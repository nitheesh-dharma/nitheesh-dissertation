<B>Why is this review important?</B>
</P>
<P>Postnatal depression is a common disorder that can have short- and long-term adverse effects on the mother, the new infant and the family as a whole. Antidepressants are commonly used as the first treatment option for adults with moderate to severe depression, but there is little evidence on whether antidepressants are an effective and safe choice for the treatment of this disorder in the postnatal period. This review was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of different antidepressants and to compare their effectiveness with other forms of treatment (e.g. psychosocial interventions such as peer support, psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy), placebo or treatment as usual.</P>
<P>
<B>Who will be interested in this review?</B>
</P>
<P>Parents, professionals in primary care services who work with women of reproductive age, general practitioners, professionals in adult mental health services who work with women of reproductive age and professionals working in perinatal mental health services.</P>
<P>
<B>What questions does this review aim to answer?</B>
</P>
<P>This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2001, which found insufficient evidence to make conclusions about antidepressant treatment in postnatal depression. Therefore, this update aims to answer the following question:</P>
<P>What are the effects of antidepressants in comparison with other any other treatment, placebo or treatment as usual for postnatal depression?</P>
<P>
<B>Which studies were included in the review?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched clinical trials registries; the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group; and the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group databases to find all high-quality studies comparing antidepressants with any other form of treatment from the upper date limit of the most recent previous searches to July 2014. We contacted drug companies and experts in the field.</P>
<P>To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people were randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) and had to include women with postnatal depression (onset of depression up to six months after giving birth) who were not taking any antidepressant medication at the start of the trial.</P>
<P>We included six trials of 596 women in the review. Although many of the studies were well conducted and reported, there are some areas with substantial risk of bias; for example, through incomplete follow-up (e.g. in one study over 50% of the participants dropped out prior to the primary outcome measurement).</P>
<P>
<B>What does the evidence from the review tell us?</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence from this review was assessed as being very low quality due to the small number of studies, risk of bias in the included studies (in particular, high proportions of participants dropped out) and the fact that many studies excluded women with chronic (i.e. long lasting) or severe depression, or both. We were able to combine data from three studies comparing a type of commonly used antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with placebo. The results showed that women with postnatal depression who were given SSRIs were more likely to improve or recover than those given placebo. We were unable to combine the data from studies comparing antidepressants with other treatments or treatment as usual due to the very small number of studies identified for these comparisons. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether, and for whom, antidepressant or psychosocial/psychological treatments are more effective, or whether some antidepressants are more effective or better tolerated (or both) than others. Conclusions were also limited by the lack of data on long-term follow-up, the safety of breastfeeding or child outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>What should happen next?</B>
</P>
<P>Larger studies need to be done, and treatment decisions for women with postnatal depression will need to use evidence from other sources such as trials in general adult populations and observational studies of antidepressant safety in the postnatal period. The review authors recommend that future studies in this area should include women with severe postnatal depression, long-term follow-up on psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in mothers who have been treated for postnatal depression. In addition, more evidence is needed on outcomes for infants, particularly with regards to the safety of breastfeeding and effect of treatment for postnatal depression on the maternal-infant relationship.</P>

<P>Postnatal depression is a common disorder that can have adverse short- and long-term effects on maternal morbidity, the new infant and the family as a whole. Treatment is often largely by social support and psychological interventions. It is not known whether antidepressants are an effective and safe choice for treatment of this disorder. This review was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of different antidepressants and to compare their effectiveness with other forms of treatment, placebo or treatment as usual. It is an update of a review first published in 2001.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-09-11 10:24:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR) to 11 July 2014. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the following bibliographic databases: <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE, (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also searched international trial registries and contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-09-11 10:25:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We included RCTs of women with depression with onset up to six months postpartum that compared antidepressant treatment (alone or in combination with another treatment) with any other treatment, placebo or treatment as usual.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently extracted data from the trial reports. We requested missing information from investigators wherever possible. We sought data to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to pool data where sufficient comparable studies were identified.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-11 10:25:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six trials with 596 participants in this review. All studies had a randomised controlled parallel group design, with two conducted in the UK, three in the US and one in Israel. Meta-analyses were performed to pool data on response and remission from studies comparing antidepressants with placebo. No meta-analyses could be conducted for other comparisons due to the small number of trials identified.</P>
<P>Four studies compared selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with placebo (two using sertraline, one using paroxetine and one using fluoxetine; 233 participants in total). In two of these studies both the experimental and placebo groups also received psychological therapy. Pooled risk ratios based on data from three of these studies (146 participants) showed that women randomised to SSRIs had higher rates of response and remission than those randomised to placebo (response: RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.03; remission: RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.98); the fourth study did not report data on response or remission.</P>
<P>One study (254 participants) compared antidepressant treatment with treatment as usual (for the first four weeks) followed by listening visits. The study found significantly higher rates of improvement in the antidepressant group than treatment-as-usual group after the first four weeks, but no difference between antidepressants and listening visits at the later follow-up. In addition, one study comparing sertraline with nortriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) found no difference in effectiveness (109 participants).</P>
<P>Side effects were experienced by a substantial proportion of women, but there was no evidence of a meaningful difference in the number of adverse effects between treatment arms in any study. There were very limited data on adverse effects experienced by breastfed infants, with no long-term follow-up. All but one of the studies were assessed as being at high or uncertain risk of attrition bias and selective outcome reporting. In particular, one of the placebo-controlled studies had over 50% drop-out.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-09-05 12:09:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence base for this review was very limited, with a small number of studies and little information on a number of important outcomes, particularly regarding potential effects on the child. Risk of bias, for example from high attrition rates, as well as low representativeness of participants (e.g. exclusion of women with severe or chronic depression in several trials) also limit the conclusions that can be drawn.</P>
<P>Pooled estimates for response and remission found that SSRIs were significantly more effective than placebo for women with postnatal depression. However the quality of evidence contributing to this comparison was assessed as very low owing to the small sample size for this comparison (146 participants from three studies), the risk of bias in included studes and the inclusion of one study where all participants in both study arms additionally received psychological therapy. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether, and for whom, antidepressant or psychological/psychosocial treatments are more effective, or whether some antidepressants are more effective or better tolerated than others. There is also inadequate evidence on whether the benefits of antidepressants persist beyond eight weeks or whether they have short- or long-term adverse effects on breastfeeding infants.</P>
<P>Professionals treating women with severe depression in the postnatal period will need to draw on other evidence, including trials among general adult populations and observational studies of antidepressant safety when breastfeeding (although the potential for confounding in non-randomised studies must be considered). More RCTs are needed with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up, including assessment of the impact on the child and safety of breastfeeding. Further larger-scale trials comparing antidepressants with alternative treatment modalities are also required.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-11 18:11:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Postnatal depression is an important and common disorder that can have short- and long-term adverse impacts on the mother, her child and the family as a whole (<LINK REF="REF-Letourneau-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Letourneau 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1992</LINK>). Postnatal depression is characterised by persistent low mood and loss of pleasure or interests, occurring with associated symptoms such as changes in appetite, psychomotor agitation or retardation, disturbed sleep and low self confidence (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2013</LINK>) and the International Classification of Disease Tenth Revision (ICD-10) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>) include postnatal depression within the standard diagnostic criteria for depression, and postnatal depression has been found to have similar phenomenology to depression in women who have not recently given birth (<LINK REF="REF-Nylen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nylen 2013</LINK>). Somatic symptoms of depression, such as sleep disturbance and loss of libido, may occur as part of the normative postpartum experience, but evidence suggests that they are more commonly reported among depressed than non-depressed women in the postnatal period (with the exception of appetite change, <LINK REF="REF-Nylen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nylen 2013</LINK>). An onset specifier for depression is used in both the ICD-10 (within six weeks of delivery) and DSM-5 (onset during pregnancy or in the four weeks following delivery), but many researchers use time limits between three and six months' postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Munk_x002d_Olsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munk-Olsen 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>One comprehensive systematic review of perinatal depression reported a prevalence of 4.7% for major depression at three months postpartum and 12.9% including minor (sub-threshold) depression (<LINK REF="REF-Gavin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gavin 2005</LINK>), similar to estimates for adult women at non-childbearing times. However, there may be an increased risk of new episodes of depression in the period following childbirth; <LINK REF="REF-Cox-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1993</LINK> found a three-fold increase in the incidence of depression in the first five weeks after delivery. More recent studies using medical records have supported a peak incidence in the first postpartum months (<LINK REF="REF-Ban-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ban 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munk_x002d_Olsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munk-Olsen 2006</LINK>), although it must be noted that a substantial proportion of postnatal depression episodes begin during pregnancy or prior to conception (<LINK REF="REF-Wisner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wisner 2013</LINK>). Most women with postpartum depression recover within a few months but about 30% of episodes last beyond the first postpartum year (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 2004</LINK>). Women who have had postnatal depression also have a high risk (about 40%) of both postnatal and non-postnatal relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wisner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wisner 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is important that classifications distinguish postpartum depression from both the 'baby blues' and postpartum psychosis, which also occur following childbirth. The 'baby blues' are characterised by sub-threshold symptoms of depression (e.g. insomnia, fatigue, tearfulness, anxiety, irritability, impairment of concentration and mood lability) occurring soon after delivery. Prevalence estimates range from 15% to 85% among postpartum women (often around 50%, <LINK REF="REF-Henshaw-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henshaw 2003</LINK>), but symptoms are usually mild and resolve within days. In contrast, postpartum psychosis is a very severe condition that affects a small proportion of postpartum women (about 2 per 1000) (<LINK REF="REF-Kendell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendell 1987</LINK>). Women with postpartum psychosis may present with mania, psychotic depression, schizophrenia or confusional states and in most cases, hospitalisation is indicated.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-07-29 14:33:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>In light of the influence of social factors, psychosocial and psychological interventions to improve outcomes for women with postnatal depression have been developed and evaluated. Reductions in depression have been identified following a range of psychosocial and psychological interventions (e.g. non-directive counselling, telephone-based peer support and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) compared with usual care (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2013</LINK>). However, for some women who cannot access psychosocial or psychological interventions or who have a severe depression, antidepressant drugs may be an important alternative form of treatment.</P>
<P>Antidepressants are drugs that treat the symptoms of depression. They are commonly used as the first treatment option for adults with moderate to severe depression, and can be classified into the following types:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors</B> (SSRIs, e.g. fluoxetine) selectively block the re-uptake of serotonin. They are less dangerous in terms of overdose than most tricyclic antidepressants (TCA);</LI>
<LI>
<B>TCAs</B> (e.g. amitriptyline) are antimuscarinic drugs that block the re-uptake of both serotonin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and have variable sedating properties;</LI>
<LI>
<B>heterocyclic antidepressants</B> (e.g. mianserin), which block the re-uptake of noradrenaline and serotonin (5-HT);</LI>
<LI>
<B>monoamine oxidase inhibitors</B> (MAOIs, e.g. phenelzine): most drugs from this class are not commonly used due to the dangerous reactions these drugs have with various food groups and other drugs. They act by causing an accumulation of amine neurotransmitters;</LI>
<LI>
<B>noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors</B> (NARIs, e.g. reboxetine);</LI>
<LI>
<B>noradrenaline-dopamine re-uptake inhibitors </B>(NDRIs, e.g. amineptine, buproprion);</LI>
<LI>
<B>serotonin-noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors</B> (SNRIs, e.g. duloxetine, milnacipram, venlafaxine);</LI>
<LI>
<B>noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants</B> (NASSAs, e.g. mirtazapine);</LI>
<LI>
<B>serotonin antagonist and re-uptake inhibitors </B>(SARIs, e.g. trazodone);</LI>
<LI>
<B>other unclassified antidepressants</B> (e.g. agomelatine, vilazodone).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Antidepressants - and often their metabolites (especially if pharmacologically active) - are lipid soluble and are excreted in breast milk. These drugs are metabolised mainly in the liver and excreted via the kidneys. Exposure to antidepressants in breastfed infants is considerably lower (five- to 10-fold) than exposure in utero (<LINK REF="REF-Berle-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berle 2011</LINK>), but immaturity or impairment of liver or kidneys (e.g. in preterm babies) may lead to higher concentrations. Breastfeeding women are advised to avoid doxepin (a TCA) as its main metabolite has been found in higher concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Eberhard_x002d_Gran-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eberhard-Gran 2006</LINK>). Some case reports and case series have described non-specific adverse events in infants exposed to other antidepressants through breastfeeding, most commonly following exposure to fluoxetine (e.g. poor feeding) and citalopram (e.g. poor sleep) (<LINK REF="REF-Berle-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berle 2011</LINK>). There is no evidence of longer-term adverse outcomes among infants exposed to antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Berle-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berle 2011</LINK>), but this could reflect a lack of studies.</P>
<P>Due to the limitations of the existing evidence, most manufacturers' data sheets carry warnings that antidepressants should not be given to nursing mothers. Physicians often advise women not to breastfeed when taking an antidepressant or may prescribe reduced and potentially ineffective doses or delay pharmacotherapy until after breastfeeding. However, most researchers agree that if a mother was successfully treated for depression during her pregnancy, the same medication should usually be used in the postpartum period while breastfeeding as discontinuing or switching an antidepressant treatment could lead to relapse.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-11 18:11:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is substantial evidence showing the effectiveness of antidepressants for depression, particularly as severity of depression increases (<LINK REF="REF-Fournier-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fournier 2010</LINK>); however, the exact mechanism by which antidepressants have their effect is unclear. One systematic review and meta-analysis of pharmacological neuroimaging studies found that, for both patients and healthy controls, repeated antidepressant administration affected activity in areas of the medial prefrontal cortex and limbic systematic that are associated with emotion processing (e.g. the anterior cingulate, amygdala and thalamus), with increased activity in response to positive emotions and decreased activity in response to negative emotions (<LINK REF="REF-Ma-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 2014</LINK>). It appears that most antidepressants inhibit uptake of monoamine neurotransmitters (e.g. serotonin or noradrenaline (norepinephrine)) into neurons thereby increasing the concentrations of these neurotransmitters at synapses (<LINK REF="REF-Berton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berton 2006</LINK>).

<P>Postnatal depression is a common problem that can have adverse short- and long-term effects on the mother, her child and the wider family. Antidepressants are commonly used as the first treatment option for adults with moderate to severe depression (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>), but there are few systematic data on the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs in the postnatal period and it is important to establish the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs in comparison with other forms of treatment for postnatal depression or placebo. In addition, although antidepressants are lipid soluble and are excreted in breast milk, the safety of breastfeeding while taking these medications has not been sufficiently reviewed. There is some evidence to suggest that the benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh potential risks for healthy infants born at term (<LINK REF="REF-Berle-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berle 2011</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although beyond the scope of this review, antidepressants may also be used for the treatment of pre-existing and antenatal depression during pregnancy. One forthcoming Cochrane review will complement this review by examining the effectiveness of antidepressant use, compared with placebo or psychological therapy, for the treatment of pre-existing and antenatal depression (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK: a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 35,000 reports of RCTs in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 60% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual, using a controlled vocabulary, please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Coordinator for further details. Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950-), EMBASE (1974-) and PsycINFO (1967-); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organization's trials portal (the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>)), pharmaceutical companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-08-11 18:11:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We presented the primary outcome of depression response or remission using risk ratios (RR) for all studies. We summarised other outcomes using the data as quoted in the original papers (e.g. odds ratio (OR), RR, mean difference (MD)). If there were sufficient data for meta-analyses to be performed on any outcomes, we calculated RRs for dichotomous outcomes and MDs or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>We calculated the RR and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for primary outcome dichotomous data. It has been shown that RR is more intuitive than ORs and that OR tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect.</P>
<P>Where possible, we attempted to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data using cut-off points on rating scales to identify those who did and did not fulfil the criteria for depression.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>If a meta-analysis was conducted for continuous data, we would analyse this by calculating the MD between groups, if studies use the same outcome measure for comparison. If studies used different outcome measures to assess the same outcome, we would calculate SMD and 95% CIs.</P>
<P>When standard errors instead of standard deviations (SD) were presented, we converted the former to SDs. If SDs were not reported and could not be calculated from available data, we asked authors to supply the data. In the absence of data from authors, we used the mean SD from other studies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>It is important to ensure that the data analysed from cluster RCTs takes into account the clustered nature of the data. No cluster-RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this review, but if any are included in future updates we will deal with them as follows. We will extract the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) for each trial; where no such data are reported, we will request the information from study authors. If this information is not available, in line with the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), we will use estimates from similar studies in order to 'correct' data for clustering, where this had not been done. We will use generic inverse variance methods to meta-analyse results from cluster RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Both of these effects are very likely in postnatal depression; although we identified no cross-over trials in the review, if any are identified for inclusion in future updates we will only use data from the first randomised treatment period.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Trials that have more than two arms (e.g. pharmacological intervention (A); psychological intervention (B); and control (C)) can cause issues with regards to pair-wise meta-analysis. In line with the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), if we identified any studies with two or more active treatment arms, then we took the following approach, dependent on whether the outcome was dichotomous or continuous:</P>
<P>For a dichotomous outcome: we combined active treatment groups into a single arm for comparison against the control group (in relation to the number of people with events and sample sizes), or the control group was split equally.</P>
<P>For a continuous outcome: we pooled means, SDs and the number of participants for each active treatment group across treatment arms as a function of the number of participants in each arm to be compared against the control group.</P>

<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>); therefore, in the protocol, we determined that we would exclude studies with more than 50% loss to follow-up.</P>
<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50% and outcomes for these people were presented, we reported the data. We presented data on a 'once-randomised always-analyse' basis, assuming an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. We assumed that women lost to follow-up had a negative outcome, with the exception of the outcome of death. For example, for the outcome of remission of depression, we assumed that this had not occurred for any of the women lost to follow-up.</P>

<P>We used ITT analysis when available. It was anticipated that some studies would have used the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) to do an ITT analysis. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results. Therefore, where we have reported LOCF data in this review it is indicated. We presented ITT analysis for all primary outcomes. Where ITT analyses were not available for secondary outcomes, we reported this in the relevant section of the results.</P>

<P>We conducted searches to July 2014 retrieving 134 references from the specialised registers of the two Cochrane Review Groups (CCDAN and PCG). We retrieved an additional 428 records from other sources, including nine studies suggested by pharmaceutical companies. After de-duplication, two review authors (HM, AK or KT) independently screened 382 records and excluded 361 records (on title and abstract) as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. We retrieved the full-text papers for the remaining 21 reports and assessed them for eligibility. After discussion, the review authors decided that the protocol should be altered to allow studies with more than 50% attrition rate to be included in the review due to the small number of relevant RCTs. Therefore, we included <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK> (56% dropout).</P>
<P>We required further information to determine the eligibility of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006)</LINK>; the trial investigator provided this (Katherine Wisner). Information on antidepressant prescriptions in <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> was also provided following contact with the study author (Debbie Sharp). We translated the two Chinese papers, but neither was eligible for the review. Forward and backward citation tracking of included articles yielded no further relevant trials. The PRISMA flow diagram details the study selection process (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. We also identified one potentially eligible on-going study (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00602355" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00602355</LINK>) and two studies awaiting classification with no data available at the time of production of this review (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00744328" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00744328</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT02122393" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02122393</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The studies had broadly similar inclusion and exclusion criteria.</P>
<P>All required women to meet criteria for depression in the postpartum period, although different criteria were used between studies. <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK> both assessed depression using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV; <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK> also requiring participants to score 18 or greater on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) at study entry and to have symptoms rated as at least 'moderate' of the Global Clinical Impressions (CGI) severity of illness scale. <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK> both required participants to meet the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder and score above a cut-off on the HAM-D (18 or greater for <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK> and 16 or greater for <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> assessed depression using the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) for ICD-10 and the EPDS (participants had to score 13 or greater at entry to the study). <LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK> required women to score 10 or greater on the EPDS and 12 or greater on the CIS-R, as well as satisfying researcher diagnostic criteria for major or minor depression (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> for more details on these measures).</P>
<P>Enrolment times varied between six to eight weeks' postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK>), and within 12 months' postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK>). In all studies, onset of the depressive episode had to be before six months' postpartum (ranging from four weeks' postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK>), to 26 weeks' postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK>)). In all included trials, participants were not taking any antidepressant medication at the commencement of the study. In three trials, participants were also not eligible for the study if they were receiving psychological therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>All studies restricted the population of depressed women with further exclusion criteria. In order to restrict the participants to women with moderate depression, women were excluded from the <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK> study if they scored 32 or greater on the HAM-D and from <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK> if they scored 30 or greater on the Montgomery-Åsbery Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

Where mean age was reported in studies, this ranged from 23.1 years (<LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK>, in the placebo plus one session of counselling group) to 30.8 ± 4.0 years (<LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The predominant ethnicity was reported was white, ranging from 48.6% of participants in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK> to 94.4% of participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK> study. In one study, there was a significant minority of Hispanic participants (35.7%) (<LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK>), with a small minority of participants in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK> being Hispanic (5.6%). Two studies had a minority of black participants (12.9%: <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK>; 11.5%: <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK>), and the study by <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> also had 13 Asian participants (5.2% of those randomised). In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK>, 40% of women randomised to sertraline and 19% of women randomised to nortriptyline had non-white ethnicity. Two studies provided no data on ethnicity (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK>). Information provided on socioeconomic status was highly varied, making any comparisons of socioeconomic status across trials difficult.</P>
<P>All studies assessed severity of depression at baseline. <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK> reported that baseline severity was assessed using several scales including the HAM-D and CGI with no difference between the two study groups, but did not report scale scores. <LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK> reported geometric means scores on the EPDS and the HAM-D for all women randomised to take fluoxetine (all also receiving either one or six sessions of counselling) and all women randomised to placebo (again all also receiving either one or six sessions of counselling). Geometric mean HAM-D scores were 14.2 (95% CI 13.0 to 15.5) for the fluoxetine group and 13.9 (95% CI 12.5 to 15.4) for the placebo group; on the HAM-D scores in the range 8 to 16 indicate mild depression (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmerman-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmerman 2013</LINK>), Geometric mean EPDS scores were 17.2 (95% CI 16.2 to 18.2) for the fluoxetine group and 16.9 (95% CI 15.8 to 18.1) for the placebo group. In <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK>, baseline EPDS scores showed similar means to <LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK> with 16.05 (SD 4.84) in the brief dynamic psychotherapy group plus placebo group and 18.40 (SD 4.83) in the brief dynamic psychotherapy group plus antidepressant group. Similar baseline severity was also found in the <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> study based on EPDS scores (mean ± SD: 17.3 ± 3.3 for the antidepressant group and 17.7 ± 3.5 for the treatment as usual followed by listening visits group).</P>
<P>Higher baseline severity was found in two placebo-controlled studies (mean HAM-D scores in the range 17 to 23 indicating 'moderate depression' and &#8805;24 indicating 'severe depression'; <LINK REF="REF-Zimmerman-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmerman 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK> measured baseline severity with both the EPDS and HAM-D; on the EPDS the mean score for women randomised to the antidepressants (sertraline) was 18.8 (SD 2.6) and 20.8 (SD 5.7) for women randomised to placebo. On the HAM-D, these scores were 20.6 (SD 2.8) for the antidepressant group and 23.2 (SD 3.9) for the placebo group. Similar but slightly higher scores were recorded at baseline by <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK>; in this study women randomised to antidepressants had a mean HAM-D score of 23.6 (SD 4.7) and women randomised to placebo had a mean HAM-D score of 24.7 (SD 5.0). Further details on these measures are given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>Women were recruited from a variety of settings, including general practice, postnatal wards, obstetric care settings and general advertising. <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> sent an information pack containing an EPDS questionnaire to all new mothers within the catchment area (data obtained from birth registry office and general practitioner (GP) records).

<P>Antidepressant prescriptions varied between studies with three prescribing sertraline (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK>), one fluoxetine (<LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK>), one paroxetine (<LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK>), and one nortriptyline (<LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK>; used as a comparison with sertraline). <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> allowed choice of antidepressants based on physician and participant preference. Although GPs were given prescribing guidelines in this study (with SSRIs recommended as the first-line therapy in keeping with national guidelines), there were no set drugs for the trial. Information on the antidepressants prescribed was obtained through participant self report at all follow-up points and by recording prescribing information from medical notes. Most participants were prescribed citalopram, fluoxetine or sertraline; full details of the antidepressants prescribed and the number of participants prescribed each antidepressant are given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK>) had a one-week run-in period to the trial during which all participants took placebo only, followed by participants in the antidepressant group being given sertraline 50 mg per day. In the other two trials prescribing sertraline, both <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK> had initial doses of 25 mg per day, increasing to 50 mg after two (<LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK>) or seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK>) . In <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK>, the maximum dose allowed was 200 mg per day, in <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK>, it was 100 mg per day. Participants randomised to nortriptyline in the <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK> study started on 10 mg per day, increasing to 25 mg per day up to a maximum of 150 mg per day. The prescription of paroxetine in the <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK> study began with 10 mg per day, increasing to a maximum of 40 mg per day. Initial dosage of antidepressants were described as increasing at regular intervals in all of the trials except <LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK> (where no data on prescribing patterns were given), as guided by tolerability of treatment and effect on symptoms. Where specified, dosage was once daily. Data on dosage was collected in <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK>, but is not reported here owing to the heterogeneity of treatments given. Adherence was monitored with pill counts in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK>), self report plus review of prescription data in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK>), and serum drug level monitoring in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK>).</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK>, participants were randomly assigned to receive either one or six sessions of the CBT-based counselling. <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK> compared the efficacy of two pharmacological treatments (nortriptyline and sertraline) in a two-arm blinded RCT. <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> conducted an unblinded pragmatic RCT in which participants were randomised to antidepressants or four weeks of treatment as usual followed by listening visits. Antidepressants were prescribed by the participant's GP, who was requested to provide no other counselling or psychological intervention for women in this arm of the trial. However, the participants receiving antidepressants also received usual care and had several GP appointments for antidepressant monitoring. The comparison group received treatment as usual (general supportive care from GPs) for the first four weeks to allow the effectiveness of antidepressants to be compared with treatment as usual and to replicate the waiting period that would likely occur prior to a woman beginning counselling for postnatal depression. The GPs were requested not to prescribe antidepressants or additional psychological interventions unless clinically necessarily. The listening visits (non-directive counselling) began after this four-week period and were delivered by trained health visitors (up to eight sessions). The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of antidepressants for mothers with postnatal depression compared with treatment as usual (i.e. outcomes at four weeks prior to the commencement of listening visits). The secondary aim of this study was to compare outcomes in the two groups at 18 weeks (i.e. women randomised to antidepressants compared with women randomised to listening visits following treatment as usual). In this trial, women were also able to change to (or add in) the alternative intervention (i.e. antidepressants or listening visits) at any point after four weeks.</P>

In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK>, follow-up at seven weeks included the one-week run-in placebo period; therefore, outcomes after six weeks of active treatment versus placebo were assessed.

<P>Five of the six included studies described methods of random sequence generation with low risk of bias (e.g. using computer- or pharmacy-generated random numbers). For one study, the risk of bias in this domain was unclear; the study was described as randomised but there were insufficient details to assess whether appropriate methods of randomisation were used (<LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding of participants and personnel</HEADING>
<P>Four studies had low risk of bias with study personnel and participants blinded to treatment allocation. One study compared the antidepressant intervention with listening visits so blinding of study personnel and participants was not possible, leading to high risk of bias in this domain (<LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK>). The risk of bias was unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK>. Participants and the managing psychiatrist were blinded to treatment condition, but when the blind was assessed at the end of the study the psychiatrist guessed group assignment incorrectly in every case. This suggests that there may have been some differences between the intervention groups; incorrect assignment of every participant when there are only two treatment options implies that the psychiatrist correctly grouped the participants with others who had received the same treatment, although incorrectly guessed treatment status of these groups. It should be noted that only <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK> reported assessment of the success of blinding, although <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK> described the withdrawal of one participant following accidental unblinding in the penultimate week of the study.</P>

<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-11 18:11:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The greatest risk of bias in the studies included in this review came from incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), with only one study having low risk of bias in this domain (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK> had very high risk of attrition bias, with 39 women withdrawing from the study out of the 70 women randomised (56%). This means that the study findings must be interpreted extremely cautiously. However, dropout reasons and numbers were similar between treatment groups and sensitivity analyses assuming that all drop-outs had either positive or negative outcomes in the trial found that antidepressants remained associated with significantly higher remission rates than placebo in both scenarios. This suggests that the primary finding was robust to a range of outcomes for drop-outs.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK> had high risk of bias from incomplete outcome data. Significantly more participants withdrew from the sertraline than the nortriptyline group in the first eight weeks of the study and there was high attrition from both groups (withdrawal rates: 23/55 (42%) with sertraline and 13/54 (24%) with nortriptyline; Wilcoxon P value = 0.02). Reasons for withdrawal were assessed and although "side effects" and "clinical deterioration" did not differ in frequency between the two groups, significantly more women in the sertraline group withdrew by personal choice or were lost to follow-up without reasons given, which may reflect factors associated with clinical outcomes or side effects.</P>
<P>In four studies, there was some evidence of potential risk of bias, but we rated this as 'unclear' owing to insufficient details in reporting. In <LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK>, 26 of the 87 women dropped out over the course of the study, although with relatively similar rates across treatment groups. Timing and reasons for drop-out were reported but in many cases this was "no reason given", meaning that it is difficult to assess whether reasons for drop-out varied between groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK>, seven of the 36 women dropped out over the course of the trial. Again, there were similar numbers of drop-outs in the two treatment groups but all women dropping out due to clinical deterioration had received the placebo, which may have led to an underestimation of the intervention effect. <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> reported some differential drop-out between the antidepressant group and the treatment as usual followed by listening visit group (higher in the antidepressant group), which was not statistically significant at four weeks (antidepressant group 18% drop-out, 23 women; treatment as usual group 10% drop-out, 13 women; P value = 0.09) but was significant at 18 weeks (antidepressant group 25% drop-out, 32 women; listening visits 13% drop-out, 16 women; P value = 0.015). However, sensitivity analyses examining the impact of attrition (including multiple imputation) found that study findings were robust to a range of outcomes for study drop-outs. <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> did not give characteristics of the drop-outs separately by intervention group and reasons for withdrawal were not described so it is not possible to assess whether these differ between groups.</P>
<P>All studies used LOCF in cases of missing data, except for <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> who used multiple imputation. All studies conducted ITT analyses for their primary outcomes and all results for the primary outcome of this review are reported using ITT, although some secondary analyses were reported using complete case analysis only (and are indicated as such).</P>

<P>Bias from selective outcome reporting was unclear in four of the studies: in most studies, the protocols were unavailable and, in one study, the protocol had insufficient detail on outcomes to assess selective reporting (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK>, the protocol was available and all pre-specified primary outcomes were reported, but outcomes from assessments of participants' partners, the HOME measure and Bayley Scale of Infant Development were not reported.

In <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK>, the Social Adjustment Scale and SF-36 were included in the methods but not reported in the results. We believe that the general absence of data on child outcomes and breastfeeding safety in the six studies reflects the fact that these data were not collected, rather than selective outcome reporting; however, this cannot be assessed without access to the study protocols.</P>

<P>Adherence to antidepressants is often low, which could bias study findings, so we assessed risk of bias related to low adherence in the included studies. <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK> assessed serum levels as a measure of compliance and found that 14 women (out of 95 study participants) had minimal levels of the antidepressant in their blood, despite claiming compliance. These women were evenly distributed between the two antidepressant groups and results did not alter when these women were removed from analysis. Therefore, the risk of bias related to adherence in this study was low. <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> collected self reported data on adherence to medication and had high risk of bias in this area; only 56% (59 women) of the 106 women who were randomised to antidepressant treatment and followed up reported taking any antidepressants in the first four weeks after randomisation. Of the women followed up at 18 weeks, 64% of participants randomised to antidepressants reported taking antidepressants in the previous four weeks (62/97), and 34% of women randomised to listening visits reported taking antidepressants in the previous four weeks (37/109). Two studies provided no details of adherence to antidepressant medication so risk of bias in these studies was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK>). One study stated that pill counts were used to monitor compliance but it is unclear from the results how many women were non-compliant (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK> used pill counts to assess adherence and found that seven of the 35 women randomised to antidepressant treatment were non-compliant (took less than 80% of pills) at one visit, four were non-compliant at two visits and one was consistently non-compliant and consequently removed from active treatment in the study. In the placebo group, 10 of the 35 women were non-compliant at one visit, three were non-compliant at two or more visits and one was non-compliant at four visits. It is unclear to what extent this may have biased study findings, as we do not know how much medication the non-compliant women were taking (this could range between 0% and 79% based on reported data) or whether adherence was only reported for women who completed the study.</P>

There was no significant difference between groups on the HAM-D (-1.62; P value = 0.22).There was a significant main effect of group on the IDS-SR scores (-4.98; P value = 0.019); however, IDS-SR scores were significantly different between the antidepressant and placebo groups at baseline and the authors concluded that it was this baseline difference carried over at later time points as the group by time interaction effect was not significant. The authors concluded that there was significantly greater improvement in the antidepressant than placebo group based on CGI-S scores (main effect -0.48; P value = 0.047, groups did not differ at baseline).</P>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK>, severity of depression was defined as a treatment group by time interaction with the baseline score as a covariate on the HAM-D and EPDS. Analysis of change in scores over time in the ITT group showed that there was not a significant group by time effect for the HAM-D (F(1,145) = 2.05; P value = 0.15) or EPDS (F(1,137) = 0.43; P value = 0.51).</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK>, ITT analyses using LOCF indicated no group by time interaction effect for depression scores on either the MADRS (F[4,35] = 0.97; P value = 0.44) or EPDS (F[4,35] = 0.62; P value = 0.65) across the eight-week intervention period.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK> assessed reduction in depression using the CIS-R, HAM-D and EPDS, with ITT analysis (LOCF). The geometric mean scores at 12 weeks on the CIS-R were 11.1 (95% CI 6.9 to 17.6) for fluoxetine plus <I>one </I>session of counselling and 19.1 (95% CI 15.4 to 23.5) for placebo plus <I>one</I> session of counselling. Geometric mean scores at 12 weeks on the CIS-R were 10.5 (95% CI 6.6 to 16.6) for fluoxetine plus <I>six</I> sessions and 13.0 (95% CI 9.2 to 18.1) for placebo plus <I>six </I>sessions of counselling. The calculated percentage difference in geometric mean scores between fluoxetine and placebo at 12 weeks was 40.7% (95% CI 10.9% to 60.6%). Similar findings were observed using the HAM-D with the following geometric mean scores reported at 12 weeks: 4.4 (95% CI 2.4 to 7.4) for fluoxetine plus <I>one </I>session of counselling and 8.1 (95% CI 6.1 to 10.7) for placebo plus <I>one</I> session of counselling; 5.1 (95% CI 2.6 to 9.2) for fluoxetine plus <I>six </I>sessions of counselling and 4.9 (95% CI 3.0 to 8.9) for placebo plus <I>six</I> sessions of counselling. Finally, the geometric mean scores on the EPDS at 12 weeks were reported as follows: 7.1 (95% CI 5.0 to 10.1) for fluoxetine plus <I>one </I>session of counselling and 10.3 (95% CI 8.1 to 13.2) for placebo plus <I>one</I> session of counselling; 7.5 (95% CI 4.6 to 11.8) for fluoxetine plus <I>six </I>sessions of counselling and 9.5 (95% CI 7.2 to 12.5) for placebo plus <I>six</I> sessions of counselling. Authors of this study concluded that fluoxetine was significantly more effective than placebo and, after an initial session of counselling, was as effective as a full course of CBT counselling in the treatment of postnatal depression. However, the 95% CIs of geometric mean scores for all treatment groups overlap.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.4 Acceptability</HEADING>
<P>While no direct assessments of treatment acceptability were made, treatment adherence and withdrawal rate may be indicative of the level of treatment acceptability. In the paroxetine arm of <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK>, one woman withdrew due to nausea, six due to lack of efficacy, five who felt well and no longer desired treatment, one who became pregnant and one who was not adherent to medication. A further six women were lost to follow-up. Among the women on placebo, four left due to perceived adverse effects, seven discontinued due to lack of efficacy, two felt better and no longer desired treatment and one moved out of the area. A further nine women in this arm were lost to follow-up. In terms of treatment compliance, among the women on paroxetine, seven were taking less than 80% of medication at one visit, four were non-adherent on a second visit and one was excluded from the trial for ongoing non-adherence. Among the women on placebo, 10 were non-compliant at one visit, three were non-compliant at two visits and one was non-compliant on a fourth visit.</P>
<P>In the trial comparing sertraline and placebo, <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK> reported that 36/36 (100%) women remained in the trial at week two, 33/36 (92%) completed through week four and 29/36 (81%) completed through week seven. Three of 19 women on placebo left the trial due to clinical worsening. Among the women randomised to antidepressants, 3/17 (17.6%) dropped out (e.g. due to death in the family or unable to contact) and 1/17 (5.9%) was excluded after the blind was broken due to an administrative error. The authors did not report on adherence to medication is either treatment arm.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK> reported a similar dropout rate in all treatment arms. Fourteen of 43 (32.6%) women on fluoxetine dropped out of the trial. Of these, two reported that they 'disliked the drug', three reported a lack of improvement, one reported side effects (type not specified) and eight gave no reason for dropping out. Twelve of 44 (27.3%) women taking placebo dropped out of the trial, of whom three disliked the drug, three reported side effects (type not specified) and six gave no reason.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK> reported that seven women (3/20 from the placebo group and 4/20 from the antidepressant group) discontinued the trial between week four and week eight, at which point primary outcomes were reported.

<P>One study (254 women) compared antidepressants with treatment as usual (outcomes assessed after four weeks) (<LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK>). There were no set antidepressants (prescriptions based on GP/participant choice) although most participants were prescribed citalopram, fluoxetine or sertraline (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table for details). Results showed higher remission (EPDS less than 13) for women in the antidepressant group compared with treatment as usual after four weeks (improvement: 37.2% (48/129) women with antidepressant group versus 17.6% (22/125) women with treatment as usual). The RR was significant (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.28; Analysis 2.1). This RR was based on the assumption that all the women who were lost to follow-up did not have remission of depression (calculated for this review on a 'once-randomised always-analyse' basis). In the <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> study, multiple imputation was also used to impute missing data and ORs calculated. At four weeks, the imputed OR for remission in the antidepressant group compared with treatment as usual was 3.2 (95% CI 1.7 to 6.1).</P>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> trial, more women in the antidepressant group withdrew or were lost to follow-up than women randomised to treatment as usual (withdrawal at four weeks: antidepressant group 23/129 (17.8%), treatment as usual group 13/125 (10.4%); P value = 0.090). From the reported data, it was not possible to determine whether this difference in withdrawal was due to a lack of acceptability of treatment with antidepressants or to other factors. Adherence was assessed in this trial using the Morisky Adherence Scale and four items adapted from a scale reported by <LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 2006</LINK>. Authors reported low adherence to treatment: the percentage of women randomised to antidepressants who reported actually taking antidepressants in the previous four weeks was 56% at four weeks (59/106; only reported for the women followed up).</P>

<P>Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the effects of removing studies with high dropout or high risk of bias in any domain; both of these required <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK> to be removed from the pooled estimates. After removing <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK> from the analyses, the pooled risk ratio for response was 1.52 (95% CI 0.89 to 2.58; <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>) and the pooled risk ratio for remission was 1.60 (95% CI 0.86 to 2.97; <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>). The effect size for response in this sensitivity analyses was slightly larger than in the main analyses (from RR 1.43 to RR 1.52), but the effect size for remission was reduced (from RR 1.79 to RR 1.60). Again, these pooled estimates were now based on two studies only so confidence intervals were extremely wide and neither effect was statistically signficant.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-11 10:26:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified six RCTs (596 women) examining the effectiveness of antidepressants (predominantly SSRIs: sertraline, paroxetine or fluoxetine, and a TCA: nortriptyline) for postnatal depression. Four studies comparing SSRIs with placebo were identified; in two of these trials all participants also received psychological therapy. Meta-analyses of the three studies (146 participants) for this comparison with relevant data found that participants randomised to SSRIs were significantly more likely to show response or remission of depression at follow-up compared with participants randomised to placebo. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution; the quality of evidence was graded as 'very low' owing the small number of included studies, high risk of bias in some trials (including over 50% drop-out in one study) and the pooling of results from one study which provided psychological therapy in both the SSRI or placebo arms (<LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK>) with two studies that compared SSRIs and placebo only (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>It was not possible to conduct meta-analyses for the other comparisons and there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether, and for whom, antidepressant or psychosocial treatments are more effective, or whether some antidepressants are more effective or better tolerated than others. One study showed a significant benefit of antidepressants compared with treatment as usual (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), but there was no evidence of a benefit of antidepressants compared with listening visits after these had been introduced at later follow-up (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). No difference in effectiveness was demonstrated in the one study comparing sertraline with nortriptyline (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), although a significantly higher proportion of women randomised to sertraline withdrew in the first eight weeks of the study compared with those randomised to nortriptyline which may suggest a difference in the acceptability of the treatments. The current evidence on antidepressant treatment of postnatal depression is limited by the small number of RCTs, underpowered samples, lack of long-term follow-up or child outcomes and other study limitations such as risk of bias. There were few data on the safety of breastfeeding, adverse effects for the infants or long-term outcomes for the mother and child. Two studies reported that there were no adverse effects for breastfed infants (<LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK>), but this was based on small numbers (e.g. six mothers randomised to sertraline were breastfeeding in <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK>) and limited assessment.</P>
<P>Side effects were reported by a substantial proportion of women and were mainly characteristic of the type of antidepressant used with nausea, diarrhoea and headaches reported with SSRIs and constipation with nortriptyline. It was often difficult to interpret the severity of side effects and several studies were limited in their assessment and reporting of side effects and adverse events; <LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK> only reported adverse events in reasons for withdrawal so we do not know whether there were side effects among women who remained in trial and <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> reported only 'serious side effects' (of which there were none). High attrition rates with limited reporting of reasons for withdrawal and the overall lack of child outcomes make it difficult to draw conclusions about adverse outcomes in the included studies, particularly any adverse outcomes related to breastfed infants. It was also difficult to make any conclusions on most of secondary outcomes, as very few of these were addressed in any included studies. Although acceptability was generally not specifically assessed, high drop-out, low adherence and low recruitment may reflect limited acceptability of antidepressants or RCTs in the postnatal period.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-09-03 13:16:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This evidence base is limited by the fact that there have been few trials of antidepressants in the postnatal period, and most of these were underpowered to detect significant differences in treatment effect. Data could only be pooled for the SSRI versus placebo comparison and this meta-analysis included only three studies. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the effect of removing <LINK REF="STD-Bloch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bloch 2012</LINK> (all participants received psychological therapy as well as SSRI or placebo) or <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK> (high drop-out and high risk of bias) from the pooled estimates but are difficult to interpret as each was based on two studies only and had extremely wide confidence intervals. There were insufficient data to conduct meta-analyses for the other comparisons so these conclusions are drawn from individual studies.</P>
<P>Studies recruited women presenting with a major depressive disorder (except for <LINK REF="STD-Appleby-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Appleby 1997</LINK>, which also included women with minor depressive disorder) in the first few months postpartum. However, many studies had restrictive inclusion criteria and excluded women with the most severe disorders, which will affect the generalisability of findings. This is a particular limitation given the need to establish an evidence base for the treatment of severe depression in the postnatal period to enable informed decision making for women who may be reluctant to take antidepressants. For example, four studies excluded women with chronic depression (variously defined), four studies excluded women with suicidal ideation and three studies excluded women with treatment-resistant depression (usually defined as past failed trial or trials of antidepressant treatment). Women with psychotic disorders or drug or alcohol use were also excluded from the majority of studies. The findings of these studies may therefore not be generalisable to these women, who may be those in most need of pharmacological treatment. Chronic depression or depression with other co-morbid mental disorders may be more resistant to treatment; however, there is evidence from non-pregnant adults that antidepressants are more effective compared with placebo for individuals with severe depression (<LINK REF="REF-Kirsch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirsch 2008</LINK>). The three studies that excluded women who had previously been resistant to treatment for depression may have biased findings, particularly as <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK> excluded women who had previously not responded to sertraline from their trial comparing sertraline with placebo. One study allowed a choice of antidepressant medication with 14 different antidepressants prescribed over the course of the study (majority citalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline; see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> for full details) (<LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK>). However, as the results were not reported separately for each antidepressant, conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of individual antidepressants cannot be drawn from this study. The fact that there was choice of antidepressant in the <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK> study means that this (more pragmatic) trial addresses a slightly different question from those that randomised participants to a particular antidepressant. It should also be noted that the antidepressant groups in all studies received usual care alongside their prescriptions, including appointments with the study doctors (to monitor prescriptions). This needs to be taken into account when interpreting findings, particularly for the antidepressants versus treatment as usual comparison in <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK>, where both groups received the same usual care (supportive visits with their GP).</P>
<P>The studies in this review are all from high-income countries, with five of the six studies from UK or US settings. Conclusions therefore cannot be generalised to medium- and low- income settings, a limitation given the elevated prevalence of perinatal mental disorders observed in these settings (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2012</LINK>). Most of the women in the included studies were also white Caucasian, which may prevent results being applicable to ethnic minority populations. Teenage mothers were also often excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2006</LINK> included women over 15 years of age and <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK> included women over 16 years of age; other studies were limited to women over 18 years). Again, this limits generalisation to a group particularly vulnerable to postnatal depression (<LINK REF="REF-Figueiredo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Figueiredo 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence is also limited by the small number of antidepressants individually assessed (four antidepressants only, of which three were SSRIs) and the extremely limited data on longer-term, infant and secondary outcomes. Response and remission rates varied substantially between studies, with relatively low rates even in the antidepressant groups in some studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK>). This is likely to reflect differences in study methodology (particularly participant inclusion and exclusion criteria and length of follow up) and adherence but should be considered when interpreting findings. Studies of other antidepressants, including evaluation of the impact of antidepressants on outcomes for breastfeeding mothers and infants, would increase the evidence base on treatment options for postnatal women.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-09-03 13:18:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The risk of bias varied between domains in the six trials included in the review. Random sequence generation and blinding were generally performed and reported adequately (with some exceptions), but assessment of allocation concealment and selective outcome reporting was problematic due to insufficient detail in most included studies and lack of availability of study protocols. The greatest limitations to the quality of evidence were issues with recruitment and attrition. Most studies experienced difficulties in recruitment, leading to studies being underpowered to detect a significant treatment effect, and many also had high rates of drop-out (the highest being 56% drop-out in <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK>). Although ITT analysis is reported for all primary outcomes in this review, drop-out may have introduced bias particularly if reasons for drop-out, such as clinical worsening, differed between groups. In addition, some secondary outcomes were not reported as ITT, which is likely to have introduced bias for these data. The amount of attrition was generally well described, but the reasons for and timing of drop-out were often insufficiently detailed to assess the likelihood of meaningful bias. In addition, adherence was low in many studies (particularly <LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010,</LINK> where there was also substantial cross-over between the study groups). Future studies should report more clearly on all areas of potential bias, with particular focus on reducing and describing attrition. Assessing studies using the GRADEpro criteria (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) showed that the quality of the evidence for all comparisons was low or very low (low: antidepressant versus antidepressant; very low: antidepressant versus placebo, antidepressants versus treatment as usual, antidepressants versus listening visits). This demonstrates the uncertainty in the estimates and the likelihood that further research will have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of the effect sizes or the effects themselves, or both. The evidence was limited by the risk of bias and imprecision in the included study estimates.</P>
<P>As RRs were used for the primary outcome in this review but not in any original papers, the conclusions here do not always match those of the primary papers. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK> reported significant differences in response and remission between the antidepressant and placebo group based on Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests; however, the RRs for these data were not significant. This is due to the small sample size and low precision in the estimate; the RRs themselves suggest substantial benefit to the antidepressant group but the 95% CIs were very wide.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-08-14 09:12:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe that all relevant RCTs were identified by the systematic review process. Extensive efforts were made to identify relevant papers through database searches, citation tracking, and contacting pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field for knowledge of relevant papers or unpublished data. Our searches of clinical trial registries identified one ongoing study that may meet criteria for the review; this is described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> table. We also identified two studies where data collection has been completed but data are not yet available, these are listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK> tables. We also contacted authors of conference presentations identified by the initial search results when there was no record of an associated publication. Despite these efforts, it is possible that publication bias may have influenced the review findings. This could not be assessed (e.g. through funnel plots) owing to the small number of studies.</P>
<P>Two review authors independently performed study screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment with a third review author resolving any discrepancies remaining after discussion. We included one study with a dropout rate above 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK>). This may have introduced bias; however, drop-out in this study was balanced between the antidepressant and placebo groups, and the findings of the paper were robust to sensitivity analyses assuming that all drop-outs were remitters or non-remitters. Owing to the small number of relevant studies, we believe that the data from this trial were valuable, although its conclusions must be interpreted with caution. A number of other updates to the protocol were made (e.g. the specification of response/remission as the primary depression outcomes, the inclusion of quality of life as a secondary outcome and the increased sub-categorisation of antidepressant types). We also updated the protocol so that non-validated scales could be included as outcome measures (with planned sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of non-validated scales on findings). This change was made to reduce the potential for bias or limitations to the evidence base from excluding these measures, balanced against the need to assess the potential for bias from including non-validated measures. While changes to the protocol may introduce bias in the review process, most changes made here had no impact on the current review as they related to items that were not present in included studies (e.g. certain types of antidepressants, non-validated scales). However, these changes should benefit future updates of this review.</P>

<P>Although the effectiveness of antidepressants as a treatment for depression has been established in the general adult population (<LINK REF="REF-Arroll-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroll 2005</LINK>), there is a paucity of studies, particularly RCTs, examining this in the postnatal period. Our review includes similar studies to those reported in a systematic review focused on SSRIs for postnatal depression (<LINK REF="REF-De-Crescenzo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Crescenzo 2014</LINK>), although an additional published study is reported here (<LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK>), and <LINK REF="REF-De-Crescenzo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Crescenzo 2014</LINK> included a study comparing paroxetine only with paroxetine plus CBT (<LINK REF="STD-Misri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Misri 2004</LINK>), which did not meet out inclusion criteria. De Crescenzo et al concluded that antidepressants appear to reduce postnatal depression effectively without severe adverse effects but emphasised limitations including the small number of studies, high dropout rates, unrepresentative samples and lack of long-term follow up or assessment of acceptability. They also highlighted that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a superiority of SSRIs over other treatments. The addition of <LINK REF="STD-Hantsoo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hantsoo 2013</LINK> in this review allowed us to conduct a small meta-analysis comparing SSRIs with placebo, however our overall conclusions are similar and also emphasise the limitations of the evidence, particularly regarding potential adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-09-03 17:11:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence base reported in this review is of very low quality and includes only a small number of studies, which imposes significant limitations for conclusions on both efficacy and potential adverse outcomes for the mother and baby. It is difficult to draw implications for practice from the findings reported here, particularly due to the lack of evidence on child outcomes, which may be particularly important for women with postnatal depression. The trials included here focused on mild to moderate depression and suggested that, while SSRIs were found to be significantly more effective than placebo, there was little difference in effectiveness when comparing antidepressants with psychological/psychosocial interventions. </P>
<P>Women with mild to moderate depression should be informed that there is no current evidence to suggest a clear difference between the effectiveness of antidepressants and psychological/psychosocial treatments; shared decision-making to weigh up the potential for benefits and harms for both the mother and child needs to be implemented in treatment decisions. Women with severe or chronic depression or suicidal ideation were excluded from several of the included studies, which is also a major limitation for making clinical recommendations. Clinicians treating women with severe depression in the postnatal period will need to draw on the evidence base for severe depression from outside of the postnatal period as well as observational studies examining the impact of antidepressant medication on breastfeeding infants (taking into account the potential for confounding in non-randomised studies).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-11 18:11:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Postnatal depression is the most common complication of childbearing and is associated with substantial morbidity for the mother and child. However, there are few randomised controlled trials examining the effectiveness of antidepressant treatments in the postnatal period and more trials in this period are needed. Further research is particularly required to demonstrate the impact and safety of antidepressant treatments in the postnatal period regarding child outcomes and long-term follow-up. This is of particular importance for breastfeeding women and their infants, as positive or negative effects related to antidepressant treatment may not emerge immediately. The safety of antidepressants for the baby and in breastfeeding are often critical concerns for women in the postnatal period, so these outcomes must be assessed and reported by future research. Other outcomes that are meaningful for women, such as maternal satisfaction, mother-child interactions and quality of life, also need to be evaluated, as does the severity of side-effects experienced.</P>
<P>Future trials should try to address other limitations of the current evidence base, including small sample sizes and high attrition. Reasons for non-participation and drop-out should be assessed in detail in future studies and substantial efforts should be made to reduce their impact, including realistic estimates of recruitment and dropout rates in sample size calculations and study protocols. Broader inclusion criteria (e.g. not excluding women with chronic depression) could improve recruitment and also increase the generalisability of findings. It is particularly important to develop an evidence base for women with severe/chronic depression or suicidal ideation in the postnatal period.</P>
<P>One study in this review allowed a choice of antidepressants (decision made by study GPs and participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Sharp-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sharp 2010</LINK>), and future studies could compare treatment effects in a group randomised to a choice of antidepressant medications, compared with women randomised to a specific antidepressant with no choice. Fidelity to antidepressant and comparison treatments among trial participants should also be assessed in all future trials. Further research could also examine combination therapy in comparison with either antidepressants or psychological therapy. Finally, future studies should examine whether psychological interventions are more likely to prevent relapse than antidepressants; cognitive and behavioural strategies acquired through psychological interventions may help prevent relapse when pharmacological treatment has been stopped but there has been little research in this area.</P>

<P>This update of the review includes an updated background, additional information on the included studies and participants, and uses the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We have updated the primary outcome; this was originally "clinically significant improvement in depression", which was not specifically defined by many papers. We also added severity of depression and quality of life as additional secondary outcomes. Based on peer reviewer comments, we altered the inclusion criteria so that non-validated scales can be included as outcomes (but will be excluded in sensitivity analyses if meta-analyses are conducted in future updates of this review to examine their impact on findings). This does not affect the data included in this review. The 'other' category of antidepressants has been separated into the separate types included to reflect the diversity of antidepressants previous included in this single category. Again, this does not alter the analyses in this review, as we identified no studies including these antidepressants. The original protocol planned sub-group analyses for women with a history of bipolar disorder, which was not included in the current study owing to the lack of relevant studies. The original protocol stated that studies with greater than 50% drop-out would not be eligible for the review. However, owing to the small evidence base, we decided to include studies with greater than 50% drop-out (<LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2008</LINK> reported a 56% drop-out rate).</P>

Other antidepressants prescribed were amitriptyline (4 women), cipramil (1 woman), clomipramine (1 woman), dosulepin (5 women), escitalopram (6 women), imipramine (1 woman), iofepramine (1 woman), mirtazapine (4 women), paroxetine (7 women), prothiaden (1 woman) and venlafaxine (2 women). Trial design allowed women to receive the alternative intervention at any time after four weeks. 68 women in the antidepressant arm requested listening visits after the 4-week follow-up.

<B>EPDS</B> is a 10-item self administered screen for perinatal depression, validated in 20 languages. For each item, women are asked to select 1 of 4 responses that most closely describe how they have felt over the past 7 days. Each response has a value of 0-3; scores for the 10 items are summed to give a total score between 0 and 30. The EPDS is the most widely used screening instrument for postpartum depression and has a positive predictive value for postnatal major depression of 9-64% (with a cut-off score of 9/10) or 17-100% (with a cut-off of 12/13). A cut-off score of 12/13 is used in most studies to indicate postpartum depression. The EPDS does not discriminate levels of depression and additional information is required to meet diagnostic criteria for depression.</P>
<P>
<B>EQ-5D</B> is a preference-based measure of health-related quality of life measured on 5 dimensions (i.e. mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), each rated on 3 levels (i.e. no problems, some problems and severe problems). Participants are classified into 1 of 243 health states, each associated with a score that can be used to calculate quality-adjusted life years. The measure has been extensively used in health economic evaluations and its psychometric properties are adequate.</P>
<P>
<B>GAS</B> is a rating scale for evaluating the overall functioning of a person during a specified time period on a continuum from psychological or psychiatric sickness to health.</P>
<P>
<B>GRIMS</B> is a 28-item self complete questionnaire that assesses the quality of the relationship between a married or co-habitating couple.</P>
<P>
<B>HAM-A</B> is a clinician-rated screening instrument that assesses the presence and severity of anxiety. Total scores are obtained by summing the score of each item, 0-4 (symptom is absent, mild, moderate or severe). For the 14-item HAM-A version total scores range from 0 to 56. A score of 0-13 is indicative of no anxiety; 14-17 is indicative of mild anxiety; 18-24 is indicative of moderate anxiety and 25-30 is indicative of severe anxiety.</P>
<P>
<B>HAM-D</B> is a clinician rated screening instrument that assesses the presence and severity of depression. Total scores are obtained by summing the score of each item, 0-4 ((symptom is absent, mild, moderate or severe) or 0-2 (absent, slight or trivial, or clearly present). For the 17-item HAM-D version, total scores range from 0 to 54. A score of 0-6 is indicative of no depression, 7-17 is indicative of mild depression, 18-24 is indicative of moderate depression and &#8805; 25 is indicative of severe depression. For most raters, a total score of &#8804; 7 after treatment is a typical indicator of remission and a decrease of 50% or more from baseline is considered an indicator of a clinically significant change.</P>
<P>
<B>MADRS</B> is a diagnostic instrument that measures the severity of depressive episodes. Each response has a value of 0-6; scores for the 10 items are summed to give a total score between 0 and 60. A score of 0-6 is indicative of no depression, 7-19 is indicative of mild depression; 20-34 is indicative of moderate depression and &#8805; 35 is indicative of severe depression.</P>
<P>
<B>MAMA</B> is a self administered questionnaire that examines perceptions of maternal adjustment and attitudes towards marital relationships and the baby. The postnatal sub-scale of the MAMA questionnaire comprises 12 items rated on a 4-point scale from 1 = "not at all" to 4 = "very much".</P>
<P>
<B>SF-12</B> is a 12-item self-complete questionnaire that measures functional health and well-being. The measure is a widely used and well-validated generic measure of functional quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>SPQ</B> is a 33-item self report questionnaire that covers 10 areas or domains, including housing conditions; occupation; financial status; social and leisure activities; contacts with relatives, friends and neighbours; family functioning; child-parent interaction; relationship with spouse or partner and legal matters. The individual items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (no social difficulties/satisfactory adjustment) to 3 (severe social difficulties/very poor adjustment).</P>
