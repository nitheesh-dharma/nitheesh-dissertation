<P>Acute haematoma of the pinna is a condition where a collection of blood forms beneath the perichondrial layer of the pinna. It is usually caused by blunt trauma and if untreated will ultimately result in a deformity commonly known as 'cauliflower ear' or 'wrestler's ear'. Various treatments are employed to relieve the haematoma but no clear consensus exists on the best way to do so in order to produce the best cosmetic result with the least permanent deformity.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-31 09:16:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 2, 2004 and previously updated in 2005 and 2008.</P>
<P>The outer ear (pinna) comprises cartilage covered by perichondrium, subcutaneous tissue and skin. Acute haematoma of the pinna is a collection of blood beneath the perichondrial layer of the pinna (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsen-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsen 1975</LINK>). It is generally caused by blunt trauma, e.g. a blow to the ear in sports such as rugby or wrestling (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1997</LINK>). The blood vessels within the perichondrium on the anterior aspect of the pinna are disrupted and bleeding occurs within the potential space beneath. Separation of the perichondrium from the cartilage can result in necrosis of the cartilage due to the deprivation of its blood supply. A collection of blood can also stimulate formation of fibroneocartilage (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsen-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsen 1975</LINK>). These processes may result in the loss of cartilaginous support for the shape of the pinna and thickening of the soft tissues and cartilage (the 'cauliflower ear' or 'wrestler's ear' deformity) (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1996</LINK>). It is a common condition but prompt and proper treatment should reduce the likelihood of a permanent cosmetic deformity. It is generally thought that the longer haematomas are left untreated the greater the chance of a poor cosmetic outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current management generally consists of evacuation of the haematoma, either by aspiration or incision and drainage, sometimes followed by head bandaging or splinting of the pinna to prevent re-accumulation (<LINK REF="STD-Giffin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Giffin 1985</LINK>). There is no consensus on the best method of treatment hence variation in treatment from centre to centre. These treatments have little risk other than their failure to prevent re-accumulation and the development of a 'cauliflower ear'. However, the introduction of infection (either at the time of initial injury or during the procedure to drain the haematoma) may result in the serious consequence of perichondritis of the pinna. In severe cases tissue loss may occur.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of treatment options for acute auricular haematoma by systematic review of published evidence.</P>

<P>We conducted systematic searches for randomised controlled trials. There were no language, publication year or publication status restrictions. The date of the last search was 13 January 2011, following previous search updates in 2005 and 2008, and original searches in 2004.</P>
<ELECTRONIC_SEARCHES MODIFIED="2011-01-28 13:33:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following databases from their inception for published, unpublished and ongoing trials: the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2010, Issue 4); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; CAB Abstracts; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; ISRCTN; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and Google.</P>
<P>We modelled subject strategies for databases on the search strategy designed for CENTRAL. Where appropriate, we combined subject strategies with adaptations of the highly sensitive search strategy designed by the Cochrane Collaboration for identifying randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials (as described in <I>The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>Version 5.0.2, Box 6.4.b.

At the update of the review in 2011, we adopted the Cochrane Collaboration 'Risk of bias' method whereby assessment of the risk of bias of the included trials would be undertaken independently by the two review authors, with the following taken into consideration, as guided by the<I> Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2009</LINK>):</P>

This involves answering a pre-specified question whereby a judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; indicates low risk of bias, &#8216;No&#8217; indicates high risk of bias, and &#8216;Unclear&#8217; indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias.</P>

<P>We used a comprehensive search strategy to identify 59 potentially relevant articles. Of these 11 were clearly not applicable to the review after scanning of the abstracts as they were related to animal experiments or other conditions rather than haematoma of the pinna. We retrieved 48 in full text in order to assess the papers for inclusion and to search the bibliographies for further relevant trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria. We identified no randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials or cohort studies in this way. One other widely cited article was, however, identified and retrieved for examination (<LINK REF="STD-Kelleher-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Kelleher 1967</LINK>).</P>
<P>The searches identified two letters, 13 'How I do it' articles, five case reports, 18 review articles and 10 case series articles.</P>
<P>The updated searches in 2005, 2008 and 2011 retrieved 16, six and 10 references, respectively, but none met the inclusion criteria for the review.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-01-28 13:45:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We made efforts to identify all relevant studies and no study was excluded due to language. It is possible that some studies were missed but we feel that it is unlikely that we missed any higher quality published studies such as randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>The studies retrieved reported a number of different types of treatment for haematoma of the pinna, including aspiration (<LINK REF="STD-Koopmann-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Koopmann 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talaat-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Talaat 1985</LINK>), simple incision and evacuation (<LINK REF="STD-Savage-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Savage 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuller-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schuller 1989</LINK>), anterior incision, fenestration of cartilage and evacuation (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>), and posterior incision, fenestration of cartilage and evacuation (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vuyk-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vuyk 1991</LINK>). Treatments for prevention of re-accumulation of the haematoma also varied widely and included through suturing (<LINK REF="STD-Bader-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bader 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cochran-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Cochran 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koopmann-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Koopmann 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savage-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Savage 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vuyk-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vuyk 1991</LINK>), tie-over dressing (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>), various tie-through dressings (<LINK REF="STD-Nahl-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Nahl 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scarcella-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Scarcella 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuller-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schuller 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talaat-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Talaat 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unger-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Unger 1970</LINK>), silicone splints (<LINK REF="STD-Bingham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bingham 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lane-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lane 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quine-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Quine 1996</LINK>), cotton wool and plaster of paris dressing (<LINK REF="STD-Spearing-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Spearing 1967</LINK>), passive drainage (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1997</LINK>), suction drainage (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eliachar-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Eliachar 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krugman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Krugman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2000</LINK>) and the use of a swimmer's nose clip (<LINK REF="STD-Grosse-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grosse 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have found no studies which show whether simple aspiration of the haematoma is adequate treatment or when more invasive evacuation techniques might be necessary. Although almost all articles found by our search strategy suggest the use of some form of post-drainage intervention, no studies have been performed to demonstrate evidence for or against its use.</P>
<P>Very few of the studies identified by the searches discussed their rate of complication. Schuller et al (<LINK REF="STD-Schuller-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schuller 1989</LINK>) describe two cases of perichondritis in the 24 ears treated using a tie-through dressing and state that this caused only minor thickening of the pinna. Koopmann and Coulthard (<LINK REF="STD-Koopmann-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Koopmann 1979</LINK>), Eliachar et al (<LINK REF="STD-Eliachar-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Eliachar 1983</LINK>), Talaat et al (<LINK REF="STD-Talaat-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Talaat 1985</LINK>) and El-Silimy and Bradley (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Silimy-1985" TYPE="STUDY">El-Silimy 1985</LINK>) each stated that their series of patients suffered no complications. Many of the other published studies identified fail to comment on the rate of complication. Many of these studies are retrospective, review articles or expert opinion describing methods rather than prospective descriptions of actual outcomes in series of patients.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-01-28 13:45:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available literature relating to the effectiveness of the possible interventions for acute auricular haematoma is generally poor with no randomisation or controls. There is evidence from the trials that various interventions are effective at removal of haematomas and preventing their recurrence, resulting in good cosmetic outcome, but no evidence as to whether one intervention is better than another or whether post-drainage interventions, such as pressure bandaging, tie-through compression or application of silicone moulds, are necessary.</P>
<P>Many of the identified papers consisted of expert opinion only and it is therefore not possible to recommend a specific intervention as the best. However, all of the trials identified by the search demonstrated a technique for treatment and none suggested that no treatment was a better option.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-28 13:46:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for a well-designed trial comparing interventions for acute auricular haematoma. In view of the relative rarity it may be necessary to organise a multi-centre trial so that significant numbers of patients will be identified within a reasonable time-frame. Long-term follow up will also be required to assess the final cosmetic outcome of the interventions being examined. A placebo-controlled, double-blinded study would clearly be impossible and unethical, however blinding of those assessing the outcomes of treatment should be possible.</P>
<P>It could be said that even a prospective study assessing the rate of complication and success of a given treatment would be of benefit when compared to the studies identified in this review.</P>
