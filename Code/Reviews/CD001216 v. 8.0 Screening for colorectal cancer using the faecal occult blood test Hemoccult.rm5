<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Regular screening of faeces for blood can detect colorectal cancer earlier and hence may reduce mortality in populations at risk, such as older patients. The screening test used in these trials to detect colorectal (bowel) cancer was the faecal occult blood test (FOBT). If the FOBT is positive, the bowels are examined closely with further diagnostic test (coloscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast barium enema), but these tests often cause discomfort and can cause serious adverse consequences. As blood identified in faeces may be due to several reason (unrelated to cancer), it may cause people unnecessary stress and expose them to possible harm. This review found that FOBT screening is likely to avoid approximately 1 in 6 colorectal cancer deaths.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-12 14:40:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in the Western world. Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males (54.8 per 100,000) and the second in females (34.8 per 100,000) in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 2005</LINK>). In the USA, it is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in both males (62.7 per 100,000) and females (45.8 per 100,000) (<LINK REF="REF-U.S.-CDC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">U.S. CDC 2004</LINK>). Colorectal cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer for males (60.7 per 100,000) and for females (52.1 per 100,000) in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>The human and financial costs of this disease have prompted considerable research efforts to evaluate the ability of screening tests to detect the cancer at an early curable stage. Tests that have been considered for population screening include variants of the faecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Winawer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winawer 1993</LINK>). Reducing mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) may be achieved by the introduction of population-based screening programmes.</P>

<P>See: Colorectal Cancer search strategy.</P>
<P>This review is the second update of the previously published Cochrane Collaboration systematic review (First published 1998 Issue 2).<BR/>To identify appropriate studies, we conducted a search using COCHRANE LIBRARY, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, AMED, SIGLE, and HMIC electronic databases (searches performed using WebSPIRS - search strategies used available on request). There were no restrictions on language of the articles. Studies identified in the searches published before 1996 were compared with the existing reference list for the previous Cochrane review.</P>
<P>Four elements of the search strategy were developed and intersected using the Boolean term 'AND':<BR/>i. Colorectal cancer subject headings (exploded): colorectal neoplasms. Text words (title and abstract): colorectal*, colon, colonic, bowel*, rectal, rectum, sigmoid, anal, anus combined with cancer*, neoplas*, tumor*, tumour*, carcinoma*, sarcoma*, adenocarcinoma*, adeno?carcinoma*, adenom*, lesion*, CRC<BR/>ii. Diagnostic methods subject headings (exploded): occult-blood, endoscopy-gastrointestinal, colonoscopes, sigmoidoscope, proctoscope and enema. Text words (title and abstract): faecal, fecal, stool near occult, FOBT, FOB, haemoccult, hemoccult, sensa, coloscreen, seracult, ez-detect, colocare, flexsure, hemmoquant, hemeselect, immudia, monohaem, insure, !nsure, hemodia, instant-view, immocare, magstream, guaiac near1 smear*, endoscop*, proctoscop*; colonoscop*, sigmoidoscop*, rectosigmoidoscop*, proctosigmoidoscop*, COL, SIG, FSIG, barium near1 enema, DCBE<BR/>iii.

Study search criteria: based on the Cochrane controlled trial filter (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The references of all retrieved relevant studies were searched for additional trials. We also wrote to the principal investigators of four of the trials (Funen, Goteborg, Minnesota, Nottingham) to inform them of the update to the review. The trial authors were asked to clarify aspects of the methods and results, and asked for any unpublished data in the areas of quality and trial outcomes. Three of the four investigators replied (authors of the Nottingham trial did not respond).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>2010 Update Search</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>For this update, searches was conducted in May 2010 to identify articles published between Januar 2006 to May 2010, in addition to the previously performed searches from 1989-2006. We searched COCHRANE LIBRARY, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PSYCHINFO electronic databases (searches performed using OVID - search strategies used available on request). There were no restrictions on language of the articles. The update search strategy used the new Cochrane highly sensitive search filter (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook-5.0.2" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook 5.0.2</LINK>), replacing the &#8216;study search criteria&#8217; filter (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2005</LINK>) above.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-01-12 14:38:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reviewers (PH and PG) contributed to assembling a comprehensive set of articles published between 1989 and 2010 that met the inclusion criteria. The reference list was examined to make certain that the current searches did not miss studies included in the previous Cochrane review.</P>
<P>Data from the trials were independently extracted onto standardised critical appraisal forms by two reviewers (PH and EW). Abstracted data included the study citation, study objectives, study design, method of randomisation and blinded assessment of mortality, length of study and follow-up, number of participants (including number of withdrawals), participant characteristics, description of FOB testing regime, characteristics of FOB test (i.e., sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value), compliance with screening (both overall and for each screening round), number of CRC cases, number of CRC deaths, all cause mortality, number of follow-up diagnostic procedures (e.g. colonoscopies, sigmoidoscopies, etc), compliance with follow-up diagnostic procedures and stage of cancer.</P>
<P>The trials identified from the searches were independently assessed for their quality by two reviewers (PH and EW), using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2005</LINK>). Using the Cochrane approach to the assessment of allocation concealment, trials were graded as one of four randomisation categories (A = adequate; B = unclear; C = inadequate; D = not used). A method to generate the sequence of randomisation was regarded as appropriate if it allowed each study participant to have the same chance of receiving each intervention and the investigators could not predict which treatment was next (e.g. table of random numbers or computer generated). Disagreements about quality were resolved through discussion with PG.</P>
<P>Data analysis was performed using the group subjects were originally randomised to ('intention to screen'), whether or not they were ever screened. To determine the effect of screening on colorectal cancer mortality, we estimated the relative risk and risk difference for each trial, and then overall, using fixed and random effects models and tested for heterogeneity of effects using the chi-squared test in Review Manager 5.0.2.</P>
<P>Since analysis by intention-to-screen would underestimate any real effect in those attending screening, as a secondary analysis, we adjusted for screening in individual trials using a previously published method (<LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 1992</LINK>). Essentially, this method divides the intention-to-screen effect (relative risk reduction) by the proportion attending screening.</P>

<P>Three trials - the Funen, Goteborg and Nottingham trials - randomly allocated individuals or households identified from general practice records or population registers to invitation with screening with Hemoccult (Nottingham) or Hemoccult-II (Funen, Goteborg) or to control groups. One trial - the Minnesota study - allocated people to either screening (Hemoccult) or control groups only after they had agreed to participate in the trial ('volunteers').</P>
<P>The age of participants ranged from 45 to 75 years for the majority of trials, with the exception of the Goteborg trial where participants were aged 60 to 64 years. The ratio of males and females was similar across the studies (see Table 1). The Funen trial (<LINK REF="STD-Funen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Funen 2004</LINK>) reported that mean age increased from 59.8 years to 73.0 years during the study and that the male/female ratio decreased from 0.92 to 0.78. The length of follow-up ranged from 8.5 years to 18.4 years. Median follow-up for the Nottingham trial was 11.7 years (range 8.4 to 18.4 years) (<LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 2002</LINK>) and mean follow-up time for the Goteborgtrial was 15.75 years (range 11.25 to 19.5 years) (<LINK REF="STD-Goteborg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Goteborg 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Three trials (Funen, Goteborg, Nottingham) performed biennial screening. Only individuals who took part in the first round of screening were invited for further screening for the Funen trial. One randomised trial (Minnesota) evaluated both annual and biennial screening. The number of potential screening rounds varied between the trials. Nine rounds of screening were offered to the screening arm of the Funen trial. Participants in the screening arm of the Goteborg trial were offered a second FOB test one-and-a-half to two years after initial screening. In the Minnesota trial, the screening rounds were divided into Phase 1 (between February 1976 and December 1982) and Phase II (between February 1986 and February 1992). This meant that screening group participants had an interval of between 3 to 5 years between the two phases of the trial. In total, 11 rounds of screening were offered to the annual screening group and 6 rounds of screening were offered to the biennial screening group. Six rounds of screening were offered to participants in the screening arm of the Nottingham trial.</P>
<P>To reduce the rate of a false-positive results, three trials (Funen, Goteborg, Minnesota) encouraged participants to restrict their diet and medications for a specific period before collecting samples for the Hemoccult test. The restrictions varied between studies, but primarily concerned avoiding food containing blood (e.g. red meat, fish, poultry), certain fruits and vegetables, vitamin C and aspirin. Hemoccult slides were not rehydrated in two of the randomised trials (Funen, Nottingham) and both of the controlled trials. Both the Goteborg and Minnesota randomised trials rehydrated the majority of Hemoccult slides. In all of the trials, participants with a positive Hemoccult test were referred for further diagnostic evaluation. Further diagnostic evaluations were expected to be performed by colonoscopy, except for participants in the Goteborg randomised trial who received sigmoidoscopy and double-contrast barium enema.</P>

<P>All of the randomised trials (Funen, Goteborg, Minnesota, Nottingham) used an adequate randomisation procedure resulting in comparable study groups. Given that the FOB test was completed by trial participants at home, blinding of participants to the intervention was not possible.</P>
<P>Mortality analyses were by "intention to treat" for the Funen, Minnesota and Nottingham randomised trials. This is not specifically stated for the Goteborg trial. One hundred and ninety-seven participants were excluded from the screening group in the Goteborg randomised trials (participants had either died between randomisation and screening or could not be located).</P>
<P>Blinded, standardised assessment for mortality was performed for all four randomised controlled trials and both controlled trials.

</B>Combining the four randomised trials shows that screening results in a statistically significant relative reduction in colorectal cancer mortality of 16% (fixed and random effects models: RR 0.84, CI: 0.78-0.90). This overall result combined the annual and biennial groups in the Minnesota randomised trial as there was little heterogeneity between the effects (Chi-square test for heterogeneity = 1.85, df = 3, P = 0.60, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>

Hemoccult screening continued to be offered to all screening participants in most trials, regardless of previous attendance. In the Funen study, only subjects who participated in the first round of screening were invited to subsequent screening rounds, hence, the compliance with Hemoccult testing was very high (91-94%) (<LINK REF="STD-Funen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Funen 2004</LINK>).

<BR/>For two of the trials (Funen, Nottingham), the Haemoccult slides were not rehydrated resulting in a low test positivity rate (0.8% to 3.8%) and a higher positive predictive value for colorectal cancer (5% to 18.7%). In comparison, the test positivity rate for rehydrated slides (Goteborg and Minnesota) was 1.7% to 15.4% and the positive predictive value lower at 0.9% to 6.1% (see Table 5).<BR/>The sensitivity of the Hemoccult test was defined as the proportion of all colorectal cancers that were detected by screening, where "all colorectal cancers" was the sum of screen-detected cancers (true positives) and interval cancers within one or two years of screening (false-negatives). The estimated sensitivity of the Hemoccult test for colorectal cancer varied from 55% to 57% for the non-rehydrated slides (81% for a small sample of participants in the Minnesota trial) and from 82% to 92% for the rehydrated slides.</P>

<BR/>As population screening results in earlier cancer diagnosis, we would expect an excess of colorectal cancers detected initially in the screening groups. In the previous Cochrane review, the authors reported that there was an excess of CRC cases for the Funen, Goteborg and Nottingham trials. However, it was uncertain why this did not initially occur for the Minnesota trial (<LINK REF="REF-Towler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towler 1998</LINK>). A re-examination of this data shows an increased number of CRC cases for the screening groups in the Funen (at 3 years follow-up CRC cases screen = 147; CRC cases control = 115; <LINK REF="REF-Kronborg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kronborg 1989</LINK>), Goteborg (at 8.5 years follow-up CRC cases screen = 117; CRC cases control = 44; <LINK REF="STD-Goteborg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Goteborg 1994</LINK>) and Nottingham trials (at 7.8 years follow-up CRC cases screen = 893; CRC cases control = 856; <LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 1996</LINK>). It was suggested that the discrepancy in the number of CRC cases detected in the Minnesota trial (at 13 years follow-up CRC cases annual screen = 323; CRC cases biennial screen = 323; CRC cases control = 356; <LINK REF="STD-Minnesota-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Minnesota 1993</LINK>) may have occurred through chance and that this may then also be associated with an underestimation of CRC mortality in the screening groups (<LINK REF="REF-Towler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towler 1998</LINK>). However, it is interesting to note that the Minnesota trial was reporting at 13 years follow-up, in comparison to the much shorter reported length of follow-up for the other trials. Indeed, in a later publication of the Funen trial, the screening and control groups were almost identical in identified CRC cases (at 10 years follow-up CRC cases screen = 481; CRC cases control = 483; <LINK REF="STD-Funen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Funen 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>With further follow-up, the decreasing number of CRC cases occurring over time between the screening and control groups was evident in most of the included trials. In the Funen trial, the number of CRC cases was only slightly higher in the screening groups in comparison to the control groups (see Table 6). The Minnesota (CRC cases annual screen = 417; CRC cases biennial screen = 435), Goteborg and Nottingham trials all reported a lower number of CRC cases in comparison to the control groups. This suggests that other factors, rather than chance (see <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Church-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Church 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ederer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ederer 1997</LINK>), may have contributed to the reported lower number of CRC cases in the screening groups. There is support for the reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer following colonoscopic polypectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Citarda-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Citarda 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-New-York-1993" TYPE="STUDY">New York 1993</LINK>). The reduced number of CRC cases for the screening groups most likely reflects the efficacy of colonoscopic polypectomy in preventing adenomas from developing into CRC. Indeed, two of the trials (Funen, Goteborg) reported a very large number of identified adenomas in the screening groups in comparison to the control groups (Funen: screen group = 481 adenomas, control group = 174 adenomas, <LINK REF="REF-Kronborg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kronborg 1989</LINK>; Goteborg: screen group = 419 adenomas, control group = 51 adenomas, <LINK REF="STD-Goteborg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Goteborg 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>As would be expected with screening, all four trials reported more early stage colorectal cancers (Dukes A) and less late stage colorectal cancers (Dukes D or Dukes C and D) in the screening groups compared with the control groups (see Table 7). This favourable shift in colorectal cancer staging occurred across the trials, although the proportion of cancers that were actually screen-detected (e.g. excluding interval cancers, re screening and cancers detected in non-responders to the screening invitation) was fairly low (23% to 46% for Dukes A reported in two of the included trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Funen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Funen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 1996</LINK>).</P>

<I>Further investigation rates</I>
</B>
<BR/>Rates of further diagnostic evaluation (e.g. colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, completion rates for colonoscopy, etc) were reported for all of the included trials. The main investigation was colonoscopy (three of the trials), with only the Goteborg trial using flexible sigmoidoscopy and double-contrast barium enema (DCBE). Around 9 in 10 patients with a positive FOB had further testing. In the Funen trial, 93% of participants with a positive Haemoccult result attended at least one colonoscopy examination. In the Minnesota trial, 83% of the annual screening group and 84% of the biennial group returning a positive FOBT result underwent a colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy and double-contrast barium enema. In the Nottingham trial 87% of participants with a positive result underwent either colonoscopy, double contrast barium enema or both. In the Goteborg trial, 92% of participants with a positive test attended flexible sigmoidoscopy and a double contrast barium enema.</P>
<P>In the two trials that used colonoscopy as the primary means of further investigation (the Goteborg trial primarily used flexible sigmoidoscopy) and reported complications of the procedure, the rate of perforation during colonoscopy is approximately 1 in 1,400 (9/13,720 = 0.0007). Adverse outcomes were reported in detail for 3 of the trials (Goteborg, Minnesota, Nottingham). The Goteborg trial reported adverse outcomes for both flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. In this trial, 3 participants (out of 2,108 participants) who received follow-up by flexible sigmoidoscopy had perforations of the sigmoid colon (<LINK REF="STD-Goteborg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goteborg 1996</LINK>). All three participants recovered without complications. Three complications (out of only 190 procedures) were also reported for participants undergoing colonoscopy in the Goteborg trial (two perforations and one bleeding complication; perforation detected at polypectomy, perforation of sigmoid colon due to colonoscope and bleeding detected 12 days after polypectomy). In the Minnesota trial, of the 12,246 colonoscopies performed at the University of Minnesota hospital there were four perforations of the colon (all requiring surgery) and 11 serious bleeding (3 requiring surgery) complications (<LINK REF="STD-Minnesota-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Minnesota 1993</LINK>). The Nottingham randomised trial reported that there were seven complications (out of 1,474 procedures) associated with colonoscopy (five perforations, one major bleed, one snare entrapment) (<LINK REF="STD-Nottingham-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nottingham 1999</LINK>). Six of these complications required surgery although none of these patients died from the colonoscopy complications.</P>
<P>The cumulative risk of being invited for further investigation (either colonoscopy or flexible-sigmoidoscopy) following a positive FOBT was 2.6% (1,977/76,466) for the Nottingham trial, 5.3% (1,647/30,762 ) for the Funen trial and 6.4% (2,180/34,144) for the Goteborg trial. The total number of positive screening tests is not reported for the Minnesota trial. However, the number of positive screening tests that were followed by an adequate examination (either colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy and DCBE) were reported as 8,663 for the annual screening group and 5,170 for the biennial screening group (<LINK REF="STD-Minnesota-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Minnesota 2000</LINK>). Based on the reported compliance rate for further investigation (annual = 83%; biennial = 84%), the estimated cumulative risk of being invited for further investigation in the Minnesota trial was 65% for the annual group (8,663/15,570 X 1.17) and 38% for the biennial group (5,170/15,587 X 1.16).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-09-17 15:00:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence from the randomised controlled trials included in this review, indicates that screening with Haemoccult reduces mortality from colorectal cancer. Based on all randomised participants, the reduction of colorectal cancer mortality from inviting participants to repeat screening is 16% (RR 0.84, CI: 0.78-0.90). Although the trials varied in the selection and age of their study populations, screening intervals, conditions of Haemoccult testing and slide processing, length of follow-up and attendance for screening, the relative reduction in colorectal cancer mortality with screening is consistent across the trials.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of a screening programme depends on the accuracy of the screening test used to detect the condition. The majority of trials reported that the positive predictive value (PPV) of Haemoccult for colorectal cancer was fairly low (see Table 5), suggesting that over 80% of all positive tests were false-positives. These false-positive participants would have been encouraged to attend a further diagnostic investigation, which may have resulted in some negative consequences (e.g. stress, anxiety, other psycho-social consequences) and a small chance of significant adverse consequences from the diagnostic test (e.g. risk of bleeding, bowel perforation or even death). Although this must also be tempered by the PPV for adenomas (1 cm or over), which was higher in comparison to the colorectal cancer PPV. Removal of adenomas identified at screening may also reduce the likelihood of the development of colorectal cancer in the future (<LINK REF="STD-New-York-1993" TYPE="STUDY">New York 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Citarda-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Citarda 2001</LINK>), although this has not been definitively demonstrated.</P>
<P>A criticism of the previous Cochrane review was that it did not include an analysis of all-cause mortality. The all-cause mortality from four of the randomised trials (Funen, Goteborg, Minnesota and Nottingham) combined showed no difference between the screening and control groups (RR 1.00, CI: 0.99-1.03). Although the expectation that all-cause mortality would be decreased as a result of a decrease in mortality in the intervention group (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2002</LINK>) this would only be so for diseases that have a significant impact on overall mortality. A major limitation of using all-cause mortality as an endpoint in cancer screening trials is that it is poorly powered as the intervention is targeted to a disease that causes only a small proportion of overall deaths. A complete analysis of the specific reasons for death (e.g. coronary heart disease, stroke, car accidents, etc) contributing to the all-cause mortality would help to determine if people who have survived colorectal cancer die of other causes several (or more years) later.</P>
<P>The estimate of mortality reduction from the updated randomised and controlled Haemoccult trials is consistent. Haemoccult screening is likely to be of benefit in reducing colorectal cancer mortality for particular population groups (e.g. older adults given the increased incidence of colorectal cancer with age). The included trials also indicated that there was a general shift towards identifying colorectal cancer in the earlier stages within the screening groups (e.g. Duke's Stage A) in comparison to the control groups. However, this is to be expected, given that screening studies would identify earlier stage lesions due to lead and length time biases. Other benefits of screening that were not explored in detail include the reduction in colorectal cancer incidence through detection and removal of colorectal adenomas, and potentially, less invasive treatment of identified early-stage colorectal cancers.</P>
<P>Alternative CRC screening modalities to FOBT are currently under investigation or in use.  The suggested improved accuracy and patient acceptance of immunochemical FOBT (FIT) have been forwarded as reasons for adopting FIT over guaiac FOBT for population screening (<LINK REF="REF-Guittet-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guittet 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Federici-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Federici 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Netherlands-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Netherlands 2008</LINK>).  Ongoing trials of flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), either alone or in combination with FOBT/FIT to reduce CRC mortality have also yielded promising findings (<LINK REF="REF-Atkin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoff 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weissfeld-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissfeld 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Netherlands-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Netherlands 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Segnan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segnan 2005</LINK>) with more definitive results expected in several years. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Who would be likely to benefit from colorectal cancer screening using Haemoccult? Assuming a constant reduction in relative risk, the mortality benefit of screening is greatest in populations at greater risk of colorectal cancer death whilst the harmful effects of screening are likely to be independent of this risk (<LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 1995</LINK>). Indeed, increasing screening benefit with increasing population risk of colorectal cancer death was observed in the screening trials.</P>
<P>The reduction in the relative risk of colorectal cancer death with screening needs to be interpreted for its benefit in the overall population where there are differing baseline risks for colorectal cancer. For example, the risk of colorectal cancer increases markedly with age and also in people who have a family history of CRC (<LINK REF="REF-Weitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weitz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cappell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappell 2005</LINK>). However, people who have a genetic disposition, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), have an greatly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Faivre-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faivre 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynch-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 2000</LINK>). These individuals would not benefit from population screening, but are likely to benefit from specific monitoring of their conditions through dedicated genetic services (<LINK REF="REF-Bliss-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bliss 2004</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Several important areas require further research. First, there is relatively little information currently available concerning the information needs and psychosocial consequences of screening for colorectal cancer. Specific research regarding the best method to provide relevant, high-quality information about the benefits, risks and potential consequences of screening is important to allow people to make and informed choice if they are offered screening. Moreover, the specific information needs of people regarding the type of information that is most relevant to their decision and how best to communicate the possible risks associated with colorectal screening also need to be addressed. Second, there is limited research on patient acceptance of colorectal cancer screening or on how best to involve particular sections of the community, who are often under-represented in other screening activities, in potential colorectal cancer screening programmes. Thirdly, the accuracy of other variants of the faecal occult blood test (e.g. RHNA) for colorectal cancer screening also require further investigation, particularly in comparison to existing tests.</P>
<P>Estimated screening benefit for potential screening populations should guide health policy decisions about to whom screening can be offered. For example, in England and Wales in 2004, the cumulative 10 year mortality from colorectal cancer in males for the decades beginning 40, 50 and 60 are respectively 5, 22 and 70 per 10,000 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 2005</LINK>). If offering screening reduced this mortality from colorectal cancer by 16%, then the reduction in CRC deaths over the following 10 years for each of these age groups would be 0.8, 3.5 and 11.2 respectively, per 10,000 invited. This somewhat overestimates the benefits of CRC screening, as some of the mortality relates to those diagnosed prior to that decade (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 2004</LINK>). However, it is also an underestimate for those who regularly attend CRC screening. If we use the mortality reduction of 25% estimated for those who regularly attend screening, the reduction in CRC mortality over 10 years for those aged 40, 50 and 60 would be 1.25, 5.5 and 17.5 per 10,000 respectively. Although the relative risk reduction is held to be constant across the trials, greatest reduction in CRC deaths that could be achieved by CRC screening is dependent on the advancing age of the individual (although, given the lack of an effect for all-cause mortality, an increase in life years may not be observed). Hence targeting and monitoring of population programs also requires attention.</P>

<P>Based on the numbers given in your tables, I came to the conclusion that all-cause mortality is higher in the screening group as compared to the control group. Colorectal cancer (CRCa) screening does more harm than benefit: for one life prolonged there are almost three lives shortened. <BR/>From calculations I performed <I>(available from the CCCG editorial office)</I> there is a statistically significant increase in all-cause mortality in the screening group (p = 0.03).<BR/>Furthermore, calculations of absolute risk reduction (Control-Screening) showed that Number needed to harm (NNH) is one in 287 in the screening group. Other-cause mortality is significantly increased, and finally for the colorectal cancer specific mortality my calculations showed that per one life that is prolonged (omitting one CRCa death) there are about 625/211 = 2.96 lives shortened.</P>
<P>I would be very grateful if you could help me to answer a few questions:<BR/>1.) Would it not be prudent now to emphasize that colorectal cancer screening can be detrimental<BR/>in terms of all-cause mortality, or even to warn against colorectal cancer screening?<BR/>2.) Is there a strong argument why to use the Peto odds ratio in your review?<BR/>3.) Was the choice of the Peto odds ratio done a priori before the data were evaluated?<BR/>

<P>Dear Hans-Hermann Dubben,</P>
<P>Thank you for your interest in the review and for taking the time to contact us in regards to your query. We also appreciate that you sent your analysis of the data to enable us to respond to your query.<BR/>Unfortunately, and with all due respect sir, we suspect that your calculations are incorrect. You seem to have pooled the results of all four trials, however, your analysis indicates that you have included both of the screening arms of the Minnesota trial (annual and biennial screening). Therefore, unfortunately you have introduced confounding into the analysis in that you have included a greater number of deaths in the screening arms than the control arms (essentially 5 screening groups versus 4 screening groups). This is also the reason why we performed the meta-analysis of the trials.<BR/>We decided to user the Peto method a priori given that:<BR/>a) it is appropriate for trials in which trials have roughly an equal number of participants in both groups<BR/>b) the treatment effects are small (e.g. CRC mortality is approximately 2% of all-cause mortality).<BR/>Indeed, the Peto method was developed specifically for use in cancer where small effects are likely, yet very important.<BR/>I hope that I have answered your query satisfactorily and would also like to indicate that we will be updating the review towards the end of this year. Thank you again for your time. </P>
<P>Kind regards, <BR/>Paul Hewitson<BR/>Research Fellow</P>
