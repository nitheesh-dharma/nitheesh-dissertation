<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-05-11 09:47:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>This review looks at interventions for the skin infections 'cellulitis' and 'erysipelas'. These two terms are now considered different presentations of the same condition by most experts, so they are considered together for this review. For simplicity we used the one term 'cellulitis' to refer to both conditions.</P>
<P>Cellulitis is a common painful skin infection, usually bacterial, that may require hospitalisation in severe cases. There is variation in the types of treatments prescribed, so this review aims to collate evidence on the best treatments available.</P>
<P>The infection most commonly affects the skin of the lower leg but can infect the skin in any part of the body, usually following an injury to the skin. The symptoms include severe pain, swelling, and inflammation, often accompanied by fever, rigours, nausea, and feeling generally unwell. The infection is usually treated with antibiotics, however corticosteroids and physical treatments have been used to reduce pain, redness, and swelling, and improve the circulation to the skin.</P>
<P>We identified 25 randomised controlled trials. No two trials investigated the same antibiotics, and there was no standard treatment regime used as a comparison. We are not able to define the best treatment for cellulitis and our limited conclusions are mostly based on single trials. No single treatment was clearly superior. Surprisingly, oral antibiotics appeared to be more effective than antibiotics given into a vein for moderate and severe cellulitis. This merits further study. Antibiotics given by injection into a muscle were as effective as when given into a vein, with a lower incidence of adverse events. In one study the addition of corticosteroids to an antibiotic appeared to shorten the length of hospital stay, however further trials are needed. A single small study indicated vibration therapy may increase the rate of recovery but the results of single trials should be viewed with caution. We had insufficient data to give meaningful results for adverse events.<BR/>

<P>We included 25 studies with a total of 2488 participants. Our primary outcome 'symptoms rated by participant or medical practitioner or proportion symptom-free' was commonly reported. No two trials examined the same drugs, therefore we grouped similar types of drugs together.</P>
<P>Macrolides/streptogramins were found to be more effective than penicillin antibiotics (Risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97). In 3 trials involving 419 people, 2 of these studies used oral macrolide against intravenous (iv) penicillin demonstrating that oral therapies can be more effective than iv therapies (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73<I> </I>to 0.98).</P>
<P>Three studies with a total of 88 people comparing a penicillin with a cephalosporin showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43).</P>
<P>Six trials which included 538 people that compared different generations of cephalosporin, showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to1.06).</P>
<P>We found only small single studies for duration of antibiotic treatment, intramuscular versus intravenous route, the addition of corticosteroid to antibiotic treatment compared with antibiotic alone, and vibration therapy, so there was insufficient evidence to form conclusions. Only two studies investigated treatments for severe cellulitis and these selected different antibiotics for their comparisons, so we cannot make firm conclusions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cellulitis and definitions</HEADING>
<P>Cellulitis is an acute, subacute, or chronic inflammation of loose connective tissue, but the term has been applied mainly to inflammation of subcutaneous tissue in which an infective, generally bacterial cause is proven or assumed. Erysipelas is a bacterial infection of the dermis and upper subcutaneous tissue; its hallmark is a well-defined, raised edge reflecting the more superficial (dermal) involvement. However, cellulitis may extend superficially and erysipelas deeply, so that in many cases the two processes coexist and it is impossible to make a meaningful distinction. Current usage tends to regard erysipelas as a form of cellulitis rather than a distinct entity, so that the definition of cellulitis would include inflammation of dermal as well as subcutaneous tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 2004</LINK>). There are no internationally accepted criteria for mild, moderate, and severe cellulitis although this classification is widely used in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2001</LINK>). In this review we have used the term cellulitis to include erysipelas.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence</HEADING>
<P>Cellulitis is thought to be relatively common, but there are few published data on its incidence. A cohort study conducted in the USA indicated that the incidence of cellulitis and leg abscess (grouped together) ranged from 4 to 25 cases per 10,000 person years in the over 65 age group and that the incidence of cases diagnosed in hospital increased over a 10-year period (<LINK REF="REF-Haan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haan 1997</LINK>). A further USA study carried out in 1997 to 2002 indicated a higher incidence of 246/10,000 person years (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-Simonsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis Simonsen 2006</LINK>). In England alone, people admitted with a diagnosis of cellulitis took up to 360,000 bed days (<LINK REF="REF-UK-DOH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK DOH 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Infective agents</HEADING>
<P>Microbiological studies are positive in only a quarter of people who present to hospital with erysipelas or cellulitis, using classical testing with blood cultures, swabs from skin lesions, or fine needle aspiration from affected skin. The use of latex agglutination techniques and direct immunofluorescence on skin biopsy specimens increases the yield and has clearly shown that beta <I>Haemolytic streptococci</I> (usually group A or group G) represent the most prominent bacteria in studies of cellulitis and erysipelas, accounting for almost 80% of isolated organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brook 1995</LINK>). <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> probably does not cause a clinical picture of classical erysipelas, but may sometimes cause cellulitis (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1996</LINK>). However with the rise in the number of community-acquired methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (MRSA)-related infections (<LINK REF="REF-Kluytmans_x002d_Vandenbergh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluytmans-Vandenbergh 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Purcell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purcell 2005</LINK>) this picture may change in the future. Enterococci are occasionally isolated from people with leg ulcers, often mixed with gram-negative bacteria and/or <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1996</LINK>). Anaerobic organisms are much less commonly isolated and include <I>Peptostreptococcus </I>species, <I>Bacteroides fragilis</I>, <I>Prevotella species</I>, <I>Porphyromonas species</I>, and <I>Clostridium species</I>. (<LINK REF="REF-Brook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brook 1995</LINK>). In rare cases fungal species may be implicated in the disease process (<LINK REF="REF-Baddour-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baddour 1984</LINK>). There was a decrease in the frequency of childhood periorbital and orbital cellulitis caused by <I>Haemophilus influenzae </I>B (Hib) coinciding with the introduction of the Hib vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-Ambati-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ambati 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes and risk factors</HEADING>
<P>Research data on risk factors for developing cellulitis is scant. Three case-control studies (<LINK REF="REF-Dupuy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dupuy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mokni-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mokni 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roujeau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roujeau 2004</LINK>) focused on cellulitis of the leg. Of the variables investigated, a disruption of the cutaneous barrier caused by such factors as leg ulcer, wound, athlete's foot, pressure ulcer, dermatosis, or leg oedema were shown to be risk factors in these studies. Venous insufficiency, lymphoedema, and being overweight were additional risk factors in the <LINK REF="REF-Dupuy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dupuy 1999</LINK> study. In contrast to anecdotal and case-series reports, diabetes, alcohol misuse, intravenous drug misuse, or smoking were not risk factors. Age was not analysed as a risk factor. Cellulitis may be reported as a complication following surgery, with incidence being reported in case-series studies as 1% to 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Critchley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Critchley 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Escalante-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escalante 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lasley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lasley 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1999</LINK>) and those with lymphatic abnormalities are over represented in acute and recurrent cellulitis cases (<LINK REF="REF-Soo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soo 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact and complications of cellulitis</HEADING>
<P>Cellulitis is a localised skin infection, most commonly affecting the lower limbs, although it can involve any part of the skin. It is characterised by an area of redness and inflammation of the skin, with associated pain and swelling. It has an acute onset and it is usually accompanied by generalised symptoms, such as fever and rigours, nausea, and vomiting. A minority of sufferers have severe sepsis, local gangrene, or necrotising fasciitis, but most people are not seriously ill and have a low risk of severe complications (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1996</LINK>). There are no scientific studies investigating risk factors for complications. In most people the condition is treatable with antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2001</LINK>), however, longer-term problems, such as persistent swelling and venous ulcers, can occur in about one in every ten hospital inpatients (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1998</LINK>). Between 25% and 46% of people admitted to hospital may have recurrent episodes of cellulitis (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jorup_x002d_R_x00f6_nstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorup-Rönström 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pavlotsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavlotsky 2004</LINK>). However, in a population-based cohort study, in which nearly 80% of cases were treated in the community, only 11% had a recurrence within 1 year (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-Simonsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis Simonsen 2006</LINK>). Factors associated with recurrence have been examined using case-control (<LINK REF="REF-Pavlotsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavlotsky 2004</LINK>), cohort (<LINK REF="REF-Jorup_x002d_R_x00f6_nstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorup-Rönström 1987</LINK>), and case-series designs (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 2006</LINK>), and identified factors included venous insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Jorup_x002d_R_x00f6_nstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorup-Rönström 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pavlotsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavlotsky 2004</LINK>) and obesity, lymphoedema, (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pavlotsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavlotsky 2004</LINK>) smoking, tinea pedis, and local injury (<LINK REF="REF-Pavlotsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavlotsky 2004</LINK>).</P>

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-05-12 12:21:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard treatment for cellulitis is antibiotics as cellulitis is usually a bacterial infection. However, as symptoms may persist due to inflammation, anti-inflammatory agents may be effective. Physical treatments to reduce inflammation have also been used. This review does not include prophylaxis for recurrent infections: currently a large multicentre trial on 'Prophylactic Antibiotics for the Treatment of Cellulitis at Home' (<LINK REF="REF-PATCH-I-and-II" TYPE="REFERENCE">PATCH I and II</LINK>) is investigating penicillin to prevent recurrence</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Guidelines for treatment</HEADING>
<P>No single specialty of medicine can claim cellulitis as exclusively part of their remit. The condition is diagnosed and treated by general practitioners, emergency department doctors, dermatologists, paediatricians, surgeons, and physicians from a variety of sub-specialties. If it occurs following surgery, orthopaedic, vascular and general surgeons, ophthalmologists, ear, nose and throat surgeons, gynaecologists, and paediatricians may treat it. Anecdotal discussions with clinicians within the UK have highlighted that there is variation in practice for treating cellulitis. There are a few published guidelines for cellulitis (<LINK REF="REF-British-Lymphology-Society-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Lymphology Society 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CREST-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CREST 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eron-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eron 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Societe-Francaise-de-Dermatologie-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Societe Francaise de Dermatologie 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2005</LINK>). Due to the paucity of relevant research, recommendations from these guidelines are mostly based on evidence extrapolated from studies of other infections or based on expert opinion.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-06-30 11:33:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sally A Kilburn">
<P>Cellulitis is a common condition taking up a large number of occupied bed days in hospital. No national guidelines for treating cellulitis have been published, although some are currently in preparation and the Dermatological Society of France have issued a consensus guideline. Trials of treatment options have been published but these are often small and inconclusive. This review of the effects of interventions for cellulitis provides a valuable resource for clinicians in summarising current best evidence and highlighting gaps in the research. </P>

<P>All studies stated that inclusion criteria consisted of signs of skin inflammation and evidence of bacterial infection. In studies specialising in cellulitis, criteria were expanded in keeping with the definition of cellulitis. For example, 'a well delineated dermal-hypodermal inflammation' (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2002</LINK>) or the less specific 'erythema' (<LINK REF="STD-Grayson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Grayson 2002</LINK>). The reports of mixed populations did not usually provide a definition for individual conditions. Three studies of SSSIs restricted their studies to more severe cases. Their inclusion criteria were stated as 'complicated' infections (<LINK REF="STD-Fabian-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fabian 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giordano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Giordano 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weigelt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weigelt 2005</LINK>), with 'deep tissue involvement' or 'the presence of co-morbid conditions'. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Weigelt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weigelt 2005</LINK> included only those where there was suspected methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (MRSA). Trial authors did not give definitions of severity of disease or state the range of severity in the baseline characteristics, with the exception of two studies of moderate-to-severe cases: <LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2002</LINK>, who applied a scoring system, and <LINK REF="STD-Grayson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Grayson 2002</LINK>, who used 'the severity of symptoms or failure of previous treatment'.

In a number of studies the 'cure' group also contains those with 'clinical improvement' (<LINK REF="STD-Bucko-2002-part-1" TYPE="STUDY">Bucko 2002 part 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bucko-2002-part-2" TYPE="STUDY">Bucko 2002 part 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiMattia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">DiMattia 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grayson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Grayson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hepburn-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hepburn 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iannini-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Iannini 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tack-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tack 1998</LINK>). The 'time to follow-up' for assessment of cure or improvement varied widely. The quality of follow-up ranged from all participants being assessed to an assumption that cure had occurred unless the participant returned to the emergency department (<LINK REF="STD-Leman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leman 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A few studies reported the proportion with severe complications, but the numbers were too low in the cellulitis subpopulations to yield reliable data.</P>
<P>None of the trials described quality of life scores. In one study the primary outcome measure was the length of stay as a hospital inpatient (<LINK REF="STD-Bergkvist-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bergkvist 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of our secondary outcomes only two studies included 'changes in laboratory markers of infection and inflammation' in the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2002</LINK>). However, the results were not reported. Trials generally described adverse events, but none of the SSSI studies separated the data for those with cellulitis.</P>
<P>Therapeutic failure, as defined within this review, was not reported in the studies as a primary outcome measure. A few trials provided outcome data for cure, improvement, or failure. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Chan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 1995</LINK> defined failure as 'no significant effect on signs and symptoms', <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 1990</LINK> 'no apparent response to therapy', and <LINK REF="STD-Vinen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vinen 1996</LINK> as 'persistence of all symptoms and signs at 48 to 72 hours'. Within many studies the response to treatment was reported as a dichotomous outcome; failure as no response or requiring additional antibiotic treatment; cure as 'reduced signs and symptoms or none', e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2002</LINK>. For this reason these two outcomes are reported together in the results section.</P>
<P>Some studies of SSSIs showed data for microbiological eradication, however the results for the cellulitis subset were not shown (<LINK REF="STD-Bucko-2002-part-1" TYPE="STUDY">Bucko 2002 part 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bucko-2002-part-2" TYPE="STUDY">Bucko 2002 part 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-1991-part-1" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 1991 part 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-1991-part-2" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 1991 part 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiMattia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">DiMattia 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fabian-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fabian 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giordano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Giordano 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiani-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kiani 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tack-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tack 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vinen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weigelt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weigelt 2005</LINK>). Two studies of cellulitis participants intended to show microbiological eradication, however one did not pursue this because of lack of data (<LINK REF="STD-Grayson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Grayson 2002</LINK>), and the other used the organism, not the person, as the unit of analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Vinen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vinen 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>Dropouts and exclusions were determined slightly differently in the trials, which made it difficult to standardise our assessment of quality in this regard. For participants who did not return for follow-up, one trial assumed that they had been cured (<LINK REF="STD-Leman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leman 2005</LINK>), while others called them dropouts. In one study of military personnel and their families, follow up of participants appears to have been 100% (<LINK REF="STD-Hepburn-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hepburn 2004</LINK>). There was also 100% follow-up of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Zeglaoui-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeglaoui 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>Only six studies included an intention-to-treat analysis for the outcomes of interest for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Bergkvist-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bergkvist 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grayson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Grayson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hepburn-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hepburn 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weigelt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weigelt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeglaoui-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeglaoui 2004</LINK>). Other studies involving participants with a mixture of infections provided intention-to -treat analysis for the whole mixed population but not for the cellulitis subgroup. In a similar way details of loss to follow up for the cellulitis subgroup was not shown.  </P>
<P>A number of drug-company-sponsored studies excluded participants where the bacteria isolated were not sensitive to study antibiotics. These may have represented postrandomisation exclusions, although this was not stated. Participants with cellulitis will only yield a positive culture in a minority of cases unless sophisticated immunofluorescence techniques are employed (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1987</LINK>). So, if being 'culture negative' at baseline counted as an exclusion factor, a large proportion of participants with cellulitis were excluded from the trial, which may have skewed the results.</P>
<P>There was inconsistency in trials dealing with the situation where bacteria were found to be resistant to the study drugs at the baseline assessment.</P>
<P>In some trials the investigators isolated the organism, tested sensitivities, and then excluded those participants postrandomisation where the bacteria isolated were not sensitive to study antibiotics. In other studies the organisms' sensitivity to trial antibiotics was not assessed and this group of participants was be included in the final analysis.</P>

<P>A number of other difficulties were encountered in reviewing the trials. Presentation of results was sometimes poor, especially in older papers. A narrative description of outcomes, especially of adverse events, made it difficult to ascertain percentages and participants lost to follow up.

<P>The study reports did not provide data for all of the three primary outcomes listed in our protocol. Of our primary outcomes, only symptoms rated by the participant or a medical practitioner were reported. These were presented as 'absence of symptoms', 'reduced symptoms at end of treatment', or 'cure at end of treatment'. None of the studies reported our second outcome, severe complications of cellulitis, such as necrotizing fasciitis, severe sepsis, or multi-organ failure. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1985</LINK>, reported a death, however this was due to gastrointestinal bleeding and was unrelated to cellulitis. No studies reported our third primary outcome, quality of life.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-05-12 08:29:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>We cannot define the best treatment for cellulitis and most recommendations are made on single trials.</P>
<P>Some groups suggest using combinations of intravenous benzyl penicillin and intravenous flucloxacillin to ensure that the treatment is suitable for the majority with <I>Streptococcus</I> as the causal bacterial agent, and the largest minority with <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (<LINK REF="REF-British-Lymphology-Society-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Lymphology Society 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CREST-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CREST 2005</LINK>; ;<LINK REF="REF-Eron-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eron 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Royal-Pharmaceutical-Society-of-Great-Britain-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain 2007</LINK>). However, one included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Leman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leman 2005</LINK>) demonstrated that the addition of benzyl penicillin to flucloxacillin did not increase efficacy, perhaps indicating that flucloxacillin could be given alone. For penicillin-allergic participants the usual recommended alternatives are erythromycin or clindamycin. There are no studies on the latter and only one study on the former (<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-1991-part-1" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 1991 part 1</LINK>), which showed no difference between oral azithromycin and oral erythromycin.</P>
<P>In three studies of complicated skin infections, researchers used long courses of newer broad-spectrum antibiotics, employing high intravenous doses. Clinicians would be unlikely to use these in simple, community-acquired cellulitis. This again makes it difficult to assess the 'best treatment' for cellulitis. Only one study focused on participants suspected of having MRSA (<LINK REF="STD-Weigelt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weigelt 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is little evidence supporting any particular duration of treatment. Opinion suggests that residual symptoms may persist due to inflammation, rather than active infection (<LINK REF="REF-Eron-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eron 2003</LINK>) and one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Hepburn-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hepburn 2004</LINK>) supported this view by showing that five days of treatment may be as effective as ten days. Also Bergkvist's study (<LINK REF="STD-Bergkvist-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bergkvist 1997</LINK>) showed that symptoms resolved more quickly in response to the anti-inflammatory agent, prednisolone, however this finding needs corroboration by further studies.</P>
<P>Few studies investigated the route of treatment. One study showed similar efficacy but greater safety for intramuscular compared to intravenous antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Zeglaoui-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeglaoui 2004</LINK>). In this review when oral antibiotics were compared with intravenous treatments, the oral treatments appeared more effective. These results are inconclusive due to the small number of studies, but merit further investigation. Only two studies compared oral macrolides against intravenous benzyl penicillin (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bernard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 2002</LINK>) and demonstrated an overall benefit for the oral therapy. This observation has been shown in other conditions, including community-acquired pneumonia in the hospital setting (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-R-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan R 1995</LINK>) and severe pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Rojas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas 2006</LINK>). For severe pneumonia in children, no difference was found between the two routes and no difference was found for neutropenic sepsis after chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Kern-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kern 1999</LINK>), nor for urinary tract infections in children (<LINK REF="REF-Hoberman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoberman 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is an increasing trend towards home treatment for cellulitis, with claims that it leads to greater satisfaction with fewer adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Corwin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corwin 2005</LINK>). Route and frequency of drug administration has a great impact on such a service. For parenteral drugs, once-a-day treatment is preferable to multiple doses and clinicians commonly use intravenous ceftriaxone as an alternative to benzyl penicillin for participants with cellulitis. However, without firm evidence in favour of intravenous therapy the need for Outpatient Parenteral Antibiotic Therapy (OPAT) has not been established.</P>
<P>One study investigated the addition of anti-inflammatory treatments. <LINK REF="STD-Bergkvist-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bergkvist 1997</LINK> showed that the addition of high-dose oral steroids shortened the length of hospital stay by one day, without an increase in side-effects. More efficacy and safety evidence would be required to adopt this as standard therapy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-05-12 08:33:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Thirty three studies investigating treatment for 'skin and skin structure infections' were excluded as they gave no separated data for the cellulitis subgroup.</P>
<P>There is no internationally agreed standard treatment for comparison. Several European guidelines for erysipelas/cellulitis or skin and skin structure infections recommend penicillin as the standard treatment, with the pathogenic organism assumed to be a <I>Streptococcal</I> infection. However, there were limited studies with penicillin as a comparator to confirm or refute this approach and there is tentative evidence that a macrolide/streptogramin antibiotic may be more effective, although probably more expensive.</P>
<P>The majority of studies were hospital-based, as a consequence these studies are likely to include people who failed to respond to treatment in the community. Only <LINK REF="STD-Giordano-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Giordano 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zeglaoui-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeglaoui 2004</LINK> specifically excluded those who had previously taken antibiotics for this episode of cellulitis.</P>
<P>Interviews demonstrate that the outcomes of interest to participants are time-to-resolution of unpleasant symptoms, such as pain (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 2007</LINK>), yet only three studies gave the rate of symptom reduction. A more common outcome was proportion cured or improved. This assessment was often timed 'at the end of treatment' or 'up to two weeks after treatment', and defined as 'reduction or absence of the original signs and symptoms'. This does not allow for discrimination between treatments that may influence duration of symptoms or length of hospital stay.</P>
<P>In many cases the organism was not isolated, in those that did, the presence of <I>Streptococcus pyogenes</I> and <I>Staphylococcus aureus </I>reported<I>. </I>This review did not investigate the effectiveness of isolation and sensitivity tests in the management of this condition. This review did not investigate the effectiveness of prophylaxis to prevent recurrent disease.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-05-10 23:02:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A low rate of included studies explained the process for concealment of allocation (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>) and no studies provided sample size calculations. A number of studies were 'open' (9/25) and this lack of blinding, in combination with a lack of objective outcome measures, could increase the risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many reports of studies with mixed populations showed subgroup data for causal organisms, but not the type of tissue involvement, for example abscess or cellulitis. Isolation rates for causal organisms were low for cellulitis infections (<LINK REF="STD-Fabian-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fabian 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Iannini-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Iannini 1985</LINK>), rarely higher than 25%, meaning that up to 75% of cellulitis participants would be excluded from some studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-02-23 12:28:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>There are a number of clinical trials that include a mixed population of people with a range of skin and skin structure infections. Unless these studies presented subgroup data for those with cellulitis we were unable to include the studies. There may be bias in the decision to show this data in reports of clinical trials. For example researchers may be more likely to show data for specific disease groups if these groups varied in their response to the treatments. It may be difficult to assess the external validity of the studies as the prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains in the community was not presented by the authors of the clinical trials.</P>

<OL>
<LI>There is limited evidence that macrolide and streptogramin are slightly better than penicillin for eliminating or reducing symptoms at the end of treatment for cellulitis.</LI>
<LI>The studies comparing a penicillin with different generations of cephalosporin did not agree and there was heterogeneity, only one study investigated a third generation cephalosporin, consequently no recommendations can be made.</LI>
<LI>There is limited evidence to indicate that oral antibiotics can be more effective than intravenous antibiotics, although this evidence is limited to two studies.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>In future trials of populations with a variety of distinguishable skin and soft tissue infections, baseline and outcome data on each of the disease group subpopulations e.g. abscess or cellulitis needs to be recorded.</LI>
<LI>In the absence of an effective method for isolating and identifying the infective agent the exclusion of culture negative participants leads to a very high postrandomisation exclusion rate.</LI>
<LI>The evidence from this review indicates that some oral antibiotics may be as effective as intravenous therapies, however, the number of trials found was small. Randomised controlled trials should be carried out comparing intravenous versus oral antibiotics such as penicillins and carbopenems for participants within a community setting, as this would have implications for delivering a more cost-effective home therapy that does not involve a home intravenous service or frequent outpatient hospital visits.</LI>

<B>Background </B>
</P>
<P>In the section 'Impact and complications of cellulitis' the following paragraph has been added as a response to recent research on the topic: '<I>However, in a population-based cohort study in which nearly 80% of cases were treated in the community, only 11% had a recurrence within 1 year</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-Simonsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis Simonsen 2006</LINK>). <I>Factors associated with recurrence have been examined using case-control </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Pavlotsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavlotsky 2004</LINK>) <I>and cohort</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Jorup_x002d_R_x00f6_nstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorup-Rönström 1987</LINK>) <I>designs and identified factors included venous insufficiency </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Jorup_x002d_R_x00f6_nstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorup-Rönström 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pavlotsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavlotsky 2004</LINK>;) <I>and obesity, lymphoedema, smoking, tinea pedis, and local injury</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Pavlotsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavlotsky 2004</LINK>)'.</P>
<P>To reflect the guidelines published since we originally wrote the protocol, in the section 'Guidelines' we deleted the text: '<I>As far as these authors are aware there is only one published guideline for cellulitis or erysipelas that uses a systematic approach. This guideline was produced by the Société Française de Dermatologie (Soc. Fr. Derm. 2001)'. </I>We then<I> </I>added:<I> 'There are a few published guidelines for cellulitis </I>(<LINK REF="REF-British-Lymphology-Society-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Lymphology Society 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CREST-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CREST 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eron-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eron 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Societe-Francaise-de-Dermatologie-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Societe Francaise de Dermatologie 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2005</LINK>). <I>Due to the paucity of relevant research, recommendations from these guidelines are mostly based on evidence extrapolated from studies of other infections or based on expert opinion</I>.'</P>
<P>
<B>Methods </B>
</P>
<P>We amended the 'Types of outcome measures section'. We had initially stated:</P>
<P>'<I>Symptoms rated by </I>participant<I> or medical practitioner, e.g. duration and intensity of fever, pain, redness of the affected area, swelling of the skin surface and subcutaneous tissue, blister formation.</I>' </P>
<P>Studies seldom listed duration of symptoms, a more widely used outcome was proportion symptom-free, or with reduced symptoms. We therefore added the following text to examples '<I>or proportion symptom-free ('cure'), at a time specified by the study authors'.</I>
</P>
<P>In the search section we have deleted:</P>
<P>
<I>'(3) UNPUBLISHED LITERATURE<BR/>Authors of primary studies and companies involved with the development of drugs used for treating cellulitis will be contacted in an attempt to locate data of unpublished trials data and the relevant data extracted.</I>
</P>
<P>(<I>4) CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS<BR/>Major dermatological conference proceedings and poster abstracts over the last 5 years will be handsearched for further RCTs.'</I>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>The number of organisations involved in antibiotic production is very wide, and any of which may be conducting trials on cellulitis. We therefore amended our search strategy to include a more in depth look at registers of ongoing trials.</P>
<P>We originally stated that we would display the results as:</P>
<P>
<I>'odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI with for continuous outcomes.</I>
</P>
<P>However, as the outcome was relatively common the results are expressed as risk ratio in accordance with guidance given by the Cochrane Skin Group editorial base and the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(See Handbook section 9.2.2.3).</P>
<P>We amended the text from our original protocol with regard to risk of bias to follow current guidelines in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>.</P>

Flucloxacillin alone or combined with benzylpenicillin to treat lower limb cellulitis: a randomised controlled trial. Emerg-Med-J. 2005; 22(5):342-6. ISSN: 1472-0213.&lt;br&gt;Reprint: In file , in file&lt;br&gt;Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether using intravenous benzylpenicillin in addition to intravenous flucloxacillin would result in a more rapid clinical response in patients with lower limb cellulitis. METHODS: This was a randomised controlled trial set in an inner city teaching hospital, comprising 81 patients with lower limb cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics. The main outcome measure was the mean number of doses of antibiotic required until clinical response. RESULTS: The mean number of doses required was 8.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.09 to 9.86) in the benzylpenicillin and flucloxacillin combined group. In the flucloxacillin only group it was 8.71 doses (95% CI 6.90 to 10.5), a mean difference of -0.24 doses (95% CI -2.48 to 2.01, p = 0.83). Other markers of treatment efficacy showed no difference between groups at review the following day; temperature decrease (mean difference -0.07 degrees C, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.62, p = 0.84), or diameter decrease of affected area (mean difference -34 mm, 95% CI -99 to 31, p = 0.30). Patient subjective assessments were also similar between the different drug regimen; improvement on a visual analogue scale of pain/discomfort from admission to first review (mean difference 10 mm, 95% CI -12.6 to 14.2, p = 0.91) and on second review (mean difference 15 mm, 95% CI -18.6 to 21.6, p = 0.88). Patient overall subjective feelings of improvement on first review (p = 0.32) and on second review (p = 0.64) were also similar. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides no evidence to support the addition of intravenous benzylpenicillin to intravenous flucloxacillin in the treatment of lower limb cellulitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2010-05-10 16:37:19 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Laura " PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
