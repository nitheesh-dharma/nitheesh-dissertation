<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is self-help group, organised through an international organization of recovering alcoholics, that offers emotional support and a model of abstinence for people recovering from alcohol dependence using a 12-step approach.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>As well as AA, there are also alternative interventions based on 12-step type programmes, some self-help and some professionally-led. AA and other 12-step approaches are typically based on the assumption that substance dependence is a spiritual and a medical disease. The available experimental studies did not demonstrate the effectiveness of AA or other 12-step approaches in reducing alcohol use and achieving abstinence compared with other treatments, but there were some limitations with these studies. Furthermore, many different interventions were often compared in the same study and too many hypotheses were tested at the same time to identify factors which determine treatment success. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international organization of recovering alcoholics that offers emotional support through self-help groups and a model of abstinence for people recovering from alcohol dependence, using a 12-step approach. Although it is the most common, AA is not the only 12-step intervention available there are other 12-step approaches (labelled Twelve Step Facilitation (TSF)). </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of AA or TSF programmes compared to other psychosocial interventions in reducing alcohol intake, achieving abstinence, maintaining abstinence, improving the quality of life of affected people and their families, and reducing alcohol associated accidents and health problems.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Specialized Register of Trials of the Cochrane Group on Drugs and Alcohol, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE from 1966, EMBASE from 1980, CINAHL from 1982, PsychINFO from 1967. Searches were updated in February 2005. We also inspected lists of references for relevant studies.</P>

<P>Studies involving adults (&gt;18) of both genders with alcohol dependence attending on a voluntary or coerced basis AA or TSF programmes comparing no treatment, other psychological interventions, 12-step variants.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>One reviewer (MF) assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data using a pre-defined data extraction form. Studies were evaluated for methodological quality and discussed by all reviewers. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eight trials involving 3417 people were included. AA may help patients to accept treatment and keep patients in treatment more than alternative treatments, though the evidence for this is from one small study that combined AA with other interventions and should not be regarded as conclusive. Other studies reported similar retention rates regardless of treatment group. Three studies compared AA combined with other interventions against other treatments and found few differences in the amount of drinks and percentage of drinking days. Severity of addiction and drinking consequence did not seem to be differentially influenced by TSF versus comparison treatment interventions, and no conclusive differences in treatment drop out rates were reported. Included studies did not allow a conclusive assessment of the effect of TSF in promoting complete abstinence. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>No experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA or TSF approaches for reducing alcohol dependence or problems. One large study focused on the prognostic factors associated with interventions that were assumed to be successful rather than on the effectiveness of interventions themselves, so more efficacy studies are needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-10 11:43:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Alcohol consumption is rising in many developing countries and in Central and Eastern Europe (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). Alcohol's abuse significantly contributes to the global burden of disease and in parts of Central and Eastern Europe alcohol abuse has been linked to an unprecedented decline in male life expectancy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). On average, alcohol dependence one-year prevalence is around 7% and its life-time prevalence rates are 14% in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Regier-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regier 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1994</LINK>). Alcohol dependence (also called alcoholism) is a condition that involves four main symptoms: craving (a strong need to drink); uncontrolled behaviour (after the first drink it is impossible to stop); physical dependence (if one does not drink enough then withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, sweating, shakiness and anxiety occur); and tolerance (the need to increase the amount of alcohol intake to feel satisfied) (<LINK REF="REF-NIAA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIAA 2003</LINK>). Substance dependence is defined (<LINK REF="REF-DSMIV-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSMIV 1994</LINK>) as a "cluster of cognitive, behavioural, and physiological symptoms indicating that the individual continues using a substance despite significant substance-related problems". Dependence on alcohol is characterised by tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. Tolerance is a progressive reduction in the susceptibility to the effects of a substance, resulting from its continued administration. It is present when a person must use an increasing quantity of a given substance, to achieve the same perceived effect as time passes (<LINK REF="REF-Gitlow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlow 2001</LINK>). Tolerance is also experienced when the person notices a decreased sensation with similar doses of a substance over time. Tolerance can be measured objectively, for example when a person with high blood alcohol level can still perform given perceptual and motor tasks such as walking in a straight line. Withdrawal symptoms are physiological and psychological symptoms associated with withdrawal from a substance after prolonged administration or habituation. Withdrawal is present when a characteristic physiological pattern associated with a certain substance is experienced, or when the person uses the substance to avoid or reduce specific symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Gitlow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlow 2001</LINK>). People compulsively using alcohol may devote substantial time to obtain and consume alcoholic beverages and continue to use alcohol even if they experience severe psychological and physical consequences such as depression, blackouts, liver disease or other sequelae (<LINK REF="REF-DSMIV-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSMIV 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no unique and known cause of alcohol dependence and several factors may play a role in its development: familiar and genetic factors, psychological attributes such as high anxiety, ongoing depression, unresolved conflicts within a relationship or low self-esteem, and social factors such as availability of alcohol, social acceptance and promotion of the use of alcohol, peer pressure and a demanding lifestyle (<LINK REF="REF-A.D.A.M.-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">A.D.A.M. 2002</LINK>). Risk factor studies conducted on animals suggest that genetic vulnerability to alcohol dependence is multigenic. In humans, evidence about the genetic vulnerability is typically provided by studies involving monozygotic and dizygotic adult twins, suggesting that alcohol dependence can be attributed in the ratio 2/3 to genetic factors and 1/3 to environmental factors, without gender differences (<LINK REF="REF-Heath-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heath 1997</LINK>). Alcoholic dependence syndrome is three to four times higher in the relatives of alcohol dependent people compared with the general population (<LINK REF="REF-DSMIV-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSMIV 1994</LINK>). Stress and emotional problems can also play a role in the development of alcohol abuse (<LINK REF="REF-NIAA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIAA 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Remission is spontaneous in about 20% of people with alcohol dependence, who achieve long term sobriety without active treatment (<LINK REF="REF-DSMIV-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSMIV 1994</LINK>). Gender and age do not substantially affect prognosis. Positive prognostic factors are good social functioning (employment, family relationship, absence of legal problems) and good health status. Retention in treatment for at least one month increases the likelihood of remaining abstinent for one year (<LINK REF="REF-Hales-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hales 1999</LINK>). Psychiatric comorbidity is a negative prognostic factor. </P>
<P>The health, social and economic consequences of alcohol abuse are usually devastating. Although many individuals do achieve long-term sobriety with treatment, others continue to relapse and deteriorate despite multiple courses of treatment. Alcohol dependence contributes to accidents, violent behaviours, suicide, loss of working days, work related accidents and low productivity. Mortality and morbidity are increased in people with alcohol dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Hales-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hales 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Attendance of self-help groups is often suggested to people with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. Participation in self-help organization meetings can be an adjunct to professional treatment, or a treatment in itself in particular for long periods. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international organization composed of recovering alcoholics that offers self-help group emotional support and a model of abstinence for people recovering from alcohol dependence. The practice of AA is the 12-step approach, an intervention based on the assumption that substance dependence is a spiritual and a medical disease (<LINK REF="REF-Nowinksi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowinksi 1992</LINK>). The 12-step approach consists of a brief, structured, manual-driven approach to facilitating recovery from alcohol abuse, and it is intended to be implemented over 12 to 15 sessions. In addition to AA, there are also other, alternative, interventions based on the 12-step approach: some include a spiritual approach and others do not; and some are led by a professional and others are led by former alcohol dependents. AA self-help groups are widely available and are well known in many countries. Although it is the most common, AA is not the only 12-step intervention available: in this review we have considered all 12-step approaches. However, as AA is the most widely available we have distinguished, wherever possible, those that are conventional AA self-help programmes from other 12-step approaches. The latter have been labelled Twelve Step Facilitation (TSF) in one of the most powerful studies recently conducted on this treatment (<LINK REF="STD-MATCH-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MATCH 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>A meta-analysis by Tonigan (<LINK REF="REF-Tonigan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tonigan 1995</LINK>) reported that many of the available studies were not focused on AA per se but rather on AA-inspired or AA-focused treatment and on AA involvement and outcomes within formal therapeutic interventions. The meta-analysis included 74 studies, 10 of which were randomised. The results were grouped by global study quality, a multidimensional tool considering random allocation as one of several weighting factors. Therefore it was not possible to distinguish results by study design. Another meta-analysis by Kownacki (<LINK REF="REF-Kownacki-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kownacki 1999</LINK>) identified severe selection bias in the available studies, with the randomised studies yielding worse results than non-randomised studies. This meta-analysis is weakened by the heterogeneity of patients and interventions that are pooled together. <LINK REF="REF-Emrick-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emrick 1989</LINK> performed a narrative review of studies about characteristics of alcohol-dependent individuals who affiliate with AA and concluded that the effectiveness of AA as compared to other treatments for alcoholism was not clear and therefore needed to be demonstrated. </P>
<P>This systematic review updates previous reviews and meta-analyses and also incorporates the results from Project MATCH<LINK REF="REF-MATCH-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">MATCH 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MATCH-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">MATCH 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MATCH-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">MATCH 1998b</LINK>), a large randomised controlled trial conducted in the United States in the late 90's with the aim of identifying the predictors of success in different non-pharmacological interventions for alcohol dependence. </P>

<P>
<B>Assessment of the methodological quality of Randomised Controlled Studies</B>
<BR/>Quality assessment was performed by one reviewer (MF) and discussed with other reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Study quality was assessed according to the latest quality criteria from the Drugs and Alcohol Editorial Group (see the module of the group (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2005</LINK>). The randomisation procedures are described below to indicate the types of procedures accepted (from the best to the worst) and to explain what we mean by allocation concealment and follow-up. </P>

<P>
<B>Assessment of the methodological quality of Observational Studies with a Control Group</B>
<BR/>For observational controlled studies it was decided at protocol stage that quality would be assessed against the scales developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>The quality evaluation was not used as a criteria for exclusion and inclusion but the findings are described and discussed below.</P>

<P>
<B>Statistical analysis</B>
<BR/>If possible, we calculated relative risks with Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). The types of intervention considered here involve heterogeneity due to social context, political organization (for instance in the legal consequences of dependence related problems, access to social services etc.) (<LINK REF="REF-Ferri-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferri 2006</LINK>); therefore the random-effects model was chosen. </P>
<P>Considering the varieties of approaches delivered under the name of Twelve-Steps, we decided at protocol stage to perform separate analyses basing on the characteristics of the interventions, for example: the standardized procedures for the conduct of groups; the spiritual approach, the professionally led groups; and the former alcoholic led groups. Other subgroups may be identified as the review is updated and reasons for separate analysis will be justified. </P>
<P>In fact, the heterogeneity of studies (interventions, patients, settings and outcomes measured) prevented a formal meta-analysis and therefore the results are described narratively in the results section.</P>

<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2002</LINK>) studied participants who had completed an inpatient detoxification treatment; another study (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2002</LINK>) studied participants who had applied for outpatient rehabilitation without passing through in-patient treatment. Project MATCH and its sub-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Cloud-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cloud 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MATCH-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MATCH 1998</LINK>) studied either participants in outpatient therapy or participants in aftercare.

Two studies compared TSF with Motivational Enhancement Therapy and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (MATCH 1998) and Relapse Prevention Therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2002</LINK>); and one study investigated the relationship between helping others and being involved in TSF (<LINK REF="STD-Zemore-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zemore 2004</LINK>).

<B>Outcomes</B>
<BR/>The majority of the studies considered outcomes about drinking behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cloud-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cloud 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahler-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kahler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MATCH-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MATCH 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCrady-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McCrady 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zemore-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zemore 2004</LINK>). The MATCH study was designed to test a series of a priori hypotheses on how patient-treatment interactions relate to outcome. Two independent but parallel matching studies have been conducted, one with clients recruited from outpatient settings, the other with participants receiving aftercare treatment following inpatient care. Several publications (<LINK REF="STD-MATCH-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MATCH 1998</LINK>) derived from the study and each of them investigate different associations, overall 504 hypotheses were tested on these data (<LINK REF="REF-Moyer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyer 2001</LINK>). Among the publications derived from MATCH data we identified, one article reported measuring drinking outcomes (in terms of Percent Days Abstinent and Drinks per Drinking Days) at 12-weeks during treatment; another publication measured the same outcomes at one year post-treatment. A third publication studied only the outpatient arms at three year follow-up, looking for association of participants characteristics with successful treatment. The most recent publication (<LINK REF="REF-Cutler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutler 2005</LINK>) looked for associations between treatment outcome and treatment quantity (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>: studies by intervention and outcomes).</P>

Coherently, the amount of drinks per drinking days is lower for TSF and CBT compared with MET (drink reduction is reported as a graph and calculated with hierarchical linear modelling). In the aftercare arm (N = 774) the same pattern is showed during 1 to 12 weeks treatment, with the percentage of days abstinent reduced for the three groups and drinks per drinking days increased for the three groups. At year one (15 months after treatment onset) in both outpatient and aftercare arms there was an improvement in terms of drinking reduction from baseline.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-04-10 11:37:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, severity of addiction does not seem to be differentially influenced by the interventions from studies included in this review. TSF improved scores in drinking consequences in the same way as other comparison treatments, though regression to the mean cannot be discounted as a factor. Similarly, there is no conclusive evidence from a number of different studies to show that AA helps patients to accept therapy and keep patients in therapy any more or less than other interventions. Similarly, there was no evidence that other TSF interventions impacted the number remaining in treatment any more or less than relapse prevention treatment.</P>
<P>In terms of reduction of self-reported drinking measures, this review shows that TSF helps to reduce alcohol consumption similarly to other comparison interventions, though without a no treatment control group conclusions are limited. Two studies comparing TSF to other interventions showed a similar reduction in alcohol consumption in all groups. It was not clear whether AA specifically helps people to reduce drinking during treatment and at follow up compared with other interventions. Three studies comparing AA in different conditions with other interventions found few differences between interventions in reducing amount of drinks and percentage of drinking days.</P>
<P>Although one small study reported AA had better abstinence outcomes than a comparison treatment, there is no conclusive evidence to show that AA can help patients to achieve abstinence, nor is there any conclusive evidence to show that it cannot. Most studies included in this review did not allow assessment of the effectiveness of TSF in promoting complete abstinence.</P>
<P>12-step and AA programmes for alcohol problems are promoted worldwide. Yet experimental studies have on the whole failed to demonstrate their effectiveness in reducing alcohol dependence or drinking problems when compared to other interventions. Even with the notable contribution from the USA National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) in terms of funding, resources and researchers for the MATCH study (<LINK REF="STD-MATCH-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MATCH 1998</LINK>), and then in giving free access to the Match data to allow further analysis, no conclusive results have been obtained about superiority of one treatment over the other included studied (<LINK REF="REF-Cutler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutler 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general, the available research seems to be concentrated on prognostic factors associated with assumedly successful treatments rather than on the effectiveness of treatments in themselves. Moreover, further attention should be devoted to quality of life outcomes for patients and their families and it is possible that a well designed qualitative study could identify hypotheses for further research</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>People considering attending AA or TSF programmes should be made aware that there is a lack of experimental evidence on the effectiveness of such programmes. It should also be underlined that in the available studies all the interventions appeared to improve at least some of the outcomes considered. Policy makers and health care professionals need to consider the options they provide and the advice they give in this regard. The active collaboration of patients or clients should perhaps be sought to identify the best intervention for that specific person. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further large-scale studies comparing just one AA or TSF intervention with a control should be undertaken to test the efficacy of that intervention over longer follow-up periods. </P>
<P>Further attention should be devoted to quality of life outcomes for patients and their families and it is possible that a well designed qualitative study could identify hypotheses for further research.</P>
