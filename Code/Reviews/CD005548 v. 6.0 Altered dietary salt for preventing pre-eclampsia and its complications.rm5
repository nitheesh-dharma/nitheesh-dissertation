<P>Low salt intake in pregnancy is unlikely to prevent pre-eclampsia.</P>
<P>Pre-eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy associated with poor health, or even death, for the mother and baby. Pre-eclampsia is identified by raised blood pressure and protein in the urine during the second half of pregnancy. In the past, a low-salt diet was often recommended, in the belief that it would help to prevent pre-eclampsia. However, the review found just two trials that did not show any evidence of benefit for the mother or baby. Salt intake in pregnancy should be a matter of personal preference.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-10-27 11:59:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>In the past, women have been advised that lowering their salt intake might reduce their risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Although this practice has largely ceased, it remains important to assess the evidence about possible effects of altered dietary salt intake during pregnancy.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of altered dietary salt during pregnancy on the risk of developing pre-eclampsia and its complications.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-10-27 11:59:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (8 April 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2005), and EMBASE (2002 to May 2005). We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 1 October 2009 and added the results to the awaiting classification section.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials evaluating either reduced or increased dietary salt intake during pregnancy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors selected trials for inclusion and extracted data independently. Data were entered on Review Manager software for analysis, and double-checked for accuracy.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two trials were included, with 603 women. Both compared advice to reduce dietary salt intake with advice to continue a normal diet. The confidence intervals were wide and crossed the no-effect line for all the reported outcomes, including pre-eclampsia (relative risk 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 2.66). In other words, there was insufficient evidence for reliable conclusions about the effects of advice to reduce dietary salt. </P>

<P>In the absence of evidence that advice to alter salt intake during pregnancy has any beneficial effect for prevention of pre-eclampsia or any other outcome, salt consumption during pregnancy should remain a matter of personal preference.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-28 09:52:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-24 19:32:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypertension (high blood pressure) is common during pregnancy. Around 10% of women will have raised blood pressure at some point before delivery. The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy comprise a spectrum of conditions that is usually classified into four categories: (1) gestational hypertension: a rise in blood pressure during the second half of pregnancy; (2) pre-eclampsia: usually hypertension with proteinuria (protein in urine) during the second half of pregnancy; (3) chronic hypertension: a rise in blood pressure before pregnancy or before 20 weeks' gestation; and (4) pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-NHBPEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEP 2000</LINK>). For women who have hypertension alone but do not develop proteinuria, pregnancy outcome is similar to that for women with normal blood pressure. Outcome deteriorates once pre-eclampsia develops. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder that affects 2% to 8% of pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>). Complications of pre-eclampsia are associated with a substantive increase in morbidity and mortality for both the woman and her baby (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2002</LINK>). Pre-eclampsia is discussed in more detail in the generic protocol of interventions for prevention of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Generic-Protocol-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Generic Protocol 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the early part of the twentieth century, a low-salt diet was often recommended as treatment for oedema in both pregnant and non-pregnant people. At that time oedema was included in the definition of pre-eclampsia, although it is now recognised to be part of normal pregnancy as it affects 80% of pregnant women. This led to the idea that restricting salt intake might treat, and also prevent, pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1989</LINK>). By the 1940s, a low-salt diet was widely recommended during pregnancy, particularly for women with pre-eclampsia. In the late 1950s and early 1960s this practice began to be questioned, and it was even suggested that high-salt intake might prevent or treat pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="STD-UK-1958" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-1961" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1961</LINK>). Subsequently, interest in salt consumption during pregnancy has largely faded away.</P>
<P>In most parts of the world, women are no longer advised by clinicians to alter their salt intake during pregnancy. A notable exception is in the Netherlands where, until relatively recently, this practice remained widespread. Nevertheless, some lay literature aimed at pregnant women continues to advocate salt restriction during pregnancy. </P>
<P>Salt is a widely used flavour enhancer. Women who like adding salt in their food may find a low-salt diet unpalatable. This may be particularly relevant during the first half of pregnancy when nausea and vomiting is common, and taste can also be altered. Low-salt foods can also be less convenient and more expensive than salted alternatives. Women should not be advised to alter their dietary salt during pregnancy unless there is reasonable evidence of benefit.</P>
<P>This review aims to summarise the evidence about the effects of advice to alter dietary salt intake during pregnancy for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences. The methods are described in full in the generic protocol of interventions for prevention of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Generic-Protocol-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Generic Protocol 2005</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The main objective was to assess the effects of altered dietary salt on the risk of developing pre-eclampsia and its complications.</P>
<P>If altered salt intake is effective, a secondary objective was to compare the effects of one form of alteration with another, such as restricted salt intake with increased salt intake, and to compare the effects of altered salt intake with other measures for prevention of pre-eclampsia.</P>

<P>Randomised trials evaluating altered salt intake during pregnancy were included. </P>
<P>Studies with a quasi-random design, such as allocation by alternation or day of week, were excluded as inadequate concealment of the allocation may have introduced bias.

</OL>
<P>The generic protocol states that studies should also be excluded if there is more than 10% difference in loss of participants between groups. This is reasonable as a large difference in exclusions between two groups results in the loss of balance created by randomisation, and increases the chance of bias. However, we could not apply this criterion to our review as this would have led to the exclusion of a large study (<LINK REF="STD-Netherlands-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Netherlands 1997</LINK>) which is of better quality than most other available data. At present, there is a paucity of data, so we have decided to include this study. In future updates, if further large good quality studies become available, we will consider excluding this study.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-10-28 09:52:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>Two trials involving 603 women were included. Both were multicentre studies conducted in The Netherlands, in hospital clinics and midwifery practices. Both trials included women who were healthy and nulliparous. In one study all women were normotensive, in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Netherlands-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Netherlands 1998</LINK>) women had a diastolic blood pressure 85 mmHg, or more, at trial entry. Both studies compared advice to restrict dietary salt (to 20 or 50 mmol/day) with advice to continue a normal diet. Compliance was assessed by checking urinary sodium excretion. Although this was higher than the target level for the low sodium group, sodium excretion was still lower than for the normal diet group. (One report from an updated search in October 2009 has been added to <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>.)</P>
<P>Definitions used in trials were similar to those specified for this review, although the definition of hypertension was not clear in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Netherlands-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Netherlands 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six studies were excluded (2992 women). Three of these evaluated a high-salt diet, but used a quasi-randomised design (<LINK REF="STD-UK-1958" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-1961" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-USA-1961" TYPE="STUDY">USA 1961</LINK>). In addition, for two of these the participants had established pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="STD-UK-1961" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-USA-1961" TYPE="STUDY">USA 1961</LINK>). The other three studies were excluded because they did not report clinically relevant outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Australia-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Australia 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Australia-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Australia 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belgium-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Belgium 1986</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Follow up</HEADING>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Netherlands-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Netherlands 1998</LINK>), there was complete follow up for all women. In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Netherlands-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Netherlands 1997</LINK>), 10% of women were excluded from the analyses. There was a substantial difference in the number of excluded participants between the two arms (23 women in the low-salt arm and five in the normal diet arm). The proportion was higher in the low-salt group as 17 women (13% of women in the low-salt arm) did not want to use the recommended diet.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Blinding of participants was not possible. In one study, the caregiver was blinded to urinary sodium concentration measurements. As blinding of outcome assessment was not reported in either study, it is unlikely to have been done.</P>

</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The two trials (603 women) compared advice to restrict dietary salt with advice to continue a normal diet. Confidence intervals for all the outcomes reported in this review were wide, and crossed the no-effect line. For example, the relative risk for pre-eclampsia was 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 2.66. This means that the true effect could be anything from over a halving in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with salt restriction to a more than doubling.</P>
<P>No included trials evaluated a high-salt diet for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of altered dietary salt intake for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. The two trials included in this review evaluated advice to restrict dietary salt. In both, women appear to have taken this advice, as urinary sodium excretion was reduced in the low-salt group. However, even when taken together, these trials were too small to provide reliable information about the effects of advice to restrict salt intake during normal pregnancy. </P>
<P>Women's preferences were not reported. However, in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Netherlands-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Netherlands 1997</LINK>) 13% of women in the salt restriction arm withdrew, as they did not want to follow the diet. In the other study only 24% of women successfully reduced their urinary sodium excretion to below the target level. One possible explanation for this is that women who are not used to a low salt diet may not find it palatable. </P>
<P>No included trials evaluated a high-salt diet. One excluded study did evaluate a high-salt diet for prevention of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="STD-UK-1958" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1958</LINK>). In this quasi-random study involving 2077 women the relative risk for pre-eclampsia was 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.75), a reduction that appeared to be reflected in fewer complications (<LINK REF="STD-UK-1958" TYPE="STUDY">UK 1958</LINK>). In view of the methodological limitations of this study it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions, beyond saying that it seems unlikely that a high-salt diet will increase the risk of pre-eclampsia.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-27 12:03:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>A low-salt diet is often unpalatable. In the absence of evidence that advice to alter salt intake during pregnancy has any beneficial effect for prevention of pre-eclampsia or for any other outcome, salt consumption during pregnancy should remain a matter of personal preference.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-10-27 12:03:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>Salt restriction during pregnancy does not seem promising for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. Very large numbers of women would need to be randomised to detect a moderate to small effect. Such trials might be justified in the context of a setting where this form of dietary advice was already widespread practice, but they would be difficult to justify elsewhere. Unless new and plausible hypotheses emerge, further trials of salt intake are unlikely to be a priority.</P>
