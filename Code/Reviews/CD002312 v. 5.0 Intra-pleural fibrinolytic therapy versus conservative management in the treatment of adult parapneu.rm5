The Key question at the heart of the update is why Maskell is different from the other studies. Many reasons are possible (publication bias, blinding, differences in patients and treatments) and there is no way of being sure why the difference is present. I think in view of this a more cautious approach to the conclusions and implications is needed. &lt;br&gt;I have made changes (mainly to the conclusions) in the light of the peer review feedback. Please have a look at the revised version.&lt;br&gt;Thanks for all the work on this update.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;PS Spellchecked for this version&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;CJC Nov 5&lt;br&gt;Toby,&lt;br&gt;Thanks for amending the synopsis. This is ready for peer review. &lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Oct 29&lt;br&gt;Thanks for making these amendments. I think the new version is reads better but I have adjusted the wording for the adverse events, as a good safety profile is too subjective in view of the new Maskell data. The confidence interval is wide and cannot exclude a five fold increase in adverse events in the Maskell study. I have added this to the end of the abstract and altered the conclusions at the end so these match the abstract too. I have also modified what's new slightly. &amp;quot;(3 additional RCTs included in review (Diacon 2004, Maskell 2005, Misthos 2005) and background &amp;amp; discussion updated. The Maskell study is a large multi centre study which is less favourable to fibrinolytic therapy than the smaller studies, but the reasons for this discrepancy are uncertain as there are many potential explanations for this finding.)&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Toby can you check that Rob is happy with this. I think this must be called a substantive update in view of the issues raised by the large new study.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC&lt;br&gt;Date: 2007 10 15&lt;br&gt;Authors' Contribution&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Fine&lt;br&gt;What's new&lt;br&gt;ACTION: very helpful summary. Thanks&lt;br&gt;Objectives&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Fine&lt;br&gt;References&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Fine&lt;br&gt;Table of included studies&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Fine&lt;br&gt;Metaview Labels&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Fine&lt;br&gt;Synopsis&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Clear but I have removed the sentence about the effect being unknown as I think this will confuse readers. &amp;quot;It is less clear whether this increased drainage makes a significant difference to the clinical endpoints of death rate or the need for an additional surgical operation to clear the pleural space. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;ACTION: I have a problem with the subgroup interpretation as it is heavily dependent on missing data from the large negative Maskell study. What makes this study different from the others? Was follow-up longer. I have left this in red for reconsideration (and see results below).&lt;br&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Fine&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;ACTION: At present this may be misleading because Maskell is missing from the subgroup comparison except for the overall failure rate. This needs at least explaining within the results. Could the authors provide the missing data? As far as I can see there is no test showing a significant difference in overall failure rate between loculated studies and non-loculated studies. Without this the conclusion of better effects in loculated studies is not substantiated.&lt;br&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Brings out some of the areas above. Helpful.&lt;br&gt;Contentious issues&lt;br&gt;ACTION: In the end the post-hoc question is why Maskall is different from the other studies. The problem is that there are a host of possible reasons and we cannot know for sure. I think we just have to report that there is one large negative study and several smaller postive ones (with inevitable uncertainty about why this might be)?&lt;br&gt;Spellchecked&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Back to authors please Toby.&lt;br&gt;Next action: I look forward to the authors' responses to my feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old title: Intra-pleural fibrinolytic therapy versus conservative management in the treatment of adult parapneumonic effusions and empyema&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-04-01 14:45:53 +0200" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Paolo Rosati" REVIEW_NO="FIB-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.18" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="5.0">

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Intra-pleural fibrinolytic therapy versus conservative management in the treatment of adult parapneumonic effusions and empyema</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Infected purulent pleural effusions (empyema) with isolated collections (loculations) of fluid or pus (complicated parapneumonic effusions) may develop with pneumonia. Drainage of this infected fluid via an intercostal catheter is important in healing. Evidence from seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 761 participants indicates that flushing the pleural space with a fibrinolytic agent such as streptokinase or urokinase may help to break down the fibrinous bands or loculations that prevent total drainage of infected pleural fluid and therefore may significantly increase the amount of pus drained. Meta-analysis of these RCTs indicates that intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy confers a benefit in reducing the requirement for surgical intervention for patients in some studies but not in others . The safety profile of intrapleural fibrinolytics remains uncertain. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Pleural effusions and empyema may complicate lower respiratory tract infections. Treatment of these collections of pus includes surgical drainage and the use of intra-pleural fibrinolysis to break down fibrin bands that may cause loculation. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To conduct a systematic review of the benefit of adding intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy to intercostal tube drainage in the treatment of complicated para pneumonic effusions and empyema to reduce mortality or the need for subsequent surgical debridement of the pleural space.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Trial authors were contacted for further information and details regarding the possibility of unpublished trials was requested. The most recent search was conducted in November 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All studies in the review were Randomised Controlled Trials in adult patients with post-pneumonic empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusions who had not had prior surgical intervention or trauma. The intervention was an intrapleural fibrinolytic agent (streptokinase or urokinase) via an intercostal chest drain (ICD) versus control, or a comparison of the two agents.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data . Study authors were contacted for further information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven studies met the eligibility criteria of the review, recruiting 761 participants. The only consistent end points in all trials were treatment failure, as gauged by the requirement for additional intervention including surgery or death. In studies where patients had either loculation and empyema, there was no significant difference in the risk of death with fibrinolytics (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.68). When treatment failure was considered as surgical intervention, fibrinolytics reduced the risk of this outcome (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85), but there is discordance between earlier positive studies and the more recent negative study by Maskell.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy confers significant benefit in reducing the requirement for surgical intervention for patients in the early studies included in this review but not in the more recently published Maskell study. The reasons for this difference are uncertain. Separate subgroup analysis of proven loculated/septated effusions from the available data in our meta-analysis suggests a potential overall treatment benefit with fibrinolytics, but these results should be treated with caution as the data are incomplete and the benefit is not significant in the subgroup of high quality trials (Cochrane Grade A). Intrapleural fibrinolytics have not been shown to significantly increase adverse events, but the confidence interval is too wide to firmly exclude this possibility.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-31 17:43:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>A parapneumonic effusion, resulting from pneumonia in up to 57% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Sahn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahn 1993</LINK>), may constitute an incidental, non-significant finding or become large and persistent. These effusions, which may arise from a variety of infections, have been classified according to their size, biochemical and microbiological properties and the presence of fibrinous loculations - <I>Light's criteria</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Light-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Light-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 1998</LINK>). For the purposes of this review, a complicated parapneumonic effusion may be defined as having pH &lt; 7.2, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; 1000 units, glucose &lt; 40 mg/dl or &lt; 25% blood glucose, gram stain or culture positive and with loculations or septations proven on either computerised tomography (CT) or ultrasound (US) scan. An empyema may be simple, i.e. with free flowing pus, or loculated (complicated parapneumonic effusion). A previous meta-analysis of tests confirming the diagnosis of parapneumonic effusions has found that pH has the highest diagnostic accuracy, followed by glucose, then LDH (<LINK REF="REF-Heffner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heffner 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The benefit of draining large plural effusions and empyema has been recognised since the time of Hippocrates (<LINK REF="REF-Hippocrates" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hippocrates</LINK>). However, it has been realised that the presence of loculations may impede the free drainage of effusions and prevent lung re-expansion. There are several therapeutic choices (<LINK REF="REF-Light-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 1998</LINK>). Non-surgical treatment options to reduce the impact of adhesions and loculae, in addition to appropriate antibiotic therapy, include single and multiple thoracocenteses, or single and multiple intercostal tube thoracostomies or both, with or without intrapleural fibrinolytic agents. Surgical options include direct-vision and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) adhesiolysis, limited and full thoracotomy with adhesiolysis, and possible decortication for severe pleural thickening</P>
<P>The formation of parapneumonic effusions can be divided into three stages (<LINK REF="REF-Light-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sahn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahn 1993</LINK>). The first, or exudative phase, is characterised by a small sterile exudate secondary to increased permeability of the visceral pleura. The fibro-purulent phase arises from infection of this exudate by the initial invading organism. During this stage, fibrin is deposited over the visceral and parietal pleura, with a tendency to loculation and adhesion. Pleural fluid glucose and pH fall and LDH rises. The organisation stage occurs with the growth of fibroblasts into the exudate to form an inelastic pleural peel. Empyema, with the formation of frank pus, may arise from a parapneumonic effusion, but 25% of empyemata may occur after trauma or post surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Light-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 1985</LINK>). The rapidity and extent of this process may be affected by the type and virulence of the organism (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been demonstrated that exudative pleuritis disrupts the turnover of fibrin within the pleural space, favouring an increase in pro-coagulant and a decrease in fibrinolytic activity with a propensity to fibrin deposition (<LINK REF="REF-Idell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idell 1991</LINK>). Using artificially induced pleural exudates in rabbits this process has been shown to begin early after bacterial infection (<LINK REF="REF-Strange-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strange 1993</LINK>). Early intervention with fibrinolysis <I>may</I> avoid the complications of adhesion and loculation. The same animal model suggests that, although the degree of these complications is reduced by streptokinase, the residual formation of fibrous adhesions remains likely.</P>
<P>Although there are arguments for the treatment of complicated parapneumonic effusions with antibiotics alone, with or without intercostal chest-tube drainage (ICD) (<LINK REF="REF-Lemmer-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemmer 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berger-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1990</LINK>), it is now generally accepted that clearance of loculations is the cornerstone of successful therapy. Chemical fibrinolysis in the management of complex parapneumonic effusions and thoracic empyema has been employed for over 50 years, with a mixture of streptokinase/ streptodornase being used initially (<LINK REF="REF-Tillett-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tillett 1951</LINK>). Side effects due to impurities led to a decline in use, but the availability of more purified streptokinase products have led to reappraisal of this modality (<LINK REF="REF-Bergh-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergh 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fraedrich-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraedrich 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aye-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aye 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>More recently, urokinase has been successfully trialled as an intrapleural fibrinolytic (<LINK REF="REF-Moulton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moulton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Temes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temes 1996</LINK>). Intrapleural recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) has been used safely and effectively (<LINK REF="REF-Thommi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thommi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skeete-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skeete 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Idell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idell 2005</LINK>), but is considerably more costly. Deoxyribonuclease (streptodornase), as either a single agent or in combination with streptokinase (as used initially by <LINK REF="REF-Tillett-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tillett 1951</LINK>) liquefies pus more readily than streptokinase alone in vitro (<LINK REF="REF-Light-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 2000</LINK>), and sparse case reports suggest it may have a larger role to play as an intrapleural fibrinolytic (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2003</LINK>), with rTPA and DNAse being another possible combination (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2006</LINK>)</P>
<P>The results of a retrospective study led to the recommendation that all cases of complicated empyema should be treated by early surgical intervention (<LINK REF="REF-LeMense-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">LeMense 1995</LINK>) as the rate of success by tube drainage alone was very poor (11% success with tube drainage versus 93% for decortication). Early surgical intervention has also been advocated if a short trial of tube drainage (without fibrinolytic therapy) is unsuccessful (<LINK REF="REF-Pothula-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pothula 1994</LINK>). Latterly, the minimally invasive surgical technique of VATS has been employed for drainage (<LINK REF="REF-Ridley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ridley 1991</LINK>), adhesiolysis and decortication (<LINK REF="REF-Landreneau-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landreneau 1995</LINK>). A small prospective randomised controlled trial of 20 patients comparing VATS versus tube drainage (ICT) with intrapleural streptokinase (SK) suggested that VATS significantly reduced the number of days in hospital, and had a significantly higher primary treatment success rate than ICT/SK (<LINK REF="REF-Wait-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wait 1997</LINK>). A recent trial of VATS with ICT/SK versus ICT/SK or ICT alone indicated a significantly reduced length of stay in the former group versus both, and a reduced mortality, significant versus ICT but not versus ICT/SK (<LINK REF="STD-Lim-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 1999</LINK>). In spite of these positive results, there is a paucity of RCT's of conservative versus surgical management, comparing particularly surgery with fibrinolytic therapy.</P>
<P>Although large intercostal tubes (that is, 24 to 32 French) were initially held to be optimal for maximal drainage (<LINK REF="REF-Light-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 1985</LINK>), smaller pigtail catheters placed strategically under CT or US guidance (<LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kerr-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerr 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moulton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moulton 1995</LINK>) may provide adequate drainage. CT guided instillation of fibrinolytics via needle puncture into (<LINK REF="REF-Kerr-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerr 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moulton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moulton 1995</LINK>) or adjacent to (<LINK REF="REF-Ogirala-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogirala 1988</LINK>) persistent loculi may further enhance their breakdown.</P>
<P>The potential side effects of fibrinolytic therapy include local and systemic haemorrhage. A single case report suggests that a high dose of 500,000 units intrapleural streptokinase caused systemic haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Godley-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Godley 1984</LINK>), and pleural haemorrhage has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Temes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temes 1996</LINK>). A study that specifically addressed this issue with intrapleural SK to a total of 1.5 million units concluded that it did not cause significant activation of systemic fibrinolysis in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1998</LINK>). Urokinase at 1.75 million units total dose similarly did not give rise to side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Moulton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moulton 1995</LINK>). Urokinase administered intrapleurally to coagulopathic patients has not caused systemic complications (<LINK REF="REF-Idell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idell 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Streptokinase is antigenic, with post-dose fevers and chest wall pain described (<LINK REF="REF-Aye-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aye 1991</LINK>). The intrapleural SK results in the elevation of the serum anti-streptokinase antibody level. An increased pretreatment anti-streptokinase antibody level does not appear to reduce the efficacy of intrapleural fibrinolysis but can cause an elevation of body temperature after SK is administered (<LINK REF="REF-Laisaar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laisaar 2003</LINK>). Severe anaphylactic reactions post-intrapleural administration have not been reported. Urokinase by contrast is non-antigenic. Bronchopleural fistula formation has resulted from SK therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Jerjes_x002d_Sanchez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jerjes-Sanchez 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chin 1997</LINK>), but administration of UK two to eight days post- resolution of bronchopleural fistulae in five patients did not lead to their re-formation (<LINK REF="REF-Moulton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moulton 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>To date, six randomised controlled trials to compare either streptokinase or urokinase with more conservative management (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bouros-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bouros 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuncozgur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuncozgur 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diacon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Diacon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Misthos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misthos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK>), and one to compare SK with UK (<LINK REF="STD-Bouros-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bouros 1997</LINK>) have been published. These trials raise the issues of effectiveness of therapy and the endpoints by which this is judged, clinically and radiologically. The issues of side effects and cost are also pertinent to these studies. This review updates a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2004</LINK>). </P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Bouros-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bouros 1999</LINK>) had a treatment algorithm where all patients who failed conservative treatment were given fibrinolysis before consideration for surgery. Referral for fibrinolysis in this group was therefore considered a treatment failure.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY MODIFIED="2008-07-31 17:07:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>In all studies, all other endpoints are either secondary (for example, a reduction in hospital stay) or surrogate (for example, radiographic clearing). The primary outcomes can only be studied in sufficient numbers in large multi-centred trials. Small single-centred studies tend to report other outcomes such as clinical or radiographic outcomes. These include the daily and total volume of pleural fluid drained before and after fibrinolytic instillation; resolution of clinical sepsis; improvement in chest radiograph or CT scan appearances or both. The volume of pleural fluid drainage is unhelpful since SK will itself increase pleural fluid production. Side effects of treatment are addressed with coagulation studies and reports of adverse reactions to treatment.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-31 17:29:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Six trials have been included in this meta-analysis of fibrinolytic versus saline control. Five studies were Cochrane grade A quality and one Cochrane grade C. Our analysis demonstrates that:</P>
<P>1. Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy confers significant benefit in reducing the requirement for surgical intervention for patients with either empyema or loculated parapneumonic effusions, when either the Cochrane Grade A studies or all included studies are included in the meta-analysis. There is however considerable heterogeneity in this outcome with the addition of the new studies for this update. This appears to arise from a difference between the results of <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> and the other studies. The reasons for this difference are uncertain.</P>
<P>2. Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy has not been shown to reduce the risk of death in patients with either empyema or loculated parapneumonic effusions.</P>
<P>3. Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy has a non-significant major side effect profile in analysis of all studies and sub-groups, with an overall RR of 2.15 (95% CI 0.88 to 5.21). The confidence interval around this estimate is wide and therefore an increase in adverse events cannot be firmly excluded; the adverse event data all comes from <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK>.</P>
<P>4. In sub-group analysis of all included studies which provide data on those with proven loculations, intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy confers significant benefit in reducing overall treatment failure .Separate analysis of Cochrane Grade A studies of those with proven loculations, however, does not show significant benefit. These data must therefore be interpreted with caution.<BR/>
<BR/>The largest of these studies, <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> (which carries the greatest weighting in this meta-analysis) is a multi-centre randomised trial. It did not demonstrate any significant difference between conservative management and fibrinolysis in the treatment outcomes of death or requirement for surgery. The study authors felt fibrinolysis may have a role in individual patients but could not identify a cohesive group to target. This opinion was mirrored in the very comprehensive meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Tokuda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tokuda 2006</LINK>) of five of the six trials included here (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bouros-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bouros 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuncozgur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuncozgur 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diacon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Diacon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK>, the same studies given Cochrane A status) which excluded <LINK REF="STD-Misthos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misthos 2005</LINK>. In the Tokuda analysis, fibrinolysis was not shown to be statistically beneficial. A visual inspection of a funnel plot of the primary outcome is suggestive of publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), whereby small trials which report significant findings are more likely to be published than non-significant small studies. The availability of a large negative study (<LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK>) gives some indication that the true population effect could be closer to the null than our analysis estimates, although certain important characteristics of this study and other meta-analyses in this area merit comment.</P>
<P>The discrepancy between the <LINK REF="REF-Tokuda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tokuda 2006</LINK> meta-analysis of the same data and our review may lie with <LINK REF="STD-Bouros-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bouros 1999</LINK>, where we counted as treatment failures the 12 patients who passed from the control group to the fibrinolytic group prior to surgical intervention; whereas <LINK REF="REF-Tokuda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tokuda 2006</LINK> considered as failures only the 6/12 who subsequently failed the intermediate fibrinolysis step and then required surgical intervention. The current reviewers have concluded that 6/16 (37.5%) patients should be considered as surgical referrals but that overall 12/16 (75%) be considered as treatment failures in the control arm of the trial. The different end points for considering treatment failure leads to a significant difference in the outcome of the two meta-analyses.</P>
<P>With the larger number of trials, the final common end points diminish compared with our earlier analyses. Indices such as resolution of pyrexia, resolution of sepsis, parameters to gauge improvement in chest radiograph appearance, length of stay in either the ward or hospital, and whether they are measured as median or mean, make these end points too diverse to combine for the current analysis. The volume of pleural fluid drained is a very doubtful measure of the efficacy of fibrinolytic therapy. The pleural fluid volume drained increases significantly after fibrinolysis, but this may be due principally to a hypersensitivity reaction to fibrinolytics (demonstrated for SK, <LINK REF="REF-Idell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idell 2005</LINK>) coupled with decreased resorptive capacity of the inflamed pleura (<LINK REF="REF-Strange-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strange 1993</LINK>). Its value as a clinical endpoint is therefore unclear.</P>
<P>The only consistent end points therefore are treatment failure, as gauged by the requirement for further interventional therapy (surgery), or death; or in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Bouros-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bouros 1999</LINK>, a trial of UK in the event of failed conservative treatment. The end point of this meta-analysis is therefore taken at these end points. The timing of these end points varies considerably between studies. Whilst the smaller studies look at more immediate time frames, the larger <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> study examines the end point for treatment failure at three months. In terms of patient outcome, this may be more meaningful for the clinician, but is more likely to include other causes of mortality. The mortality of the <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> study is very high at 62/427 (14.5%) for all patients when compared with the other studies 4/275 (0.15%%) and the reasons for this are not apparent from the provided information. Variability of care in the multi-centre trial and the considerably longer time to study endpoint may both be contributors.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> study has been criticised for lack of consistency in treatment protocols, the small drainage tube size, and the lack of clear end points regarding treatment failure, which was left, within broad guidelines, to the treating physicians with a variation of consistent on-site surgical expertise. These last two points may however reflect how 'real-life' decisions are made, rather than reflect the idealised confines of a single-centre RCT. The largely negative large <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> multicenter study balances the other largely favourable single centre studies without being able to pinpoint specifics as to why these discrepancies might exist.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Misthos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misthos 2005</LINK> trial suffers from significant drawbacks. The treatment allocation on the basis of hospital admission number may have seriously compromised selection bias, and thus the study received a Cochrane C grading. Furthermore, eight patients in the SK allocated treatment group did not receive the full treatment protocol and could not therefore be included in an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bouros-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bouros 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tuncozgur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuncozgur 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Misthos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misthos 2005</LINK> have selected patients who have US or CT scan proven loculated pleural effusions. The <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> study provides separate data (on line) for some of these patients. If the analysis is narrowed to patients with loculated effusions only, then an analysis excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Misthos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misthos 2005</LINK> trial shows no significant benefit in reducing overall treatment failure (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.6 to 1.1). The inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Misthos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misthos 2005</LINK> in this analysis shows significant benefit in favour of fibrinolytic therapy (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.52-0.92). Differentiation between simple and loculated empyema &amp; effusion by CT or US scan may therefore prove pivotal in effectively selecting candidates for intrapleural fibrinolytics.<B> </B>It is unfortunate that the methodological flaws of <LINK REF="STD-Misthos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misthos 2005</LINK> do not allow for a more robust weighting in the meta-analysis to further clarify this issue.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Light-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 1995</LINK> has documented the progress from infection through exudative effusion to fibrin formation, clot coalescence, the formation of septation and possible permanent fibrous tissue. This may be driven by a concomitant persistent infection, with sepsis and abscess formation which fuels a parallel inflammatory and healing process. As the disease process progresses along this pathway, fibrinolytic agents may become less able to clear loculation and septation formation, particularly if cellular infiltrates become organised into fibrous tissue. Whilst fibrinolytics may be useful to clear early fibrous stranding and septation, other, more aggressive agents such as TPA and DNAse and other proteolytics, may be better candidates to lyse more advanced septation. This differentiation between simple empyema, where septation has not yet occurred, and more advanced effusions with the presence of loculation may well affect the response to treatment.</P>
<P>It is difficult to control for the age of the effusion. An analysis of risk factors for treatment failure with intrapleural fibrinolysis (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1999</LINK>) suggested that chronicity of infection was not a predictor of outcome and survival in 85 patients with complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema treated with intrapleural streptokinase. They found purulence was more frequent in medical failures than successes (P &lt; 0.02 chi-squared) but 27% of patients with non-purulent effusions still went on to require surgical interventions. The absence of purulence was a useful predictor of success (positive predictive value 93%). They concluded there were no reliable clinical, pleural fluid or radiological characteristics at the time of admission that could reliably predict medical outcome, including the thickness of the pleura on CT scan.</P>
<P>Longer term follow up on these patients suggest that the further out from initial treatment then the more likely that the outcomes with placebo and fibrinolytic therapies become similar. <LINK REF="STD-Bouros-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bouros 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Diacon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Diacon 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> all report long term follow-up data to suggest that once over the acute event, objectively measured functional outcomes between the two groups converge over the next few months.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Bouros-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bouros 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tuncozgur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuncozgur 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> studies have a considerably higher control arm failure rate than the other smaller studies. <LINK REF="STD-Bouros-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bouros 1997</LINK> found that choice of fibrinolytic agent (either SK or UK) was not a significant factor. The number of instillations was limited to three in <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bouros-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bouros 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuncozgur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuncozgur 2001</LINK> used five, there were six in <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> and up to seven in <LINK REF="STD-Diacon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Diacon 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>Mortality is low in most of these studies .The differing percentages of treatment successes and failures in all six studies therefore suggests a variable threshold for surgical intervention, decided upon by the treating physicians, despite defined criteria which in all studies are slightly different. This may be particularly relevant to the multi-centre <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> study in which the decision to undergo surgery was left to many individual clinicians.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tuncozgur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuncozgur 2001</LINK> do not provide information on underlying patient co-morbidity, which is common in other studies; with 38% of <LINK REF="STD-Diacon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Diacon 2004</LINK>, &gt; 50% of cases in <LINK REF="STD-Bouros-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bouros 1999</LINK> and 74% of patients in <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> having at least one other major co-morbidity. This may have an impact on treatment failure, as seen in <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> which carries the highest mortality rate. <LINK REF="STD-Chin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chin 1997</LINK> (not included in meta-analysis) shows an overall mortality of 7/52 (13.5%) and a high overall treatment failure rate of 17/52 (33%) attributable to septicaemia in a study population with 75% co-morbidity.</P>
<P>The intrapleural dose of fibrinolytics is empirical, without experimental foundation in the context of pleural disease. Daily streptokinase 250,000 units and urokinase 100,000 units were employed in these studies. Frequency of dose is equally empirical, generally being administered once daily, but given the effective half-life of both fibrinolytics is less than half an hour (<LINK REF="REF-Moulton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moulton 1995</LINK>), it is possible that fibrin deposition may occur within the 24 hour period, and more frequent than daily administration may therefore be appropriate. Higher doses of intrapleural fibrinolytics have been used safely.</P>
<P>The safety profile in these studies was generally good. The only study to report significant side effects attributable to a fibrinolytic (SK) was <LINK REF="STD-Maskell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Maskell 2005</LINK> who reported a non-significant increase (P = 0.08) in severe events in the streptokinase arm (14/208) versus 6/222 in the control arm). Haemorrhage was found equally in both arms, 7/208 versus 6/222.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy has been shown in the trials included in this review to confer significant benefit in reducing the requirement for surgical intervention for patients in the early studies included in this review but not in the more recently published Maskell study. The reasons for this difference are uncertain. Separate subgroup analysis of proven loculated/septated effusions from the available data in our meta-analysis suggests a potential overall treatment benefit with fibrinolytics, but these results should be treated with caution as the data are incomplete and the benefit is not significant in meta-analysis of the subgroup of the high quality trials (Cochrane Grade A). Intrapleural fibrinolytics have not been shown to significantly increase adverse events, but the confidence interval is too wide to firmly exclude this possibility.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A focus on patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions, i.e. with loculations alone rather than the currently studied heterogenous group of empyema and complicated parapneumonic effusions may clarify the niche in which fibrinolytics may play a role. Other agents which more aggressively degrade fibrin, such as deoxyribonuclease or TPA (both currently being trialled in <LINK REF="STD-Davies-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 2007</LINK>) and possibly other proteolytic agents which can lyse more organised intrapleural repair tissue could be considered for trial in this group.</P>

<P>33 male, 17 female,age 15-92 years</P>
<P>Eligibility criteria: Parapneumonic effusion as defined by the following criteria: purulent fluid with evidence of bacteria on gram stain or culture, pH &lt;7.0, lactate dehydrogenase &gt;1000 IU/L, pleural fluid glucose &lt;40 mg/dl with multi loculation of pleural fluid on CT or ultrasound, or with an empyema with frank pus on thoracocentesis and multiple locules. Patients had clinical features of systemic sepsis and chest infection. As an inclusion criterion, there must have been failure to drain &gt;70 ml via thoracostomy tube during the previous 24 hours.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria: Empyema as defined in Bouros 1999, florid sepsis, bronchopleural fistula, history of previous thrombolysis with streptokinase (SK group only), known sensitivity to urokinase, bleeding diathesis, and contraindication to thrombolytic therapy such as a history of haemorrhagic stroke, intracranial neoplasm, cranial surgery or head trauma within the previous 14 days, abdominal or thoracic surgery within 10 days, or disease making survival &lt;2 months unlikely.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Daily intrapleural streptokinase 250,000 IU vs urokinase 100,000 IU infusions</P>
<P>Intervention group: Intrapleural streptokinase 100 000 IU via a 28 - 32 French intercostal catheter in 100 ml normal saline on three consecutive days<BR/>Control group: 100 000 IU urokinase in 100 ml normal saline. </P>
<P>After instillation, the drain was clamped for 3 hours. Continuous suction of -20 cm water was applied for after each instillation. The process was repeated if the amount of pleural fluid was &lt;50 ml in the preceding 24 hours and a persistent effusion was seen on chest ultrasound or CT scan. The intercostal catheter was removed when the amount of fluid drained was &lt;50 ml in 24 hours and no persistence of effusion was seen on chest CT or US.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary treatment outcomes were-<BR/>1) Improvement in chest radiography (see Notes)<BR/>3) Improvement in chest CT and/or US<BR/>4) Duration and total volume of pleural drainage<BR/>5) Time in days to defervescence<BR/>6) Cost of treatment</P>
<P>Secondary outcome was-<BR/>7) Time to leucocytes &lt; 10 x 109/L<BR/>8) Significant side effect of therapy<BR/>9) Number of instillations required</P>
<P>Withdrawal from the trial by continuing with fibrinolytic therapy or proceeding to surgery was made by the attending physician on the basis of "substantial" (unspecified) residual pleural fluid and persistent sepsis.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>

<P>There were no significant differences between the patients in the two treatment groups in terms of baseline demographics, pleural fluid biochemical and microbiological analyses. A microbiological diagnosis was obtained in 19/50 patients. There was appropriate randomisation into urokinase and streptokinase groups. The statistical analysis did not differentiate between complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema. Underlying predisposing factors were found in 10/25 patients in the SK group and 14/25 patients in the UK group. There were no dropouts during the study.<BR/>
<BR/>Improvement in clinical parameters was noted in all but 2 of each group. Details of these parameters and duration of hospital stay were not provided.<BR/>
<BR/>The final numbers in the SK group were reduced as a result of therapeutic complications. Two patients were changed from SK to UK after spiking a pyrexia &gt;39 degrees C, which was deemed to be a result of the SK instillation. The number of patients in each group on an intention-to-treat basis was 25 each, but the actual numbers at the end of the trial would be 23 in SK and 27 in the UK group. It appears from the section on radiographic improvement that the final analysis reflected the intention-to-treat population. This approach will be used for this analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>The number of pleural instillations required to effect adequate clinical and radiological response was equal in both groups at 6 +/- 2.2 for SK and 5.9 +/- 2.1 for UK. The mean volume of pleural fluid drained in the 24 hours after instillation was comparable with 380 +/- 99 ml in the SK group and 421 +/- 110 in the UK group. The mean total fluid volume drained was 1596 +/- 68 ml vs 1510 +/- 55 ml; this was not statistically significant. The mean length of stay was not different between treatment groups.<BR/>
<BR/>The degree of improvement in chest radiograph was equivalent in both groups with score 3 (excellent) in 17/25 SK patients vs 19/25 in the UK patients; score 2 in 5/25 SK vs 4/25 UK and score 1 (minimal) in 3/25 SK vs 2/25 UK. Mean overall improvement was 2.5 +/- 0.7 vs 2.7 +/- 0.8 was not significant.<BR/>
<BR/>Two patients from each group underwent a surgical drainage procedure, which constituted treatment failure. One patient in the UK group died of underlying malignancy, which the authors felt was unrelated to the fibrinolytic therapy, with a clear pleural cavity on autopsy. For the purposes of this review therefore, this will not be considered a treatment failure.<BR/>
<BR/>Cost analysis in US dollars showed a lower drug cost of SK vs UK $180 +/- 47 vs $320 +/- 123 but the authors did not factor this into the overall estimated cost of treatment in hospital.</P>

<P>There were no significant differences between the 31 patients in terms of baseline demographics, pleural fluid biochemical and microbiological analyses between the urokinase and control groups. A microbiological diagnosis was obtained in 12/31 patients. There were more complicated parapneumonic effusion (21) than empyemata (10) with appropriate randomisation of each into intervention and control groups. The statistical analysis did not differentiate between these 2 diagnoses. Underlying morbidity was found. There were no dropouts during the study. Treatment failure, for the purposes of this analysis was judged either by the requirement for surgery or the withdrawal from a treatment arm to administer alternative therapy due to clinical or radiological failure to progress. 2/15 (13.5%) UK patients vs 12/16 (75%) control patients were felt to have inadequate pleural drainage. For the purposes of this review, the analysis goes no further. All 12 failed control patients received UK, with 6 achieving adequate pleural drainage, and 6 proceeding to surgery. The 2 failed UK patients also underwent a surgical drainage procedure. One patient in the UK group had abnormalities in clotting parameters that resolved after drainage and did not necessitate alteration in therapy. There were no other significant treatment side effects in either group. All treatment modalities were well tolerated, with no side effects. Improvement in clinical parameters significantly favoured the UK group with mean time to defervescence 6 +/- 4 vs 12 +/- 5 days (p&lt;0.01) and duration of hospitalisation 13 +/- 4 vs 18 +/- 5 days (p&lt;0.01). The duration of pleural fluid drainage significantly favoured the UK group at 8 +/- 4 vs 12 +/- 6 days (p&lt;0.05). The net amount of pleural fluid drained was significantly greater in the UK group in the first 24 hours after instillation at 410 +/- 99 ml vs 105 +/- 10 ml (p&lt;0.001). This difference was maintained over the first 3 days: 970 +/- 5 ml vs 280 +/- 55 ml (p&lt;0.001).The total fluid drained was 1240 +/- 120 vs 350 +/- 80 ml (p&lt;0.001). Chest radiographs were assessed after 3 days of treatment. Score 3 (excellent improvement) was seen in 12/15 UK vs 2/16 control patients, score 2 (moderate improvement) in 2/15 vs 4/16 and score 1 (minimal improvement) in 1/15 vs 7/16 with no improvement seen only in 3/16 patients of the control group. Overall improvement clearly favoured the UK group with mean score improvement of after 3 days of 2.7 +/- 0.59 vs 1.2 +/- 0.9, (p&lt;0.001).</P>

<P>24 patients completed the study with no dropouts. 13/24 patents had a microbiological aetiology established and treated accordingly, and those who did not were treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen to cover gram positive, negative and anaerobic organisms. Treatment failure with referral to surgery favoured the SK group at 0/13 vs 3/12 in the conservative group. There was no mortality. The volume of pleural fluid drained was significantly greater in the streptokinase group. In the first three days of therapy it was 391 ml +/- 200 (SD) vs 124 +/- 44 ml with a mean difference of 267 ml, 95% CI 144 to 390 ml (p&lt;0.001). The total volume of fluid drained was 2564 ml +/- 1663 vs 1059 +/- 502 ml with a mean difference 1505 ml, 95% CI 465 to 2545 ml (p&lt;0.01). Secondary end points did not show a significant difference between the intervention and control groups. The duration of hospital stay was 16 +/- 13 days for the SK group vs 13 +/- 8 days for the control group. The duration of pleural fluid drainage was 9 +/- 5 days vs 9 +/- 3 days. There was also no difference in the time of return to normal white cell count at 9 +/-11 days vs 5 +/- 7 days and the time to return to normal C reactive protein levels at 34 +/- 10 vs 7 +/- 17 days. All of these outcomes slightly but non-significantly favoured the control group. The time of return to consistently normal temperature at 6 +/- 6 vs 8 +/- 6 days slightly favoured the intervention group. The large standard deviations in these results indicate a broad range of results. The changes in pleural fluid volume were gauged by the reduction of the largest linear dimension of the fluid collection on chest radiograph. This significantly favoured the SK group at 6.0 +/- 2.7 cm vs 3.4 +/- 2.7 cm; with a difference of 2.6 cm; 95% CI 0.3 to 4.9 cm. At discharge, 10/12 of the SK group showed &gt;75% improvement from the original size compared to 4/9 in the control group. Three patients were not strictly eligible for assessment in the control group as they underwent surgery, giving &gt;75% improvement in 4/9. The authors suggest however that these patients would not have improved to that extent (hence the requirement for surgery) and therefore technically only 4/12 patients in the control group showed 75% reductions in pleural fluid volume. This significantly favours the SK group (p&lt;0.05, 2-tailed Fischer's exact test). No patients were withdrawn due to treatment side effects. There was a small but significant rise in INR from baseline in the control group from 1.18 +/- 0.08 to 1.32 +/- 0.14, with a mean rise of 0.14 +/- 0.12. This did not reach statistical significance. The SK group coagulation profile remained uniformly within normal limits.</P>

<P>Primary endpoints.<BR/>454 patients consented to be studied. Of 226 randomised to Streptokinase intervention, 20 patients were excluded with 18 not receiving the study drug and 2 lost to follow up. 208 of these patients were therefore included in the intention to treat analysis. In the control group 228 patients were randomised to receive placebo, and 6 of these received no trial drug. 1 was lost to follow up. Therefore 222 of the control patients were included in the intention to treat analysis. 54 patients did not receive all 6 doses of the study drug.<BR/>
<BR/>At 3 months, 32 of 206 patients (16%) in the intervention group and 30 of 221 (14%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk 1.14 p=0.66).<BR/>At 3 months, 32 of 206 patients (16%) in the SK group and 32/221 (14%) of control had required surgery (relative risk 1.07 p=0.87).<BR/>
<BR/>Secondary end points<BR/>There was no significant difference in median hospital stay between the intervention/control groups (13 days, range 1 to 271 versus 12 days range 2 to 152, P=0.16). There was no difference in chest radiograph pleural fluid reduction between the 2 groups at 3 months. There was a small but significant difference in favour of placebo in the vertical height of the thorax on the affected side in millimetres, SK group was 209+/- 30mm versus 221+/- 33mm, p=0.03. Dynamic lung volumes were similar between the 2 groups at 3 months with no significant difference between forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC).</P>

<P>147 patients were assessed for eligibility, 135 included in the study. 75.5% of cases had positive pleural fluid cultures. There were eight dropouts in the intervention group who did not recieve the full SK protocol and none in the control group. The mean age of patients was 45 years (range 19-77). There were no significant differences between exclusion characteristics of either the intervention or control groups. <BR/>
<BR/>The mean length of stay in the Thoracic Surgical Department was significantly longer for the control group than the intervention group. Mean 15.5 +/- (SD) 4 days (range 8-24 days) for control versus 7 +/- 1.7 days (range 4-14 days) for the intervention group (p &lt; 0.001). <BR/>
<BR/>3/70 (4.2%) patients died in the control group versus 1/57 (1.7%) in the intervention arm. <BR/>Treatment failure (requirement for surgery or death) occurred in 25/70 (35.7%) in the control group and 7/57 (13.3%) in the SK group. (p&lt; 0.05). <BR/>
<BR/>There were no serious complications of tube thoracostomy or SK therapy. 9/57 patients noted mild discomfort after SK installation.</P>

<P>All 49 patients completed the trial, with no dropouts. 24 received urokinase and 25 normal saline control. The patient demographics in both groups were not statistically different, with a young mean age of 33-34 years (SD 14-16) and p&lt;0.01.<BR/>
<BR/> 7/27 (29%) of patients in the SK intervention group vs 15/25 (60%) in the control arm required surgical drainage, and there were no deaths in either group. No major complications were reported.<BR/>
<BR/>Mean time to defervescence was significantly shorter in the UK group 7 (SD 3) vs 13 (SD 5) days, p&lt;0.01 as was duration of hospital stay 14 (SD 4) vs 21 (SD 4), p&lt; 0.01.<BR/>10 out of 25 (40%) in the saline group, and 17 out of 24 (71%) in the UK group had radiological improvement i.e. reduction by more than 2/3 of the original effusion size (author, private communication) and this radiological success was reflected by the same proportion of treatment failures i.e. 15/25 (60%) in the control group and 7/24 (29%) in the UK group (p&lt; 0.001).</P>
