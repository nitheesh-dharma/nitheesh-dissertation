<P>Oral cavity (mouth) cancer is usually detected earlier and treated with surgery and radiotherapy. Oropharyngeal (throat) cancer may be advanced when it is found and is treated with radiotherapy. Both treatments may be associated with disfigurement and decreased ability to eat, drink and talk. Treatment with chemotherapy (drugs which kill cancer cells), in addition to radiotherapy (and surgery where possible) offers prolonged survival. Chemotherapy given at the same time as radiotherapy, is more effective than chemotherapy given before radiotherapy, and may reduce the need for surgery. The improvement in overall survival with the use of chemotherapy is estimated to be between 8% and 22%. The additional side effects of combined chemoradiotherapy (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, hair loss, and infections) were not measured.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-09 14:16:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers are frequently described as part of a group of oral cancers or head and neck cancer. Treatment of oral cavity cancer is generally surgery followed by radiotherapy, whereas oropharyngeal cancers, which are more likely to be advanced at the time of diagnosis, are managed with radiotherapy or chemoradiation. Surgery for oral cancers can be disfiguring and both surgery and radiotherapy have significant functional side effects, notably impaired ability to eat, drink and talk. The development of new chemotherapy agents, new combinations of agents and changes in the relative timing of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy treatments may potentially bring about increases in both survival and quality of life for this group of patients.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-06-09 13:37:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine whether chemotherapy, in addition to radiotherapy and/or surgery for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer results in improved survival, disease free survival, progression free survival, locoregional control and reduced recurrence of disease. To determine which regimen and time of administration (induction, concomitant or adjuvant) is associated with better outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-01-17 13:57:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Electronic searches of the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED were undertaken on 1st December 2010. Reference lists of recent reviews and included studies were also searched to identify further trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-04-08 16:40:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials where more than 50% of participants had primary tumours in the oral cavity or oropharynx, and which compared the addition of chemotherapy to other treatments such as radiotherapy and/or surgery, or compared two or more chemotherapy regimens or modes of administration, were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-02-28 11:51:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eighty-nine trials which met the inclusion criteria were assessed for risk of bias and data were extracted by two or more review authors. The primary outcome was total mortality. Trial authors were contacted for additional information or for clarification.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-28 11:52:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence of a small increase in overall survival associated with induction chemotherapy compared to locoregional treatment alone (25 trials), hazard ratio (HR) of mortality 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.00, P = 0.06). Post-surgery adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with improved overall survival compared to surgery ± radiotherapy alone (10 trials), HR of mortality 0.88 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, P = 0.03), and there is some evidence that this improvement may be greater with concomitant adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (4 trials), HR of mortality 0.84 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.98, P = 0.03). In patients with unresectable tumours, there is evidence that concomitant or alternating chemoradiotherapy is associated with improved survival compared to radiotherapy alone (26 trials), HR of mortality 0.78 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.83, P &lt; 0.00001). These findings are confirmed by sensitivity analyses based on studies assessed at low risk of bias. There is insufficient evidence to identify which agent(s) and/or regimen(s) are the most effective. The additional toxicity attributable to chemotherapy in the combined regimens remains unquantified.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-02-28 11:53:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chemotherapy, in addition to radiotherapy and surgery, is associated with improved overall survival in patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers. Induction chemotherapy may prolong survival by 8 to 20% and adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy may prolong survival by up to 16%. In patients with unresectable tumours, concomitant or alternating chemoradiotherapy may prolong survival by 10 to 22%. There is insufficient evidence as to which agent or regimen is most effective and the additional toxicity associated with chemotherapy given in addition to radiotherapy and/or surgery cannot be quantified.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-08-03 13:46:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral cancers are a significant disease group globally with more than 404,000 new cases worldwide in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>). Oral cancers are the sixth most common cancer worldwide, accounting for an estimated 4% of all cancers. The incidence and mortality from oral cancers varies geographically; the highest age standardised rates of oral cancers are reported in parts of Europe (France, Hungary), Botswana and south central Asia (Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Banglasdesh and India) (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2005</LINK>). There is overwhelming evidence that tobacco use, alcohol consumption and betel quid chewing are the main risk factors in the aetiology of intraoral cancer (<LINK REF="REF-La-Vecchia-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Vecchia 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 1995</LINK>). There is also strong evidence that low socio-economic status is associated with a higher incidence and poorer survival of oral cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Faggiano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faggiano 1997</LINK>). There is a higher incidence of oral cancers in men (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 2007</LINK>) that is generally attributed to a greater exposure to the known risk factors and vast majority of cases occur in men over 50 (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>) and among low socio-economic groups (<LINK REF="REF-Conway-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 2008</LINK>). However, the ratio of males to females diagnosed with oral cancers has declined from approximately 5:1 in the 1960s to less than 2:1 in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2005</LINK>). Another recent trend is the increasing incidence of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers in younger adults in the European Union and the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The epidemiological data concerning 'oral cancer' obscures the fact that 'oral cancer' includes both oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers which have clinically different aetiology, are generally diagnosed at different stages and managed in different ways. Patients with oral cavity cancers generally present with early stage disease and the primary treatment is surgery or radiotherapy or both. However, oropharyngeal cancers are likely to be advanced at the time of diagnosis and primary treatment is more likely to be radiation therapy or chemoradiation. It is now recognised that oral infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) is strongly associated with the development of oropharyngeal cancer where HPV infection is found in 40% to 60% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Souza-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Souza 2007</LINK>), and HPV is thought to be associated with the increased incidence of oropharyngeal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Hammarstedt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammarstedt 2006</LINK>). The link between oncogenic HPV and oropharyngeal cancer is strong and has been documented in numerous studies, fufilling the epidemiological criteria for disease causality, especially in the development of oropharyngeal cancer in non-smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Sturgis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturgis 2007</LINK>). The proportion of patients with oropharyngeal cancer who are HPV positive has increased dramatically over recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Attner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryerson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryerson 2008</LINK>) but it is interesting to note that this group of patients have significantly improved rates of both overall survival and disease free survival (<LINK REF="REF-Fakhry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fakhry 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fakhry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fakhry 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Licitra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Licitra 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common cancer of the oral cavity is the squamous cell carcinoma that arises from the lining of the oral cavity; over 95% of all oral cavity cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Despite significant technical advances in the treatment of oral cancer, it still has a significant mortality with 128,000 deaths recorded, representing nearly half of the incident cases (48%) (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2001</LINK>). Survival following a diagnosis of oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer remains poor with 5-year survival around 50% overall, with only limited improvement in the past 3 decades (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-08-03 13:46:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary treatment modality for oral cavity cancer in most countries has been surgery, whereas oropharyngeal cancer, which is often diagnosed at a more advanced stage, may be inoperable and is more commonly treated with radiation or chemoradiation. Post-operative radiotherapy is added for late stage disease but chemotherapy has historically been used in a relatively small proportion of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Funk-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Funk 2002</LINK>). Surgery for oral cancers can be disfiguring and both surgery and radiotherapy have significant functional side effects, notably impaired ability to eat, drink and talk. As a consequence there has been considerable research into non-surgical treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A major determination of survival in the treatment of oral cancer is that it commonly spreads to the lymph nodes of the neck (cervical lymph nodes) (<LINK REF="REF-Haddadin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddadin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Partridge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partridge 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pentenero-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pentenero 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1990</LINK>). In low volume disease, chemotherapy may have an important role to play in the control/treatment of metastatic disease, and may be equally as effective as radiotherapy and surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Fanucchi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanucchi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harari-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harari 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chemotherapy is the administration of anticancer or 'cytotoxic' drugs. These drugs work by attacking rapidly dividing cancer cells, disrupting the growth of the cancer cells and destroying them. The drugs used in chemotherapy affect the life cycle of the cancer cells, most commonly by damaging the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the cells so that they can no longer reproduce. Because the drugs enter the body's circulatory system their effect is systemic and therefore this offers greater applicability in higher stage tumours where there is a higher risk of metastases to other parts of the body. Different types of chemotherapeutic agents interrupt the life cycle of cancer cells at different stages; thus combining two or three different agents into a chemotherapy regimen may produce a greater and/or longer lasting effect on the tumour than single agent chemotherapy. However as well as increased benefits, combinations of chemotherapeutic agents may also be associated with increased toxicity, effects which may be exacerbated by the simultaneous used of radiotherapy.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-08-03 13:47:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chemotherapy agents can be classified into groups according to their mode of action (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). It is common to give two or more chemotherapy drugs together and this is commonly referred to as 'combinational therapy'. A commonly used standard chemotherapy regimen for oral cancer, for the past 20 years has been a combination of cisplatin and 5 fluorouracil (<LINK REF="REF-Specenier-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Specenier 2007</LINK>). Most chemotherapy drugs are administered directly into the bloodstream but other modes, including oral, intramuscular or intratumoural administration may also be used. The timing of chemotherapy can vary. It may be given as 'induction' therapy, early treatment in order to shrink a tumour prior to surgery or radiotherapy, concurrently with radiotherapy (concomitant, concurrent or synchronous chemoradiotherapy), or may be provided following treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (adjuvant) (<LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2009</LINK>). Sequential therapy usually refers to induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy.</P>
<P>Chemotherapy regimens are cycles of treatment, with drugs administered daily for one or more days, followed by rest days, depending on the combination of agents and dosages used. Chemotherapy is often associated with adverse effects, which are usually temporary, but may be quite severe, and are the result of the chemotherapy drugs targetting all dividing cells in the body: normal cells as well as cancer cells. Adverse effects vary amongst patients and treatment type, but can include tiredness, anaemia, nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation, hair loss, mucositis and susceptibility to infections. The rest days included in chemotherapy regimens allow time for adverse events to resolve before the next treatment cycle begins.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-01-17 14:04:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The management of advanced oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers is problematic and has traditionally relied on surgery and radiotherapy, both of which are associated with substantial adverse effects. Although there have been new treatments developed there has been limited improvement in survival over the past 3 decades (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>). Oropharyngeal cancers have relatively 'silent' symptoms which may not be present during the early stages of the disease, which is a possible explanation for the fact that stage of disease at diagnosis has not altered in the past 40 years despite public education (<LINK REF="REF-McGurk-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGurk 2005</LINK>). Tumour recurrence and the development of multiple primary tumours are the major causes of treatment failure (<LINK REF="REF-Day-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Partridge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partridge 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woolgar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolgar 2003</LINK>). Surgical treatment may be disfiguring and result in a substantially reduced quality of life as patients are socially isolated, due to difficulties with altered appearance, speech, eating and drinking. The development of new chemotherapy agents, new combinations of agents and changes in the relative timing of treatments may bring about increases in both survival and quality of life.</P>
<P>This review of chemotherapy will attempt to answer the broad question 'Does treatment with chemotherapy, in addition to radiotherapy and/or surgery, improve the outcomes for patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers?'. It is undertaken as part of a series of Cochrane reviews looking at the treatment modalities of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers categorised into four intervention groups: surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2007</LINK>), chemotherapy, radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Glenny-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glenny 2010</LINK>) and immunotherapy/biotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Pavitt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavitt 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this chemotherapy review we will include all randomised controlled trials where more than 50% of participants included have primary tumours in the oral cavity or oropharynx. Only trials where patients in each treatment arm receive different chemotherapy (either different agents, dosages, timing or mode of administration) plus or minus radiotherapy and/or surgery, or chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy will be included.</P>

<P>Patients with oral cancer as defined by the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) codes as C01-C06 (oral cavity including mouth, tongue, gum, or palate), tonsil (ICD-O: C09) or oropharynx, (ICD-O: C10) will be included, but trials where patients have cancer of hypopharynx (ICD-O: C13), nasopharynx (ICD-O: C11), larynx (ICD-O: C32) or lip (ICD-O: C00) will be excluded (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Clinical trials have frequently recruited patients with any type of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck - i.e. primary tumours in oral cavity, oropharynx, other pharynx or larynx. Where trials report the results separately for the different primary tumour sites, data from oral cavity and oropharynx are used. However, excluding trials of treatments for head and neck cancer where data from all primary tumour sites are combined would result in the loss of a great deal of information. We have therefore decided that trials which include patients with head and neck cancer including cases of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer will be included, provided data are available separately for those participants who have cancer of the oral cavity or oropharynx, or where patients with oral cavity/oropharyngeal cancers make up more than 50% of trial participants.</P>
<P>Cancers will be primary squamous cell carcinomas arising from the oral mucosa. Histological variants of squamous cell carcinomas will be included (adenosquamous, verrucous, basaloid, papillary etc) although they are known to have differing natural history to the majority of conventional squamous cell carcinomas they have a common aetiology, their incidence is low and they are generally managed in the same way. Oral carcinoma in situ (OCIS) is considered to be an early or incipient form of cancer that may, if left untreated long enough, transform into invasive squamous cell cancer. OCIS is usually treated with surgery alone. However any trials of chemotherapy for OCIS identified will be included in this review. Epithelial malignancies of the salivary glands, odontogenic tumours, all sarcomas and lymphomas will be excluded as these have a different aetiology and are managed differently.</P>

<P>Patients may be randomised to treatment with chemotherapy plus other treatments (such as surgery, radiotherapy or other medical therapies) but the comparison must be either between chemotherapy and other treatments (no chemotherapy), or chemotherapy A compared with chemotherapy B (different agent, timing or mode of administration).

<P>This review is part of a series of Cochrane reviews on the treatment modalities for treating oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer. The reviews have been broadly divided into four themes: concerning surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy/targeted therapies. A search strategy was developed that would encompass the four broad themes simultaneously and further adapted for use in the following databases (date of the most recent searches as indicated):</P>

<P>Current Controlled trials (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com">www.controlled-trials.com</A>) was searched for oral cancer or oropharyngeal cancer on 25th January 2010.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Because studies involving oral cancer are often included with those of the head and neck, a broad search was undertaken to include all possible studies. The searches attempted to identify all relevant trials irrespective of language. The reference list of related review articles and articles considered to be potentially relevant were checked for further trials. Authors of identified trials and known specialists in the field were contacted in an attempt to identify any additional published or unpublished trials.</P>
<P>Sensitive search strategies were developed for each database using a combination of free text and MeSH terms; these were based on the search strategy developed for MEDLINE (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) but revised appropriately for each database. The search strategy combined the subject search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (CHSSS) for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity maximising version (2009 revision) as referenced in Chapter 6.4.11.1 and detailed in box 6.4.c of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> version 5.0.2 (updated September 2009) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). Handsearching was done as part of the Cochrane Collaboration's worldwide handsearching programme, <I>see</I> the <A HREF="http://apps1.jhsph.edu/cochrane/masterlist.asp">Cochrane Master List</A> of journals being searched for more information.<BR/>The reference lists of related reviews and all articles obtained were checked for further trials. Authors of trial reports and specialists in the field known to the review authors were written to concerning further published and unpublished trials.</P>
<P>The original search strategy was deployed for all four reviews at the same time i.e. encompassing all the oral cancer treatment modalities and combinations of treatment with identified papers being then classified into subsets of treatment modalities: surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy/biotherapy.</P>

<P>As the majority of trials were for head and neck cancers the proportion of oral/oropharyngeal cancer patients was recorded (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).

Head and neck cancer trials with only combined data (i.e. no outcome data available by primary tumour site) where greater than 50% of participants presented with oral/oropharyngeal cancer were included in this review.

<P>Data were extracted by at least two review authors independently using a specially designed data extraction form. The data extraction form was piloted on several papers and modified before use.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-08-03 18:14:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the studies included in this review assessment of risk of bias was conducted by at least one review author using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). We assessed six domains for each included study: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding (of patient, carer, outcome assessor), completeness of outcome data, risk of selective outcome reporting and risk of other potential sources of bias. An overall risk of bias assessment was also made.</P>
<P>For this systematic review we assessed risk of bias according to the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sequence generation: use of a random number table, use of a computerised system, central randomisation by statistical co-ordinating centre, randomisation by an independent service using minimisation technique, permuted block allocation or Zelan technique. If the paper merely stated randomised or randomly allocated with no further information this was assessed as being unclear.</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment: centralised allocation including access by telephone call or fax, or pharmacy-controlled randomisation, sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes.</LI>
<LI>Blinding: in most of the included studies blinding of patients and clinical carers to treatment allocation was not done. Unless the trial was specifically described as double blind, or there was a statement about blinding in the methods section of the paper it was assumed that blinding of patients, clinical staff and outcome assessors did not occur.</LI>
<LI>Outcome data: outcome data were considered complete if all patients randomised were included in the analysis of the outcome(s). However, in trials of treatment for cancer this is rarely the case. Trials where less than 10% of those randomised were excluded from the analysis, and where reasons for exclusions were described for each group, and where both numbers and reasons were similar in each group, were assessed as being at low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome assessment. Where post-randomisation exclusions were greater than 10%, or reasons were not given for exclusions from each group, or where rates and reasons were different for each group, the risk of bias due to (in)complete outcome data was assessed as unclear.</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting: a trial was assessed as being at low risk of bias due to selective outcome reporting if the outcomes of interest described in the methods section, were systematically reported in the results section. Where reported outcomes did not include those outcomes specified or expected in trials of treatments for oral cancer, or where additional analyses were reported this domain was assessed as unclear.</LI>
<LI>Other bias: imbalance in potentially important prognostic factors between the treatment groups at baseline, or the use of a co-intervention in only one group (for example nasogastric feeding) are examples of potential sources of bias noted.</LI>

<P>The primary outcome is total mortality expressed as hazard ratio of death. These data were entered into the meta-analysis using the inverse variance method. If hazard ratios were not quoted in studies, but there were Kaplan-Meier estimates and the numbers at risk over a range of time intervals were reported, we then calculated the log hazard ratio and the standard error (SE) from the available summary statistics (observed events, expected events, variance, confidence intervals, P values or Kaplan-Meier estimates - survival curves) according to the methods proposed by Parmar et al (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>), or these data were requested from authors. Where possible we have presented total mortality as log hazard ratios, either calculated from Kaplan-Meier graphs, or from data presented in the MACH-NC meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2000</LINK> or <LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2009</LINK>). For dichotomous outcomes, the estimates of effect of an intervention were expressed as risk ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. Total mortality at a specific timepoint, disease free survival and progression free survival were analysed in two ways depending on the data presented in study reports, or obtained from authors.</P>
<P>Some trials were deemed to meet the review's inclusion criteria but insufficient data were presented to enable these trials to be included in the 'Analyses' section. Providing these trials had used an appropriate statistical approach they were included in the review and their salient findings summarised in the text of the 'Results' section of the review.</P>
<P>Due to the different natural history and treatment regimens for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers we planned to analyse these separately if possible. Investigation of clinical heterogeneity (to examine the types of participants, interventions and outcomes in each study) was planned but there were insufficient data. Meta-analyses were conducted only if there were studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures. Risk ratios were combined for dichotomous data, and hazard ratios for survival data, using fixed-effect models, unless there were more than four trials to be combined, when random-effects were used. Where the same meta-analysis contained subgroups with varying numbers of trials, a decision as to whether to use a fixed-effect or random-effects model was based on the degree of heterogeneity of the larger subgroups of studies. In this situation where heterogeneity was low a fixed-effect model was chosen. The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials was assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity and the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic, and any heterogeneity investigated.</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis (to examine the effects of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinded outcome assessment (if appropriate) and quality of follow-up/completeness of data set) was planned. </P>

<P>There were some 5000 papers identified from the search strategy. These were put into a bibliographic database and the titles and abstracts were screened against the inclusion criteria for this review. Full text copies of papers that appeared to meet our inclusion criteria were obtained and from these 89 included trials (many with multiple publications) were identified. Some of the included studies had 100% of participants with oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer and others included participants with primary tumours in other sites (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were 89 trials included in this review. Trials were undertaken all over the world with 17 based in the USA, 15 in France, 12 in Italy, 6 in Germany, 6 in India, 4 in Spain, 2 each in Canada, UK, South America and Scandinavia, 1 trial in Russia, 1 trial in Australasia, 3 conducted worldwide,13 multicentre trials in Europe and 3 multicentre trials in Asia. A total of 16,767 patients were randomly allocated to treatments and individual trials varied in size between 23 and 966 participants. Participants were recruited over periods ranging between 1 and 10 years, with the first study starting recruitment in 1965 (<LINK REF="STD-Richard-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1974</LINK>) and the most recent completing recruitment in 2007 (<LINK REF="STD-Gladkov-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gladkov 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2009</LINK>). Fifty trials described the stage of cancer of patients eligible for inclusion (6 trials included patient with stages 2-4, 44 stages 3-4) and 23 trials described cancer stage using the more specific TNM system (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2005</LINK>) (3 trials included patients with T2-T4 tumours and a further 3 with T1-T4 tumours). The remaining 16 trials did not specify the disease stage(s) in their inclusion criteria. The clinical heterogeneity of the included studies is substantial, and one of the strengths of this review lies in presenting an overall summary of the results of this body of research undertaken across the world over the past 45 years.</P>
<P>Twenty-eight of the included studies were included in a published meta-analysis produced by the MACH-NC Collaborative Group (<LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2000</LINK>) and a further 13 included studies were included in a subsequent meta-analysis published by the same group (<LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2009</LINK>). With the permission of these authors we have used the published data for total mortality from these meta-analyses, because they are from individual patient data from the included trials (details of the data source for total mortality data are recorded in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, and in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables. For the remainder of the included trials we have extracted data from the published papers, and sought clarification from the authors where necessary.</P>
<P>Only 23 of the included trials restricted inclusion to patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer. In the remainder of trials included in this review at least 50% of included participants had either oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer (for details <I>see</I> Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2011-01-25 09:09:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed each included study for risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool using the six domains described in the methods section. All of the included studies are described as randomised with the method of sequence generation described as either adequate or unclear.</P>
<P>In most studies of chemotherapy, blinding of patients and clinicians would be difficult and possibly unethical. Where blinding of patients, carers or outcome assessors is not mentioned in the text, we have assumed that there was no blinding. We have taken a pragmatic approach and assumed that where outcomes are objective (e.g. mortality, overall survival) the lack of blinding in the included studies is unlikely to result in bias. However, it is acknowledged that for outcomes which may be seen as more subjective, such as progression free survival, disease free survival or recurrence, the absence of blinding of trial personnel, especially of those assessing these outcomes may represent a potential risk of bias. Only three of the included studies used blinding of either patients or outcome assessors (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Assessment of possible selective reporting was based on the printed paper and it is acknowledged that even when the planned outcomes are listed in the methods section and reported in the results section of a paper, selective outcome reporting may still be a risk. However, in most cases, the only information available to us was that included in the published article so assessment was based on this information unless otherwise stated. Eight trials were assessed as being unclear with regard to selective reporting of outcomes, because insufficient information was available to the review authors from the published paper and contact with the authors.</P>
<P>In 15 trials, some outcome data were missing and it was unclear whether missing data from those who withdrew or were excluded represented a possible risk of bias. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mohr-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szabo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Szabo 1999</LINK>) outcome data were missing on more than 25% of those randomised and reasons and distribution of those not included were not described. In our assessment this represents a significant risk of bias in these two studies.</P>
<P>Various other potential sources of bias were identified in 20 trials. Eight trials presented so little information it was not possible to make a clear assessment. In seven trials there was a degree of imbalance between the randomised groups at baseline which may have introduced a bias to the results. Two trials gave inconsistent descriptions of methods used, and another three trials included a co-intervention which may result in bias (<I>see</I> 'Risk of bias' tables in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> on each study for details, and summary in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have described our assessment of the risk of bias of the studies included for each comparison under the heading <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK> (below). Overall 21 of the 89 included trials were assessed as being at low risk of bias for the outcome of total mortality.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-02-28 13:58:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The searches revealed two published meta-analyses of individual patient data (IPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2009</LINK>) which gave log hazard ratios and standard errors for total mortality and some data were pertinent to this systematic review; these data were included providing the trials met our own inclusion criteria. As the Pignon data were calculated from IPD we considered these data to be more precise than figures we calculated from the often scant data presented in trial manuscripts. Therefore these Pignon 2000 and 2009 data take precedence over our data where both types of data were available. We contacted Pignon for relevant site-specific data; however his team were unable to provide these until they were able to finalise their own publications - their IPD data were protected under strict agreement by those contributing data for their use and distribution.</P>
<P>As described in the methods section, the primary outcome of this review is total mortality expressed as hazard ratio for death. For obvious reasons clinicians prefer to use the more positive term overall survival when communicating information about treatment effectiveness with patients, but the data from the trials is based on deaths.

<P>None of the 26 trials incorporated blinding of patients or clinicians and only one (<LINK REF="STD-Richard-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1974</LINK>) used blinded outcome assessment. The lack of blinding is unlikely to have influenced the objective outcomes of total mortality, but may have had an effect on the assessment of the more subjective outcomes such as disease free survival, progression free survival, locoregional control and disease recurrence. Only seven trials had information indicating adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Domenge-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Domenge 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HNCProg-1987" TYPE="STUDY">HNCProg 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Licitra-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Licitra 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paccagnella-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Paccagnella 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szabo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Szabo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKHAN-2010" TYPE="STUDY">UKHAN 2010</LINK>) but two of these had incomplete outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Richard-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szabo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Szabo 1999</LINK>).</P>

<UL>
<LI>One trial by <LINK REF="STD-Mohr-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mohr 1994</LINK> compared pre-operative chemoradiotherapy with concomitant low dose cisplatin followed by surgery to surgery alone. This trial is included in this comparison because the chemotherapy is the first treatment used in these patients, but the trial is not truly a trial of induction chemotherapy versus none, and should be considered as a separate subgroup. In this trial, 377 patients were randomly allocated to chemoradiotherapy treatment followed by surgery or surgery alone, but only 268 patients were included in the outcome data. An additional 25 patients randomised to pre-operative chemoradiotherapy subsequently refused surgery (these patients had larger tumours than the group average), 23 patients were not evaluated due to 'protocol violations' and a further 61 randomised patients are not accounted for in the outcome. Sequence generation and allocation concealment are unclear from the information given in the paper. Although the results from this trial showed a statistically significant reduction in total mortality in favour of the chemoradiotherapy group, the results from this trial must be interpreted with caution as there is a high risk of bias, and missing data from 29% of randomised patients could potentially alter the conclusions from this trial. This trial has not been included in the meta-analysis.</LI>

<P>One small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bitter-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bitter 1979</LINK>) compared post-surgery chemotherapy with post-operative radiotherapy in 33 patients who had undergone surgery, and found no difference between the two treatments with regard to total mortality or disease free survival (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK> respectively).</P>
<P>Two trials compared surgery plus post-operative chemotherapy with surgery alone (no patients in these trials had radiotherapy). <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK>(participants with primary tumour in the oral cavity) randomised 116 post-operative patients to receive either methotrexate or no further treatment and in <LINK REF="STD-Lam-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 2001</LINK>, 65 patients who had been given levamisole prior to surgery, were randomised to post-surgery UFT (oral formulation of tegafur and uracil) plus levamisole or no further treatment. Both of these studies showed no statistically significant difference between surgery plus chemotherapy and surgery alone with regard to total mortality (total mortality data for <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK> from <LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2000</LINK>).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Szpirglas-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Szpirglas 1979</LINK> randomised patients with primary tumours in the oral cavity, who had undergone standard therapy (surgery ± radiotherapy) to either chemotherapy with a combination of methotrexate/bleomycin/leucovorin or no further treatment.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rentschler-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rentschler 1987</LINK> randomly allocated patients to adjuvant chemotherapy versus standard treatment of surgery and radiotherapy alone. The chemotherapy group received methotrexate once a week for 4 weeks pre-operatively, followed by surgery, then weekly methotrexate for 4 weeks, followed by a course of radiotherapy followed by a final eight doses of weekly methotrexate. The comparison group received surgery followed by radiotherapy. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in this trial for either total mortality or disease free survival (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>, Comparison 2.1.5; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>, Comparison 2.2.3).</P>
<P>Another trial, <LINK REF="STD-Laramore-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Laramore 1992</LINK> randomly allocated post-surgery patients to either three cycles of cisplatin/5-FU followed by radiotherapy or post-surgery radiotherapy alone. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups compared with regard to total mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>, Comparison 2.1.6), or disease free survival (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>, Comparison 2.2.4).</P>
<P>Post-surgery concomitant chemoradiotherapy was compared with post-surgery radiotherapy alone in four trials.

Another smaller trial with 72 patients randomised patients to concomitant carboplatin plus radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Argiris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Argiris 2008</LINK>) and the large <LINK REF="STD-UKHAN-2010" TYPE="STUDY">UKHAN 2010</LINK> study which included both patients with unresectable tumours and a post-operative group of 253 patients, randomly allocated the latter group of patients to either concomitant chemoradiotherapy (either methotrexate alone or vincristine/bleomycin/methotrexate/fluorouracil) or radiotherapy alone.</P>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Bernier-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bernier 2004</LINK>, 56% of the included patients had oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer and in <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 2004</LINK>, 70% of the patients included had oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer and also two 'high risk factors' (any two of histological evidence of invasion of at least two lymph nodes, extracapsular extension of nodal disease, microscopically involved mucosal margins of resection). These two trials evaluated the same interventions and when data from these two studies are pooled, the overall effect estimate shows a reduction in total mortality favouring chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97, Comparison 2.1.7). The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 2004</LINK> also showed a statistically significant benefit favouring cisplatin chemoradiotherapy in disease free survival (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.99, Comparison 2.2.5) and locoregional recurrence (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.91, Comparison 2.4.1). There was also a statistically significant difference between the groups in favour of cisplatin plus radiotherapy with regard to progression free survival in <LINK REF="STD-Bernier-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bernier 2004</LINK> (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99, Comparison 2.3.1).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Argiris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Argiris 2008</LINK> found no statistically significant difference between concomitant carboplatin plus radiotherapy and radiotherapy alone for the outcomes of either total mortality or disease free survival.</P>
<P>The post-surgery patients (n = 253) in the <LINK REF="STD-UKHAN-2010" TYPE="STUDY">UKHAN 2010</LINK> trial were randomised to post-surgery chemotherapy with methotrexate or VBMF (vincristine/bleomycin/methotrexate/fluorouracil) or post-surgery radiotherapy alone. There was no statistically significant difference between these two groups in total mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>, Comparison 2.1.9), disease free survival (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>, Comparison 2.2.7) or in progression free survival (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>, Comparison 2.3.2).</P>
<P>However, the combined estimate of total mortality from the pooled data from any concomitant chemoradiotherapy regimen versus radiotherapy alone in post-operative patients (four trials <LINK REF="STD-Argiris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Argiris 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bernier-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bernier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKHAN-2010" TYPE="STUDY">UKHAN 2010</LINK>) shows evidence of a reduction in total mortality in favour of concomitant chemoradiotherapy (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98, P = 0.03 <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> Comparisons 2.1.7 to 2.1.9).</P>

<P>Disease free survival was reported by eight trials in this comparison, and all evaluated different agents, administered either prior to radiotherapy or concomitantly. <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK> was the only trial that showed a difference in disease free survival between the groups, favouring adjuvant methotrexate compared to surgery alone.</P>
<P>The three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Argiris-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Argiris 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooper-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKHAN-2010" TYPE="STUDY">UKHAN 2010</LINK>) reported disease free survival for <I>concomitant</I> adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and the pooled estimate for these trials shows no evidence of a difference in disease free survival, (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.04, P = 0.12 <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK> estimate not shown on forest plot).</P>
<P>The remaining trial in Comparison 2 reported data for disease free survival only. The <LINK REF="STD-HNCProg-1987" TYPE="STUDY">HNCProg 1987</LINK> trial randomly allocated 462 patients to one of three treatment regimens: either A, standard therapy (surgery plus radiotherapy), or B, 5 days of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and bleomycin, followed by surgery and radiotherapy, or C, 5 days of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and bleomycin, followed by surgery and radiotherapy, plus adjuvant cisplatin (subsequent chemotherapy). We extracted data from a published subgroup analysis of the oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients (n = 192) (<LINK REF="STD-HNCProg-1987" TYPE="STUDY">HNCProg 1987</LINK>). Group C is compared to Group A in <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK> (Comparison 2.2.8) which found no statistically significant difference between these groups with regard to disease free survival.</P>

<P>One trial, conducted in India (<LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1996</LINK>), compared treatment with induction cyclophosphamide and MTX followed by concomitant 5-FU, to radiotherapy alone in 38 participants with previously untreated inoperable primary malignancy of the oral cavity, oropharynx and laryngopharynx.

<P>One trial compared either cisplatin or carboplatin plus standard fraction radiotherapy with radiotherapy alone (n = 159) (<LINK REF="STD-Jeremic-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jeremic 1997</LINK>) and one compared carboplatin plus radiotherapy to radiotherapy alone in 164 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Ruo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ruo 2010</LINK>). Participants recruited were those with histologically confirmed locally advanced, non-metastatic, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. The other three trials in this group recruited patients with SCC of the head and neck and randomised them to cisplatin plus radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Adelstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adelstein 2003</LINK> (n = 182); <LINK REF="STD-Huguenin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huguenin 2004</LINK> (n = 224); <LINK REF="STD-Jeremic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jeremic 2000</LINK> (n = 130)). Two trials in this group used hyperfractionated radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Huguenin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huguenin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeremic-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jeremic 1997</LINK>) and the other three used standard fractionation. When the estimates from all five trials of a platin plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone were combined by meta-analysis, a hazard ratio for total mortality of 0.66 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.77) was calculated, in favour of the combined chemoradiotherapy arm. (<I>See</I> summary of results table below.)

It should be noted that the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Wendt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wendt 1998</LINK> also administered CA-foliant along with the cisplatin and radiotherapy. For the eight trials of concomitant platin (either cisplatin or carboplatin) + 5-FU, the pooled estimate shows evidence of a reduction in total mortality (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81, P &lt; 0.00001) with no significant heterogeneity (I² = 0%, P = 0.77) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>, Comparison 3.1.2).</P>

<P>No statistically significant difference was shown in total mortality when methotrexate was used as a single agent chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone in one trial (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>, Comparison 3.1.6) (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2001</LINK> (data from <LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2000</LINK>)).</P>
<P>A large multicentre trial of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, judged suitable for radical radiotherapy as either initial treatment or following surgery, used a factorial design (<LINK REF="STD-UKHAN-2010" TYPE="STUDY">UKHAN 2010</LINK>). The chemotherapy regimen used was either methotrexate alone or methotrexate in combination with vincristine, bleomycin and 5-FU. Chemotherapy started on either days 1-14 concurrent with radiotherapy (SIM) or 14 and 28 days after completing radiotherapy (SUB). Neither the concomitant (SIM) regimen, nor the concomitant plus subsequent (SIM + SUB) regimen showed a statistically significant difference between the chemotherapy plus radiotherapy arm compared to radiotherapy alone (Comparisons 3.1.7 and 3.1.8 respectively).</P>
<P>Bleomycin as single agent chemotherapy concomitant with radiotherapy was compared to radiotherapy alone in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Eschwege-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eschwege 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morita-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Morita 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parvinen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Parvinen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shanta-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Shanta 1980</LINK> (all data from <LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2000</LINK>)), all undertaken in the 1980s. In these trials primary tumours were located in oropharynx only (<LINK REF="STD-Eschwege-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eschwege 1988</LINK>), tongue only (<LINK REF="STD-Morita-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Morita 1980</LINK>), buccal mucosa (<LINK REF="STD-Shanta-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Shanta 1980</LINK>) and both oral cavity and oropharynx (<LINK REF="STD-Parvinen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Parvinen 1985)</LINK> and the dose of bleomycin varied between 5 and 15 mg/dose, delivered between 2 &amp; 5 times weekly to a total of 60-150 mg. Three of these trials found no difference between bleomycin plus radiotherapy and radiotherapy alone. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Shanta-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Shanta 1980</LINK>, 157 patients were randomised to either bleomycin and radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. Bleomycin was administered intra-arterially (IA) (n = 42), intravenously (IV) (n = 22) or intramuscularly (IM) (n = 20) compared to radiotherapy alone (n = 73), and the IA and IV groups received bleomycin and radiotherapy concomitantly. (The IM group in this trial received bleomycin for 2 weeks before starting radiotherapy and also during radiotherapy - results reported above). There is some discrepancy between the numbers of patients in each subgroup in the original paper compared to the numbers per group in the data presented in <LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2000</LINK>. The data included in Comparison 3.1.9 is from <LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2000</LINK> WIA OC5b from the IV + IA bleomycin groups combined (n = 38) versus radiotherapy alone (n = 41), and shows a significant benefit associated with bleomycin plus radiotherapy in this study. Overall these four trials show considerable clinical and statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 85%, P = 0.0002 ) which suggests that these data should not be pooled.</P>
<P>Bleomycin and mitomycin were combined with radiotherapy in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Smid-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Smid 1995</LINK>) of patients with inoperable head and neck cancer. There was no difference between the groups with regard to total mortality in this trial (Comparison 3.1.10).</P>
<P>Mitomycin C as single agent plus concomitant radiotherapy was compared to radiotherapy alone in two large trials with 558 and 239 patients with head and neck cancer respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Dobrowsky-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dobrowsky 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Grau 2003</LINK> (data from <LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2000</LINK>)).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-28 12:20:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review was undertaken to answer the question 'Does treatment with chemotherapy, in addition to radiotherapy and/or surgery, improve the outcomes for patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers?'. A wide range of chemotherapeutic agents, regimens and timing of chemotherapy treatments relative to radiotherapy and surgery are evaluated in the 89 randomised controlled trials included in this systematic review. Only 21 of the included studies can be considered at low risk of bias with regard to the outcome of total mortality. A total of 16,767 patients were randomly allocated to treatments in trials where at least 50% of the patients with head and neck cancers had primary tumours in either the oral cavity or oropharynx.</P>
<P>We have divided the included trials into four major comparisons, according to the type of regimens, and stage of disease of the participants. Our primary outcome is total mortality as measured by hazard ratio for mortality. A reduction in the hazard ratio for mortality can be interpreted as an improvement in overall survival.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1: Induction chemotherapy plus locoregional treatment versus locoregional treatment alone</HEADING>
<P>The first comparison concerned the addition of induction chemotherapy to locoregional treatment (either radiotherapy or surgery or both) for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer. A wide range of chemotherapeutic agents were used in the trials included in this comparison. These included cisplatin, carboplatin, adriamycin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, methotrexate, mitomycin C, vinblastine,vincristine, vindesine, 5-FU, either as single agents, or more commonly as combinations of two or more agents. The pooled estimate from seven trials of induction chemotherapy with a regimen including either cisplatin or carboplatin plus 5-FU showed no evidence of a difference in overall survival between the induction chemotherapy arm and locoregional treatment alone. Likewise four trials of methotrexate alone showed no evidence of a difference in overall survival between those who had induction chemotherapy and those who had locoregional treatment alone. However the two trials of induction therapy with bleomycin plus vincristine did show evidence of improvement in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.91, P = 0.01). Overall, meta-analysis of 25 trials of induction chemotherapy plus locoregional treatment versus locoregional treatment alone showed some evidence of a small improvement in overall survival (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.00, P = 0.06). A sensitivity analysis based on pooling data from the four studies assessed as being at low risk of bias for this outcome showed HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.97, P = 0.02, which suggests that induction therapy may be associated with a benefit (up to 20%) for overall survival.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2: Surgery ± radiotherapy + chemotherapy versus surgery ± radiotherapy alone</HEADING>
<P>There were 11 trials in this comparison, involving a range of chemotherapeutic agents, with most regimens including either methotrexate or a platin (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Overall, in the 10 trials that reported total mortality, there was some evidence of a benefit in overall survival associated with the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy after surgery (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, P = 0.03). Sensitivity analysis based on four of these studies assessed as being at low risk of bias, showed the same point estimate (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05, P = 0.16) confirming the size of the benefit, but indicating reduced precision.</P>
<P>However it appears that timing of post-operative chemotherapy, relative to post-operative radiotherapy, may be important. In the four trials that evaluated concomitant chemoradiotherapy after surgery there was evidence of a benefit in overall survival in favour of concomitant chemoradiotherapy after surgery compared to radiotherapy alone (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98, P = 0.03).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: Concomitant chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone (non-resectable)</HEADING>
<P>Of the 29 trials included in this comparison two evaluated a combination of induction and concomitant chemotherapy, 26 evaluated concomitant chemoradiotherapy and a further two evaluated alternating chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens.</P>
<P>The induction plus concomitant trials used different agents and regimens and neither found a statistically significant benefit associated with chemotherapy over radiotherapy alone. These trials combined included less than 200 patients and had an unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>The two trials of alternating chemoradiotherapy were both assessed as being at low risk of bias and both used cisplatin/5-FU, but used different radiotherapy alone regimens as controls. The pooled estimate shows evidence of a reduction in total mortality favouring the alternating regimens (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.90, P = 0.006)</P>
<P>The remaining 26 trials in this comparison evaluated concomitant chemoradiotherapy regimens compared to radiotherapy alone, and 24 provided data for calculation of a hazard ratio for total mortality. More than half of the trials used a chemotherapy regimen which included either cisplatin or carboplatin. From these 24 trials, there is evidence of a reduction of total mortality (improvement in overall survival) in the order of 20% (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.84, P &lt; 0.00001). Senstivity analysis based on the 7 studies at low risk of bias confirmed this finding (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99, P = 0.03) albeit with a reduced magnitude of effect (10% benefit).</P>
<P>Pooling data from 26 trials of either alternating or concomitant chemoradiotherapy showed a benefit in overall survival favouring chemoradiotherapy (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.83, P &lt; 0.00001). Sensitivity analysis based on the 9 studies at low risk of bias confirmed this finding (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95, P = 0.003) suggesting that concomitant or alternating chemoradiotherapy is associated with a benefit in overall survival of 10 to 22%.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 4: Chemotherapy A (± LRT) versus chemotherapy B (± LRT)</HEADING>
<P>Comparison four included 28 trials which directly compared different chemotherapeutic agents, different regimens, and different timing relative to locoregional treatment. The analyses show that many of the regimens compared showed no statistically significant differences in the outcomes evaluated. Those that showed a statistically significant difference between the regimens compared are summarised below.</P>
<P>In a large trial with direct comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-UKHAN-2010" TYPE="STUDY">UKHAN 2010</LINK>) concomitant chemoradiotherapy resulted in improved overall survival compared to either radiotherapy alone, radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy or concomitant chemoradiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, in patients who had not undergone surgery. However, in the post-operative group (adjuvant setting) there was no difference in mortality between concomitant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy alone in this trial.</P>
<P>Docetaxel was the new chemotherapy agent added to the commonly used cisplatin/5-FU (PF) regimen in both the TAX 324 and TAX 323 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Posner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Posner 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermorken-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vermorken 2007</LINK>) in the induction setting. Both these trials showed a statistically significant increase in overall survival (43% and 36% respectively) associated with the TPF regimen (docetaxel/cisplatin/5-FU). <LINK REF="STD-Vermorken-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vermorken 2007</LINK> (n = 358) compared induction chemotherapy with TPF to PF followed by radiotherapy, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Posner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Posner 2007</LINK> (n = 539) compared TPF induction with PF induction and then followed both arms with chemoradiotherapy using carboplatin. Following these results, the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Paccagnella-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Paccagnella 2010</LINK> (n = 101) compared TPF induction regimen followed by cisplatin/5-FU (PF) chemoradiotherapy versus PF concomitant chemoradiotherapy alone, and found no statistically significant difference in total mortality or progression free survival associated with the addition of induction chemotherapy. It may be that <LINK REF="STD-Paccagnella-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Paccagnella 2010</LINK> lacked power to detect a difference as this trial included fewer participants compared to TAX 323 or TAX 324, or perhaps the delay in the start of concomitant chemoradiotherapy associated with the prior induction chemotherapy regimen is the reason for the poorer outcome. All three of these trials included a similar proportion of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients (64% to 70%). There is not clear evidence as to which regimen of chemotherapy is the most effective.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-08-03 16:05:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We originally sought to evaluate the benefits of chemotherapy in addition to locoregional therapies, against the potential increase in the adverse effects of treatment associated toxicity. However, we found very little quantitative data in the reports of the randomised controlled trials concerning harms associated with treatment, and almost all data were in a form unsuitable for analysis. Toxicities and adverse events were often reported as numbers of events rather than numbers of patients with adverse events, and there was considerable variation in the way harms were reported (e.g. all adverse events, moderate to severe adverse events, those requiring treatment interruption/cessation, causes of death).</P>
<P>We have therefore reluctantly modified the original protocol for this systematic review and have reported only the benefits associated with chemotherapy, in terms of survival and response to treatment. However we acknowledge that the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy and/or surgery is associated with additional toxicity. From the data available in the trials it is not possible to quantify the expected increase in toxicity associated with a given agent or regimen. Overall toxicity is related to the chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the dose and duration of therapy, but may also be related to factors including the age, bodyweight and overall health status of the individual patient(s). Close monitoring of patients undergoing chemotherapy for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers will detect adverse effects at an early stage, and enable clinicians to modify or interrupt chemotherapy to avoid and/or manage severe toxicity.</P>
<P>The other issue that we have encountered in this systematic review is that the majority of the research trials have specified squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in the inclusion criteria. Only 11 of the included trials specifically recruited participants with oral cavity cancer only and a further five included only those with oropharyngeal cancer. The authors of three trials provide us with separate data (<I>see</I> Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for details). In the remaining 68 trials included in this systematic review at least 50% of participants had either oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer. We have included these trials because we believe that they contribute important information concerning the effectiveness of chemotherapy in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers, in the absence of separate data in the research literature. However, we acknowledge that trials on the two specific cancer sites, or combined trials where the data are reported separately by primary tumour site, would yield much better information to guide clinical practice in these two conditions which have imported differences in aetiology, presentation and management. We look forward to trials on oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer alone being available for inclusion in future updates of this review.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-08-03 16:05:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only three of the trials included in this systematic review used blinding of either the participants (<LINK REF="STD-Browman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Browman 1994</LINK>) or the outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Richard-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shanta-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Shanta 1980</LINK>). It is recognised that blinding is difficult to maintain in trials of chemotherapy and it may not be either possible or indeed ethical, to blind trial participants or their clinicians to the treatment being administered, as different agents and regimens require differences in monitoring patients for both benefits and harms. It is likely that many outcome assessments are performed by the clinicians treating the patients. However blinded outcome assessment would be a pragmatic step to reduce the risk of bias for the more subjective outcomes.</P>
<P>For objective outcomes such as total mortality, trials assessed as adequate with regard to the domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment, complete outcome data and absence of selective reporting, have been assessed as being at low risk of bias. Only 21 of the 89 included studies (24%) meet these criteria, and can be considered at low risk of bias. The more recent trials are more likely to have low risk of bias.</P>

It is possible that the observed improvement in survival in oropharyngeal cancer over time may partly be explained by an increasing proportion of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer, rather than purely explained by improvement in treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Licitra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Licitra 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is some evidence that induction chemotherapy results in a small increase in overall survival compared to locoregional treatment alone, which is confirmed by a sensitivity analysis of trials at low risk of bias. There is evidence that adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and specifically concomitant adjuvant chemotherapy, improves overall survival compared to these treatments given sequentially. In patients with unresectable tumours, there is evidence that concomitant chemoradiotherapy is associated with an improvement in overall survival of between 10 and 22%. The additional toxicity associated with the combined regimens remains unquantified. While the addition of docetaxel to cisplatin and 5-FU during induction chemotherapy appears to improve overall survival further, it remains unclear whether the combination of induction chemotherapy (with or without docetaxel) plus concomitant chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-18 15:13:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research on the use of other taxanes, such as paclitaxel, in addition to the standard regimen of cisplatin/5-FU is currently underway in patients with advanced head and neck cancers. Trials of chemotherapy regimens in single cancer sites are desirable to identify differences in response between oral cavity and oropharyngeal tumours. This will require multicentre collaborations in order to conduct trials of sufficient size and statistical power. Research to identify the high risk subgroups most likely to benefit from post-operative concomitant chemoradiotherapy is desirable because these regimens are associated with substantial toxicities.</P>
<P>Given the substantial toxicities associated with chemotherapy it would also be desirable for future trials to report toxicities per patient treated, rather than summarising the most common toxicities experienced. This would enable patients and their doctors to better estimate the benefits and harms of treatment so that individuals could make more informed treatment plans.</P>

<P>Types of studies - As the primary outcome for this review is total mortality we have added a requirement that included studies have a minimum of 6 months of follow-up of participants after the end of treatment. Where participants in a trial have head and neck cancer in general, we have only included studies where at least 50% of the participants have either oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer, or where data for the oral cavity and oropharyngeal patients only are available.</P>
<P>The protocol for this review stated that quality of life would be a primary outcome for this review. Quality of life is an important outcome, for both patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers and their doctors. In this deadly and disfiguring disease, searching for treatments that offer an improvement in both quantity and quality of life for patients motivates the large body of research into the management of this disease. The search for effective chemotherapies is motivated at least in part by the desire to avoid patients having to undergo radical disfiguring surgery with resultant loss of function.</P>
<P>However, as the review has progressed we have found the large quantity of research on chemotherapy focused on finding better treatments that prolong overall survival, disease free survival and progression free survival. Quality of life is inconsistently reported in trials which address a primary outcome of overall survival. Therefore we have opted to transfer this outcome to the list of secondary outcomes to be considered in future updates of this review as appropriate.<BR/>Secondary outcome measures to be considered in future updates of this review include:<BR/>
