<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-05 11:35:44 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>LADA is a condition that at diagnosis looks like type 2 diabetes (non-insulin requiring diabetes mellitus) but actually is a type 1 diabetes, where the patient will become insulin requiring. In the UK approximately 3.6% of people who look like they have type 2 diabetes actually have type 1 diabetes, while other studies suggest the prevalence is higher and treatment for these patients may need to be different from that used in type 2 diabetes.<BR/>We identified 15 publications (10 studies) looking at 1019 patients who were followed between three months to 10 years. We found many of the publications had poor quality of reporting and had small numbers of participants. However, there does seem to be evidence from this review that the drug sulphonylurea (like glibenclamide or glyburide, gliclazide) could make patients insulin dependent sooner and it does not control blood sugar as well as insulin. Therefore, this suggests that this drug should not be a first line treatment for patients with LADA. In addition, insulin combined with vitamin D, or Chinese herbs may maintain natural insulin production better than insulin alone. Similarly, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) may maintain natural insulin production. However, there was no conclusive evidence that any of the other remaining treatment methods were better than each other. Studies on oral agents or insulin reported no adverse events in terms of severe hypoglycaemic attacks.</P>
<P>This review represents very early days of our understanding of the best way to treat LADA. It is limited by the poor reporting quality of the studies, small sample sizes, no clear single definition of LADA and many of the studies being carried out in different ethnic groups (China, Japan, Cuba, UK, Sweden) with different clinical care systems.<BR/>None of the publications reported on complications of diabetes, health-related quality of life, costs or health service utilisation. All but one of the publications reported there were no deaths.<BR/>In summary, this review demonstrates that insulin treatment may be preferable compared to sulphonylurea treatment but there is little evidence regarding other forms of treatment. Future studies are needed, should have a clear definition of LADA, investigate patient-important outcomes and use a common method of measuring stimulated C-peptide (a marker of natural insulin production reflecting improved beta-cell function of the pancreas).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-04 15:11:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Sinead Brophy">
<P>Searches identified 13,306 citations. Fifteen publications (ten studies) were included, involving 1019 participants who were followed between three months to 10 years (1060 randomised). All studies had a high risk of bias. Sulphonylurea (SU) with insulin did not improve metabolic control significantly more than insulin alone at three months (one study, n = 15) and at 12 months (one study, n = 14) of treatment and follow-up. SU (with or without metformin) gave poorer metabolic control compared to insulin alone (mean difference in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to end of study, for insulin compared to oral therapy: -1.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.4 to -0.1; P = 0.03, 160 participants, four studies, follow-up/duration of therapy: 12, 30, 36 and 60 months; however, heterogeneity was considerable). In addition, there was evidence that SU caused earlier insulin dependence (proportion requiring insulin at two years was 30% in the SU group compared to 5% in conventional care group (P &lt; 0.001); patients classified as insulin dependent was 64% (SU group) and 12.5% (insulin group, P = 0.007). No intervention influenced fasting C-peptide, but insulin maintained stimulated C-peptide better than SU (one study, mean difference 7.7 ng/ml (95% CI 2.9 to 12.5)). In a five year follow-up of GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase formulated with aluminium hydroxide), improvements in fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels (20 &#956;g group) were maintained after five years. Short term (three months) follow-up in one study (n = 74) using Chinese remedies did not demonstrate a significant difference in improving fasting C-peptide levels compared to insulin alone (0.07 µg/L (95% CI -0.05 to 0.19). One study using vitamin D with insulin showed steady fasting C-peptide levels in the vitamin D group but declining fasting C-peptide levels (368 to 179 pmol/L, P = 0.006) in the insulin alone group at 12 months follow-up. Comparing studies was difficult as there was a great deal of heterogeneity in the studies and in their selection criteria. There was no information regarding health-related quality of life, complications of diabetes, cost or health service utilisation, mortality and limited evidence on adverse events (studies on oral agents or insulin reported no adverse events in terms of severe hypoglycaemic episodes).<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-07-20 18:11:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Two studies show SU leading to earlier insulin dependence and a meta-analysis of four studies with considerable heterogeneity showed poorer metabolic control if SU is prescribed for patients with LADA compared to insulin. One study showed that vitamin D with insulin may protect pancreatic beta cells in LADA. Novel treatments such as GAD65 in certain doses (20 &#956;g) have been suggested to maintain fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels. However, there is no significant evidence for or against other lines of treatment of LADA.</P>

<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs)'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>Diabetes is normally classified into two major types: type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes and type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes. However, there is one form of diabetes which presents with non-insulin requiring diabetes in adults, but with many of the genetic, immune and metabolic features of type 1 diabetes and with a high risk of progression to insulin dependency. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a type 1 diabetes which shows slow progression to insulin dependence. A person with LADA will present clinically as an adult who is not insulin dependent at diagnosis. The patient will usually, therefore, be treated as having type 2 diabetes. However, LADA is an autoimmune condition unlike type 2 diabetes and therefore can be distinguished from type 2 diabetes by blood tests for antibodies. LADA is classified by the presence of pancreatic auto-antibodies, such as glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA) in an adult initially presenting with non-insulin dependent diabetes. Officially, LADA is classified as type 1 diabetes mellitus by the World Health Organisation. There are different laboratory methods used in GADA analysis such as a radioactive-assay or an Elisa (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). The GADA radioactive-assay has been shown to obtain 84% sensitivity and 94% specificity and varies in cost (<LINK REF="REF-Bingley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bingley 2003</LINK>). The GADA Elisa has been reported as a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 99% in the Diabetes Antibody Standardization Program (DASP) in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Bingley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bingley 2003</LINK>). Compared to a person with type 2 diabetes, a person with LADA may be younger, thinner and usually insulin deficient rather than insulin resistant (<LINK REF="REF-Nabhan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabhan 2005</LINK>). Numerous studies have attempted to establish the prevalence of LADA based on auto-antibody detection amongst adults with diabetes in both European and non-European countries. Recently, a study in the UK found that 3.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1% to 6.1%) of all newly diagnosed people with apparent type 2 diabetes have LADA (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2008</LINK>).<B> </B>Similarly, the ADOPT study (<LINK REF="REF-Zinman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zinman 2004</LINK>) reported that GADA was detected in 4.7% of their North American cohort and in 3.7% of their European cohort. The Ehime study (<LINK REF="REF-Takeda-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeda 2002</LINK>) in Japan also reported similar frequencies of GADA at 3.8%. The UK Prospective Diabetes study (which recruited people from 25 centres in the UK) examined the number of patients with apparent type 2 diabetes (n = 3672) who were positive for islet cell antibodies (ICA) and GAD (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>). They found that 13% of 25 to 44 year old people were positive for ICA and GAD and of these 94% required insulin therapy by six years. However, the UKPDS started participant recruitment in 1977 and the number of people with type 2 diabetes has now increased. Another study (<LINK REF="REF-Owen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2003</LINK>) examining 268 people with type 2 diabetes diagnosed age 18 to 45 years found 11.6% had potential LADA. Based on the latter figures, this means there are more people with LADA than with 'classical' type 1 diabetes. However, in the UK, GAD tests are not routinely performed and patients are treated as having type 2 diabetes, in other countries in Europe GAD tests are performed (<LINK REF="REF-Brophy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brophy 2006</LINK>). However, there is much debate regarding the definition of LADA (<LINK REF="REF-Gale-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gale 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leslie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leslie 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stenstrom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stenstrom 2005</LINK>). It is not clear if antibody positivity marks a distinct condition or simply a risk factor to insulin progression for a type 1 diabetes phenotype. The lack of a clear definition makes conclusions regarding a treatment strategy even more difficult.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-08-05 12:03:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Early studies in Japan (58 patients) (<LINK REF="REF-Kobayashi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobayashi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maruyama-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maruyama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takino-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takino 1998</LINK>) have suggested that patients with GAD antibodies should start insulin treatment within one year of diagnosis in order to maintain near norm-glycaemic control and this treatment could prevent slowly progressive pancreatic beta-cell failure. Patients taking insulin had an improved C-peptide response (this is a marker of natural insulin production and reflects improved beta-cell function), stable glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values and reduced auto-antibody levels. These findings have been supported by studies in Cuba (<LINK REF="REF-Cabrera_x002d_Rode-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cabrera-Rode 2002</LINK>) and China (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2004</LINK>).<BR/>Oral agents like thiazolidinediones have anti-inflammatory activity and could potentially also be an effective treatment for patients in the non-insulin dependent stage of LADA (<LINK REF="REF-Beales-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beales 2002</LINK>). Rosiglitazone has been given in combination with insulin and was found to maintain C-peptide levels better than insulin alone (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2004</LINK>).<BR/>Sulphonylurea treatments may be harmful to people with LADA as they may deplete the already low reserves of insulin. LADA patients given sulphonylurea (with or without insulin) have persistent antibodies and poor fasting glucose concentrations compared to people on insulin alone (<LINK REF="REF-Kobayashi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobayashi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Takino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2004</LINK>). This review aims to examine the effects of a range of interventions aimed at improving treatment in people with LADA.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions used in diabetes and adverse effects associated with these interventions</HEADING>
<P>Serious long-term complications can result such as eye complications, heart disease, kidney and foot problems if blood sugar levels are poorly controlled. Insulin is the primary treatment for all patients with type 1 diabetes and for type 2 diabetic patients who cannot adequately control their blood sugar by diet and exercise or oral hypoglycaemic agents, or both. However, insulin can cause hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) and requires a change in life style. There are six major types of oral antidiabetic drugs and a new type of antidiabetic medication (injection) which are glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues (such as exenatide) and liraglutide (<LINK REF="REF-Amori-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amori 2007</LINK>) that can be used to control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes; biguanides (metformin (<LINK REF="REF-Saenz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saenz 2005</LINK>) is now the only one available), sulphonylureas (glibenclamide, gliclazide to name a few), thiazolidinediones, i.e. pioglitazone (<LINK REF="REF-Richter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2006</LINK>) and rosiglitazone (<LINK REF="REF-Richter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2007</LINK>), meglitinides (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2003</LINK>) (nateglinide and repaglinide), acarbose (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Laar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Laar 2006</LINK>) and dipeptidyl peptide-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Richter-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2008</LINK>) (such as vildagliptin, sitagliptin and saxagliptin). The most common side effects of metformin (biguanides) are digestive in nature; feeling or being sick, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and a metallic taste. Metformin can very rarely cause lactic acidosis in certain individuals at risk and can cause hypoglycaemia. Sulphonylureas can encourage weight gain, and because they stimulate insulin release they can cause hypoglycaemia, and can lead to early depletion of insulin, leading perhaps to earlier insulin requirement. Sulphonylureas can also cause mild gastroenterological disturbances. On rare occasions they may cause allergic reactions. The most common side effects of the thiazolidinediones are weight gain, oedema and congestive heart failure. Infrequently, they may cause liver problems. Recently, the drug rosiglitazone was taken off the market in Europe and has severe restrictions in the US due to cardiovascular morbidity associated with its use. Side effects of meglitinides are rare, but include hypoglycaemia, mild digestive side effects and allergic reactions. The main side effect associated with acarbose is flatulence. All these interventions should be avoided in people with kidney or liver problems. Side effects of DPP-4 inhibitors in particular sitagliptin include upper respiratory tract infections, headaches, and diarrhoea. The GLP-1 analogues most common reported side effects are nausea and abdominal fullness.</P>

<P>This is an update of the systematic review conducted in 2006 and no other systematic reviews have been conducted on this topic to date. However, a number of reviews and editorial articles exist (<LINK REF="REF-Appel-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appel 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nabhan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabhan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naik-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naik 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naik-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naik 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pozzilli-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pozzilli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schernthaner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schernthaner 2001</LINK>) .

<P>Adults (age 18 years and over) diagnosed with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with islet autoantibodies.<BR/>This review excludes interventions specifically addressed at children, adolescents, people with type 2 diabetes without antibodies or those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and insulin treated at diagnosis. Those specifically diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (presence of ketones, insulin dependent for life) were defined within this review as having 'classical' type 1 diabetes and not LADA.

<P>The diagnosis of LADA may differ between studies. Patients classified as LADA within a study are included and assumed to have LADA. However, a record of each definition for LADA from each study was included to give a summary of the different classification methods currently in use within the literature. The way LADA is classified will influence the characteristics of the people selected as 'LADA'. For example, selecting patients with high glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) levels will favour the leaner, younger patient with other autoimmune conditions; selecting patients who have not been treated with insulin for more than 12 months will select those with low GAD titre's, more insulin resistance and higher body mass index (<LINK REF="REF-Lohmann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lohmann 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Data were extracted using standard data extraction forms provided by the Cochrane Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group (for details see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). We recorded country of origin, year of study, LADA definition used, average disease duration of participants, average age of participants, intervention used, glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting glucose and C-peptide at baseline and at specific time periods after intervention or placebo, as well as antibody measures. Data extraction and data entry were performed independently in duplicate by two evaluators (SB, SM, HD or HB).

<P>Two independent authors (SB, HD) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. As recommended by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), the following methodological domains were assessed.<BR/>

</TABLE>
<P>We explicitly judged each of these criteria. Two authors (HD or SB or SM or HB) assessed each trial independently. Possible disagreement was resolved by consensus, or with consultation of a third party in case of disagreement. We planned to explore the influence of individual quality criteria in a sensitivity analysis (see under 'sensitivity analyses'). Interrater agreement for key quality indicators (for example concealment of allocation) was calculated using the kappa statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1960</LINK>). In cases of disagreement, the rest of the group would have been consulted and a judgement would have been made based on consensus.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 1019 participants (1060 randomised) were included in the fifteen publications (ten studies). The smallest study included 14 participants and the largest 488 participants. All trials recruited adults with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with the presence of antibodies. However, the selection criteria to define latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) varied with each study (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). Two papers were included as they reported findings for type 2 antibody positive patients (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x002d_Hallin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">L-Hallin 1999</LINK>) . However, these patients were not labelled as LADA within these trials and these were not intervention trials specifically for LADA. The selection criteria for these trials were: Type 2 diabetes patients who failed treatment with sulphonylureas alone (<LINK REF="STD-L_x002d_Hallin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">L-Hallin 1999</LINK>), and people with type 2 diabetes aged 25 to 65 years (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>). In both these studies an extract of results of those positive was provided by the authors. No trials reported ethnicity, therefore we have to assume that the patients recruited were mainly of the ethnicity of the country conducting the trial. There were no selection criteria for disease duration of the participants at entry for the majority of studies. For example, <LINK REF="STD-L_x002d_Hallin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">L-Hallin 1999</LINK> had a mean disease duration of 9.9 years in one arm of the study, <LINK REF="STD-Cabrera_x002d_Rode-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cabrera-Rode 2002</LINK> had one participant with a disease duration of 7 years and seven participants with a duration less than one year.

<LINK REF="STD-Thunander-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thunander 2010</LINK> was a 3 year follow-up study examining insulin alone (n=20) compared to OHA (metformin and/or SU, n=17) and baseline HbA1c was 7.3 (SD 1.3) in the insulin group compared to 7.0 (SD 1.3) in the tablet arm, and at 36 months 7.2 (SD 0.7) and 7.5 (SD 1.5) respectively.

<B>Meta-analysis</B>: A meta-analysis examining insulin alone compared to tablet treatment (SU +/- metformin) was performed combining: <LINK REF="STD-Kobayashi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kobayashi 1996</LINK> (30 months follow-up, tablet SU), <LINK REF="STD-Maruyama-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Maruyama 2008</LINK> (60 months follow-up, tablet SU), <LINK REF="STD-Thunander-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thunander 2010</LINK> (36 months follow-up, tablet metformin+/-SU) and the insulin arm and SU arm in <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2004</LINK> (12 months follow-up). <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2009</LINK> was excluded as the SU arm and insulin only arm were not comparable as the selection criteria stratified the patients based on GADA and FCP level. <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK> was excluded from the initial analysis because the standard deviations of the HbA1c values were not available and patients were stratified based on FBG level. This meta-analysis shows the combined difference in HbA1c change from baseline to study endpoint of -1.3% (95% CI -2.4 to -0.1); P = 0.03, 160 participants, 4 trials, <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. These are the first results of a random-effect meta-analysis and represent the average from the distribution of treatment effects across studies. Heterogeneity is caused by <LINK REF="STD-Kobayashi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kobayashi 1996</LINK> which has the smallest sample size and so more studies will be needed to give more certainty to the intervention effect. <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK> was excluded from this analysis as we did not have the standard deviations for the HbA1c. However, the interquartile range was published as 6.2 to 9.5. This can be used to estimate a standard deviation (3.3/1.3489 = 2.4). This estimated standard deviation (which assumes a normal distribution and assumes that the groups stratified on FBG level have the same standard deviation - both assumptions suspected to be false) was used to examine if the addition of the Davies study changes the findings. Taking those patients stratified with high FBG did not change the findings of the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). In addition, the considerable heterogeneity due to <LINK REF="STD-Kobayashi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kobayashi 1996</LINK> would mean there is still uncertainty in the effect of insulin compared to SU (+/- metformin).</P>
<P>In summary, data suggest that the study examining withdrawal of SU compared to insulin and SU was underpowered for antibody positive patients (<LINK REF="STD-L_x002d_Hallin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">L-Hallin 1999</LINK>). An early pilot study using glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 suggests it could improve metabolic control (<LINK REF="STD-Agardh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Agardh 2005</LINK>). In a Chinese population, Chinese medicine and insulin improved metabolic control when compared to SU treatment. In a Chinese population insulin with rosiglitazone did not improve metabolic control when compared to insulin alone at 12 and 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2005</LINK>). However, metabolic control is improved with rosiglitazone alone when compared to insulin alone at 36 months follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2009</LINK>). In a Cuban population insulin improved metabolic control at 12 months when compared to SU plus insulin (<LINK REF="STD-Cabrera_x002d_Rode-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cabrera-Rode 2002</LINK>). A meta-analysis of insulin alone compared to SU +/- metformin for metabolic control (HbA1c) suggested the patients in the insulin arm showed improved metabolic control in comparison to SU. The average improvement was a HbA1c of 1.3% less in the insulin arm in comparison to SU when baseline levels are taken into account. However, heterogeneity was considerable.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-04 17:03:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>This review systematically examined fifteen publications (ten studies) of interventions aimed at latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) . No studies reported on secondary complications of diabetes, instead proxy measures associated with the development of complications were used such as metabolic control (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose) and natural insulin productions levels (C-peptide) were reported. There are very early pilot data that GAD65 may improve metabolic control. There are no data on the effects of oral agents such as metformin or glitazones alone. Rosiglitazone with insulin or sulphonylureas (SU) with insulin did not improve metabolic control significantly more than insulin alone. However, insulin combined with Chinese medicine improved metabolic control when compared to SU. There is evidence that metabolic control in terms of HbA1c is improved using insulin when compared to tablet treatment (SU). Vitamin D appears to protect the beta-cells when given with insulin compared to insulin alone.</P>
<P>No studies on oral agents or insulin reported adverse events in terms of severe hypoglycaemic attacks. However, the trial with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 reported a number of non-hypoglycaemic adverse events.</P>
<P>There is not enough evidence to examine if any intervention (insulin or SU or glitazone with insulin) affects fasting C-peptide (FCP) levels. GAD65 may maintain C-peptide levels better than placebo in the short term and has shown to be maintained in a certain GAD65 dosage group (20 &#956;g) in the longer term. Stimulated C-peptide was maintained better with insulin than with SU and better with rosiglitazone and insulin together compared to insulin alone.</P>

<P>These results are difficult to generalise as there is a great deal of heterogeneity between studies; differences in selection criteria for LADA (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>), some studies stratifying patients by FBG or GADA titre before randomisation, small sample sizes and lack of description of treatment regimes. In addition, the measurement of the same outcome, C-peptide, was performed differently in every study ranging from an integrated serum C-peptide value (<LINK REF="STD-Maruyama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maruyama 2003</LINK>), glucagon-stimulated C-peptide (<LINK REF="STD-Thunander-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thunander 2010</LINK>) and glucose stimulated delta C-peptide (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2009</LINK>).

<P>The findings of this review represent very early days in our understanding of the best ways of treating LADA as some of the findings are based on studies that were not aimed at LADA patients but were actually aimed at type 2 patients in which retrospective analysis identified some antibody positive patients (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x002d_Hallin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">L-Hallin 1999</LINK>). Others have used outcome measures that are difficult to understand by clinicians and are perhaps only relevant to research studies (<LINK REF="STD-Maruyama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maruyama 2003</LINK>). There is a great deal of heterogeneity in the studies which does affect the meta-analysis' generalizability.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-08-04 15:20:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Sinead Brophy">
<P>There are very few studies examining interventions for LADA. In the studies that exist the selection criteria for LADA varied greatly, some had very low numbers of patients and showed poor quality of reporting the findings (studies selected did not report on randomisation, allocation concealment, follow-up, treatment regimes (for example what insulin regime, what type of conventional treatment, blinding of the analysis, and there was no CONSORT statement for any of the studies) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). </P>

<P>No other systematic reviews have been conducted on this topic.</P>
<P>
<B>Other on-going studies. </B>
</P>
<P>Current ongoing studies are: <LINK REF="STD-Buzzetti-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buzzetti 2006</LINK> examining insulin compared to metformin, <LINK REF="STD-Grill-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Grill 2010</LINK> examining metformin and insulin compared to metformin and sitagliptin +/- repaglinide, <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2010</LINK> examining sitagliptin combined with insulin compared to sitagliptin alone. In addition, number of studies have been started but are no longer ongoing; 1. DiaPep277 for LADA: A Study entitled "Safety, tolerability, immunological and clinical efficacy of multiple subcutaneous doses of DiaPep277 in LADA" was found at the Phase II level to not give enough benefit to continue to the Phase III level. Therefore, the plan to continue with the DiaPep277 trial was stopped. (<LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2009</LINK>). The findings from the Phase II trial have still not been published. 2. Insulin compared to standard care (diet, metformin, metformin with or without glitazones). The primary investigator is Dr S Brophy (author of this review) in Swansea University (<LINK REF="STD-Brophy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Brophy 2007</LINK>). This study closed early due to over 70% of potential participants being initiated on insulin before they could be recruited to the trial. Therefore putting them in the exclusion criteria. The results at closure of study have just been written up (<LINK REF="REF-Brophy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brophy 2011</LINK>). 3. A phase II/III level RCT to investigate if a prime and boost of 20ug Diamyd® (rhGAD65 formulated in Alhydrogel®), administered subcutaneously four weeks apart, can preserve insulin production in patients with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adult (LADA) started in April 2007. The primary investigator is Diamyd Therapeutics AB. This study is registered as ongoing but is not currently recruiting patients (<LINK REF="STD-Agardh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agardh 2004</LINK>). 4. Rosiglitazone and sulphonylurea (SU): A study which compares rosiglitazone with SU is registered as starting in 2000 with results currently being written up but are not yet published (confirmed by email with Palmer (<LINK REF="STD-Palmer--2000" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2000</LINK>) . The study examines fasting C-peptide, antibody levels over three years in 60 patients treated either with rosiglitazone or SU. The primary investigator is Dr Jerry Palmer at Washington University. 5. Oral Insulin: <LINK REF="STD-E_x002d_Longmire-2004" TYPE="STUDY">E-Longmire 2004</LINK> examined if oral insulin improved endogenous insulin retention in insulin dependent diabetes. It was found that oral insulin treatment improved C-peptide responses in patients diagnosed at ages greater than 20 years, best seen at the low (1 mg per day) over the high (10 mg per day) insulin dose (P = 0.003 and P = 0.01, respectively). In patients diagnosed before age 20 years, the 1 mg dose was ineffective, whereas the 10 mg dose actually accelerated C-peptide loss (P = 0.003). The authors concluded that "if confirmed, these findings suggest that diabetic patients over age 20 years with ICA evidence of late-onset immune-mediated diabetes should be considered for oral insulin at 1 mg/day to better retain endogenous insulin secretion". This study is relevant, but failed to provide details of numbers of patients treated, loss to follow-up, intention-to-treat and methods of randomisation or concealment of treatment during analysis. Therefore, the results were not reported as part of this review.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-04 14:47:40 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Sinead Brophy">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-08-04 14:47:40 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Sinead Brophy">
<P>There is no significant evidence that sulphonylureas (SU) could be preferable to other forms of treatment of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). Some evidence from meta-analysis suggests that insulin is preferable for metabolic control (however, there is considerable heterogeneity) and there is some evidence that SU may bring about earlier insulin dependence (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maruyama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maruyama 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maruyama-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Maruyama 2008</LINK>). Therefore, SU should not be a first line treatment agent of antibody positive LADA patients. However, this review has not found any evidence to chose or reject any other possible intervention. Taking results from <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2005</LINK>, patients who are poorly controlled in the beginning and are antibody positive are likely to progress to insulin quickly. Antibody positive patients who have good control can remain on standard treatment (oral therapy excluding SU) until insulin treatment is needed for control. Taking results from <LINK REF="STD-Maruyama-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maruyama 2003</LINK>, patients with high glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) titre may be less likely to progress to insulin dependence if given insulin early. Therefore, poorly controlled, high GAD titre patients could benefit from early insulin. Other innovative therapies administered with insulin, including vitamin D and Chinese remedies appear to preserve beta cell function better than insulin alone. There is early evidence that GAD65 may be useful in LADA.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-07-20 18:26:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>There is a need for more high quality trials investigating therapies (both established and innovative) in LADA with longer-term follow-up. Further studies are required to examine:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Insulin treatment compared to metformin or glitazones (with the exception of rosiglitazone) for metabolic control and C-peptide levels.</LI>
<LI>Impact of different treatment strategies on long-term complications of LADA (retinopathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, nephropathy) and total mortality.</LI>
<LI>Impact of different treatments strategies on health-related quality of life.</LI>
<LI>Impact of different treatments on costs and health service utilization.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Future studies should use the CONSORT statement and should perform power calculations. It would improve generalizability if future studies recorded clinically relevant outcomes such as HbA1c or fasting glucose levels, if a standard definition of LADA and a common method of measuring stimulated C-peptide could be used.<BR/>
