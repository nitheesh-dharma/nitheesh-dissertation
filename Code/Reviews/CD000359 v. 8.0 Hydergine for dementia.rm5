<TITLE>Uncertainty about the efficacy of hydergine in dementia</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-03-27 16:08:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Hydergine has been used to treat patients with either dementia, or 'age-related' cognitive symptoms. Hydergine may offer benefit to some patients, possibly at doses of 4.5 to 9.0 mg per day, with possibly greater benefit to younger subjects and inpatients. The statistical evidence for efficacy in 'possible or probable Alzheimer's disease' patients was so modest however that one additional statistically non-significant trial would have reduced the results to non significance; evidence for efficacy in vascular dementia rested on relatively stronger effects for hydergine on clinical ratings; and effective doses may be higher than 3 mg/d (i.e., than that currently approved in the USA). Despite its availability for 40 years, the circumstances of hydergine's efficacy in dementia syndromes have not been adequately researched, and have yet to be precisely defined.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-03-27 16:10:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-03-27 16:09:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Currently hydergine is used almost exclusively for treating patients with either dementia, or 'age-related' cognitive symptoms. Since the early 1980s there have been over a dozen more clinical trials, yet hydergine's efficacy remains uncertain. Although previous reviews offer generally favourable support for hydergine's efficacy, they were, however, limited by a bias with respect to the particular clinical studies chosen (e.g., the inclusion of case reports, and uncontrolled trials), and by authors' impressionistic assessments of results. Not surprisingly, there has been a lack of consensus among reviewers with regard to the efficacy of hydergine.</P>
<P>In 1994, a meta-analysis was published by the present reviewers who reported that overall, hydergine was more effective than placebo. However they also observed that the statistical evidence for efficacy in 'possible or probable Alzheimer's disease' patients was so modest that one additional statistically non-significant trial would have reduced the results to non-significance.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Because of uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of hydergine, the goals of this overview were to assess its overall effect in patients with possible dementia, and to investigate potential moderators of an effect.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-03-27 16:10:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>The trials were identified from a searches of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources on 2 March 2009 using the terms hydergin*, ergoloid* and dihydroergo*. Two proprietary databases were also searched. Published reviews were inspected for further sources.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-06-20 14:14:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Trials to be included must be randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, and unconfounded comparisons of hydergine with placebo for a treatment duration of greater than one week in subjects with dementia or symptoms consistent with dementia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-20 14:15:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Data were extracted independently by the reviewers, pooled where appropriate and possible, and the pooled odds ratios (95% CI) or the average differences (95% CI) were estimated. Where possible, intention-to-treat data were used.</P>
<P>Outcomes of interest included clinical global impressions of change and comprehensive rating scales. Potential moderating variables of a treatment effect included: inpatient/outpatient status, trial duration, age, sex, medication dose, publication year, and diagnostic grouping.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-03-27 16:08:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>There were a total of 19 trials that met inclusion criteria and that had data sufficient for analysis.</P>
<P>Thirteen trials reported sufficient information to use a global rating of improvement and nine trials provided information on a comprehensive rating scale. Three trials provided both outcome measures.</P>
<P>It was not possible to use many of the published results in a combined analysis owing to the lack of sufficient data to perform statistical analyses.</P>
<P>For the 12 trials that used global ratings, there was a significant effect favouring hydergine (OR 3.78, 95% CI, 2.72 to 5.27). For the nine trials that used comprehensive ratings, there was a significant mean difference favouring hydergine (WMD 0.96, 95%CI, 0.54 to 1.37).</P>
<P>Hydergine was well tolerated in these trials, with 78% of randomized subjects available for data analyses.</P>
<P>Greater effect sizes on global ratings were associated with younger age, and possibly higher dose, although most of the subgroup analyses were statistically insignificant.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>As in an earlier systematic review, we found hydergine to show significant treatment effects when assessed by either global ratings or comprehensive rating scales (based here on a smaller set of trials than in the earlier published systematic review because trials were required to have data that could conform with MetaView, the Cochrane Collaboration statistics software). The small number of trials available for analysis, however, limited the ability of subgroup analyses to identify statistically significant moderating effects.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, most of the randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials of hydergine were conducted and published before the advent of consensus-based diagnostic standards of dementia in 1984; therefore diagnostic criteria were less specific. As a result, uncertainty remains regarding hydergine's efficacy in dementia.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-03-27 16:17:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-06-20 14:16:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Hydergine, the brand name for a specific combination of four dihydro derivatives of ergotoxine, also referred to as ergoloid mesylates, was introduced to clinical medicine in 1949. It has been used in the past as a treatment for peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, angina pectoris, and tinnitus. Currently, it is used almost exclusively for treating patients with either dementia, or 'age-related' cognitive symptoms. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has approved hydergine for 'idiopathic decline in mental capacity'. In some countries hydergine is marketed as a non-disease-specific cognitive enhancer.</P>
<P>Of note, the drug has also been advocated as a so-called 'smart drug', for use by cognitively intact young and older adults to 'increase mental abilities'.</P>
<P>As early as 1981, <LINK REF="STD-Jarvik-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvik 1981</LINK> identified limitations in the hydergine medical literature, including the lack of diagnostic rigor, and the use of crude outcome instruments, finding that there was "no convincing consistent improvement in memory, learning, or other cognitive functions." Yet, she also observed that statistically significant improvement in confusion was reported in approximately 50% of studies. <LINK REF="STD-Jarvik-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Jarvik 1981</LINK> concluded that hydergine "may help some patients with some of their activities of daily living, some of their symptoms, and their self-care...But, overall, the improvements...are very small..."</P>
<P>Since that time there have been over a dozen more clinical trials, yet hydergine's efficacy remains uncertain. Although previous reviews offer generally favorable support for hydergine's efficacy, they were, however, limited by a bias with respect to the particular clinical studies chosen (eg, the inclusion of case reports, and uncontrolled trials), and by authors' impressionistic assessments of results. Not surprisingly, there has been a lack of consensus among reviewers with regard to the efficacy of hydergine.</P>
<P>In 1994, a meta-analysis was published by the present reviewers (<LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1994</LINK>) who reported that overall, hydergine was more effective than placebo as assessed by comprehensive ratings, clinical global ratings, and combined cognitive measures. Inpatient status, high daily doses, and vascular dementia were generally associated with larger effect sizes. The effect in patients who likely would have fulfilled criteria for 'possible or probable Alzheimer's disease' (ie, <LINK REF="REF-DSM-III" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM III</LINK> or <LINK REF="REF-NINCDS_x002d_ADRA" TYPE="REFERENCE">NINCDS-ADRA</LINK> criteria) was significant only for combined neuropsychological measures in the five trials identified.</P>
<P>The present reviewers observed that the statistical evidence for efficacy in 'possible or probable Alzheimer's disease' patients was so modest that one additional statistically non-significant trial would have reduced the results to non significance; evidence for efficacy in vascular dementia rested on relatively stronger effects for hydergine on clinical ratings; and effective doses may be higher than 3 mg/d (ie, than that currently approved in the USA).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the overall effect of hydergine in patients with dementia and to investigate variables that might moderate the effect.</P>
<P>Additional reasons to undertake this review are to test for significant consensus among trials that may have contradictory findings; to gather potential information about efficacy which can be revealed only by assessing systematic variations in study design, data characteristics, and methodology; and to assess the development of a particular research domain.</P>

<P>
<I>The Cochrane Library,</I> MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, many ongoing trial databases and other grey literature sources were searched separately on 2 March 2009 for the latest records. The search terms used to identify relevant controlled trials on dementia, Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment for the Group's Specialized Register can be found in the Group's module on <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. These search terms were combined with the following search terms and adapted for each database, where appropriate: hydergin*, ergoloid* and dihydroergo*. See <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for the sources searched and number of hits retrieved.</P>
<P>Further trials were identified by Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation in 1991, who provided lists of published and unpublished reports under their sponsorship. These included reports supporting an original submission to a National Academy of Sciences--Medical Research Panel in 1974, and a subsequent submission to the Drug Safety and Efficacy Study Implementation.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Selection of studies</LI>
</UL>
<P>A single reviewer (JO) discarded irrelevant citations, based on the title of the publication and its abstract. Any suggestion that an article could possibly be relevant, caused it to be retrieved for further assessment.</P>
<P>Two reviewers (AL and SL) independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review from the culled citation list. Disagreements were resolved by discussion by a third reviewer (JO).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Quality Assessment</LI>
</UL>
<P>The same two reviewers (AL and SL) assessed the methodological quality of each trial using the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Category A (adequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) some form of centralized randomized scheme, such as having to provide details of an enrolled participant to an office by phone to receive the treatment group allocation; (ii) some form of randomization scheme controlled by a pharmacy; (iii) numbered or coded containers, such as in a pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administrated sequentially to enrolled participants; (iv) an on-site or coded computer system, given that the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant; or (v) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes; (vi) other combinations of described elements of the process that provides assurance of adequate concealment.</P>
<P>Category B (intermediate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) use of a "list" of "table" to allocate assignments; (ii) use of "envelopes" or "sealed envelopes"; (iii) stating the study as "randomised" without further detail.</P>
<P>Category C (inadequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) alternation; (ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of week, or any other such approach; (iii) any allocation procedure that is entirely transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random numbers or assignments.</P>
<P>Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias. Trials with unclear concealment measures have been shown to yield more pronounced estimates of treatment effects than trials that have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation schedules, but less pronounced than inadequately concealed trials (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Thus trials are included if they conform to categories A or B, and those falling into category C were excluded.</P>
<P>Other aspects of trial quality are not assessed by a scoring system although details were noted of blinding, whether intention-to-treat analyses were extractable from the published data, and the number of patients lost to follow-up.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Data extraction</LI>
</UL>
<P>Data were independently extracted by the same two reviewers and cross-checked by a third reviewer (AN). Any discrepancies were discussed.</P>
<P>For comprehensive rating scales, data were required to provide either: (a) means and standard deviations for pre- and post-tests, (b) means and standard deviations for change scores, (c) individual data for each patient in the trial. For global ratings, data were required to provide either: (a) the percentage of responders for both drug and placebo groups, (b) frequencies of responders for both drug and placebo groups, (c) individual data for each patient in the trial.</P>
<P>In studies where a crossover design was used, only data from the first treatment period were eligible for inclusion.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Data analysis</LI>
</UL>
<P>For continuous or ordinal variables, such as comprehensive rating scales, the main outcome of interest was the change in score from baseline (i.e. pre-randomisation or at randomisation) to the final assessment. If ordinal scale data appear to be approximately normally distributed or if the analysis that the investigators performed suggested parametric tests were appropriate, then the outcome measures were treated as continuous data.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes such as global ratings, the endpoint itself is of interest and the Peto method of the 'typical odds ratio' used.</P>
<P>A test for heterogeneity of the treatment effect between the trials was made using a standard chi-squared statistic. If a test of heterogeneity was negative then a weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials, the 'typical odds ratio' (i.e. the odds of an unfavourable outcome amongst treatment-allocated patients to the corresponding odds amongst controls) was calculated using Peto's log-rank test adapted for ordinal data (EBCTCG, 1990). If, however, there was evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results were pooled, or a random effects model used (in which case the confidence intervals would be broader than a fixed effects model).</P>
<P>Additional hypotheses tested were that hydergine had no differential effect, when compared with placebo, for certain subgroups of patients:</P>
<P>1. Age (stratified into 65-75 and 75-85 years).<BR/>2. Sex (stratified into &lt; 51% male, &gt;50% male).<BR/>3. Diagnosis (Alzheimer's Disease, Vascular Dementia, Primary Dementia, Cerebral Deterioration, Cerebral Insufficiency).<BR/>4. Dose (1.5-3.0mg/d and 4.0-9.0mg/d).<BR/>5. Duration of treatment (&lt;10 weeks, 12-16 weeks, &gt;23 weeks).<BR/>6. Inpatient or outpatient status.<BR/>7. Publication year (stratified into 1955-1973 and 1974-1990).</P>

<P>Eighteen trials were designed to compare hydergine with placebo. One trial compared hydergine to placebo with a multivitamin and 600mg of potassium (t.i.d.). The dose of hydergine and method of dose determination varied widely. In some trials, different doses of hydergine were used within the same study. Eighteen trials tested a single dose of hydergine. One trial tested 1.5mg per day, 7 trials tested 3mg per day, 6 trials tested 4.5mg per day, 2 trials tested 6mg per day, 1 trial tested 7.5mg per day, and 2 trials had different fixed doses within the same study. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hollister-1955" TYPE="STUDY">Hollister 1955</LINK>) started at 4mg per day for 30 days, reducing the dose to 3mg per day for 15 days and 2mg per day for the final 15 days. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-Loveren-1984" TYPE="STUDY">van Loveren 1984</LINK>) started at 4.5mg per day for 12 weeks and increased the dose to 7.5mg per day for the remaining 12 weeks.<BR/>

<LI>Outcome measures</LI>

<P>The outcome measures fall within the general groupings of (1) comprehensive rating scales, (2) clinical global impressions and (3) neuropsychological tests scores. Neuropsychological tests were not used as a separate outcome because there were insufficient trials reporting data for analysis (N=7). Within these groups there is a wide variety of scales. A few of the better known ones were used in the majority of trials, but there are many scales which are less well known and which display varying degrees of comparability whilst purporting to measure the same outcome. The number of subjects who failed to compete the trial, and of subjects who were omitted from analyses were reported.</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Most of the included trials have significant methodological limitations by current standards, primarily due to sample selection. Eleven of the included trials were published prior to 1980, with one paper published as early as 1955. Only one trial used <LINK REF="REF-NINCDS_x002d_ADRA" TYPE="REFERENCE">NINCDS-ADRA</LINK> criteria for AD. All trials were parallel group designs, and most subjects (77.9%) were able to complete the protocol.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>There were a total of 19 trials that met inclusion criteria and that had data sufficient for analysis. Trials were published between 1955 and 1990 (modal year =1973).</P>
<P>There were 12 trials that provided data on global improvement. The analyses gave statistically significant results in favour of treatment (OR 3.78; 95%CI 2.52 - 5.27), though only 7 of the trials showed statistically significant effects. In addition, the trials were significantly heterogeneous.</P>
<P>Nine trials that provided data regarding change on comprehensive rating scales were significantly heterogeneous. The analyses gave statistically significant results in favour of treatment (WMD 0.96; 95%CI 0.54 - 1.37), though only five trials showed statistically significant effects.</P>
<P>SUBGROUP ANALYSES<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Age</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials were divided into two groups based on younger (65-75 years) and older (76-85 years) subjects. Using global ratings, the four trials with younger subjects showed a greater effect (OR 7.72; 95%CI 3.41 - 17.52) than the seven trials with older subjects (OR 3.09; 95%CI 2.11 - 4.52), though the difference was not statistically significant. Using comprehensive rating scales, a similar finding occurred with the three trials with younger subjects showing a greater effect (WMD 1.48; 95%CI -0.05 - 3.01), than the three trials with older subjects (WMD 0.83; 95%CI 0.40 - 1.27), though the difference was non-significant, and the trials with younger subjects, the treatment effect was statistically significant.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sex</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials were divided into two groups based on the presence of male subjects (0-50%, 51-100%). For global ratings, the seven trials with fewer male subjects showed a similar effect (OR 3.65; 95%CI 2.37 - 5.63) to the four trials with more male subjects (OR 3.61 95%CI 2.02 - 6.46). For comprehensive rating scales, the six trials with fewer male subjects showed a smaller effect (WMD 0.90; 95%CI 0.48 - 1.32) than the two trials with more male subjects (WMD 2.66; 95%CI -0.41 - 5.74) though the difference was not statistically significant, and the latter mean effect was not statistically significant.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Diagnosis</LI>
</UL>
<P>The trials were divided into five diagnostic groups (AD, Vascular Dementia, Primary Dementia, Cerebral Deterioration, Cerebral Insufficiency). Using global ratings, the three trials with primary dementia diagnoses (OR 7.46; 95%CI 3.35 - 16.54) showed the greatest effect size, followed by the four trials with cerebral insufficiency diagnoses (OR 4.65; 95%CI 2.74 - 7.89), the three trials with cerebral deterioration diagnoses (OR 3.07; 95%CI 1.67 - 5.63), and the two trials with vascular dementia (OR 1.43; 95%CI 0.58 - 3.49). None of the differences among diagnostic groupings was statistically significant, and the effect for the vascular dementia trial was nonsignificant. Using comprehensive ratings, the two trials with AD diagnoses did not show a statistically significant treatment effect (WMD 3.04; 95%CI -0.39 - 6.47), though the effect was greater than in the four trials with primary dementia diagnoses (WMD 2.16; 95%CI -0.58 - 3.75) and the three trials with cerebral deterioration diagnoses (WMD 0.83; 95%CI 0.40 - 1.27).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Dose Response</LI>
</UL>
<P>Studies were divided into two groups based on low (1.5-3.0mg/d) and high (4.0-9.0mg/d) daily dose. Using global ratings, the 8 trials with higher doses had a greater effect (OR 4.39; 95%CI 2.99 - 6.45) than the 4 trials with lower doses (OR 2.48; 95%CI 1.29 - 4.75), though the difference was not statistically significant. Using comprehensive rating scales, the 2 trials with lower doses (WMD 2.52; 95%CI -0.37 - 5.42) showed a greater effect than the 7 trials with higher doses (WMD 0.93; 95%CI 0.51 - 1.34), though the difference was not statistically significant. In addition, the trials with lower doses did not show an overall statistically significant effect.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Duration</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials were divided into three groups: short (&lt; 10 weeks), medium (12-16 weeks), and long (&gt; 23 weeks). There were no significant differences between groupings, with the 6 trials of medium duration showing similar efficacy (OR 4.07; 95%CI 2.40 - 6.88) to the four trials of long duration (OR 3.86; 95%CI 2.44 - 6.09). The two trials of short duration did not show a statistically significant effect (OR 2.28; 95%CI 0.69 - 7.55). Using comprehensive ratings, there was only one short duration trial compared with five medium duration (WMD 2.26; 95%CI 0.93 - 3.58) and three long duration trials (WMD 0.79; 95%CI 0.35 - 1.22). The trials of medium duration showed a statistically significant difference from trials of long duration.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Inpatient Status</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials were divided into an inpatient and outpatient group. Using global ratings, all ranges showed significant effects. There was only one outpatient trial compared to nine inpatient trials (OR 3.46; 95%CI 2.30 - 5.19). Using comprehensive ratings, the three inpatient trials showed a greater effect (WMD 1.46; 95%CI 0.34 - 2.57) compared with the four outpatient trials (WMD 0.85; 95%CI 0.40 - 1.29); though the difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Publication Year</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials were divided into two groups based on year of publication: early (1955-1973) and late (1974-1990). Using global ratings, all ranges showed significant effects. The early trials showed a similar effect (OR 3.76; 95%CI 2.33 - 6.06) to the late trials (OR 3.81; 95%CI 2.41 - 6.03). Using comprehensive ratings, there was only one early trial compared with eight late trials (WMD 0.91; 95%CI 0.49 - 1.33); thus, a subgroup analysis was made.</P>
<P>Adverse events were not reported in a systematic manner in most of the trials so making formal comparison difficult. Seventy-seven percent of the subjects completed the trials and had data available for analysis.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-03-27 16:17:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>In the two rating areas assessed, the results of this overview seem to demonstrate a heterogeneous, statistical treatment effect for hydergine, consistent with our earlier report, though about half of the trials individually showed nonsignificant effects. In particular, our results suggest that hydergine may be more likely to benefit younger subjects rather than older and inpatients rather than outpatients, though these findings were not statistically significant. In addition, higher doses may offer a greater benefit.</P>
<P>To maintain an adequate level of methodological rigor, only trials that were double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-group in design were included in this overview. In addition trials were required to report sufficient data to use the Cochrane Collaboration software. Despite these selection criteria, individual trials still may have contained methodological problems.</P>
<P>For example, historical factors may have biased findings in favour of hydergine: Most of the trials were published prior to 1980 and earlier trials tended to report their outcomes more selectively. The use of analyses - wherein only subjects who complete a trial are analysed for efficacy - in the vast majority of published trials, may have biased the outcomes toward greater effects for hydergine because dropouts may have been less likely to benefit from treatment. Historical factors in the rendering of diagnoses could have biased effect sizes because the majority of trials were reported before stringent diagnostic standards were in widespread use.<BR/>
<BR/>Apart from methodological biases that could positively skew effect sizes, these analyses, by design, provide no direct information about onset or duration of action within each trial; nor do they provide information on direction of change over time for hydergine or placebo. Thus, it remains unclear whether the hydergine group actually improved, or merely deteriorated more slowly than the placebo group.</P>
<P>The small sample sizes of most trials (Mean, 67 subjects; range, 19-274) contributed to the frequency of statistically nonsignificant trials. The statistical power of the average-sized hydergine trial in our earlier published review suggested that 144 subjects would be needed to ensure a type II error rate of 20 percent. Even a trial of this size may have been insensitive to cognitive change in dementia, as evidenced by current trials of drugs considered more potent than hydergine.</P>
<P>A general 'publication bias', whereby trials with significant results tend to be reported and those with nonsignificant results do not, may have increased the reported effect sizes. This becomes a critical issue in any meta analysis where the effect sizes are modest in magnitude. An effort was made, however, to identify all trials, including unpublished ones. Three unpublished trials were included in these analyses. These trials largely resulted in nonsignificant outcomes, tending to give a more conservative estimate of hydergine's effect.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hydergine in possible Alzheimer's and vascular dementia</HEADING>
<P>None of the Alzheimer's trials included a global rating. The two trials with comprehensive rating scales showed a nonsignificant effect. On the other hand, the two vascular dementia trials did not have a comprehensive rating that could be analysed and when global ratings were used, the effect was again equivocal. These results are difficult to compare with our earlier review because of the smaller number of trials.</P>
<P>A total of only 94 subjects were included in these two trials, much less than the number of subjects in typical, current multicenter trials for an Alzheimer's drug, and about a third the number from our earlier review. Clearly, the effect of hydergine in patients with possible Alzheimer's dementia has not been adequately researched.</P>
<P>An adequately designed clinical trial would need to include over 200 moderately impaired subjects, require a dose ranging between 4.5 and 9.0 mg/day (ie, greater than the approved dosage in the United States), track outcome over a duration of at least 24 weeks, and a relevant neuropsychological test battery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Conclusions</HEADING>
<P>Little evidence for the efficacy of hydergine in placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials rests on observations that hydergine shows statistical effects on global and comprehensive measures, and the suggestion that effects are stronger with higher doses. The apparent dose-response relationship (ie, doses greater than 4.5 mg/day were more effective than lower doses) suggests that an adequate hydergine dose may be higher than the dose approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
<P>There was little evidence that hydergine's effect varied by diagnosis, owing, probably, to the small number of trials.</P>
<P>Because hydergine's effects were significant at higher doses, it may be a useful comparator medication in clinical trials with new, investigational drugs with putative cognitive activity (as has been done in one study previously). Overall, patients with a primary dementia show effects with hydergine. Yet, despite its availability for 40 years, the circumstances of hydergine's efficacy in dementia syndromes have not been adequately researched, and have yet to be precisely defined.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-06-20 14:18:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Hydergine showed a significant treatment effect compared with placebo. The results of this review suggest that hydergine may offer benefit to some patients, possibly at doses of 4.5 to 9.0 mg per day, with possibly greater benefit to younger subjects and inpatients.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-06-20 14:18:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Despite the large number of trials performed using hydergine, future trials are needed in clinically diagnosed subjects with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia. In particular, trials using higher doses of the medication (e.g., 9 mg/d) are warranted. Finally, studies that assess long-term use of hydergine and its ability to affect the course of disease would be appropriate.</P>
