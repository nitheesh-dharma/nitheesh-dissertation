<P>Human breast milk provides good nutrition for term infants for growth and has benefits for immunity and maternal-infant bonding. It may, however, contain insufficient quantities of some nutrients and calories to meet the needs for adequate growth of an infant born prematurely unless fed in large volumes. Fats provide approximately half of the calories in human milk and the milk contains components (bile-salt stimulated lipase) that help digest the fat. The fat component in some commercial human milk fortifiers is often in very low quantities because of concerns that preterm infants will deposit fat tissue to a greater extent than when in the uterus. They also have relatively poor digestion and absorption of fat with their immature digestive systems. Supplementing with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), which are more easily digested than long-chain fats, may provide a ready source of energy for preterm infants for growth and neuronal development. The review authors searched the medical literature and found only one small randomised controlled trial (14 infants) investigating the effectiveness of human milk fat supplements with vitamins and minerals (calcium and phosphate). Growth was similar with and without fat supplement over the short study period. One infant in the fat supplement group developed feeding intolerance and there were no reports of damaging inflammation of the gut (necrotizing<BR/>enterocolitis).</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>For term infants, human milk provides adequate nutrition to facilitate growth, as well as potential beneficial effects on immunity and the maternal-infant emotional state. However, the role of human milk in premature infants is less well defined as it contains insufficient quantities of some nutrients to meet the estimated needs of the infant. There are potential short term and long term benefits from human milk, although observational studies have suggested that infants fed formula have a higher rate of growth than infants who are breast fed. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The main objective is to determine if addition of supplemental fat to human milk leads to improved growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes without significant adverse effects in preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Collaborative Review Group was used. This includes searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE (1966-Apr 2002), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences and symposia proceedings, expert informants, journal handsearching mainly in the English language.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All trials utilizing random or quasi-random allocation to supplementation of human milk with fat or no supplementation in preterm infants within a hospital were eligible.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Collaborative Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by each author and synthesis of data using relative risk and weighted mean difference.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Results are available for only one small study evaluating the effects of fat supplementation. There are insufficient data to evaluate short term or long term growth outcomes and neurodevelopmental outcomes. There are insufficient data to comment on potential adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for practice. Further research should evaluate the practice of supplementation of human milk with fat. This may best be done in the context of the development of multicomponent fortifiers. Both short term growth outcomes and long term growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes should be evaluated. Adverse effects should be evaluated.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Human milk is the recommended nutritional source for full-term infants in at least the first six months of postnatal life. It is known that in this group of infants, breast milk supplies adequate substrate to meet the infant's nutritional demands, as well as supplying the infant with other substances that may afford some physiological advantage (for example, immunoglobulins and gastrointestinal hormones). Breast feeding may also contribute to maternal-infant bonding.</P>
<P>However, the role of human milk in preterm infants is less well defined. The nutrient content of preterm human milk provides insufficient quantities of protein, sodium, phosphate and calcium to meet the estimated needs of the infant. In addition, large fluid volumes may be required to provide sufficient calories to maintain adequate growth. Studies have shown that preterm infants fed human milk have lower than expected growth rates than infants fed a modified, preterm infant formula (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Calvert-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calvert 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fat provides approximately 50% of the calories supplied in human milk, although the exact content can vary both between and within individuals, depending on the time of the day and the phase of lactation at which milk is collected (for example, hindmilk obtained at the end of nursing has a higher fat content). Fat separates from human milk when left standing and may adhere to collection containers and delivery devices, so the delivery method may impact on the eventual provision of calories. Preterm infants have relatively poor digestion and absorption of fat, due partly to immaturity of the various lipases in the gut (<LINK REF="REF-Zoppi-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zoppi 1972</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lebenthal-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lebenthal 1980</LINK>) and decreased bile salt secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Norman-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1972</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Signer-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Signer 1974</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Watkins-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkins 1975</LINK>). The presence of bile-salt stimulated lipase in human milk may be important in improving the availability of the contained lipids to preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Hamosh-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamosh 1987</LINK>). An alternative approach is to provide fat supplements as medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), which are absorbed without the need for initial cleavage in the gut, and may therefore be more readily used by the preterm infant.</P>

</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Only two studies were identified which met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK>). Data were extractable only for <LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK>. Details of this study are included in the table "Characteristics of Included Studies".</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK> assigned infants to receive either fat (1g human milk fat per 100ml of human milk) or no supplementation. Two other arms of the study evaluated supplementation with protein alone and protein and fat. The intervention was commenced once the infants were tolerating enteral feeds at 170ml/kg/day and was ceased when the infants were breast fed or weighed 2200g. Supplemental vitamins and minerals (calcium and phosphate) were given to all infants.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK> was excluded. Infants were randomised by alternate allocation to no supplementation, supplementation with protein, supplementation with fat (medium-chain triglyceride, MCT), or supplementation with both protein and fat (MCT). The authors state that there was no apparent effect from the addition of fat alone and, therefore, combined the groups according to protein supplementation. Data were not able to be extracted for the group of infants receiving only MCT.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK> randomised by sealed envelopes and investigators were double-blinded. Eight infants were randomised to the fat supplementation arm and eight to the unsupplemented (control) arm. Results are reported for seven infants in each group, and additional information has been received for the two infants excluded (Dr S.Polberger). One control infant was excluded because of apnoea, and one treatment infant was excluded because of feeding intolerance.</P>
<P>Growth was calculated using a regression of growth parameters against time. The slope of the regression was converted to units of g/kg/day and cm/week for the study period.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Results for this single trial are reported for only 14 infants. </P>
<P>There were no significant differences in weight gain (WMD 0.60 g/kg/day, 95% CI -2.36 to 3.56 g/kg/day), linear (WMD 0.10 cm/week, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.28 cm/week) or head growth (WMD 0.15 cm/week, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.37 cm/week) over the short term study period.</P>
<P>There were no cases of necrotizing enterocolitis in those infants for whom results are reported. Feeding intolerance (undefined) occurred in one infant in the treatment group.</P>
<P>This study did not evaluate any of the other prespecified outcomes (long term growth, neurodevelopmental outcome, or other adverse gastrointestinal disturbance).</P>
<P>No subgroup analysis could be performed to separately assess the effects of MCT supplementation and other forms of fat supplementation.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The evidence concerning the effects of supplementation of human milk with fat is scanty. A single trial did not show any short term benefit of the addition of fat to human milk in preterm infants. Although the study by <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK> was excluded, the authors similarly commented that fat supplementation did not demonstrate any effect on growth. However, the numbers of infants studied is too small to say that the addition of fat to human milk is associated either with benefits or adverse events.</P>
<P>Fat is a component in some commercial multicomponent human milk fortifiers - often in very low quantities. Fat has some theoretical advantages over other energy sources such as protein and carbohydrate in that it provides more calories per gram than protein and carbohydrate, does not appear to be associated with metabolic imbalance (unlike protein), and may result in a lower respiratory quotient and therefore less carbon dioxide production than carbohydrate supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Pereira-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 1994</LINK>). There are concerns, however, about the quality of growth in preterm infants - namely, that fat accretion or deposition in these infants may be greater than that of fetuses in utero even when not supplemented with excessive quantities of fat (<LINK REF="REF-Reichman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichman 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Putet-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Putet 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-de-Gamarra-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Gamarra 1987</LINK>). It is unknown whether this results in any long term advantage or disadvantage.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence evaluating the supplementation of human milk with fat in preterm infants to make recommendations for practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Research should be directed towards evaluating short term and long term growth outcomes in preterm infants supplemented with fat, although it may be most appropriate to do so in the context of evaluation of the effects of different formulations of multicomponent (carbohydrate, protein, minerals) fortifiers. Research should take into account adverse effects such as feed intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis, and diarrhea. Studies should also evaluate potential effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes. The number of subjects required to evaluate long term outcomes would be extremely large.</P>

<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>This study had four arms - unsupplemented vs. supplemented with protein, vs. supplemented with fat, vs. supplemented with fat and protein. Supplementation with protein alone and protein in combination with fat are discussed in other reviews on protein and multicomponent fortification respectively. 34 infants were enrolled in all four study arms - 6 infants were withdrawn following randomization (reasons discussed in separate reviews). 7 infants were left in each arm.<BR/>There were large fluctuations in the energy intake for all four groups across the study.</P>
