<P>
<B>Review Question</B>
</P>
<P>This review summarises the evidence from randomised controlled trials that test whether Reiki if beneficial for people with anxiety or depression.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Reiki is a non-drug treatment that is used on people with anxiety, depression or both. Reiki is a 2500 year old treatment, described as a vibrational or subtle energy therapy and is most commonly facilitated by light touch on or above the body. But there is no systematic review of randomised trials evaluating whether it works in this group of people.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found three studies for inclusion in the review. One recruited males with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of prostate cancer who were not receiving chemotherapy and had elected to receive external-beam radiation therapy; the second study recruited community-living participants who were aged 55 years and older; the third study recruited university students.These studies included people with anxiety or depression or both, and reported their results separately. This included only 25 people with anxiety, 17 with depression and 20 more with either anxiety or depression but which was not specified. The search is up to date as of 4 November 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Very few people with anxiety or depression or both have been included in randomised studies. This means there is insufficient evidence to make any comment about the usefulness of Reiki for the treatment of anxiety and depression.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>At best, the quality of the evidence is moderate which, on top of a dearth of evidence, weakens the findings further.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-11 10:07:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  R Davies">
<P>Anxiety and depression affect many people. Treatments do not have complete success and often require people to take drugs for long periods of time. Many people look for other treatments that may help. One of those is Reiki, a 2500 year old treatment described as a vibrational or subtle energy therapy, and is most commonly facilitated by light touch on or above the body. There have been reports of Reiki alleviating anxiety and depression, but no specific systematic review.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-23 14:18:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Search of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - all years), the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR - all years), EMBASE, (1974 to November 2014), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to November 2014) and AMED (1985 to November 2014). Additional searches were carried out on the World Health Organization Trials Portal (ICTRP) together with ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any ongoing or unpublished studies. All searches were up to date as of 4 November 2014.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-11 02:41:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="G Peter Herbison">
<P>We found three studies for inclusion in the review. One recruited males with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of non-metastatic prostate cancer who were not receiving chemotherapy and had elected to receive external-beam radiation therapy; the second study recruited community-living participants who were aged 55 years and older; the third study recruited university students.</P>
<P>These studies included subgroups with anxiety and depression as defined by symptom scores and provided data separately for those subgroups. As this included only 25 people with anxiety and 17 with depression and 20 more with either anxiety or depression, but which was not specified, the results could only be reported narratively. They show no evidence that Reiki is either beneficial or harmful in this population. The risk of bias for the included studies was generally rated as unclear or high for most domains, which reduces the certainty of the evidence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-11 02:50:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="G Peter Herbison">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-11 02:38:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="G Peter Herbison">
<P>Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent disorders and are often comorbid with each other. The Burden of Disease Project reported that mental disorders account for 9.1% of the global burden of disease in the world, almost one-half of which is accounted for by anxiety and depressive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anxiety is a natural response and a necessary warning adaptation in humans. However, anxiety can become a pathologic disorder when it is excessive and uncontrollable, requires no specific external stimulus, and manifests with a wide range of physical and affective symptoms as well as changes in behaviour and cognition (<LINK REF="REF-Rowney-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowney 2014</LINK>). Anxiety disorders include generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia), specific phobia, panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety secondary to medical condition, acute stress disorder (ASD), and substance-induced anxiety disorder, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). In a community sample, the one-year prevalence for GAD was approximately 3%, with a lifetime prevalence of 5% (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). For acute anxiety disorder, prevalence ranged from 14% to 33% in individuals exposed to severe trauma (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). Community-based studies suggest a lifetime prevalence for PTSD of 8% of the USA adult population (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). As these definitions are redefined occasionally future versions of this review will use the most recent definitions.</P>
<P>Depressive disorders include major depressive disorder, major depressive episode, depressive disorders not otherwise specified and dysthymic disorder, as defined by DSM-IV. According to DSM-IV the lifetime prevalence for dysthymic disorder is six per cent. The point prevalence of major depressive disorder in a community sample of adults has been estimated at 5% to 9% for women and from 2% to 3% for men (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-03-11 02:49:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="G Peter Herbison">
<P>The most frequently used treatments for anxiety and depressive disorders include antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications; however these can be unpopular with people, due to side effects and the dislike of taking long-term medication. For example, from a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 36.9% of people treated for anxiety with the second-generation antipsychotic drug quetiapine withdrew during the studies (<LINK REF="REF-Depping-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Depping 2010</LINK>); and 33.9% of people with depression withdrew due to side effects from treatment for depression (<LINK REF="REF-Arroll-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroll 2009</LINK>). Psychological therapies may also be used as treatments for anxiety and depression and these are preferred over drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Prins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prins 2008</LINK>); however, a lack of trained practitioners and funding mean that many people explore self-help options.</P>
<P>There is interest from the community in the use of self help and complementary therapies for anxiety and depression. A study in the US found that 20% of people with anxiety, and 19% with depression visited a complementary or alternative therapy provider (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2001</LINK>), with 2.8% and 5.4% choosing 'energy therapy'.</P>
<P>'Energy therapies' are based on the belief in a universal flow of healing energy that flows around and through all living beings (<LINK REF="REF-Trepper-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trepper 2013</LINK>). Many ancient cultures have a name for this universal flow, for example: 'Prana' in India, 'Chi' in China, 'Ruarch' for Hebrews, 'Mana' in Hawaii and 'Wairua' for the Aotearoa New Zealand Maori people.</P>
<P>One of the complementary 'energy therapies' is the Japanese healing art of Reiki. In the Japanese language &#8216;rei&#8217; means universal and &#8216;kei&#8217; means life energy. A number of hospitals are now offering Reiki alongside other complementary therapies for management of pain and post-operative depression. A website article by prominent Reiki writer William Rand gives examples of the use of Reiki in American hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Rand-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rand 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reiki is a 2500 year old system of healing that was rediscovered by Dr Mikao Usui, in early 1900s Japan. He passed on his teachings to Dr Chujiro Hayashi, who opened the first Reiki clinic in Japan and standardised the hand placements of what is now known as the Usui system of Reiki. In his turn he trained the Japanese-American woman, Mrs Hawayo Takata, who established the first Reiki clinic in the US in 1970 (<LINK REF="REF-Trepper-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trepper 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reiki is based upon a holistic view of promoting whole-person (mind-body) health (<LINK REF="REF-Yeh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 2004</LINK>), and shares similar principles to the World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of health, namely, 'Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity' (http://www.who.int/about/en/).</P>
<P>Reiki is described as a vibrational or subtle energy therapy most commonly facilitated by light touch on or above the body (<LINK REF="REF-Lubeck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubeck 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubik 2002</LINK>). Practitioners describe it as a gentle, sequential treatment, which appears to be safe, comforting and relaxing. Reiki training involves several levels including 1, 2, 3 and 3A. Level 1 is generally for self-help or for treating family members only. Dr Usui is credited with describing the symbols and attunement processes involved in becoming a practitioner. According to Reiki spiritual masters, Reiki attunement opens and expands the ki-holding capacity of the practitioner (<LINK REF="REF-Lubeck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubeck 2001</LINK>). Spiritual attunement is an advanced spiritual practice, which involves the transmission of energy from the teacher to the student (<LINK REF="REF-Trepper-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trepper 2013</LINK>). Those that have received such attunements describe powerful experiences of love and peace alongside emotional and physical reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Lubeck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubeck 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The traditional Usui Reiki treatment, which is utilised in the studies, ranges from 45 to 90 minutes and usually involves placing the hands on 12 positions in total, on the head and on the front and back of the torso. Symbols may only be used during a treatment when a practitioner reaches level 2 and above. An understanding of the significance of using the symbols during a treatment can help to consolidate the benefits of the treatment. The symbols are usually drawn onto the practitioner's palm by the palm of the other hand. These symbols are said to enhance the quality of the energy transmitted to the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels of the person receiving the treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Nield_x002d_Anderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nield-Anderson 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is the attunement process that differentiates Reiki from other forms of energy therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Trepper-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trepper 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Miles-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Miles 2003</LINK> studied the effect of Reiki on HIV-related pain and anxiety. There was a significant reduction in both self-reported pain and anxiety following a 20-minute Reiki session. There was no significant difference between self administration of Reiki and administration by another person. <LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2003</LINK> conducted a trial to assess the effects of two treatment conditions on pain, quality of life and analgesic use in 24 cancer patients. One group received standard opioid treatment and rest, while the other group received standard opioid treatment and Reiki. No overall reduction in analgesic use was noted for either group. However, the Reiki group experienced improved pain control and quality of life scores, compared to the rest group. All studies reviewed used small samples ranging from 14 to 45 participants.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-02 22:11:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The putative mechanism of action for Reiki is said to be the transfer of energy by the Reiki practitioner acting as a channel for the energy to transfer to the client (<LINK REF="REF-Nield_x002d_Anderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nield-Anderson 2000</LINK>). Some modern authors have suggested a bio-field hypothesis that is similar to ancient yogic theory (<LINK REF="REF-Chaoul-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaoul 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feuerstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feuerstein 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2008</LINK>). Ancient yogic theory views the body as having a field of energy around and within it, that is said to be responsive to various forms of healing touch (<LINK REF="REF-Hossi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hossi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubik 2002</LINK>). This finds some similarities to the thoughts relating to the nature of the universe and consciousness that is emerging from the work in the field of quantum and particle physics (<LINK REF="REF-Bohm-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohm 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Capra-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capra 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carrol-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrol 2012</LINK>). However, in the medical literature the existence of such a biofield is refuted by some authors, particularly following the experiment which showed that under rigorous test conditions therapeutic touch practitioners were unable to sense a biofield (<LINK REF="REF-Rosa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosa 1998</LINK>). The study was conducted from a Western theoretical approach which may have been misleading and whilst this was a blinded and well-designed experiment there was little acknowledgement or understanding of the subtle nature of the phenomena being studied. It is claimed that an Eastern theoretical framework may have elicited information that reconciled the laboratory findings with the lived, reported experience of real-life human beings (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sedlmeier-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sedlmeier 2012</LINK>). Ancient traditions define the universal life force as a subtle energy that is not perceivable by the sense organs (<LINK REF="REF-Bahadur-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bahadur 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dasgupta-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dasgupta 1989</LINK>). Some claim that it may be useful to consider that when practitioners state that they &#8216;see or feel the field&#8217; they may instead be describing in a clumsy way the subtle experience of consciousness that develops specifically when one engages through the intent of love (<LINK REF="REF-Feuerstein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feuerstein 2002</LINK>). There appears to be a paucity of words within the English language and culture to describe these particular states; although cultures with deeper traditions and study of these states have many terms available. For example, the ancient Sanskrit language has many terms that describe advanced spiritual conditions and stages in a precise manner (<LINK REF="REF-Dasgupta-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dasgupta 1989</LINK>). Most spiritual traditions state that as a human being spiritually refines there develop various states of consciousness that are currently indescribable with words (<LINK REF="REF-Chandra-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandra 1991</LINK>). Often when a human being refines in this way, the capacities underlying energy therapies begin to show; however these states are often not stable and are subject to change and affected by thought (<LINK REF="REF-Dasgupta-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dasgupta 1989</LINK>). If this is the case then it is possible that Western laboratory test conditions may not be suitable for the study of the phenomena in question.</P>
<P>Within the literature many researchers have hypothesised that a generalised relaxation response may explain any Reiki treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Mackay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wardell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wardell 2001</LINK>). There is some evidence that Reiki has an effect on depression and anxiety. <LINK REF="STD-Shore-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shore 2004</LINK> found Reiki resulted in significant reductions in depressive and stress symptoms when compared to controls. These findings were maintained at a one-year follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Wardell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wardell 2001</LINK> explored the biological correlates of a single 30-minute session of Reiki: results showed that anxiety was significantly reduced (as measured by Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)) (<LINK REF="REF-Spielberger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spielberger 1983</LINK>), salivary immunoglobulin A levels rose significantly, and there was a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure. Salivary cortisol, skin temperature and electromyography (EMG) changes were not statistically significant. <LINK REF="STD-Bowden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 2011</LINK> found that the participants (university students) with high anxiety or depression or both who received Reiki showed a progressive improvement in overall mood, which was significantly better at five-week follow-up, while no change was seen in the controls. While the Reiki group did not demonstrate the comparatively greater reduction in symptoms of illness seen in the earlier study (<LINK REF="STD-Bowden-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 2010</LINK>), the findings of both studies suggested that Reiki may benefit mood.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-03-11 02:50:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="G Peter Herbison">
<P>Reiki appears to enjoy popular support by the public (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2007</LINK>); and in some cases hospitals are beginning to include this therapy in treatment plans (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 2013</LINK>). It is a therapy that intrigues and has aroused interest but in fairness little is known about its effects and possible health benefits despite several systematic reviews that included a wide range of different populations (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jain-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-vanderVaart-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">vanderVaart 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vitale-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitale 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Jain-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 2010</LINK> found, in part, that "Biofield therapies show strong evidence for reducing pain intensity in pain populations, and moderate evidence for reducing pain intensity in hospitalised and cancer populations. There is moderate evidence for decreasing negative behavioral symptoms in dementia and moderate evidence for decreasing anxiety for hospitalized populations" but this was based not only on RCTs and in small, moderate-quality studies. In contrast <LINK REF="REF-vanderVaart-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">vanderVaart 2009</LINK> concluded: "The serious methodological and reporting limitations of limited existing Reiki studies preclude a definitive conclusion on its effectiveness". <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2008</LINK> concluded from RCTs in a variety of populations: "the evidence is insufficient to suggest that Reiki is an effective treatment for any condition"; and <LINK REF="REF-Vitale-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitale 2007</LINK> questions whether RCTs are the correct way to evaluate Reiki. <LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2010</LINK> finds only a few studies with mixed findings and concludes that further good quality studies are required. Given the paucity of evidence based upon a few small studies, there is a place for a regularly updated systematic review of Reiki treatment for anxiety and depression.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Participants were to be diagnosed with anxiety or depression according to DSM-III (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1980</LINK>), DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>), ICD-9 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1978</LINK>) and ICD-10 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>); or identified through use of symptomology scales (such as <LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK> or <LINK REF="REF-Spielberger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spielberger 1983</LINK> scales, for example).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subset data</HEADING>
<P>Reiki is sometimes used on people whose primary diagnosis is something that would naturally be regarded as something that would make them anxious (such as cancer). RCTs on such populations may only have a subgroup of participants that are clinically anxious or depressed. If only a subgroup of participants met the inclusion criteria and the results for this subgroup were reported separately or these data were supplied by the authors then the study was included, but only the subgroup data were used.</P>

<P>There are several other treatments with similarities to Reiki. Therapeutic touch is a touch therapy that differs from Reiki, as it does not have an attunement process and practitioners work with conscious intent, assessing the client whilst their hands are usually, although not always, above the physical body (<LINK REF="REF-Potter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2007</LINK>). Healing touch is a nursing technique which also uses touch and intention to create changes in the biofield. It includes placement of the hands in specific sequences on the body and use of healing intent (<LINK REF="REF-Wardell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardell 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no intention to exclude participants who were on other treatments for anxiety and depressive disorders or who started them during the course of the trial.</P>

<B>CCDAN's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR)</B>
</P>
<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK: a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 37,500 reports of randomised controlled trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 60% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual. Please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Coordinator for further details.</P>
<P>Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); and review-specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers via the World Health Organization&#8217;s (WHO) Trials Portal (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>), drug companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1. Reiki treatment versus waiting list controls</HEADING>
<P>There were three arms in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Beard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Beard 2011</LINK> (Reiki, relaxation, and waiting list control); whereas the <LINK REF="STD-Richeson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Richeson 2010</LINK> study compared Reiki with waiting list controls. Both only had a small number of participants who were anxious or depressed or both at the start if the study. In <LINK REF="STD-Bowden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 2011</LINK> half of the group had high scores for anxiety or depression or both pre-treatment and these are the ones used in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">1.1.1 Anxiety</HEADING>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Beard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Beard 2011</LINK> the relaxation group (n = 6) started with a STAI mean score of 51 which reduced to 30 (but 2 dropped out and are not included) at the end of treatment; the Reiki group (n = 5) changed from a mean score of 49 to 40 and the control group (n = 5) went from a mean score of 49 to 45. These differences were not statistically significantly different.</P>
<P>In the anxious, depressed or both group in the <LINK REF="STD-Bowden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 2011</LINK> study the 1-week post-treatment mean score for the anxiety subscale of the DASS in the Reiki group was 5 (standard deviation (SD) 3.5) and in the control group it was 5 (SD 3.7). At the 5-week follow-up the mean scores were 5.4 (2.8) and 7.3 (5.7) respectively (P = 0.357).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Richeson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Richeson 2010</LINK> study there are two standard cutoffs for anxiety. When using the one with the more severely affected people there were 5 people with a mean HAM-A score at the end of the study of 30 in the Reiki group and 2 in the control group with a mean score of 44. When using the less severe cutoff there were 7 people in the Reiki group with a final mean score of 25 and 4 in the control group with a mean score of 36. There was no evidence of a difference in the HAM-A score between the groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">1.1.2 Depression</HEADING>
<P>In the relaxation group in <LINK REF="STD-Beard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Beard 2011</LINK>, 3 people met the criteria for depression with an average CES-D score of 26 but only one of these had a score at the end of treatment and that was 18 (two dropped out). In the Reiki arm 3 participants changed from a mean of 23 to a mean of 22, while in the control arm 1 person started at 31 and was 17 at the end of the study. There was no evidence of a difference between groups.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bowden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bowden 2011</LINK>, the mean depression score 1-week post treatment for the anxious, depressed or both group was 5.3 (standard deviation 4.7) in the Reiki group and 7.9 (standard deviation 4.0) in the control group (P = 0.199). At 5-weeks post treatment the mean scores were 4.7 (standard deviation 4.1) and 6.8 (standard deviation 5.3) respectively, P = 0.335.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Richeson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Richeson 2010</LINK> there were also two cutoffs in the depression score. With the cutoff for the more severely affected people there were 4 in the Reiki group with a mean GDS-15 score of 10; and 1 in the control group with a score of 14. With the less severe cutoff there were 10 in the Reiki group with a mean score of 6; and 3 in the control group with a mean score of 11. There was no evidence of a difference between groups.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-06 11:25:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results that are available are from small subgroups of small studies with potential problems from risk of bias. Therefore there is insufficient information to draw conclusions about whether Reiki provides help to people with anxiety or depression. The data were so limited that the planned analyses to explore the data in more detail were not possible.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-02 20:16:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies that aimed to improve anxiety and depression did not ensure that the participants had these problems to start with, so there is very little evidence as to whether Reiki is of benefit to these patients at all. All of the included participants had been rated as anxious or depressed by scores on scales, so did not have a clinical diagnosis. As a result of this the questions posed in this review remain unanswered.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-03-11 02:54:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="G Peter Herbison">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study limitations (risk of bias)</HEADING>
<P>On the whole these studies were not done in a manner that ensured internal validity although the randomisation sequence was well done on two of the three studies. The allocation was only securely hidden in one study and the other domains only infrequently were at low risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Consistency</HEADING>
<P>With so few data it was difficult to examine consistency. All the reported outcomes were not statistically significant, but the confidence intervals (CIs) were wide, thus not excluding beneficial or harmful effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Indirectness</HEADING>
<P>Only one of the three included studies had a subgroup that may be typical of those seeking Reiki treatment for anxiety or depression, although these were otherwise fit and well university students. One other study recruited participants who were undergoing treatment for prostate cancer and the third recruited people from the general public aged 55 and over who had pain as well as anxiety or depression. Thus quality of the results would be downgraded because of indirectness.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Imprecision</HEADING>
<P>The data are so few that CIs were wide, which would result in further downgrading of quality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>As every article in the databases that mentioned 'Reiki' were scrutinised for inclusion it is likely that all published work was included.</P>
<P>As well as not directly addressing the questions posed by this review the evidence found was likely to be downgraded to low quality. Better studies, addressing questions of interest to patients, need to be done. It is difficult to assess the evidence when there is so little of it and the included studies do not directly address the questions posed by this review. To answer the question of whether Reiki is useful for people who are anxious or depressed, studies need to include people who are anxious and depressed to start with. The participants in two of the three included studies were in stressful situations, but this does not necessarily correspond with being anxious to the extent that a clinical diagnosis could be made. It would also be of interest, if there was an effect present, to see if it persisted for some time after the Reiki sessions stopped. We identified four potentially relevant studies which have been registered and completed but have yet to be reported; all studies should be registered in a clinical trial database before recruiting participants, and should be published within a reasonable time after measuring all outcomes.</P>

</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-03-02 21:50:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We only discovered three studies that examined whether the participants were anxious, depressed, or anxious and depressed at baseline. It is impossible to say whether these people were representative of those who may choose to be treated with Reiki.</P>
<P>Participants included were a subgroup of the participants in the studies who scored highly on scales for depression, anxiety, or both. Apart from one study the randomisation was not stratified for this so it is likely that the included participants were not balanced for important prognostic factors at baseline, but there is so little data available the decision was made to use all the available data. That means that any conclusions have to be very guarded: the lack of data and most of it coming from subgroups means that any conclusions might easily be changed with new data.</P>
<P>The control group in two of the included studies was a waiting list group, so the participants knew they were not getting any treatment but would get treatment in the future. It is unclear what effect this would have on the outcome but it is possible that it would be different from a placebo treatment.</P>
<P>We could not contact the named investigators for some studies that had a possibility of being included (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-NCT01569269" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01569269</LINK>) so we may have missed eligible studies/people.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-09 05:17:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There have been mixed results on studies looking at the effects of Reiki on the outcomes of anxiety and depression. This may be because people who are not anxious and depressed have been included in many studies and they have little to gain from any treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-03-01 19:08:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We could only include a few participants (45 anxious/depressed out of 124 randomised) from subgroups of the three studies meeting the inclusion criteria; this evidence was of moderate quality, at best. There is therefore insufficient evidence from randomised trials to draw any conclusions on whether Reiki is effective for the treatment of anxiety or depression.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-02 20:27:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If Reiki is to be regarded as a serious treatment for anxiety or depression then well-designed, well-conducted, and well-reported studies need to be done. Currently Reiki is a treatment of unproven effectiveness and thus more evidence is needed before it can be accepted as useful, or discarded as useless. Studies need to be in appropriate patient populations: in this instance in people with anxiety or depression, either clinically diagnosed or by being above cutoffs in anxiety or depression scores. Reiki should be administered by a trained Reiki practitioner, and it would be useful to compare it with something that facilitates blinding of the participants and different forms of Reiki (e.g. distance Reiki). Outcomes should include measures of anxiety or depression measured after a reasonable period. These outcomes should be measured again some time after the treatment sessions have stopped to check on the persistence of any effect. Studies should be large enough to answer questions about whether such treatments are efficacious. Studies should be reported in full within a reasonable time of the last outcome being measured.</P>

<P>In the original protocol for this review, we planned to assess methodological quality of included studies by criteria sent out in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>); however, following the publication of the revised and expanded <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), we altered our plans and will now use the risk of bias tool.</P>
<P>The following methods were published in the original protocol for this review, but were not applicable to this version of the review.</P>
<P>Dealing with missing data: "missing dichotomous data will be managed through intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, in which it will be assumed that patients who dropped out after randomisation had a negative outcome, although it is acknowledged that categorising dropouts as treatment failures may have overestimated the number of patients with a poor outcome. Best/worse case scenarios will also be calculated for the clinical response outcome. For missing continuous data, the method of 'last observation carried forward' (LOCF) will be used where possible, with due consideration of the potential bias and uncertainty introduced."</P>
<P>The types of participants section was modified, to make it clear that we included studies with a subset of relevant participants where the data for those participants was reported separately or the relevant information could be obtained from the authors.</P>

<P>Behavioural: Yoga Intervention</P>
<P>The yoga intervention will take place for one hour per week for six weeks. All sessions will be guided by a Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT) who is also a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW).</P>
<P>Each yoga session will follow a similar protocol. The introductory period (10 minutes) will focus participants on increasing interoceptive and proprioceptive capacity. The main segment is comprised of a series of yoga postures that progress from lying or seated postures that provide gentle muscle stretching to standing stretches that increase balance and flexibility. The postures will be introduced, practised, and combined with breathing exercises for 40 minutes.</P>
<P>The conclusion of the session will comprise 10 minutes of relaxation.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Behavioural: Meditation Intervention</P>
<P>The meditation intervention will be conducted weekly for six weeks. Each class will follow a similar protocol: during the one-hour meeting, participants will focus on developing attention to the breath. In a supine or seated position and with eyes closed, participants will be guided to attend solely to their breathing. As physical sensations, thoughts, and emotions begin to arise, participants will be taught to recognise, acknowledge, and accept the presence of the sensations or emotions and then to step back, release the thought or sensation, and refocus attention toward the breath. At the conclusion of each meeting, the meditation instructor will encourage participants to voluntarily engage in daily meditation practices.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Behavioural: Reiki</P>
<P>The Reiki intervention will be conducted for one hour per week for 6 weeks. Protocol for each session: Briefly meet with the Reiki practitioner to review experiences with symptoms of CIPN. Then, the participant will be directed to lie supine and fully clothed on a massage table. Beginning at the top of the head, the practitioner will move inferiorly and pause while holding their hands above, but facing the participant at each energy point until reaching the feet. Upon reaching the participant's feet, the participant will roll from the supine position to a prone position and the process repeated. After being guided to a seated position on the massage table, the practitioner will spend a few moments in conversation with the participation before ending the session.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Other: Holistic Education</P>
<P>The psychoeducational intervention will be presented in a traditional classroom format with weekly one hour meetings taking place during the six-week study period. Each class meeting will address specific aspects of CIPN. Participants will be presented with content related to basic neuroanatomy, physiology, the effects of chemotherapy on peripheral nervous system, how available allopathic treatments (pharmacological/psychopharmacological) can be helpful, and psychosocial issues related to CIPN. The final week of the psychoeducational group will include the identification of complementary interventions that may be of help to people living with CIPN.</P>

<P>Primary Outcome Measures: FACT GOG-ntx scale [Time Frame: change from baseline in quality of life and symptoms of neurotoxicity in 6 weeks ] [Designated as safety issue: No ]. This scale measures two outcomes: symptoms of neurotoxicity; and quality of life. The FACT GOG-ntx combines the 27-item general Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale (FACT-G) with an 11-item neurotoxicity subscale. Completion of the FACT-G does not require assistance and can be completed in less than five minutes. Cronbach's coefficient for each item on this scale has been demonstrated at 0.70 or higher, and the instrument is sensitive to respondent changes over time.<BR/>
<BR/>Secondary Outcome Measures: The Brief Symptom Inventory - 18 (BSI-18) [Time Frame: change from baseline in quality of life and symptoms of neurotoxicity in 6 weeks] [Designated as safety issue: No]. The BSI-18 is an 18-item brief psychological screening instrument that has been designed to measure distress and yields a global distress score as well as subscale scores for somatic concerns, anxiety, and depression. The BSI-18 has been found to have good internal reliability with a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.89.</P>
<P> <BR/>Mindful Attention Awareness scale (MAAS) [Time Frame: change from baseline in quality of life and symptoms of neurotoxicity in 6 weeks] [Designated as safety issue: No]. The MAAS is a 15-item scale that is self administered, requires no assistance to complete, and can be taken in five minutes or less. The instrument was developed to evaluate states of mindfulness or the respondent's capacity to simply observe and be aware of internal and external events in the present moment as a method of self regulation. Internal reliability of items on the MAAS has been established with Cronbach's Alpha coefficients at 0.80 or higher per item.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>"The randomisation procedure consisted of the tossing of an unbiased coin to assign each new pair of High-Mood or Low-Mood participants to be recruited to the Reiki or Control groups, to ensure that there were equal numbers of participants in each group. If, for example, the first High-Mood participant to be recruited was randomly assigned to the Reiki group, then the next High-Mood participant was assigned to the Control group, and likewise with the Low-Mood participants until there were 10 participants in each of the four subgroups. When participants dropped out, new recruits continued to be randomly assigned to the four subgroups by the method described, until the target sample size was achieved." This matched pair design could be open to all sorts of problems.</P>
