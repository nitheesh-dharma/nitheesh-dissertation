<TITLE MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:43:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">Does denser compared to normal bupivacaine, given as a lower back injection, give more effective and safer anaesthesia during caesarean section</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:39:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>
<B>Background</B>: A pain-relieving drug, bupivacaine, is used during caesarean section through lower back injection. However, it is not clear that using hyperbaric bupivacaine (denser than the spinal fluid) is more or less effective in pain relief than isobaric bupivacaine (density equal to the spinal fluid). This Cochrane Review summarizes the best available evidence for the effectiveness and safety of the denser form of bupivacaine compared to the isobaric form when spinal anaesthesia (injection of medications into the lower back) is used for delivery of a baby by caesarean section.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>: The evidence is current to March 2016. We found 10 clinical trials evaluating these two types of bupivacaine, involving 614 women. The studies assessed the following effects of the two types of medicine: women needing to switch to general anaesthesia, additional drugs for pain relief or low blood pressure, experiencing nausea and vomiting, headache and excessive numbness. We found that all the studies had been done properly. None of them reported their source of funding. We await responses from the authors of two more studies, and will cover these when we next update the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>: We found that there is insufficient evidence to establish whether denser or normal bupivacaine is the more effective in reducing the need for: a) switching to general anaesthesia; b) additional pain relief medication. Denser bupivacaine had a more rapid onset of pain relief.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence:</B> Due to the differences among the included studies in doses given, variety of additional drugs used for pain relief, variation in regional anaesthesia techniques and the small numbers of participants, we rated the overall quality of evidence for different outcomes from very low to moderate, as very few women experienced untoward events in all trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>: We conclude that the denser form provides faster pain relief than the normal one. More research is required to be certain about the effectiveness of the denser form for other outcomes.</P>

<P>Bupivacaine is an amide local anaesthetic used in hyperbaric and isobaric forms. These are administered intrathecally into the spine to provide regional anaesthesia for caesarean section.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We originally searched the following databases to January 2011: CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase.</P>
<P>For this update, we reran our search in the above databases from January 2011 to March 2016; two studies are awaiting a response from authors for assessment and will be dealt with when we next update the review.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-11-12 03:12:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Fahad Javaid Siddiqui">
<P>We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving parturients undergoing spinal anaesthesia for elective caesarean section that compared the use of hyperbaric with isobaric bupivacaine.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Two authors independently extracted the data. The data that were extracted included the number of events and the sample sizes in both the intervention and control groups. For continuous outcomes, we extracted mean and standard deviation.</P>
<P>We reported odds ratios (ORs) and risk ratios (RRs) for binary outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included three new RCTs in this update, which now comprises 10 studies with a total of 614 participants. We judged most trials as having uncertain risk of bias regarding randomization. Other than this, the overall risk of bias was low. Most included trials had small sample sizes. All of the trials assessed the primary outcome of conversion to general anaesthesia. Ten trials comparing anaesthesia performed with hyperbaric and isobaric bupivacaine failed to show any difference in need for conversion to general anaesthesia (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.17, 614 participants, <I>very</I> <I>low quality of evidence</I>). Nine trials also failed to show a difference in the need for supplemental analgesics (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.41, 554 participants, <I>very</I> <I>low quality of evidence</I>). Four trials comparing requirement for ephedrine did not show any difference (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.38, 256 participants, <I>very</I> <I>low quality of evidence</I>). Seven trials did not provide convincing evidence of difference in nausea and vomiting (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.72, 433 participants, <I>low</I> <I>quality of evidence</I>). Three trials failed to show a difference in headache (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.47 to 6.99, 234 participants, <I>low quality of evidence</I>). Two trials showed that the time until sensory block to the thoracic 4th (T4) spinal level was shorter with hyperbaric bupivacaine (MD -1.06 minutes, 95% CI -1.80 to -0.31, 128 participants, <I>moderate quality of evidence</I>). Six trials showed no difference in the amount of ephedrine used (RR 0.23, 95% CI -1.65 to 2.12, 386 participants, <I>moderate quality of evidence</I>). Three trials failed to show any difference in high block (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.16 to 4.90, 205 participants).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Data are limited for some of the outcomes. Reporting of the included trials is less than optimal. For these reasons the overall quality of evidence is low or very low for most of the outcomes, based on the GRADE method of assessment. This review found that intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine had a more rapid onset of sensory blockade at the 4th thoracic vertebra (T4) level than isobaric bupivacaine. Hower, despite incorporating more data in the analysis, we found little evidence that the need for conversion to general anaesthesia and supplemental analgesia differed between the hyperbaric or isobaric bupivacaine groups. This is mainly due to the rarity of these outcomes, variability in the dose, use of adjuvant drugs and differences in the technique used for regional anaesthesia. There were no differences in the adverse effects studied. Any possible advantage of hyperbaric bupivacaine needs to be confirmed in larger randomized trials. In future research, criteria for conversion to general anaesthesia need to be defined objectively and applied uniformly.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:42:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The incidence of caesarean section is reported to be 27.3% in an Asian global study (<LINK REF="REF-Lumbiganon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumbiganon 2010</LINK>), and ranges from 15% in Thailand, 36% in Korea, to 48% in Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-Chanrachakul-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chanrachakul 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chung-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Odlind-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odlind 2003</LINK>). For non-emergency caesareans, regional anaesthesia is generally preferred to general anaesthesia. In some tertiary centres the use of regional anaesthesia for caesarean section is as high as 96.4% (<LINK REF="REF-Tsen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsen 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since 1982, bupivacaine is the most commonly used local anaesthetic in regional anaesthesia for caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1982</LINK>). It is available in two forms: an isobaric form with equal density to the spinal fluid, and a denser hyperbaric form. Both forms have been widely used intrathecally (injecting a drug beneath the spine's arachnoid membrane and directly into the spinal fluid) to provide anaesthesia for caesarean section (<LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>). This is known as spinal anaesthesia and is distinct from the other type of regional anaesthesia, epidural anaesthesia.</P>
<P>Several trials have compared hyperbaric bupivacaine and isobaric bupivacaine, but none have conclusively shown one to be better than the other (<LINK REF="STD-Sarvela-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarvela 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>). This updated systematic review summarizes the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of hyperbaric bupivacaine compared to isobaric bupivacaine when used to provide spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Spinal anaesthesia is a common anaesthetic technique used for caesarean delivery. Local anaesthetics or opioids, or both, are administered in the spinal space to cause numbness and weakness in the lower part of the body, to enable the surgeon to perform the caesarean delivery without pain or discomfort to the woman. Bupivacaine, a long-acting local anaesthetic, is the most commonly used. Opioids such as fentanyl, sufentanil and morphine are sometimes co-administered to supplement the effect of the local anaesthetic.There are two forms of commercially-available bupivacaine, isobaric and hyperbaric bupivacaine. The side effects associated with regional anaesthesia for caesarean section include total spinal anaesthesia and hypotension.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The denser (hyperbaric) bupivacaine is produced by the addition of glucose (80 mg/mL) to isobaric or plain bupivacaine. The difference in density between the two forms is believed to affect their diffusion patterns and distribution after injection into the intrathecal space.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-04-12 03:03:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Several trials have shown that hyperbaric bupivacaine appears to cause more predictable sensory blockade than isobaric bupivacaine. The two forms of bupivacaine also appear to differ in their motor blockade pattern (inability to move the lower limbs) and duration of action.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>This review was undertaken to establish the effectiveness and safety of hyperbaric versus isobaric bupivacaine, used in spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. If one intervention were shown to be more efficacious or safer, the practice of spinal anaesthesia may be more standardized for caesarean section. The review was first published in 2013 and updated in 2016 (<LINK REF="REF-Sia-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sia 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included studies that compared hyperbaric bupivacaine to isobaric bupivacaine in spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section.</P>
<P>We also included studies that used anaesthetic combinations containing spinal opioids (for example, fentanyl, morphine) and those using the combined spinal-epidural technique. The combined spinal-epidural technique involves the use of local anaesthetics in the intrathecal space via a spinal needle that passes through an epidural needle. This is followed by the placement of an epidural catheter without local anaesthetic in the epidural space. This procedure qualifies as a spinal anaesthetic technique, as the local anaesthetic is only introduced into the intrathecal space and not into the epidural space.</P>
<P>We excluded studies using the sequential combined spinal-epidural technique (use of local anaesthetic in both the intrathecal space and epidural space at initiation of anaesthesia), other local anaesthetics concomitantly, regional anaesthesia, or any other form of anaesthesia for caesarean section.</P>

<P>We evaluated clinical heterogeneity by qualitatively appraising the differences in study characteristics such as participants, interventions, outcomes assessed and study methodology. We justified quantitative pooling of the data by a consensual clinical judgement of sufficient clinical homogeneity. We informally evaluated and investigated the degree of statistical heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots, and more formally by the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>For assessments of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome that included pooled data from RCTs only, we downgraded the evidence from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias), indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias. We did not include any non-randomized study in our analysis. We used the GRADE approach to interpret findings (<LINK REF="REF-Langendam-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langendam 2013</LINK>) and the GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) allowed us to import data from Review Manager 5 to create a 'Summary of findings' tables. This provides outcome-specific information concerning the overall quality of evidence from studies included in the comparison, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on the outcomes we considered.</P>

<P>All 10 studies were described as double-blinded, but exactly which parties were blinded was not explicitly stated. We deduced that the participants were all blinded, due to the nature of the study. The spinal injections were done in the participant's back. The attending anaesthetists, who were also outcome assessors, were blinded to the group assignment in six of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Das-Neves-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Das Neves 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Punshi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Punshi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarvela-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarvela 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichitvejpaisal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vichitvejpaisal 1992</LINK>).

The adequacy of blinding was not described in <LINK REF="STD-Javed-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 2014</LINK>. The amount of ephedrine administered was at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist.

<P>Four studies (256 participants) reported the need for ephedrine (<LINK REF="STD-Javed-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarvela-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarvela 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>). One study with 97 participants was statistically significantly in favour of hyperbaric bupivacaine for reducing the need for ephedrine (<LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>). There was moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%) so we used a random-effects model to account for unexplained variation among the studies. Overall the requirement for ephedrine was similar (Mantel-Haenszel RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.38) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Nausea and vomiting</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies (433 participants) reported the occurrence of nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saracoglu-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Saracoglu 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saracoglu-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Saracoglu 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarvela-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarvela 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichitvejpaisal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vichitvejpaisal 1992</LINK>). Of these, one study was statistically significantly in favour of hyperbaric bupivacaine (<LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>) and one study was statistically significantly in favour of isobaric bupivacaine in decreasing the incidence of nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-Vichitvejpaisal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vichitvejpaisal 1992</LINK>). We used the random-effects model to pool the data from these five studies. The pooled result was not significant (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.72) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). There was moderate heterogeneity, with I<SUP>2</SUP> = 51%. We performed a sensitivity analysis to explore the underlying cause of the heterogeneity, but could find no apparent reason to account for it, although differing definitions of nausea and vomiting could not be discounted.

<P>Data and results of the outcomes conversion to general anaesthesia, supplemental analgesia, and headache only partially satisfied the criteria to use Mantel-Haenszel or Peto methods (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). We repeated the analyses using the Mantel-Haenszel and inverse variance methods so that we could assess the impact of the analysis method. This sensitivity analysis revealed that except for conversion to general anaesthesia, where the pooled result changed from significantly in favour of hyperbaric bupivacaine (Peto method) to no significant difference (Mantel-Haenszel and inverse variance methods), all other conclusions remained unchanged (no significant differences).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Evidence from the 10 studies (614 participants) contributing data to the primary outcomes of this review showed that inadequate pain relief requiring conversion to general anesthesia and supplemental analgesia showed no difference between hyperbaric and isobaric bupivacaine. Only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Das-Neves-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Das Neves 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Javed-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichitvejpaisal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vichitvejpaisal 1992</LINK>) contributed to the result of similar conversion to general anaesthesia and five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Das-Neves-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Das Neves 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarvela-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarvela 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichitvejpaisal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vichitvejpaisal 1992</LINK>) contributed to the result of similar requirement for supplemental analgesia.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichitvejpaisal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vichitvejpaisal 1992</LINK>) contributed to the result of more rapid onset of sensory block at the T4 level with hyperbaric bupivacaine. All other analyses showed no differences. In addition, the sample sizes of the included studies dictate that all of our results should be treated with caution, as future larger studies may modify these findings.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Conversion to general anaesthesia was a rare event in the 10 studies. Most studies did not report any conversions to general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Punshi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Punshi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saracoglu-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Saracoglu 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saracoglu-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Saracoglu 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarvela-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarvela 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>); <LINK REF="STD-Das-Neves-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Das Neves 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Javed-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 2014</LINK> did not show any significant differences and the evidence for the superiority of hyperbaric bupivacaine comes primarily (78% weight) from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Vichitvejpaisal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vichitvejpaisal 1992</LINK>). The criterion used in <LINK REF="STD-Vichitvejpaisal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vichitvejpaisal 1992</LINK> for conversion to general anaesthesia was when the analgesic level was deemed inadequate, but no further details were given. Caution should be exercised in interpreting the clinical significance of the finding.</P>
<P>The pooled estimate for use of supplemental analgesia was also dominated by a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>) (61% weight), as this study reports more events and was significantly larger than the other studies. The larger number of events might be attributable to the use of the combined spinal-epidural technique with small-dose hyperbaric and isobaric bupivacaine leading to a higher event rate for supplemental analgesia.</P>
<P>The use of ephedrine was lowest in <LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>, as the dose of bupivacaine was only 6.6 mg using the combined spinal-epidural technique, compared to a higher ephedrine consumption by <LINK REF="STD-Das-Neves-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Das Neves 2003</LINK> (12.5 mg bupivacaine) and <LINK REF="STD-Sarvela-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarvela 1999</LINK> (9 mg bupivacaine) using spinal anaesthesia. </P>
<P>For caesarean delivery, an anaesthesia level of T4 has been widely deemed to be the standard to allow pain-free delivery of the infant. We therefore reviewed the mean time to onset of T4 blockade, which was only reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichitvejpaisal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vichitvejpaisal 1992</LINK>). Both studies used the loss of sensation to pin-prick as the test for sensory level. We could not investigate the maximum sensory level achieved during intrathecal block or recession of sensory blockade, due to the different methods used to test sensory level. <LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK> used ether swabs to test the height of block, while others used loss of sensation to pin-prick or cold.</P>
<P>We reran the searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase between January 2011 and March 2016, and identified five new studies, of which two are awaiting assessment (<LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>). </P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>There was unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment selection bias, as the methods were not reported in nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Das-Neves-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Das Neves 2003</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Javed-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saracoglu-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Saracoglu 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saracoglu-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Saracoglu 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarvela-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarvela 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichitvejpaisal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vichitvejpaisal 1992</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1998</LINK>, the two groups were not balanced for prognostically important factors, e.g. previous caesarean sections. Other than <LINK REF="STD-Punshi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Punshi 2012</LINK>, which had a high risk of reporting bias, there were low risks of performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias or other potential biases.</P>
<P>All the studies were described as double-blind studies, but details were not explicit. Nevertheless, the participants were likely to be blinded, as the spinal injection was performed at the back, away from the woman's vision. The attending anaesthetists did not prepare the medications in five of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Das-Neves-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Das Neves 2003</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarvela-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarvela 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichitvejpaisal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vichitvejpaisal 1992</LINK>), so they would not know the group assignment. In <LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Punshi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Punshi 2012,</LINK> the attending anaesthetist prepared the medications. <LINK REF="STD-Javed-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 2014</LINK> did not describe the preparation of medication. Although a blinded observer was involved as the outcome assessor, the dose of ephedrine used was at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist. There were different hypotension thresholds and a range of ephedrine doses that could be administered each time, so there was considerable variation in the ephedrine-related outcomes. However, the attending anaesthetist was blinded, so we rated this at low risk of bias. For most of the dichotomous outcomes events were rare. This resulted in imprecision in the results, precluding firm conclusions. Therefore, considering both risk of bias and imprecision, we downgraded the evidence to either very low or low for five of the seven outcomes assessed using GRADE methods.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:39:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The dose of bupivacaine used in the studies varied from 6.6 mg to 15 mg. Some studies included intrathecal opioids such as morphine (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saracoglu-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Saracoglu 2011a</LINK>), sufentanil (<LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>) and fentanyl (<LINK REF="STD-Punshi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Punshi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarvela-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarvela 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saracoglu-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Saracoglu 2011b</LINK>), while others did not use adjuvant intrathecal drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Das-Neves-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Das Neves 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Javed-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vichitvejpaisal-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Vichitvejpaisal 1992</LINK>). There was also variability in the technique of regional block, with four studies performing the combined spinal-epidural technique (delivering the drug directly into the spinal fluid with a small catheter placed in the space surrounding the spinal column) to administer the intrathecal drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Saracoglu-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Saracoglu 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saracoglu-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Saracoglu 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarvela-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sarvela 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercauteren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vercauteren 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other potentially relevant outcomes not reported in most studies were pain on injection and recovery, duration of anaesthesia following delivery, pain with delivery of spinal anaesthesia, pain after delivery, and ability to walk around.</P>
<P>Three factors (intrathecal drug dose, adjuvant drugs, and technique of administration) have been shown to affect the spread of local anaesthetic in the intrathecal space. However, since the methodology has not been standardized, it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion from the studies in this review. It may be necessary to conduct a large randomized trial to confirm these findings, as well as to examine the economic impact so that more reliable conclusions can be made with higher quality evidence.</P>

<P>There is no compelling evidence in favour of the use of intrathecal isobaric or hyperbaric bupivacaine for spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. Due to the suggestive evidence of faster onset to T4 sensory block, intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine may have some advantages.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-09-14 12:34:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>There is a lack of clear evidence on this topic. An adequately-powered randomized controlled trial is required, in which the criteria for conversion to general anaesthesia and the need for supplemental analgesia should be defined objectively, applied uniformly and reported explicitly. Other clinically important outcomes, such as pain scores in the peri-operative period and time to walking, need to be evaluated in a standardized manner. All clinically-relevant side effects should be evaluated. Reporting standards should adhere to the CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2012</LINK>) with more details of randomization, blinding and complete outcome data assessment.</P>
