<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-11-25 09:14:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When blood pressure is consistently high it can lead to complications such as a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or stroke. Both peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a condition that affects the blood vessels (arteries) carrying the blood to the legs, arms, and stomach area, and high blood pressure (hypertension) are associated with atherosclerosis. This is hardening of the arteries which is caused by deposits of fat, cholesterol and other substances inside the blood vessels. PAD is diagnosed when the blood supply to the legs is restricted causing pain and cramping that limits walking (intermittent claudication). It is measured by the walking distance (on a treadmill) before onset of pain (claudication distance) or ankle brachial index (ABI), the ratio of the blood pressure in the arms to the blood pressure in the legs. If the blood pressure is lower in the legs compared to the arms (ABI of less than 1.0) this indicates blocked arteries in the legs (or PAD). PAD can progress to pain at rest and critical limb ischaemia (sudden lack of blood flow to a limb caused by a blood clot or fatty deposit blockage) that requires revascularisation (restoring the blood flow by opening up the blocked blood vessel) or amputation. Treatment of hypertension to reduce cardiovascular events (heart attack or stroke) and death needs careful consideration in people with PAD. Anti-hypertensive medications may worsen the PAD symptoms by further reducing blood flow and supply of oxygen to the limbs, and may have long-term effects on disease progression. The evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the risks and benefits of various anti-hypertensive drugs on measures of PAD is lacking.</P>
<P>We identified eight RCTs with a total of 3610 people with symptomatic PAD where participants were randomised to receive an anti-hypertensive treatment for at least one month or placebo or no treatment. Four studies compared an anti-hypertensive treatment with placebo and four studies compared two anti-hypertensive treatments with each other. The studies were not combined due to the variation of comparisons and the outcomes presented. One trial with 1725 participants showed that the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril was effective in reducing the number of cardiovascular events by 28% compared to placebo. In one other study using an ACE inhibitor (n = 52) the perindopril group showed a small increase in claudication distance but no change in ABI and a reduction in maximal walking distance (MWD). In patients undergoing peripheral arterial angioplasty (a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels) the results from a trial with 96 participants suggested that the calcium channel blocker verapamil reduced restenosis (new blockage of the artery) at six months. In one small study (n = 80) peripheral arterial wall thickness was similar whether men received the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker doxazosin. In another small study (n = 36) MWD was improved at 12 months in the angiotensin-II receptor antagonist telmisartan group compared to the placebo group but there were no significant differences in ABI or arterial wall thickness. Another study (n = 163) found no significant differences in intermittent or absolute claudication distance, ABI, all-cause mortality or non-fatal cardiovascular events after 24 weeks of treatment in the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker nebivolol group and the HCTZ group. A study comparing two beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, nebivolol and metoprolol, found no clear differences in intermittent or absolute claudication distance, ABI, all-cause mortality or revascularisation after 36 weeks of treatment. A subgroup analysis of PAD patients (n = 2699) in the final study revealed no significant differences in the combined endpoints of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke with or without revascularisation between the calcium antagonist-based strategy (verapamil slow release (SR) with or without trandolapril) compared to the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker strategy (atenolol with or without HCTZ).</P>
<P>The evidence on the use of various anti-hypertensive drugs in people with PAD is poor so that it is not known whether significant benefits or risks accrue. However, lack of data specifically examining outcomes in hypertensive PAD patients should not detract from the overwhelming evidence on the benefit of treating hypertension and lowering blood pressure.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-25 08:45:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. Hypertension is a risk factor for PAD. Treatment for hypertension must be compatible with the symptoms of PAD. Controversy regarding the effects of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade for hypertension in patients with PAD has led many physicians to stop prescribing beta-adrenoreceptor blockers. Little is known about the effects of other classes of anti-hypertensive drugs in the presence of PAD. This is the second update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-25 09:50:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight RCTs were included with a total of 3610 PAD patients. Four studies compared a recognised class of anti-hypertensive treatment with placebo and four studies compared two anti-hypertensive treatments with each other. Studies were not pooled due to the variation of the comparisons and the outcomes presented. Overall the quality of the available evidence was unclear, primarily as a result of a lack of detail in the study reports on the randomisation and blinding procedures and incomplete outcome data. Two studies compared angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors against placebo. In one study there was a significant reduction in the number of cardiovascular events in patients receiving ramipril (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.91; n = 1725). In the second trial using perindopril (n = 52) there was a marginal increase in claudication distance but no change in ABI and a reduction in maximum walking distance. A trial comparing the calcium antagonist verapamil versus placebo in patients undergoing angioplasty (n = 96) suggested that verapamil reduced restenosis (per cent diameter stenosis (± SD) 48.0% ± 11.5 versus 69.6% ± 12.2; P &lt; 0.01), although this was not reflected in the maintenance of a high ABI (0.76 ± 0.10 versus 0.72 ± 0.08 for verapamil versus placebo). Another study (n = 80) demonstrated no significant difference in arterial intima-media thickness (IMT) in men receiving the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) compared to those receiving the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker doxazosin (-0.12 ± 0.14 mm and -0.08 ± 0.13 mm, respectively; P = 0.66). A study (n = 36) comparing telmisartan to placebo found a significant improvement in maximum walking distance at 12 months with telmisartan (median (interquartile range (IQR)) 191 m (157 to 226) versus 103 m (76 to 164); P &lt; 0.001) but no differences in ABI (median (IQR) 0.60 (0.60 to 0.77) versus 0.52 (0.48 to 0.67)) or arterial IMT (median (IQR) 0.08 cm (0.07 to 0.09) versus 0.09 cm (0.08 to 0.10)). Two studies compared the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker nebivolol with either the thiazide diuretic HCTZ or with metoprolol. Both studies found no significant differences in intermittent or absolute claudication distance, ABI, or all-cause mortality between the anti-hypertensives. A subgroup analysis of PAD patients (n = 2699) in a study which compared a calcium antagonist-based strategy (verapamil slow release (SR) ± trandolapril) to a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker-based strategy (atenolol ± hydrochlorothiazide) found no significant differences in the composite endpoints of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke with or without revascularisation (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.07 and OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.13, respectively).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-11-25 08:46:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition that affects the blood vessels (arteries) carrying the blood to the legs, arms, and stomach area. PAD occurs when these arteries start to narrow because of a build-up of fatty deposits inside the blood vessels. PAD mainly affects the arteries in the legs. It can cause discomfort or pain in the lower legs when walking because the narrowing in the blood vessels means that less oxygen-rich blood reaches the legs. This discomfort or pain is called intermittent claudication. Not everyone has these symptoms.</P>
<P>PAD is the third leading cause of morbidity from atherosclerotic disease (disease of the arteries caused by the build-up of fatty deposits on the inner lining of the blood vessels) after coronary heart disease and stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 2013</LINK>). PAD is the cause of a large number of hospital admissions each year. In the United States of America, 9.6% of cardiovascular events are due to PAD, resulting in 63,000 annual hospital admissions (<LINK REF="REF-Kannel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannel 1996</LINK>). In addition, PAD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Criqui-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criqui 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clement-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 2013</LINK>). Patients with PAD, with and without intermittent claudication, have almost three times the risk of dying or having a major cardiovascular event (stroke or heart attack) compared to people without PAD (<LINK REF="REF-Pande-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pande 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 2013</LINK>). Although the risk of non-fatal cardiovascular events (morbidity) among patients with intermittent claudication is reported to be approximately five to 10 in every 100 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Dormandy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormandy 2000</LINK>) the risk of death is much higher. For example, the Framingham study showed that two out of every five patients with intermittent claudication died within 10 years of being diagnosed with PAD (<LINK REF="REF-Murabito-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murabito 2005</LINK>); this high adverse outcome is also reported in several other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Reunanen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reunanen 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bowlin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowlin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dormandy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormandy 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feringa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feringa 2006</LINK>) and the risk is similar whether the patient is symptomatic or not (<LINK REF="REF-Criqui-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criqui 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hypertension is the name given to high blood pressure that is consistently at such a level that it can cause disease or lead to complications (for example myocardial infarction (MI) (known as a heart attack) or stroke). Hypertension is a common and important risk factor for all vascular disorders including PAD (<LINK REF="REF-Kannel-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannel 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clement-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2007</LINK>). At presentation, between 2% and 5% of hypertensive patients have intermittent claudication, and this prevalence increases with age. Similarly, 35% to 55% of patients with PAD at presentation also have hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Novo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Binaghi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binaghi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Violi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Violi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clement-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 2008</LINK>). Patients who suffer from either hypertension or PAD have a high risk of MI and stroke and when hypertension and PAD are both present the risk is greatly increased (<LINK REF="REF-Makin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clement-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hypertension contributes to the pathogenesis (progression of disease) of atherosclerosis (the basic pathological process underlying PAD) (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bauwens-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauwens 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGill-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGill 1998</LINK>). Indeed, both hypertension and PAD are associated with abnormal levels of lipid and coagulation factors in the blood (<LINK REF="REF-Makin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makin 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-23 01:45:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the co-existence of PAD and hypertension, the overlap in risk factors between the two conditions, the increased risk of non-fatal cardiovascular events in PAD, and the greater risk of death (<LINK REF="REF-Criqui-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criqui 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murabito-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murabito 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clement-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 2013</LINK>) treatment guidelines highlight the importance of reducing the patient's overall cardiovascular risk as well as targeting the individual risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Clement-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESH-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESH 2013</LINK>). Treatment of hypertension in patients with symptoms of PAD is an obvious therapeutic target but this needs careful consideration because of the possibility that the anti-hypertensive medication will cause secondary effects and alter the process(es) causing PAD. While beta-adrenoreceptor blockers (which block the action of noradrenaline and adrenaline on the heart and thus help to reduce blood pressure) are recommended for use in MI to increase survival (<LINK REF="REF-Hjalmarson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hjalmarson 1997</LINK>), there has been some concern that they may worsen the symptoms of intermittent claudication for people with PAD although several studies have shown that there is no evidence to support this (<LINK REF="STD-Bogaert-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bogaert 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hiatt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hiatt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radack-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radack 1991</LINK>). In addition to beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, there are other classes of anti-hypertensives that are commonly used to reduce blood pressure including diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and alpha-adrenoreceptor blockers.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-04 08:06:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mechanism thought to cause the worsening of PAD symptoms with beta-adrenoreceptor blockers is peripheral vasoconstriction (narrowing of peripheral blood vessels) leading to further ischaemia in an already ischaemic limb (reducing blood flow to limbs that already have a poor oxygen supply). There is only scant evidence for this with studies showing either no change in walking distance when one beta-adrenoreceptor blocker is used (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1991</LINK>) or a deterioration (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1996</LINK>), particularly when two beta-adrenoreceptor blockers are combined (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1991</LINK>). Some beta-adrenoreceptor blockers (for example nebivolol or carvedilol) have 'intrinsic sympathomimetic activity' (ISA) that mimics the effects of the sympathetic nervous system causing the blood vessels away from the heart (for example in the feet) to open up (vasodilation) thus allowing greater blood flow. This might be useful for patients with impaired blood flow to the lower extremities (the legs).</P>
<P>If too much sodium is retained by the body, this can lead to fluid overload and increases the blood pressure. Diuretics work by increasing the flow of urine thereby removing sodium and chloride (and in turn water) from the body and can help to lower blood pressure. Control of blood pressure can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular events which are common in PAD patients.</P>
<P>Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (for example, amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine) cause vasodilation thereby helping to lower blood pressure. CCBs such as verapamil and diltiazem also vasodilate blood vessels but they can reduce cardiac output by lowering the heart rate and impair cardiac systolic function. As a result, the 'cardioselective' CCBs should not be used in patients with concomitant heart failure.</P>
<P>ACE inhibitors inhibit the conversion of the inactive form of the hormone angiotensin to the active form. The active form raises blood pressure, thus blocking its formation with ACE inhibitors helps to reduce blood pressure. There is some evidence that ACE inhibitors increase peripheral perfusion (blood flow) and claudication distance (walking distance before onset of pain in people who have this symptom, known as claudicants) in normotensive PAD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Breckenridge-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breckenridge 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ahimastos-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ahimastos 2006</LINK>) although concerns about exacerbating renal artery stenosis (blockage) arise (<LINK REF="REF-Makin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makin 2001</LINK>). These agents are also increasingly recognised for their cardioprotective effects (<LINK REF="REF-HOPE-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">HOPE 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have very similar properties to ACE inhibitors. ARBs selectively block the receptor for angiotensin-II to inhibit vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels), secretion of aldosterone, and sodium and water retention, thereby helping to lower blood pressure.</P>
<P>Cardioselective beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, CCBs, ACE inhibitors and ARBs may potentially help to reduce leg pain by increasing the blood flow to the legs thereby increasing pain-free walking distance. In addition, these drugs have been shown to reduce blood pressure and the risk of cardiovascular events in hypertensive populations and in those with coronary heart disease (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-INVEST-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">INVEST 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VALUE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">VALUE 2006</LINK>) some of which have included patients with concomitant PAD.</P>
<P>Long-acting alpha-adrenoreceptor blockers such as doxazosin also have vasodilating properties (increasing the blood flow) and are recommended as fourth line drugs, in addition to other anti-hypertensive drugs, in people with resistant hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-ESH-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESH 2013</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-11-23 02:08:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current guidelines for treating hypertension recommend an individualised approach using anti-hypertensive agents (<LINK REF="REF-ESH-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESH 2013</LINK>). There is scant evidence from randomised controlled trials of the benefit or harm of one class of anti-hypertensive medication over another in PAD patients and subsequently there are no specific national guidelines on the choice of blood pressure medication in patients with PAD. However, a consensus document for the management of PAD (<LINK REF="REF-TASC_x002d_II-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">TASC-II 2007</LINK>) highlights that controlling a patient's total cardiovascular risk is paramount in such patients. Identification of individual cardiovascular risks, of which hypertension is prevalent, is the first step in the recommendations with subsequent optimal management of each risk factor. Addressing overall cardiovascular risk necessitates polypharmacy and a regimen that includes anti-platelet agents, statins and an ACE inhibitor (unless contraindicated) plus lifestyle modification (smoking cessation, reduction of salt intake, weight control and exercise) (<LINK REF="REF-Clement-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TASC_x002d_II-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">TASC-II 2007</LINK>). Co-morbidities need to be considered when making decisions about treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Clement-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 2008</LINK>) as these may indicate that one anti-hypertensive is preferable to another in a particular patient, for example use of a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker or ACE inhibitor following an acute coronary syndrome or avoidance of the CCB verapamil or diltiazem in those with concomitant heart failure. Anti-hypertensive drugs have been used for many years in the treatment of hypertension although little is known of their effect in PAD. Therefore, before prescribing anti-hypertensive medication for people suffering with PAD, the short-term effects on symptoms and the longer-term effects on disease progression and cardiovascular outcomes should be considered.</P>

<P>For the updated review, risk of bias was assessed independently by the review authors using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We assessed the domains listed below. There were three possible judgements: 'low' risk of bias, 'high' risk of bias, and if insufficient detail was reported the judgement on risk of bias was judged to be 'unclear'. We assessed the new studies included in the updated review and we reassessed the studies already included in the previous versions of the review using these criteria.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias, if the allocation sequence was generated using techniques such as a random number table; a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice.</P>
<P>High risk of bias, if the allocation sequence was generated using techniques such as odd or even date of birth; date (or day) of admission; hospital or clinic record number.</P>
<P>Unclear risk of bias, if there was insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias, if the allocation concealment used methods such as central allocation (including telephone, web-based, and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially numbered opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
<P>High risk of bias, if the participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on using an open random allocation schedule (for example a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes used without appropriate safeguards (for example if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque, or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number.</P>
<P>Unclear risk of bias, if there was insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This was usually the case if the method of concealment was not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement (for example if the use of assignment envelopes was described but it remained unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed).</P>
<P>Where the method of allocation was unclear, we planned to contact study authors for them to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias, if there was no blinding but the review authors judged that the outcome and the outcome measurement were not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of participants and key study personnel was ensured and it was unlikely that the blinding could have been broken; either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others was unlikely to introduce bias.</P>
<P>High risk of bias, if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding and the outcome or outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of key study participants and personnel was attempted but it was likely that the blinding could have been broken; either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded and the non-blinding of others was likely to introduce bias.</P>
<P>Unclear risk of bias, if there was insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias or the study did not address this outcome (for example where the blinding was described only as double-blind without any other details).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Incomplete data assessment (loss of participants, for example with withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias, if there were no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to the true outcome; missing outcome data were balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size; missing data were imputed using appropriate methods.</P>
<P>High risk of bias, if the reasons for missing outcome data were likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk was enough to introduce clinically relevant bias in the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes was enough to introduce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size; 'as-treated' analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation; potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.</P>
<P>Unclear risk of bias, if there was insufficient reporting of attrition or exclusions to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias (for example numbers randomised were not stated, no reasons for missing data were provided); or the study did not address this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Selective outcome reporting</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias, if the study protocol was available and all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that were of interest in the review were reported in the pre-specified way; the study protocol was not available but it was clear that the published reports included all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified.</P>
<P>High risk of bias, if not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes were reported; one or more primary outcomes were reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (for example subscales) that were not pre-specified; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting was provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review were reported incompletely so that they could not be entered in a meta-analysis; the study report failed to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Unclear risk of bias, if there was insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias, if the study appeared to be free of other sources of bias.</P>
<P>High risk of bias, if there was at least one important risk of bias (for example the study had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; stopped early due to some data-dependent process (including a formal stopping rule); had extreme baseline imbalance; had been claimed to be fraudulent; had some other problem).</P>
<P>Unclear risk of bias, if there was either insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias existed or if there was insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem would introduce bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Description of PAD</HEADING>
<P>The description of how PAD was diagnosed differed between the included studies. In the INVEST (INternational VErapamil-SR/Trandolapril) study (<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>), PAD was defined as a documented history of peripheral vascular disease on the baseline form. Schweizer et al (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>) used the Fontaine Stage IIb classification (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 1954</LINK>), that is, a pain-free walking distance of less than 200 m without ischaemic rest pain or trophic changes (changes in skin and muscle related to chronic ischaemia, although how this was quantified was not explained); in addition to arterial angiography and colour-coded duplex ultrasound occlusion (diameter &#8804; 5 cm) or subtotal stenoses in the distal superficial femoral artery that were present for &gt; six months. Overlack et al (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>) included patients with a history of IC for &#8805; six months and Fontaine Stage IIb disease who had a proven occlusion on angiography. Zankl et al (<LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>) included patients with documented PAD and at least Stage Fontaine IIa. The NORMA (Nebivolol or Metoprolol in Arterial Occlusive Disease) trial (<LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) defined PAD as stable IC (Fontaine Stage II) for &#8805; six months and an ABI &lt; 0.9 (measured as the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the ankle and arm). The HOPE trial (<LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2004</LINK>) defined PAD as either a history of IC with an ABI &lt; 0.9 (measured by manual palpation of the foot pulse and not ultrasound doppler) or previous vascular intervention or limb amputation for PAD. Diehm et al (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>) included patients with one or more of the following: a history of typical IC for at &#8805; six months; actual proven PAD by objective means such as haemodynamics and non-invasive imaging or angiography; history of previous vascular intervention; or ABI of the worse leg &lt; 0.9. In the DAPHNE (Doxazosin Atherosclerosis Progression in Hypertension in the NEtherlands) study (<LINK REF="STD-DAPHNE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DAPHNE 2002</LINK>) PAD was defined as IC or peripheral vascular surgery because of atherosclerosis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Definition of hypertension</HEADING>
<P>The studies used a variety of different criteria to define hypertension. Schweizer (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>) and Overlack (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>) included patients with mild essential hypertension, which was quantified in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>) as a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 104 mmHg on three different occasions. The DAPHNE study defined hypertension on the basis of diastolic blood pressure alone, 95 to 115 mmHg in two out of three supine readings (<LINK REF="STD-DAPHNE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DAPHNE 2002</LINK>). The HOPE study defined hypertension as blood pressure &gt; 160/90 mmHg or on the basis that people were on anti-hypertensive treatment (<LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2004</LINK>). Zankl et al (<LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>) included patients with arterial hypertension which was not defined but those with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &#8805; 170 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &#8805; 95 mmHg or both) were excluded. The NORMA study (<LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) included patients with stage I arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 to 159 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 to 99 mmHg) or a previous diagnosis of stage I arterial hypertension who were under current treatment. At the time of inclusion, SBP had to be &gt; 100 mmHg and &lt; 160 mmHg, with DBP &lt; 100 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>). Diehm et al (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>) included patients with a SBP between 140 and 179 mmHg and a DBP 90 to 109 mmHg with or without treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs at screening. After a four-week run-in period, the second eligibility criterion for hypertension was a SBP &gt; 130 mmHg and DBP pressure &gt; 85 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>). The INVEST study (<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>) included patients with essential hypertension defined as SBP &gt; 140 mmHg and DBP &gt; 90 mmHg (if diabetes or renal impairment was present hypertension was defined as SBP &gt; 130 mmHg and DBP &gt; 85 mmHg) requiring treatment.</P>

<P>For the updated review, risk of bias was assessed independently by two review authors using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1303141313470263872822991452405&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>).

<P>Two (<LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>) of the included studies provided information about adequate random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Patients were randomised using a central telephone service in the HOPE study (<LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2004</LINK>), and Diehm used a computer-generated randomisation list (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>). There was a low risk of bias in allocation concealment in both these studies (<LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>) as treatment was double-blind. In the subgroup analysis of the INVEST study (<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>) there was a low risk of bias in random sequence generation because patients were randomised using an electronic system available via the Internet. However, allocation concealment was unclear because, although the investigator was informed electronically of treatment allocation, the treatment was open label. In five of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DAPHNE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DAPHNE 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) patients were randomised to the treatment arms but it was unclear if there was any selection bias because no further description of the random sequence generation or allocation concealment process was provided.</P>

<P>The HOPE study (<LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2004</LINK>) demonstrated a low risk of performance bias and detection bias because the trial was double-blind and the outcome of cardiovascular events was classified by a committee of two clinicians blinded to treatment allocation who reviewed clinical records of all cardiovascular events reported by recruiting centres to determine whether they met the endpoint criteria.</P>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>) the risk of performance bias and detection bias for patients and physicians was low because both were blinded to treatment allocation and the nebivolol and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) tablets were manufactured to be identical in size and appearance. However, no detail was given on the blinding of the outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DAPHNE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DAPHNE 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) both the patients and the physicians were blinded to treatment but no further details were given on patient or physician blinding resulting in an unclear risk of bias. In addition, no details were given on the blinding of outcome assessments in three of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DAPHNE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DAPHNE 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>). In the study by Schweizer (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>) two of the three outcomes (assessed by colour-coded duplex scan) were reviewed by two independent experts who were unaware of which group the participant was allocated to. In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>) the risk of performance bias and detection bias was unclear as the trial design was single-blind and, although the physician was not aware of treatment allocation, no information was available on the blinding process of the patients, physicians or outcome assessors.</P>
<P>The INVEST study (<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>) had a high risk of performance bias and detection bias in terms of the patients and physicians as INVEST was an open-label trial. Physicians could down-titrate the initial dose of verapamil or HCTZ monotherapy or up-titrate medication in a stepped fashion and the final step of treatment titration allowed the physician to add in any non-study anti-hypertensive (except beta-adrenoreceptor blockers for calcium antagonist-based strategy patients and calcium antagonists for beta-adrenoreceptor blocker strategy patients) at their discretion to control blood pressure. However, outcomes were adjudicated by a blinded events committee resulting in a low risk of bias in outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>).</P>

Another study (<LINK REF="STD-DAPHNE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DAPHNE 2002</LINK>) had a high risk of attrition bias as 25% of patients dropped out overall but the attrition rate was higher with HCTZ (30.8%) than doxazosin (19.5%).</P>

In the HOPE study (<LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2004</LINK>) the permanent discontinuation rate was around 30% but it was similar between the treatment arms (ramipril 28.9% versus placebo 27.3%) and the data were analysed on an ITT basis. In the Overlack study (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>) the overall dropout rate was 3.2% and 1.7% in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively, but the actual number of PAD patients with follow-up data was not clear. In the Zankl study (<LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>) the attrition rate was 10% (n = 4) due to premature discontinuation of the study medication because of non-adherence but no detail was given on which drug they were randomised to.</P>

In terms of ABI there was no statistically significant difference between the active drug and placebo immediately after angioplasty or at six weeks. However, six months after the angioplasty there was a marginal benefit on ABI in favour of the calcium antagonist, although the 95% CI fell exactly on zero (MD 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.08). The degree of diameter stenosis and arterial IMT six months after angioplasty showed a significant reduction with the use of verapamil (MD -21.6%, 95% CI -26.4 to -16.8; and MD -0.70 mm, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.54, respectively) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>, respectively) compared to placebo.

<P>Although there can be little question about the validity of outcome measures such as walking distance and cardiovascular events, some of the measures used in published studies (for example calf blood flow and ABI) might be regarded as surrogate endpoints.

<P>Three of the studies examining the effect of anti-hypertensives on arterial IMT reported conflicting results (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DAPHNE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DAPHNE 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>). One (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>) demonstrated a significant improvement in arterial IMT with verapamil compared to placebo six weeks and six months following peripheral arterial angioplasty (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>), while the other two (<LINK REF="STD-DAPHNE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DAPHNE 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>) found no difference in arterial IMT between HCTZ and doxazosin (<LINK REF="STD-DAPHNE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DAPHNE 2002</LINK>) or telmisartan and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>). Verapamil was also associated with a reduction in the degree of restenosis compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) examined the effects of the anti-hypertensives on ABI.

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) compared nebivolol to either HCTZ (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>) or metoprolol (<LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) and both found no significant difference in ABI between the two anti-hypertensives. The reduction in the degree of narrowing within the affected artery that was seen with verapamil (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>) should be considered in the light of a very marginal improvement in ABI six months after angioplasty, and no data on symptoms. It is possible that although there was restenosis on placebo little deterioration in blood flow occurred due to other mechanisms such as the formation of new blood vessels, called collaterals, to take the blood to the feet.</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) investigating the effects of the anti-hypertensives ramipril (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>) and nebivolol (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>), HCTZ (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>) or metoprolol (<LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) reported no significant improvement in IC distance with treatment. These three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) plus one other (<LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>) also examined the effect of anti-hypertensives on MWD, IC distance plus metres walked in pain. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) comparing two anti-hypertensives treatments reported no significant differences in MWD, while the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>) comparing active drug to placebo reported conflicting results. Overlack reported a significant improvement in MWD with placebo compared to ACE inhibitor (MD -46.00 m, 95% CI -69.74 to -22.26) (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), while the other (<LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>) found a significant improvement in the MWD with telmisartan compared to placebo (median 191 m, 95% CI 157 to 226 and 132 m, 95% CI 103 to 192, respectively; P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>Therefore, it appears that ACE inhibitors are effective in reducing the number of cardiovascular events (<LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2004</LINK>), with no significant differences in cardiovascular events between anti-hypertensive regimens (<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>) with blinded outcome assessment in hypertensive patients with PAD, verapamil appears to significantly improve arterial IMT and reduce the degree of restenosis six months after peripheral arterial angioplasty (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>). Anti-hypertensives do not appear to improve ABI or IC distance. There is conflicting evidence on the benefit of anti-hypertensives in improving MWD, with one study (<LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>) reporting an improvement in MWD with telmisartan compared to placebo while another (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>) demonstrated an improvement in MWD with placebo compared to ramipril. However, caution is warranted when interpreting the results given that four (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DAPHNE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DAPHNE 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>) of the eight included studies had relatively small numbers of patients, ranging from 36 (<LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>) to 98 (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>), and two (<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2004</LINK>) were subgroup analyses; many were underpowered for some or all of the outcomes assessed.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-11-23 06:02:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall the quality of the available evidence was unclear, primarily as a result of a lack of detail in the study reports on the randomisation and blinding procedures and incomplete outcome data (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The one exception was the HOPE study (<LINK REF="STD-HOPE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE 2004</LINK>), which demonstrated a low risk of bias except for a high attrition rate of 30%, although it used an ITT analysis. The DAPHNE study (<LINK REF="STD-DAPHNE-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DAPHNE 2002</LINK>) also had a high risk of attrition bias with one quarter of all patients discontinuing study medication but a higher attrition rate with HCTZ than doxazosin.</P>
<P>The PAD subgroup analysis of the INVEST study (<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>) was at high risk of performance and detection bias (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) as the trial was an open-label trial and medication could be up-titrated at the discretion of the physician, however the cardiovascular outcomes were independently adjudicated by a panel blinded to treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>). In addition, the definition of PAD employed in INVEST was a documented history of PAD at baseline and no detailed information regarding the diagnosis of PAD was available (<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>). Further, there was a high risk of reporting bias in the subgroup analysis of INVEST (<LINK REF="STD-INVEST-2003" TYPE="STUDY">INVEST 2003</LINK>) as only the two composite endpoints were reported and not the individual components of the composite endpoints which were also listed as outcomes. Three other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) also had a high risk of selective reporting (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Overlack did not report the data collected for all the various subgroups, just the most disease-specific or relevant outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>), and Schweizer did not report distance to claudication after treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>). In the NORMA study (<LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) only the endpoint analyses were reported; the safety population data (those who received &#8805; one dose of double-blind medication) described in the data analysis section was not included.</P>

<P>Our search strategy included a comprehensive search of several electronic databases. In addition, we wrote to the authors of included and excluded studies requesting further data.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-11-23 06:09:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There has been much debate about the use of beta-adrenoreceptor blockers in intermittent claudication (IC), with early case reports suggesting that they should not be used at all. The limited data from the published trials suggest that there is very little evidence to support this practice. There is no evidence in this review to suggest that beta-adrenoreceptor blockers should not be used in the presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, this is due more to a lack of evidence from large studies rather than a definite lack of effect. The proven value of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade as a treatment for hypertension and following MI, combined with the lack of evidence for avoidance in PAD, suggests that the use of this class of drug in hypertensive patients with PAD may be warranted. If any doubt continues in the clinician's mind, then a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) should probably be used.</P>
<P>The positive effect of ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular events in patients at high cardiovascular risk cannot be ignored (<LINK REF="REF-HOPE-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">HOPE 1996</LINK>), although limited data are available in the hypertensive population per se. However, in a hypertensive patient with PAD some caution is needed where patients have associated renovascular disease.</P>
<P>The evidence for benefit of other anti-hypertensive drug classes, specifically in patients with PAD and hypertension, is lacking. However, the current guidelines recommend lowering blood pressure in PAD patients to the same target blood pressure as for other high-risk groups in the absence of compelling data to the contrary. There is overwhelming evidence from clinical trials of the benefit of lowering systemic blood pressure to prevent cardiovascular events and mortality. The lack of data to date specifically examining outcomes in PAD patients should not detract from the overwhelming evidence of the benefit of treating hypertension and lowering blood pressure. The most recent European guidelines on the management of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-ESH-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESH 2013</LINK>) suggest that optimal control of blood pressure in PAD patients is paramount and that the choice of anti-hypertensive is secondary to this. Expert consensus statements recommend total cardiovascular risk management in PAD patients employing anti-platelet agents and statins in addition to lifestyle modification and optimising blood pressure control.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-11-23 06:12:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clearly, as PAD and hypertension are significant problems in patients today and doubt exists about the treatment of one condition in the presence of the other, more research is indicated. Studies to date suggest that there are no differences in ABI between anti-hypertensive drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) or compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zankl-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zankl 2010</LINK>). Anti-hypertensives do not appear to worsen IC distance (<LINK REF="STD-Overlack-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overlack 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diehm-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Diehm 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NORMA-2011" TYPE="STUDY">NORMA 2011</LINK>) but data on the effect of anti-hypertensives on maximum walking distance (MWD) is conflicting, although the sample sizes in these studies were small (ranging from 54 to 163 people). Since it would be unethical to withhold anti-hypertensive treatment from hypertensive patients with PAD, future large-scale studies in such patients are needed which specifically measure walking distances and ankle brachial index (ABI) to examine whether the lowering of systemic blood pressure is associated with worsened limb perfusion leading to exacerbation of claudication symptoms and shorter walking distances, as well as examining the effects of such treatment on mortality and cardiovascular events. Such data could produce helpful recommendations regarding their future use. However, given that PAD patients are likely to be receiving polypharmacy, particularly statins and anti-platelet therapy, it may be difficult to disentangle the specific benefit of anti-hypertensive medication on cardiovascular events and mortality per se.</P>

The four who dropped were out due to premature discontinuation of the study medication, due to non-adherence. No detail is given on which drug they were randomised to. IMT was assessed by more than one sonographer but they were trained using a standardised protocol (not specified in paper) and used a common and extensively validated imaging protocol. A minimum of three measurements at different sites on each common carotid artery were obtained and IMT values were averaged.
