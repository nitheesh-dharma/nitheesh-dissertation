<TITLE>Vaccines for preventing infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> in cystic fibrosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-20 09:43:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vaccinating people with cystic fibrosis to prevent infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease where thick mucus is produced in the lungs. This can stop the lungs clearing bacteria such as <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> and other bacteria. This causes long-lasting lung infections in approximately 80% of adult patients; these infections result in permanent lung damage.</P>
<P>Vaccines have been developed which aim to reduce infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> and it is important to know whether using these vaccines can prevent lung infection.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 30 March 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for vaccine trials where cystic fibrosis patients were selected at random to receive either an active vaccine or no vaccine (or a placebo, which is a dummy vaccine with no active medication). We also looked for trials comparing different types of vaccine or different schedules or doses of the same vaccine. We included three trials; two compared a <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> vaccine to a placebo and the third compared a vaccine to no vaccine. The two trials comparing a vaccine to placebo had 959 cystic fibrosis patients (483 in one and 476 in the other); the third trial recruited 37 patients with cystic fibrosis. The average age of the patients was about seven years in all three trials. All of the patients were free of infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> at the start of the trials and had a lung function of at least 50% of predicted for age. The two large trials followed the patients for two and four years, respectively; the small trial followed the patients for between 10 and 12 years.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We were only able to present the results from one of the large trials (483 cystic fibrosis patients) comparing an active vaccine to a placebo and the small trial (37 cystic fibrosis patients) with a no vaccination comparison group. Results for the second large trial have not been published, but the manufacturers stated that results did not confirm the findings from an earlier trial and that further clinical development had been suspended. The results we have from the two trials show that after vaccination the risk of getting a chronic infection did not decrease and lung function was similar in both groups of cystic fibrosis patients. One of the patients from the large trial died during the two year follow-up period; in the small trial, one patient from each group had died after seven to eight years and by the end of the trial (10 to 12 years) six patients in each group had died. Those who died were all chronically infected with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>. Investigators in the large trial, recorded 227 adverse events (four of which were classed as severe) in the vaccine group and 91 (one of which was classed as severe) in the placebo group. The large trial also reported a rise in antibodies against <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> with no change in the placebo group.</P>
<P>On the basis of these results, we cannot recommend the use of vaccines against <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> in patients with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We did have some concerns that in the large trial which provided data for this review, the participants in the vaccine group were apparently older, taller and heavier than those in the placebo group. This may be due to pure chance, but the paper did not acknowledge this fact. We also had some concerns about how the cystic fibrosis patients in the small trial were randomised to the different treatments.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-20 09:35:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Chronic pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis results in progressive lung damage. Once colonisation of the lungs with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>occurs, it is almost impossible to eradicate. Vaccines, aimed at reducing infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, have been developed. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-17 08:39:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Six trials were identified. Two trials were excluded since they were not randomised and one old, small trial because it was not possible to assess whether is was randomised. The three included trials comprised 483, 476 and 37 patients, respectively. No data have been published from one of the large trials, but the company stated in a press release that the trial failed to confirm the results from an earlier study and that further clinical development was suspended. In the other large trial, relative risk for chronic infection was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.49), and in the small trial, the risk was also close to one. In the large trial, one patient was reported to have died in the observation period. In that trial, 227 adverse events (4 severe) were registered in the vaccine group and 91 (1 severe) in the control group. In this large trial of a vaccine developed against flagella antigens, antibody titres against the epitopes contained in the vaccine were higher in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group (P &lt; 0.0001).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-20 09:43:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-05-06 16:06:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease in Caucasians affecting approximately 1 in 2500 to 4700 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1995</LINK>). The gene that is abnormal encodes a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (CFTR) which is a membrane bound chloride channel important in the transport of salt and water in and out of the cells that line the airways (<LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 1995</LINK>). This in turn leads to the production of thick mucus, which causes plugging of the airways and impairs the clearance of bacteria from the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 1995</LINK>). Recurrent episodes of infection and inflammation lead to progressive damage to the lung tissue, characterised by bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis and eventually to respiratory failure.</P>
<P>Recurrent and chronic lung infections are caused by <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I>, <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I>, <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P. aeruginosa</I>) and in some patients with CF also <I>Burkholderia cepacia</I> complex (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00f8_iby-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Høiby 2000</LINK>). Virtually all patients with CF will eventually become infected with <I>P. aeruginosa</I>. The presence of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> is associated with a pronounced antibody response and a marked neutrophil inflammation (intense acute inflammation), which is ineffective in clearing the bacteria from the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 1995</LINK>). The main reasons are that <I>P. aeruginosa</I> produces alginate (carbohydrate), which surrounds the bacteria growing in small colonies within the lungs (biofilm). This biofilm mode of growth protects the bacteria from the host defence mechanisms and antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00f8_iby-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Høiby 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The immune response can be divided into the antibody-mediated response, and the cellular-mediated response. When bacteria infect the airways, an antibody response usually ensues in immunocompetent individuals. As a result, antibodies which can hinder the attachment of further bacteria and neutralise toxic products are produced. Additionally, the antibodies activate the complement system, and increase the ability of some white blood cells, neutrophil leukocytes, to ingest and kill bacteria. Most patients with CF produce large quantities of antibodies directed against various components of <I>P. aeruginosa</I>. However, the naturally occurring immune response is generally ineffective in clearing the infection, and the antibodies may even be detrimental, e.g. because of immune complex formation. Wheeler and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Wheeler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheeler 1994</LINK>) found that CF children with low antibody levels (total IgG) had better respiratory status than those with a normal or high IgG level. The ability of antibodies to fight infection is limited, as neutrophil elastase and other enzymes digest them. <I>P. aeruginosa </I>also produce large quantities of alginate that may mask targets for antibodies on the surface of the bacteria. Additionally, <I>P. aeruginosa</I> growing in microcolonies are too large to be ingested and killed by neutrophils, which allows the bacteria to effectively evade the immune system. The constant attempts of the immune system to clear the large microcolonies of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> results in leakage of toxic enzymes from neutrophils (frustrated phagocytosis), causing further lung damage (<LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-07 07:47:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Vaccination aims to elicit a long-term protective immune response by the administration of a safe preparation of an organism or a purified or recombinant component. Vaccination may be effective:</P>
<OL>
<LI>by preventing an organism entering the body (usually by generation of neutralising antibodies);</LI>
<LI>by eliciting a strong immune response that clears infection rapidly, should it occur; or</LI>
<LI>by neutralising toxic products of the infecting organism during the course of the infection.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Once an immune response has been induced, it cannot be readily reversed, even if it subsequently proves to be detrimental.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-05-06 16:07:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The role of the cellular immune system involving T lymphocytes and their products in protection against bacterial infections is unclear in patients with CF. However, in a rat model of chronic <I>P. aeruginosa</I> lung infection, a vaccine containing depolymerised alginate conjugated to toxin A produced a cellular response (Th1 response) that was protective (<LINK REF="REF-Johansen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 1995</LINK>). It is possible, although by no means clear, that such a response could be beneficial in CF.</P>
<P>It has generally been accepted that the immune function is normal in patients with CF. However, it has been demonstrated that the CF gene product, CFTR, is expressed on T lymphocytes, and that production of chemical messengers that co-ordinate the immune response (cytokines) by these T lymphocytes may be altered in CF (<LINK REF="REF-Moss-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 1996</LINK>). Thus, the response to vaccination may be altered in patients with CF.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-07-20 09:43:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We aimed to study whether vaccination against <I>P. aeruginosa</I> is beneficial in CF, and to compare the effects of different vaccines. There are two potential groups of patients with CF in whom vaccination against <I>P. aeruginosa</I> is of interest:</P>
<OL>
<LI>patients who are not yet colonised by <I>P. aeruginosa</I>;</LI>
<LI>patients who are intermittently colonised by <I>P. aeruginosa</I>.</LI>
</OL>
<P>This review is an update of previously published versions (<LINK REF="REF-Johansen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keogan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keogan 1999</LINK>).</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-05-06 16:08:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>To study the immunogenicity and clinical effectiveness of vaccination against <I>P. aeruginosa </I>in CF, and to compare the effects of different anti-pseudomonal vaccines. Specifically, we wished to test the following hypotheses that vaccination against <I>P. aeruginosa</I>:</P>
<OL>
<LI>delays or prevents chronic <I>P. aeruginosa</I> lung infection;</LI>
<LI>prevents deterioration in respiratory function;</LI>
<LI>decreases the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations;</LI>
<LI>increases the levels of anti-pseudomonas antibodies in serum or secretions;</LI>
<LI>enhances T cell reactivity to <I>P. aeruginosa</I>.</LI>

<P>In the Döring trial, the authors noted that there were no significant differences between the groups in sex, age, height, weight, body mass index and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-D_x00f6_ring-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Döring 2007</LINK>). However, as there were rather obvious differences in a table, we checked this statement. There were no data for body mass index, but we calculated significant differences for age (P = 0.01), height (P = 0.008) and weight (P = 0.04), with higher numbers in the vaccine group. Differences of such magnitudes do occasionally happen in adequately randomised trials, e.g. in 8 out of 1000 trials, if height is considered, and they are not necessarily important, but as the statement in the paper was incorrect, it raises the question whether other analyses were also incorrectly reported.</P>
<P>In the small trial, the patients were "divided into two groups, matched for age and sex" "with no knowledge of clinical details" (<LINK REF="STD-Langford-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Langford 1983</LINK>). However, "several patients allocated to a group developed <I>pseudomonas</I> infection after the study commenced but before they could be entered and vaccinated", and the authors reported that "this led to some slight imbalance in sex distribution" despite the matching for sex. This suggests that some patients (no numbers are given in any of the publications) with a poor prognosis who were allocated to the vaccine group were either excluded from the trial or later changed status and were referred to the control group.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-18 13:00:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The trial data we reviewed did not suggest that the vaccines tested for preventing infection against <I>P. aeruginosa</I> were effective. Two large trials have been performed, but no data have been made public from one of them (<LINK REF="STD-Lang-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 2004a</LINK>). The press release announcing that the company had suspended further clinical development stated that the trial failed to confirm the results from an earlier study but did not contain any data (<LINK REF="STD-Lang-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 2004b)</LINK>. We contacted the company and were initially informed that we would be able to obtain the unpublished data. However, we have not received any information, not even when we only asked for an abstract. The press release was distributed in July 2006, and we believe it is an obligation towards the patients who volunteered for the trial that the results of their efforts and altruism become publicly available. Other researchers may develop vaccines and it is important to know about past successes and failures to proceed as rationally as possible.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In the other large trial, the patients were recruited over a three-year period, until February 2000 (<LINK REF="STD-D_x00f6_ring-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Döring 2007</LINK>). An additional seven years passed before the trial was published in 2007. The analyses could therefore have been more powerful if the authors had used survival analysis and followed the patients up for longer, rather than reporting a relative risk after only two years.</P>
<P>In the small trial, there were no meaningful data on lung function. A significantly larger fall in PEFR was observed in the vaccinated group during follow up, but a significantly higher mean PEFR on entry was also observed (<LINK REF="STD-Langford-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Langford 1983</LINK>). Furthermore, this was a subgroup result among those 13 out of 34 patients who developed chronic infection, and after ten years, there was no difference in survival, lung function or proportion with chronic <I>P. aeruginosa</I> infection.</P>
<P>Effective vaccines have been developed against other bacteria, e.g. <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I>, <I>Neisseria meningitidis</I> and <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I>, and there is clearly a need for additional basic research to further increase our understanding of those elements of the immune response to <I>P. aeruginosa</I> that could potentially have a protective effect in patients with CF. Beneficial alterations in immune responses have been seen in animal experiments (<LINK REF="REF-Johansen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 1995</LINK>) and should be further evaluated (<LINK REF="REF-Moser-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moser 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>Paper states that "several patients allocated to a group developed pseudomonas infection after the study commenced but before they could be entered and vaccinated", and the authors reported that "this led to some slight imbalance in sex distribution" despite the matching for sex. This suggests that some patients (no numbers are given in any of the publications) with a poor prognosis who were allocated to the vaccine group were either excluded from the trial or later changed status and were referred to the control group.</P>
