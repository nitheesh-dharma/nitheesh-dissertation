<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-06 18:30:05 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pre-eclampsia is a condition in pregnancy involving high blood pressure and protein in the urine (proteinuria) after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Most women with mild pre-eclampsia give birth without problems. However, severe pre-eclampsia can cause major problems with the liver, blood clotting etc, and some women go on to have fits (eclampsia). This can lead very occasionally to serious complications, and possibly to a life-threatening situation for both the mother and her baby. Chinese herbal medicines might help to protect vulnerable organs like the liver and kidneys, and so these remedies may help with pre-eclampsia. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) incorporates concepts of cause, diagnosis and treatment. Typical treatment in TCM is Chinese herbal remedies based on one or several herbs that come from natural plants. Their selection is often based on the individual and presence of TCM symptoms. The prescribed herbs are combined by a distinctive method to form the prescription. In recent decades, TCM has sometimes been integrated with Western medicine to incorporate its therapeutic concepts. Not all Chinese herbal medicines are free of risk, and there are concerns regarding adverse events; for example, allergic reaction and Chinese herbal nephropathy (kidney damage).</P>
<P>The authors searched for controlled trials that randomly assigned women with pre-eclampsia, toxaemia or pregnancy-induced hypertension to treatment with Chinese herbal medicines (or integrated Western medicine with Chinese herbal medicines) or a control treatment. The control treatment could be a placebo, no treatment or a Western medicine. The authors identified no trials that were suitable for inclusion and so the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicines for treating pre-eclampsia remains unclear. Although the authors identified 45 studies, none of the trials reported adequate methodology to be classified as randomised controlled trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-04 20:47:52 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Pre-eclampsia has classically been defined as the triad of hypertension, proteinuria and oedema occurring after 20 weeks' gestation in a previously normotensive woman (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1996</LINK>). Recently, pre-eclampsia (toxaemia) is defined as hypertension accompanied by proteinuria (protein in the urine) (<LINK REF="REF-Meher-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meher 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHBPEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEP 2000</LINK>). Pre-eclampsia is a common disorder that complicates 6% to 8% of pregnancies and can progress to a life-threatening situation for both the mother and the fetus. A number of medications have been used in an attempt to prevent and treat pre-eclampsia. Given the gaps in understanding the underlying pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia, the mechanisms by which many of these agents are reputed to act are theoretical at best. Anticonvulsants (agents that can inhibit a blood vessel from spasm) are used in the belief that they help treating eclamptic fits and subsequent poor outcomes for mother and infant. If an anticonvulsant is used for pre-eclampsia, magnesium sulphate appears to be the best choice but with side effects, especially flushing (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2003</LINK>). Antihypertensive drugs are often used for severe hypertensive pregnant women in the belief that lowering blood pressure will inhibit progression to more severe disease, and thereby improve outcomes, but which antihypertensive drug is the best is still unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2006</LINK>). However, it remains unclear whether antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is worthwhile (<LINK REF="REF-Abalos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abalos 2007</LINK>). Antiplatelet agents, low-dose aspirin in particular, might delay the development of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2007</LINK>). Dopamine (a catecholamine neurotransmitter in the brain and the precursor to norepinephrine and epinephrine) which help to increase urine output may theoretically help with the low urine output for severe pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Steyn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steyn 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In recent years there have been a number of definitions of pre-eclampsia in China. Prior to 2004, women were considered as having pre-eclampsia if they had mild, moderate or severe pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). Since 2004, the international criteria for pre-eclampsia have been applied in China (<LINK REF="REF-Gou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gou 2004</LINK>). Pre-eclampsia is classified as mild or severe. Mild pre-eclampsia is defined as hypertension occurring after 20 weeks' gestation (blood pressure is equal to or more than 140/90 mmHg), proteinuria (equal to or more than 300 mg/24 h or (1+)), with or without symptoms, such as headache. There is no widely accepted definition of severe pre-eclampsia. Nevertheless, the following are generally regarded as features of severe disease: severe hypertension (blood pressure at least 160 mmHg systolic, or 110 mmHg diastolic), severe proteinuria (usually at least 3 g (range 2 g to 5 g) protein in 24 hours, or 3+ on dipstick), reduced urinary volume (less than 400 ml to 500 ml in 24 hours), neurological disturbances such as headache, visual disturbances, and exaggerated tendon reflexes, upper abdominal pain, pulmonary oedema (fluid in the lungs), impaired liver function tests, high serum creatinine, low platelets, intrauterine growth restriction or reduced liquor volume (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meher-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meher 2005</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of pre-eclampsia</HEADING>
<P>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a theoretical and methodological system that incorporates concepts of cause, diagnosis and treatment. Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) are taken, or made, from natural plants. They are used as medication in the TCM system. TCM herbal formulas are primarily given according to the syndrome/pattern identified from the disease. In recent decades, TCM has sometimes been integrated with Western medicine to incorporate its diagnostic, etiological and therapeutic concepts.</P>
<P>In TCM before the middle of the 1990s, PIH was thought to have been caused by damage to the Pi (the spleen). According to TCM, the function of the spleen is to digest, absorb and transport nutrients, and control blood pressure. CHM were used in order to protect and improve the function of the spleen. However, these medicines were later found to be ineffective. After the middle of the 1990s, further advances were made regarding the pathophysiologic mechanism of PIH. Spasms in the arterioles were identified as being the main mechanism. Medicines which are thought to encourage vasodilation and increase the blood flow are now widely used in treating women with PIH. These CHM include Chuan Xiong Qin (Ligustrazine, extracted from rhizome of Sichuan lovage). Their pharmacological functions were suggested by experimental research. For example, Dan Shen (Salvia Miltiorrhiza) may reduce whole blood viscosity and dilate small arteries (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1998</LINK>); Fu Ling (Sclerotium Poriae Cocos) may increase urinary output in women with oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 1998</LINK>); Chuan Xiong (rhizome of Sichuan lovage) may produce a marked and sustained reduction in blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1998a</LINK>); Dang Gui (angelica) may relax uterine smooth muscle and inhibit platelet adhesion (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1998</LINK>); Yi Mu Cao (Herba Leonuri) may reduce whole blood viscosity and inhibit platelet adhesion (<LINK REF="REF-Ran-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ran 2003</LINK>). All the above CHM, except Chuan Xiong Qin, are usually used as a composition of mixed CHM prescription. Chuan Xiong Qin may be used as either a single CHM (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1993</LINK>) or as the composition of prescription (<LINK REF="STD-Wei-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wei 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>TCM considers that, when a woman is pregnant, most of the blood of the mother is directed to the placenta to provide the baby with the required nutrition. Maternal liver, spleen and kidneys may in consequence be vulnerable to damage. CHM that can protect these organs in pre-eclampsia by encouraging vasodilatation, increasing blood flow and decreasing platelet aggregation, such as Dan Shen, Yi Mu Cao, and Chuan Xiong are of potentially great value. The use of CHM is often based on the individual situation and presence of TCM symptoms. For example, Dan Shen, Chuan Xiong Qin may be prescribed as basic drugs for pre-eclamptic women, while Fu Ling is prescribed as an assistant drug only for women with edema. Therefore, different women with different symptoms might use different assistant drugs.</P>
<P>Increasing the quantity of blood flow provided to the placenta is the purpose of TCM in treating pre-eclampsia. Many CHM improving blood microcirculation, preventing vessel spasm, decreasing blood pressure, are used in treating pre-eclampsia. Ligustrazine and Salvia Miltiorrhizae are the main basic medicines. Ligustrazine extracted from rhizome of Sichuan lovage is a kind of alkaloid. It can increase the level of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) secreted by vascular endotheliocyte (<LINK REF="REF-Tao-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tao 1987</LINK>). The major composition of Salvia Miltiorrhizae is salvia miltiorrhiza ketone-A and sulfonic natrium. Salvia miltiorrhiza ketone-A and sulfonic natrium can significantly inhibit the action of Mg-ATP enzyme activated by platelet actin, depress activity of platelet contractive protein and decrease the level of plasma thromboxane2 (TXA2) (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1988</LINK>). Both Ligustrazine and Dan Shen can clear oxygen-derived free radicals, improving function of endotheliocyte, expand the smooth muscle of blood vessel and bronchia, increase the blood flow of heart and brain, expand arteriolar vessel, improving microcirculation, inhibit platelet congregating and depress platelet activity (<LINK REF="REF-Industry-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Industry 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 1990</LINK>). Other CHM have different effects. For example, angelica can decrease the level of plasma endothelin (ET) (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1998b</LINK>); puerarin can inhibit excessive release of ET and increase the level of PGI2 (<LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2005</LINK>); taurine can inhibit the increase of ET and calitonin gene related peptide in central nerve system (<LINK REF="REF-Qu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qu 2003</LINK>); flavone of ginkgo leaf can decrease the level of nitric oxide and the activity of ET (<LINK REF="REF-Geng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geng 2002</LINK>); motherwort can inhibit congregating of red blood cells and platelets (<LINK REF="REF-Ran-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ran 2003</LINK>); and tuckahoe can increase the blood flow of kidney and increase the quantity of urine (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many non-randomised controlled trials on TCM in treating pre-eclampsia have been published. Most of the conclusions of these studies are positive.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Rationale for undertaking this review</HEADING>
<P>In China, the use of CHM is very popular. CHM, either with or without Western medicine, has been reported to be effective for the treatment of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1994</LINK>). Increasing numbers of doctors believe that using CHM with Western medicines has a beneficial effect. Evaluating methods for the treatment of pre-eclampsia has resulted in a number of publications comparing the benefits of CHM with Western medicines. For example, three trials including 346 participants have been conducted to investigate the use of Chuan Xiong, Dan Shen, etc, in the treatment of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1997</LINK>). These showed apparent benefits, but the quality and the effects of these trials have not been assessed and systematically reviewed. Therefore, it is important to review available evidence exploring the exact effect that CHM has on the treatment of women with pre-eclampsia.</P>
<P>Interest is not confined to China; CHM are widely used elsewhere: "We are now experiencing a rapid increase in the use of Chinese herbal medicines across the Western world" (<LINK REF="REF-HLSC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">HLSC 2004</LINK>). There is increasing public interest in, and use of, a range of therapies, which lie outside the 'mainstream' of traditional medical practice.</P>
<P>However, there is evidence to indicate that not all CHM are free of risk. There are concerns regarding adverse events: for example, allergic reaction, and Chinese herbal nephropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Lampert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lampert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lord-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nortier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nortier 2000</LINK>). However, very few studies have reported the side effects of these herbal medicines when used by pregnant women.</P>
<P>This review aimed to summarise the existing evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of CHM for treating pre-eclampsia.<B> </B>

Diagnostic criteria such as the definition of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-NHBPEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEP 2000</LINK>) were acceptable. The terms ' toxaemia', 'gestational proteinuric hypertension' and 'pre-eclampsia' were also acceptable although it should be noted that the term 'pre-eclampsia' was usually used when there was proteinuria. We included women irrespective of age, gestational week and whether the pregnancy was singleton or multiple.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">(1) Selection of trials</HEADING>
<P>To determine the studies to be assessed further, three review authors (Zhang, Zhou, Tang) independently scanned the titles, abstract sections and keywords of every record. We retrieved full articles for further assessment if the information given suggested that the study:</P>
<OL>
<LI>included participants with pre-eclampsia;</LI>
<LI>compared CHM with any other active or placebo intervention;</LI>
<LI>assessed one or more relevant clinical outcome measure;</LI>
<LI>used random or pseudo-random allocation to the comparison groups.</LI>
</OL>
<P>If there was any doubt regarding these criteria from the information given in the title and abstract, we also retrieved the full article for clarification. We included only randomised controlled trials, which we trained investigators to identify. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion (Zhang, Wu). If we could not reach agreement, we added the article to those 'awaiting assessment' and contacted the trial authors for clarification by phone or e-mail. We contacted the first author of the article but, if the first author was unavailable, we contacted another of the named authors. We investigated the methodological quality of the article starting with the method of randomisation. If the randomisation was adequate, we then investigated blinding, allocation concealment, etc. If the randomisation was inadequate, we recorded detailed methods of allocation and excluded the studies. If we could not contact any of the authors and we could not confirm that the studies were truly randomised controlled trials, we excluded them. We will continue to try to contact the authors for clarification.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">(2) Quality assessment of trials</HEADING>
<P>We assessed trials as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) and the methodological guidelines prepared by the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's statistician (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>We planned to address three areas:<BR/>(a) randomisation (method of sequence generation and concealment of allocation);<BR/>(b) blinding (blinding of participants, caregivers administering treatment and outcome assessors);<BR/>(c) loss to follow up (presence of dropouts and withdrawals, and the analysis of these).</P>
<P>We evaluated the following components for each study:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>randomisation (sequence generation) - adequate when the allocation sequence protected against biased allocation to the comparison groups;</LI>
<LI>randomisation (allocation concealment) - adequate when any sequence where the assignment could not be foreseen;</LI>
<LI>blinding - adequate when the participants, caregivers administering treatment and outcome assessor were unaware of the allocation;</LI>
<LI>loss to follow up - adequate when more than 80% of participants were followed up, then analysed in the groups to which they were originally randomised (intention-to-treat).</LI>
</UL>
<P>In addition, had there been trials identified for inclusion, we planned to assess the following:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the severity degree of disease in the trials (if the trials included different degree of severity, we would have performed subgroup analysis);</LI>
<LI>baseline comparison for general condition of participants in the trial, such as the gestational age, etc.</LI>

We will perform overall analysis to generally explore the efficacy and safety of CHM in pre-eclampsia. However, we will also perform subgroup analysis according to the different CHM and control interventions. We will allocate only studies with the same CHM and control intervention to a subgroup. We will include both dichotomous and continuous data. We will express dichotomous data as risk ratio, and continuous data as mean difference. We will test heterogeneity using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (with significance being set at P &lt; 0.1) and the I² statistic. We will treat an I² value above 50% as substantial heterogeneity. We will assess possible sources of heterogeneity by sensitivity and subgroup analysis as described below. We will test potential bias using the funnel plot or other corrective analytical methods depending on the number of clinical trials included in the systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<LI>contents of herbal medicine preparations used in the intervention group (for example, whether Chuan Xiong was used in the group);</LI>
<LI>the intervention method used in the experimental group (only CHM or integrated Western medication with CHM);</LI>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-06 19:04:06 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified many potentially relevant trials, but we found all to be non-randomised controlled trials. None of the trials reported adequate methodology in their original publications, and we have no way of verifying the information we obtained from personal communication with the authors. Some studies were conducted several years ago and may be influenced by recall bias.</P>
<P>Studies which stated 'randomisation' were either observational, case reports, case-control studies, before-after studies or quasi-randomised trials. Most authors thought 'casual allocation' was 'random allocation' and none of them knew what 'allocation concealment' was, even in the college-affiliated hospitals.</P>
<P>Of the 36 quasi-randomised controlled trials, allocation methods were based on admission sequence for 18 studies (even in one and odd in the other), admission date for two studies (even in one and odd in the other) and doctors' alternation for 16 studies. Only one study included women with pre-eclampsia according to present international criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2006</LINK>); others included PIH women according to previous criteria. Eighteen studies included all PIH women; one, women with mild PIH (<LINK REF="STD-Man-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Man 2004</LINK>); three, women with moderate PIH (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>); one, women with severe PIH (<LINK REF="STD-Shen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Shen 1984</LINK>); three, women with mild and moderate PIH (<LINK REF="STD-Guo-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kuang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>); seven, women with moderate and severe PIH; two, women with PIH and fetal growth restriction (<LINK REF="STD-Wei-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wei 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhong 2002</LINK>). All studies were conducted in east China. The baseline of participants was unclear in nine studies; age was unclear in five and gestational weeks in eleven. The number of participants ranged from 38 to 401. Thirteen studies did not report treatment durations, and reported durations were different for the other studies; they ranged from three days to 'up to delivery'. One CHM decoction (Zicaojueming decoction) was compared to the other (Tianmagouteng decoction) in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1998b</LINK>), and one CHM capsule was compared with no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-You-1999" TYPE="STUDY">You 1999</LINK>). The others were compared with Western medicines, including different CHM mixed prescriptions in eight studies, salvia miltiorrhiza in seven, ligustrazine in ten, salvia miltiorrhiza plus ligustrazine in one (<LINK REF="STD-Meng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meng 2003</LINK>), mailuoning injection in two (<LINK REF="STD-Luan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Luan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2001</LINK>), milkvetch in three (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Man-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Man 2004</LINK>), rhubarb in two (<LINK REF="STD-Su-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1999</LINK>), and angelica and paeonia powder in one (<LINK REF="STD-Guo-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 1986</LINK>). CHM combined with Western medicines were applied in the intervention group for most studies. Magnesium sulphate, nifedipine, diazepam were the most common Western medicines.</P>
<P>The authors' conclusions about TCM for PIH were mainly positive. We have listed characteristics of quasi-RCTs in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-11-02 18:34:38 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are currently no good quality randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of CHM for the treatment of pre-eclampsia. Although CHM is widely used throughout the world, there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to show whether it is an effective treatment for pre-eclampsia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-02 18:34:38 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Well-conducted randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness and the safety of CHM for women with pre-eclampsia are required. The trials should use true randomisation, not quasi-randomisation (for example, computer randomisation or random-number table) and have adequate allocation concealment (for example, by utilising sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes prepared remotely); only treatments which have a demonstrated effect for pre-eclampsia should be used as the control; participating researchers and outcome assessors should be blinded; and trials should be large enough to assess pre-eclampsia and serious maternal and infant long-term morbidities. The power calculation for sample size should be reported and the trial methodology should be reported in detail according to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In China, women eligible to be recruited to such trials should be those diagnosed with pre-eclampsia using the international definition. Trialists should be adequately trained in order to carry out and report such trials. Chinese doctors and researchers urgently need to be trained about clinical epidemiologic knowledge of research design, especially in rural areas. </P>
