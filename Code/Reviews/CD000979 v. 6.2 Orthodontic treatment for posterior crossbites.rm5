<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We conducted this review to assess the effects of different orthodontic treatments for correcting posterior crossbites.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Posterior crossbite is when the top back teeth bite down inside the bottom back teeth. It occurs when the top teeth or jaw are narrower than the bottom teeth and can happen on one or both sides of the mouth. The condition affects between 1% and 16% of children who only have their baby teeth. Most posterior crossbites (50% to 90%) remain even when the permanent teeth erupt. In a minority of children, the problem self corrects.</P>
<P>In order to obtain a more comfortable bite, the lower jaw shifts to one side into a position that allows more teeth to come into contact. However, this shifting of the lower jaw may lead to tooth grinding, and this may lead to other dental problems including the tooth surface being worn away, abnormal growth and development of the teeth and jaws, and jaw joint problems.</P>
<P>Therefore, we need to find safe and effective treatments to correct posterior crossbites or expand the top back teeth, or both. One way of doing this is using orthodontic treatments. This can be more effective in children because the two halves of the roof of the mouth have not fully joined yet, so the top back teeth can be expanded more easily. Orthodontic treatments can also be used to treat posterior crossbites in adults, but they are more likely to need surgical treatments, which are not the focus of this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review update of existing studies and the evidence is current up to 21 January 2014. It includes 15 studies published from 1984 to 2013. Nine of these studies compared fixed (always in the mouth) appliances either against different fixed appliances, or against the same fixed appliance but comparing different rates of expansion. Two studies compared a fixed appliance with a removable appliance. The remaining four studies evaluated other comparisons that were more difficult to classify.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There is some evidence to suggest that the quad-helix (fixed) appliance may be more successful than removable expansion plates at correcting posterior crossbites and expanding the top back teeth for children with a mixture of baby and adult teeth (aged eight to 10 years). The remaining evidence we found did not allow the conclusion that any one treatment is better than another.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence presented is mostly of low to very low quality due to the small amount of available studies and issues with the way in which they were conducted.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-05 14:14:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>A posterior crossbite occurs when the top back teeth bite inside the bottom back teeth. When it affects one side of the mouth, the lower jaw may have to move to one side to allow the back teeth to meet together. Several treatments have been recommended to correct this problem. Some treatments widen the upper teeth while others are directed at treating the cause of the posterior crossbite (e.g. breathing problems or sucking habits). Most treatments have been used at each stage of dental development. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-08-05 14:15:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 21 January 2014), and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 21 January 2014). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register and the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-08-05 14:15:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Two review authors, independently and in duplicate, screened the results of the electronic searches, and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We attempted to contact the first named authors of the included studies for missing data and for clarification. We used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to summarise dichotomous (event) data, and mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs to summarise continuous data. We performed meta-analyses using fixed-effect models (we would have used random-effects models if we had included four or more studies in a meta-analysis) when comparisons and outcomes were sufficiently similar.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-05 14:18:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>There is a very small body of low- to moderate-quality evidence to suggest that the quad-helix appliance may be more successful than removable expansion plates at correcting posterior crossbites and expanding the inter-molar width for children in the early mixed dentition (aged eight to 10 years). The remaining evidence we found was of very low quality and was insufficient to allow the conclusion that any one intervention is better than another for any of the outcomes in this review.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-05 14:21:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Posterior crossbite is the term used to describe the situation when the top back teeth bite inside the bottom back teeth. A posterior crossbite occurs when the top teeth or jaw are narrower than the bottom teeth and can happen on one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) sides of the mouth. The prevalence of posterior crossbites is between 1% and 16% of children who only have their baby teeth, and is likely to be higher in white populations compared with children of African or Asian ethnicity (<LINK REF="REF-Malandris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malandris 2004</LINK>). Most posterior crossbites (50% to 90%) persist when the permanent teeth erupt, though, in a minority of children, the malocclusion self corrects.</P>
<P>A functional posterior crossbite occurs when there is an interference between two or more teeth when an individual closes their jaws together. In order to obtain a more comfortable bite, the mandible (lower jaw) shifts to one side into a position that allows more teeth to come into contact. However, this displacement may increase the likelihood of the individual developing bruxism (tooth grinding), which may lead to other dental problems including the tooth surface being worn away (<LINK REF="REF-Malandris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malandris 2004</LINK>), abnormal growth and development of the teeth and jaws, and jaw joint problems.</P>
<P>While it is unlikely that young children with a posterior crossbite will experience any pain or have problems with chewing, there has been concern that the abnormal movement of the lower jaw associated with a crossbite could potentially have long-term effects on the growth and development of the teeth and jaws. The strain on the jaw muscles and joints due to the abnormal movement and position of the lower jaw may lead to skeletal facial asymmetries that can be corrected during adulthood only by means of a combination of orthodontics and maxillofacial surgery.</P>
<P>Some studies have reported a correlation between posterior crossbite with a shift on closure and temporomandibular joint problems in later life, for example pain, clicking or locking of the jaw joints. Such problems have many causes but studies of teenagers and adults have shown that some people with a crossbite may have an increased risk of developing jaw joint problems and show more signs and symptoms of these problems (<LINK REF="REF-Egermark-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egermark 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNamara-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNamara 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ninou-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninou 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Bryn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Bryn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pullinger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pullinger 1993</LINK>). However, some more recent studies have been less conclusive regarding an association between posterior crossbites and jaw problems (<LINK REF="REF-Gesch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gesch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iodice-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iodice 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thilander-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thilander 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thilander-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thilander 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>A posterior crossbite may develop or improve at any time from when the deciduous (baby) teeth come into the mouth to when the permanent (adult) teeth come through (<LINK REF="REF-Heikinheimo-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikinheimo 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kurol-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurol 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leighton-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leighton 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thilander-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thilander 1984</LINK>). It is unclear what causes posterior crossbites but they may be due to skeletal, soft tissue, dental or respiratory factors, or develop as the result of a habit (e.g. thumb sucking) or some pathology (<LINK REF="REF-Bresolin-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bresolin 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Modeer-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modeer 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogaard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogaard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Subtelny-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subtelny 1980</LINK>).<BR/>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-08-05 14:21:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>As described above, a posterior crossbite may self correct but, as self correction occurs in only a very small minority of cases, treatment of this malocclusion can be recommended. Treatment of a posterior crossbite usually involves expansion of the maxillary (upper jaw) arch, removal of any occlusal interferences and elimination of the functional displacement of the mandible.</P>
<P>Maxillary expansion treatment initiated during the early mixed dentition stage (children younger than eight years of age) may require the use of lower forces to achieve expansion of the upper arch because the mid-line bony suture has not yet fused. However, obtaining co-operation with treatment may be more difficult in younger children and treatment may be complicated by the loss of deciduous teeth. In older children (aged 12 years and above) who are in the early permanent dentition, greater forces may be required to achieve maxillary expansion. Maxillary expansion can be achieved using either fixed or removable appliances and expansion can be either rapid or slow. Expansion of the top jaw is termed 'rapid' when expansion takes place at a rate of 0.5 mm per day, and 'slow' when expansion takes place at a rate of 0.5 mm per week. Braces that can bring about this expansion are fixed to the back teeth by either metal bands around the individual teeth (banded rapid/slow maxillary expansion) or acrylic splints over several teeth (bonded rapid/slow maxillary expansion) joined by a wire framework attached to a screw in the mid-line that can be opened to expand the top jaw.</P>
<P>Removal of occlusal interferences involves grinding of teeth (usually deciduous teeth) to enable the jaws to bite together in a more normal position. The reported success rate of this approach varied widely between 27% and 64% (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindner-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindner 1989</LINK>). Alternatively, composite onlays can be placed to prevent the jaw from shifting when interferences exist.</P>
<P>Where functional displacement of the mandible is associated with reversible causes such as non-nutritive sucking habits (sucking on a dummy, thumb, finger(s), etc.), eliminating the causal behaviour is a desirable adjunct to orthodontic treatment.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-05 14:41:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Expansion of the maxillary arch can be achieved through use of either fixed or removable appliances (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for a description of appliances). These have expansion screws that are adjusted during treatment to increase the width of the maxillary arch. Expansion may be either rapid (one-quarter turn of the expansion screw one or two times per day, giving 0.5 mm expansion per day) over two to six weeks or slow (one-quarter turn twice per week, giving 0.5 mm expansion per week) over six to 12 weeks. Overexpansion may be appropriate to allow for some relapse after the appliance is removed. The use of maxillary expansion at the stage of the early mixed dentition may also have the benefit of reducing crowding of the permanent dentition.</P>
<P>Orthodontic appliances may also be used to correct the sideways displacement of the mandible, which may reduce the pressure on the temporomandibular joint.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-05 14:42:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>A crossbite is a common transverse feature seen in malocclusions in the posterior region of the dental arch. There is still debate about the optimum timing of orthodontic treatment, the use of either fixed or removable appliances, and the type of appliance that leads to the best outcomes for the person. This updated systematic review will summarise the evidence available from randomised controlled trials to inform treatment decision making. The Cochrane Oral Health Group recently carried out a prioritisation exercise for their portfolio of orthodontic reviews, and this review was ranked in the top 10 most important orthodontic reviews by an international panel of oral health professionals, the majority of whom were extremely experienced and internationally renowned orthodontists.</P>

<P>We did not consider the blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) as the interventions being compared in all studies were different and it would not have been possible to blind them as to which group they were allocated. Therefore, a risk of performance bias is possible in all of the included studies. However, it should be possible for outcome assessors to be blinded if measuring casts/models or radiographs or both, if the appliances had been removed. Therefore, we focused on assessing the risk of detection bias.</P>
<P>We completed a 'Risk of bias' table for each included study. For each of the above domains, we described what was reported to have happened in the study and this formed the rationale for our corresponding judgement of 'low risk' of bias, 'high risk' of bias or 'unclear risk' of bias for each domain.</P>
<P>We categorised overall risk of bias in any included study according to the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results) if all key domains were assessed as at low risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk of bias (plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results) if one or more key domains were assessed as at unclear risk of bias.</LI>

In 11 studies, the correction of crossbite is taken for granted because it was the end point of the treatment and the point at which activation of the appliances ceased (<LINK REF="STD-Asanza-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Asanza 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garib-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Garib 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilic-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kilic 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lagravere-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lagravere 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamparski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lamparski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lippold-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lippold 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martina-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martina 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNally-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McNally 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oliveira-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveira 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oshagh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Oshagh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramoglu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ramoglu 2010</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies described adequate methods of sequence generation and we judged them to be at low risk of bias for this domain: three used a table of random numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Lagravere-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lagravere 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oliveira-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveira 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oshagh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Oshagh 2012</LINK>); two used block randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Lippold-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lippold 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martina-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martina 2012</LINK>); one used a method of drawing lots (<LINK REF="STD-Godoy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Godoy 2011</LINK>); and the remaining study used a similar method involving opaque sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Petr_x00e9_n-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Petrén 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study used random number tables to allocate the first half of the participants and then allocated the remaining half to receive the alternative treatment to those in the initial allocation (<LINK REF="STD-McNally-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McNally 2005</LINK>). Therefore, only half the participants were truly randomly allocated and we judged this study to be at high risk of bias for this domain.</P>
<P>The remaining seven studies stated only that participants were randomly allocated and we were unable to obtain further details from the authors, so we judged these studies to be at unclear risk of bias for this domain (<LINK REF="STD-Asanza-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Asanza 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garib-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Garib 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilic-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kilic 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamparski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lamparski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mossaz_x002d_Joelson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mossaz-Joelson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramoglu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ramoglu 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thilander-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thilander 1984</LINK>).</P>

<P>The method of sequence generation carried out in one study, as described above, would allow for the prediction of the allocation of half of the participants, and therefore we judged this study to be at high risk of bias for this domain (<LINK REF="STD-McNally-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McNally 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The remaining 10 studies did not mention any method of allocation concealment, so we judged these studies to be at unclear risk of bias for this domain (<LINK REF="STD-Asanza-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Asanza 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garib-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Garib 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilic-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kilic 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lagravere-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lagravere 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamparski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lamparski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lippold-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lippold 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mossaz_x002d_Joelson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mossaz-Joelson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oshagh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Oshagh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramoglu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ramoglu 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thilander-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Thilander 1984</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We did not consider the blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) as the interventions being compared in all studies were different and it would not have been possible to blind them as to which group they were allocated. Therefore, a risk of performance bias is possible in all of the included studies.</P>
<P>However, it would have been possible for an independent blinded person to perform the clinical, model and radiographic assessments. Therefore, we have focused on whether the included studies minimised the possible effects of detection bias.</P>
<P>Three studies clearly stated that the measurement of outcomes was blinded, so we judged these studies to be at low risk of detection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Godoy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Godoy 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martina-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martina 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petr_x00e9_n-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Petrén 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>We judged eight studies to be at low risk of attrition bias as they either clearly described drop-outs (which were for similar reasons and in similar numbers per group), or the numbers of participants stated in the analyses were the same as those randomised, or an intention-to-treat analysis included all randomised participants (<LINK REF="STD-Asanza-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Asanza 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Godoy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Godoy 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilic-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kilic 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lippold-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lippold 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNally-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McNally 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oliveira-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveira 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petr_x00e9_n-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Petrén 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramoglu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ramoglu 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study clearly described the numbers and reasons for drop-out but the high attrition rate (48% per group) meant that, if the missing participants had higher mean scores in one group than the other, as the attrition rate increased, so would over/understatement of the mean difference (<LINK REF="STD-Martina-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martina 2012</LINK>).

<P>We included two studies, both at low risk of bias, analysing 96 participants, in this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Godoy-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Godoy 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petr_x00e9_n-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Petrén 2008</LINK>). The two studies included children in the early mixed dentition (aged eight to 10 years). For the outcome crossbite correction, the pooled risk ratio (RR) suggests that fixed quad-helix appliances may be 20% more likely to correct crossbites than removable expansion plates (RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.37) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The 95% CI indicates that the true effect estimate lies somewhere between a 4% and 37% better correction rate for quad-helix appliances. However, the sample size was small and there was substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%), so this result should be interpreted with caution, and the results may not be the same in the permanent dentition.</P>
<P>For the outcome molar expansion, the pooled MD suggests that quad-helix appliances can achieve 1.15 mm more expansion than expansion plates (MD 1.15 mm; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.90) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). The 95% CI indicates that the true effect estimate lies somewhere between 0.4 mm and 1.9 mm in favour of quad-helix appliances. While there was no heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%), the result should be interpreted with caution as the sample size was small and the follow-up times differed between the studies.</P>
<P>For the outcome canine expansion, the pooled MD was 0.19 mm (95% CI -0.47 to 0.85) in favour of quad-helix appliances, but the difference was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). Due to considerable heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 91%), small sample size and different follow-up times, the result should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:08:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>The objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of different orthodontic treatments for correcting posterior crossbites. We included 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met the inclusion criteria for this review. We assessed the body of evidence for each comparison and outcome using GRADE, which takes into account the risk of bias of the included studies, the directness of the evidence, the inconsistency of the results, the precision of the estimates and the risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2004</LINK>). The body of evidence for all comparisons and outcomes in this review was very small.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fixed appliance with mid-palatal expansion</HEADING>
<P>The body of evidence for all comparisons and outcomes in this group was rated as very low quality (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). In all cases, the evidence was insufficient to determine a difference between any one type of appliance and another for any outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fixed versus removable appliance</HEADING>
<P>We found low-quality evidence to suggest that crossbite correction is more successful when using a fixed quad-helix appliance than when using a removable expansion plate for slow maxillary expansion (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). For the same comparison, moderate-quality evidence suggested that molar expansion is greater for fixed quad-helix appliances, and further low-quality evidence was insufficient to determine a difference in canine expansion. It should be noted that the two studies included children in the early mixed dentition (aged eight to 10 years) and the results may not be the same for people in the permanent dentition. There was also very low quality evidence that was insufficient to determine a difference in stability of crossbite correction between fixed quad-helix appliances and removable expansion plates. Further very low quality evidence suggested that fixed quad-helix appliances and removable expansion plates are superior to composite onlays for crossbite correction, molar expansion and canine expansion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Others interventions</HEADING>
<P>We found very low quality evidence to suggest that both tooth grinding, with or without an expansion plate and fixed bonded Hyrax followed by U-bow activator are superior to no treatment for the outcomes crossbite correction and molar/canine correction respectively (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). We also found very low quality evidence that was insufficient to determine a difference in molar or canine expansion between quad-helix plus multi-bracket and expansion arch plus multi-bracket. Finally, there was no evidence regarding the comparison of removable appliances with either spring-loaded or conventional screws.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:08:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>The studies identified in this review are insufficient to address the question of what is the best treatment for posterior crossbites. Although we were able to include 15 studies, there were many different comparisons of appliances or other treatments and, therefore, there was minimal pooling of data. This is unfortunate as one of the advantages of a systematic review is the ability to pool multiple studies in order to increase the power to detect a difference confidently, and thus to inform clinical practice better. Furthermore, there were very limited data available for the outcome stability of crossbite correction, and no studies assessed signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction/respiratory disease or quality of life. However, this was perhaps because all the studies included only children. This highlights another shortcoming in the overall completeness of the evidence, which is that there is no evidence on orthodontic treatments for adults with posterior crossbites. The lack of evidence regarding adults in this review is probably because the majority of studies on adults with a posterior crossbite compare orthodontic treatments with orthodontic-surgical interventions, but we excluded surgical treatments from this review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:09:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>The body of evidence identified does not allow for any robust conclusions to be made regarding the objective of this review. The sample sizes were consistently small (as low as eight participants), and this fact, combined with the lack of pooling of data in meta-analyses, meant that the power to detect statistically and clinically significant differences, with confidence, was limited. Another problem was inconsistency as three of the four meta-analyses displayed statistically significant heterogeneity. While there were two low risk of bias studies that we were able to pool, the results cannot be relied upon due to the problems already mentioned. The remaining studies were either at high risk of bias (seven studies) or the risk of bias was unclear (six studies). Most of the comparisons included in the review were assessed by very small single studies, which do not allow any conclusions to be drawn as to the effects of the interventions studied.<BR/>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-04-04 11:28:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We made every attempt to limit bias in the review process by ensuring a comprehensive search for potentially eligible studies. The authors' independent assessments of study eligibility and subsequent data extraction and risk of bias assessment minimised the potential for additional bias beyond that detailed in the 'Risk of bias' tables in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> section. The incompleteness of some of the reports and our inability to obtain clarification of certain trial details or to resolve ambiguities in the reports may have contributed to some bias in their assessment, but where these conditions applied this was explicitly stated in the text of our review. Finally, we attempted to minimise bias further by changing our inclusion criteria to only include RCTs which, when performed to a high standard, should be less biased than other study designs.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-07-03 16:51:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Another systematic review of maxillary expansion arches for treating crossbites included studies published from 1999 to 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Zuccati-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuccati 2013</LINK>). The authors of the review assessed the studies using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. In similarity with our review, they argued that there was substantial evidence of bias, which reduced the quality of the evidence; the randomisation process was poorly described and loss to follow-up was unclear in many of the included studies. Their review also called for future trials to be carefully planned and reported using universal guidelines. </P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:09:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:09:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>There is a very small body of low- to moderate-quality evidence to suggest that fixed quad-helix appliances may be more successful than removable expansion plates at correcting posterior crossbites and expanding the inter-molar width in children with early mixed dentition (aged eight to 10 years). The remaining evidence that we found was of very low quality and was insufficient to allow the conclusion that any one intervention is better than another for any of the outcomes in this review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-05 15:09:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>More randomised controlled trials are required to address the question of what is the best treatment for posterior crossbites in children, adolescents and adults. The studies should be large enough to detect a difference, if one exists, and should assess appropriate outcomes. We believe that 'correction of crossbite' needs to be the primary outcome for all studies addressing this research question. In studies where all the crossbites were corrected (as with most studies in this review), 'time to correction' and 'pain' would be of increased importance as outcomes.</P>
<P>High-quality work should be carried out to develop core outcome sets for orthodontics/areas of orthodontics. Such work should be carried out in association with the COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) Initiative (<A HREF="http://www.comet-initiative.org">www.comet-initiative.org</A>), using robust methodology suggested by those working with the COMET Initiative so far (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2012</LINK>). These core outcome sets should subsequently be the minimum set of outcomes that are measured in all clinical trials and systematic reviews (including this Cochrane review).</P>
<P>Future randomised controlled trials must be well designed, well conducted and adequately delivered with subsequent reporting, including high-quality descriptions of all aspects of methodology. Reporting should conform to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>), which will enable appraisal and interpretation of results, and accurate judgements to be made about the risk of bias and the overall quality of the evidence. Although it is uncertain whether reported quality mirrors actual study conduct, it is noteworthy that studies with unclear methodology have been shown to produce biased estimates of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2014-08-05 16:12:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fixed appliances (with mid-palatal screw)</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Bonded (acrylic splint)</B>
<BR/>An alternative to the banded design, this fixed expander uses posterior acrylic coverage that is bonded directly to the teeth. The posterior bite blocks free up the occlusion by removing cuspal interferences.</P>
<P>
<B>Bone-anchored expander</B>
<BR/>The bone-anchored expander is composed of 2 custom-milled stainless steel onplants, 2 miniscrews and an expansion screw. The expansion screw placed in palatal mid-line is anchored directly to the palatal surfaces of the maxilla (top jaw) with either bioglass-coated aluminium oxide implants or osteosynthesis plates.</P>
<P>
<B>Expansion arch</B>
<BR/>The expansion arch is made from 1.135 mm round stainless steel wire bent into the shape of a dental arch and inserted into the extra-oral traction tubes on the first molar bands.</P>
<P>
<B>Haas</B>
<BR/>A fixed maxillary expander that uses acrylic pads and heavy lingual wires to apply pressure to both the teeth and the palatal tissue during expansion. The lingual wires are soldered to bands on the first bicuspids and the first molars and extend into the palate where they are embedded in the acrylic pads.</P>
<P>
<B>Hyrax</B>
<BR/>A fixed metal expander soldered to bands on the first molars (2 points) or first molars and first bicuspids (4 points) with an 0.036-mm lingual wire connecting the bands.</P>
<P>
<B>Minne expander</B>
<BR/>This is a tooth-borne appliance without any acrylic palatal covering. This design makes use of a spring loaded screw called a Minne expander. The first premolars and molars are banded. Metal flanges are soldered onto the bands on the buccal and lingual sides. The expander consists of a coil spring having a nut that can compress the spring. This coil spring is made to extend between the lingual metal flanges that have been soldered. The expander is activated by closing the nut so that the spring is compressed.</P>
<P>
<B>Quad helix</B>
<BR/>This fixed metal expander (also available as a fixed/removable) is capable of applying forces in numerous directions depending upon how it is activated. The 4 helical loops (2 in the first bicuspid region and 2 in the second molar region) can be activated in unison or individually to achieve the desired results. The appliance is soldered to bands on the first molars and lingual arms run from the bands forwards to the cuspids or first bicuspids as desired.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Removable appliances</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Upper removable appliance</B>
<BR/>The upper removable appliance is an expansion plate made of acrylic, with an expansion screw and steel clasps on the first deciduous and permanent molars.</P>
