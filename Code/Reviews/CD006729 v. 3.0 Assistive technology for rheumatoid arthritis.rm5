<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-11 10:30:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of assistive technology in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, only one trial met the inclusion criteria for the review. The study deals with assistive technology used to administer eye drops. This is not a commonly used device.</P>
<P>Assistive technology devices are intended to make life with rheumatoid arthritis easier. It is defined as any equipment used to improve or maintain function in persons with disabilities. Assistive technology is one of the most frequent interventions used for persons with rheumatoid arthritis, besides medications and surgery.</P>
<P>There is very limited evidence for the effect of assistive technology for adults with rheumatoid arthritis. There is an urgent need for high-quality research investigating commonly used devices.</P>
<P>
<B>The review shows that in people with rheumatoid arthritis:</B>
</P>
<P>-<B> </B>An eye drop device may improve the ability to squeeze out drops, aim drops, and control the number of drops.<BR/>- An eye drop device may prevent side effects caused by the eye drop bottle touching the eye itself.</P>
<P>
<B>What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is an eye drop device?</B>
</P>
<P>When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints, making them inflamed.  Inflammation makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful and may lead to loss of function and disability. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis at present, so the treatments focus on reducing inflammation, relieving pain and stiffness, and improving function in daily life.</P>
<P>An eye drop device is an assistive technology that makes it easier to give yourself eye drops by making the bottle easier to hold, easier to squeeze and to get the drops right into your eye.</P>
<P>
<B>Best estimate of what happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis who use an eye drop device:</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ability to squeeze out drops</B>
</P>
<P>- 27 people out of 100 were able to squeeze out drops more easily from an eye drop device than when using a regular eye drop bottle. (27% absolute improvement)</P>
<P>- 35 people out of 100 had difficulty squeezing out drops from an eye drop device.</P>
<P>- 62 people out of 100 had difficulty squeezing out drops from a regular eye drop bottle.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Ability to aim drops<BR/>
</B>- 30 people out of 100 were able to aim drops more easily from an eye drop device than when using a regular eye drop bottle.  (30% absolute improvement)</P>
<P>- 46 people out of 100 had difficulty aiming drops from an eye drop device.</P>
<P>- 76 people out of 100 had difficulty aiming drops from a regular eye drop bottle.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Ability to control the number of drops<BR/>
</B>- 33 people out of 100 were able to control the number of drops more easily from an eye drop device than when using a regular eye drop bottle.  (33% absolute improvement)</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-08 00:29:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following databases: CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, ISI Web of Science, PEDro, and OTseeker (to October 2008). In addition, we scanned reference lists, sought grey literature, and had personally communicated with authors. We updated the literature searches in January 2009.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-01-23 06:03:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Included study designs were randomised controlled trials, clinical controlled trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series where the effectiveness of assistive technology was evaluated. In addition, comparative observational studies were included if addressing adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-01-23 06:21:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed study quality. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-08 00:37:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one randomised controlled trial with 29 participants was included. The study compared the use of an eye drop device to a standard bottle in people with rheumatoid arthritis suffering from persistent dry eyes. The study was considered to have low quality of evidence. The proportions with observed difficulties when using the device to squeeze out drops and getting the drops in the eyes were 10% and 14%, respectively. This compared to 52% and 52% when using the standard bottle (P = 0.001; P = 0.003, respectively). The proportions of participants reporting difficulties with squeezing the bottle, controlling the number of drops, and aiming the drops when using the device were 40%, 44%, and 46% respectively, while using the standard bottle the proportions with difficulties were 72%, 84%, and 76% (P = 0.001; P = 0.003; P = 0.031, respectively).</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-08 06:44:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-08 00:58:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease, affecting 0.5% to 1% of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Uhlig-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uhlig 2005</LINK>). It occurs twice as often in women as in men and has an onset age mainly between 45 and 65 years. The disease is chronic and systemic, with an unknown aetiology. It is characterised by the presence of synovial inflammation, limited range of motion, and destruction of bone and cartilage. It can affect almost all joints causing pain, stiffness, fatigue and impaired physical function, including limited ability to perform daily activities and to participate in society (<LINK REF="REF-Backman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Backman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fex-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fex 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nordenski_x00f6_ld-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordenskiöld 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wikstr_x00f6_m-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wikström 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Provision of assistive technology is one of the most frequent non-pharmacological, non-surgical interventions for persons with rheumatoid arthritis; and one of the most frequent self-help strategies reported by this group of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hammond-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammond 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veitiene-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veitiene 2005</LINK>). Devices are prescribed and used as a means to reduce pain and compensate for impairment and environmental demands. The purpose of assistive technology is to enable individuals to stay independent and maintain engagement in meaningful activities (<LINK REF="REF-Hammond-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammond 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Kuyk_x002d_Minis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Kuyk-Minis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 2000</LINK>). Probably few other interventions sufficiently substitute for well-designed and efficient assistive technology.</P>
<P>According to the classification of assistive products for persons with disability (<A HREF="https://ekstern.hib.no/exchange/Hanne.Tuntland/Kladd/FW:%20Response%20from%20the%20editors.EML/1_multipart/ISO%209999:2007">ISO 9999:2007</A>), assistive technology includes 11 categories of products. The categories of devices most frequently used by people with rheumatoid arthritis are aids for personal care and protection (such as aids for dressing and personal hygiene), aids for personal mobility (such as wheelchairs, walking chair and crutches), aids for housekeeping (for instance knives and peelers with ergonomic handles for use in food preparation), furnishings and adaptations to homes and other premises (such as shower chairs and raised toilet seats), and aids for handling products and goods (such as reach extenders and aids for opening containers) (<LINK REF="STD-Nordenskiold-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nordenskiold 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thyberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thyberg 2004</LINK>). Some of these devices are designed for the general population, such as electric toothbrushes and can openers, while others are developed to meet the needs of people with functional limitations or disabilities, such as wheelchairs or chairs with electrical seat lift mechanisms (<LINK REF="STD-Galumbeck-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Galumbeck 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Different terms to describe assistive technology are used interchangeably, such as aid, technical aid, assistive device, self-help device, adaptive device, assistive technology device, assistive technology, and adaptive equipment (<LINK REF="REF-L_x00f6_fquist-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Löfquist 2005</LINK>). In this review, we mainly use the term assistive technology, defined as "any item, piece or equipment, or product system whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified or customised, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities" (<LINK REF="REF-Ass.-Tech.-Act-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ass. Tech. Act 2004</LINK>). However, in order to improve readability we also use the terms aid, device, and assistive device.</P>
<P>The use of assistive technology has been found to be associated with more severe disease, a longer disease duration, and loss of grip strength and functional ability (<LINK REF="REF-Shipham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shipham 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thyberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thyberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Heide-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Heide 1993</LINK>). In addition, the use of assistive technology is influenced by differences in healthcare systems and the levels of access people with rheumatoid arthritis have to assistive technology (<LINK REF="REF-Veehof-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veehof 2006</LINK>). Studies indicate that two thirds of all persons with arthritis use assistive devices on a daily basis (<LINK REF="REF-Hammond-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammond 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1992</LINK>). In a study of people with early rheumatoid arthritis, men used an average of three devices, while women used an average of five; eating and drinking were the most frequently reported activities where the use of devices had a beneficial effect (<LINK REF="STD-Thyberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thyberg 2004</LINK>). In another study, results showed that people with severe rheumatoid arthritis use an average of 10 devices (<LINK REF="REF-Mann-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 1995</LINK>). In a Swedish study describing occupational therapy during the first 10 years of rheumatoid arthritis, provision of assistive technology was the most frequent intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Malcus_x002d_Johnson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malcus-Johnson 2005</LINK>). It was also one of the interventions most appreciated by the participants. However, the overall usage of assistive technology on a regular basis varies considerably. Three months after hip replacement, 41% of all devices were still in use (<LINK REF="REF-Haworth-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haworth 1983</LINK>) and up to 91% of the provided devices were still being used approximately one year after completing a joint protection education program (<LINK REF="STD-Nordenskiold-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nordenskiold 1994</LINK>). Reasons people give for abandoning assistive technology are that they have not been involved in the process of provision, that they have not been given sufficient instruction, that their functional ability changes, that the devices do not have the intended effect, and a lack of follow up during and after provision (<LINK REF="REF-Dijcks-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dijcks 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Philips-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scherer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scherer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wieland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wieland 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wressle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wressle 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general, there is limited research evaluating the effectiveness of assistive technology (<LINK REF="REF-McMillen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMillen 2002</LINK>). One of the reasons for this is probably the complex nature of assistive technology research. So far, two reviews concerning assistive technology in people with arthritis have been published. One is a literature review on the use of assistive technology in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1992</LINK>). However, we think that a review only including participants with rheumatoid arthritis would foster better understanding of the benefits and adverse effects of assistive technology. The other is a systematic review of occupational therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Steultjens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steultjens 2004</LINK>), in which assistive devices were one of six interventions evaluated. Provision of assistive devices may be executed by a variety of health professionals and purchased by the people with rheumatoid arthritis themselves. Thus, it should be classified and studied as a specific intervention rather than a professional strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Vliet-Vlieland-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vliet Vlieland 2002</LINK>). Hence, the rational for this review is first that it only considers the rheumatoid arthritis population and second that it considers the intervention of interest regardless of profession.</P>

<P>We performed an initial literature search in August 2007. From this search only one study met the inclusion criteria. We therefore decided to broaden the search strategy in order to detect more studies. Within the selected classes of assistive technology, the different types of devices are numerous. In addition, there are several synonyms for every type of device. We used search terms relevant to each included class of assistive device. In addition, we chose search terms for different types of devices. Device search terms were based on identified studies where specific devices for rheumatoid arthritis were included and described. Selection of search terms was also based on the authors' clinical experiences with what kinds of devices people with rheumatoid arthritis use. Finally, we added all the synonyms we could find for the term assistive technology to the search strategy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>The aim of the included study (<LINK REF="STD-Averns-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Averns 1999</LINK>) was to assess the ability to instill artificial tears using an eye drop dispenser device (Opticare) compared to a standard bottle. The study deals with aids for medical treatment (ISO class 04). The sample consisted of 29 participants suffering from persistent dry eyes due to rheumatoid arthritis. The intervention was the use of an eye drop delivery device, which was a specially designed eye drop dispenser. The device assisted in squeezing the bottle and allowed the person to position the dropper directly over the eye without touching the eye itself. The device thereby addresses some of the problems people with arthritis have in instilling artificial tears, due to reduced upper limb functioning. The comparison was with the use of the same eye drop bottle but without the specially designed device. The trial was considered to be an RCT with one cross over. The participants were randomised into either using the device (intervention) in week one and the standard bottle (comparator) in week two, or vice versa.</P>
<P>The outcomes were the ability to use the medication correctly and safely, in the study measured as observer rated and participant reported ability to squeeze out eye drops, aim drops and control the number of drops, when using an assistive device compared to using a standard bottle. This is considered as functional ability in ADL, one of the primary outcomes of interest in this review. Likewise, the participants reported adverse effects as the number of times when the eye itself was touched with the bottle. Adverse effects are also a primary outcome of interest in this review. Further, participants reported on device usability, which is a secondary outcome of interest in this review. Additional information about the trial is included in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table.</P>

<P>The concealment of allocation was considered unclear in the included study (<LINK REF="STD-Averns-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Averns 1999)</LINK> as there was no information in the article regarding method of randomisation or concealment of allocation. When asked to clarify this, the first author described the method of randomisation as using random numbers on a calculator. This is considered to be an adequate sequence generation method. No information was given about who assigned the participants to their groups and whether the allocation was concealed. Selection bias therefore cannot be excluded.</P>
<P>The assessor was aware of the assigned treatment when collecting outcome measures. Neither the participants nor the personnel were blinded for the intervention. Possible interventions other than the intervention of interest were controlled for, as participants in both groups were the same and the study period was rather short. Thirty participants were recruited, however one participant failed to attend for the treatment. Among the 29 participants followed, there were four losses to follow up for some of the outcome assessments, which is less than 20% of the sample. We therefore considered the criterion of incomplete outcome data to be met. The study had selective outcome reporting as only statistically significant results were reported in the tables. Furthermore, the standard of reporting was not optimal. When it comes to 'other potential sources of bias', all participants were analysed according to the group they were randomised into. We therefore considered the study to be apparently free of other sources of bias.</P>
<P>Since the study design can be considered as an RCT which we assessed to have moderate limitations (no blinding, selective reporting, and unclear concealment of allocation), we graded the quality of evidence from this study as 'low'.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial with a total of 29 participants that compared assistive technology with a control group was included in this review. The results show that a dispenser device may improve application of eye drops and prevent adverse effects in terms of touching the eye with the bottle tip. However, we assessed the trial as an RCT with moderate limitations and consequently graded the quality of evidence as low.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Limited amount of research</HEADING>
<P>Although we conducted an extensive literature search, we were only able to identify 13 studies, of which we excluded 12. In general, there is a lack of studies that evaluate the effect of assistive technology (<LINK REF="REF-McMillen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMillen 2002</LINK>). The paucity of primary research has implications for secondary research, as there are few studies to include in systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ilott-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ilott 2006</LINK>). As assistive technology is a widespread multidisciplinary intervention, we had hoped to find more studies. Moreover, as so many devices are available, the potential research material is enormous. Hence, the research gap on the effectiveness of assistive technology is surprising given the costs and dissemination of these devices. One reason for this gap is probably the self-evident benefit of many devices. Especially when it comes to low cost and high usage devices, research is not demanded (<LINK REF="REF-Fuhrer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuhrer 2001</LINK>). However, when it comes to technologically complex and highly expensive devices, such as electrical wheelchairs and computerised environmental control systems, the need for effectiveness research is more evident.</P>
<P>The complex nature of assistive technology makes trials of effectiveness challenging (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jonge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jonge 2007</LINK>). First, the number of devices available is almost endless and the physical designs vary a lot within each type of device. Second, assistive technology is often provided as one element in a complex intervention and it is, therefore, difficult to ascertain to which degree assistive technology is responsible for the effect. Third, the effectiveness of such technology is determined by the interaction between the person using the device(s), the assistive technology, and the context and environment in which the device is used (<LINK REF="REF-Lenker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenker 2005</LINK>). Fourth, the potential outcomes are many, ranging from improving different aspects of functional ability, preventing adverse effects, and diminishing care giver burden to time and energy use in completing tasks. Fifth, research conclusions on effects can seldom be generalised to other devices than those under investigation. Sixth, giving the control group no device, an inferior device, or putting them on a waiting list has ethical implications. All these dimensions constitute the complex nature of assistive technology research.</P>
<P>In this review, the inclusion criteria regarding study design were consistent with those recommended by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group (<LINK REF="REF-Maxwell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maxwell 2006</LINK>), which recommends study designs such as randomised controlled trials (RCT), clinical controlled trials (CCT), controlled before and after studies (CBA), interrupted time series (ITS), and observational studies if they address adverse effects. The most frequent reason for excluding relevant studies was the failure to meet this trial design criterion, as the excluded studies had designs such as cross-sectional (four studies), single-subject (four studies), uncontrolled (two studies), and a comparative observational study not addressing adverse effects (one study). To conclude, in addition to the general lack of research the few existing studies are of relatively low quality, a fact that has been addressed in previous literature (<LINK REF="REF-Ivanoff-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ivanoff 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lovarini-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lovarini 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steultjens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steultjens 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>While studies regarding the effectiveness of assistive technology in general are limited, the research concerning people with rheumatoid arthritis in particular is even scarcer. However, people with rheumatoid arthritis are probably some of the most frequent users of assistive technology (<LINK REF="REF-Veehof-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veehof 2006</LINK>). While there are numerous studies documenting usage of assistive devices among people with rheumatic conditions, there are remarkably few studies addressing the effectiveness of assistive devices.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Methodological issues</HEADING>
<P>One RCT was excluded from this review due to a mixed patient population (<LINK REF="STD-Hoenig-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoenig 2007</LINK>) and a lack of separate analysis for the participants with rheumatoid arthritis. Similarly, we detected some studies concerning usage of assistive technology in mixed populations (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veehof-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veehof 2006</LINK>). Including participants with different rheumatic diseases may be effective in increasing the sample size and thereby the statistical power in a study. A consequence is, however, that the sample will be more heterogeneous and less likely to be included in a systematic review.</P>
<P>The large diversity of assistive devices and the problems with generalisation from one type of device to another might contribute to the impression that research in this area is complicated, as described earlier. However, pain and functioning are recognised as the most important study outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Coenen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coenen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stucki-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stucki 2004</LINK>). Thus, the number of relevant outcomes is much smaller than the number of devices (<LINK REF="REF-Jeffrey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeffrey 2005</LINK>). In future studies, care should be taken to ensure a close correspondence between the purpose of using a device and the outcome measure(s) used to test the effect of the device. To ensure such consistency, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>) may be used to classify the aspect of functioning the device is meant to improve. Thereafter, measures capturing the same aspect(s) of functioning should be used to measure the effect. Already many of the measures used within rheumatology have been analysed and linked to the ICF (<LINK REF="REF-Cieza-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cieza 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamm-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 2004</LINK>), and this work continues.</P>
<P>In some outcome measures, the use of devices has implications for the questions or scoring. One example is the Evaluation of Daily Activities Questionnaire (EDAQ) (<LINK REF="STD-Nordenskiold-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nordenskiold 1998</LINK>) where the participants rate performance of each of the activities twice, once according to how they perform the activities without assistive devices, and thereafter according to how they perform the activities with assistive devices or altered working methods, or both. Another example is the Health Assessment Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Fries-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fries 1980</LINK>) where the participants' reporting of using devices when performing activities have implications for the calculation of the sum score, as the use of a device most often will result in a lower (or poorer) score. While the scoring procedure in the first example introduces some methodological problems concerning the reliability of the assessment, the second example illustrates that the use of assistive technology automatically devalues the performance of that activity, and consequently the final sum score. In future studies, therefore, one should use instruments where performance of activities is rated according to current performance and where the use of any device is understood as an integrated part of that performance.</P>
<P>To date, the instruments used in studies on assistive devices have been performance tests or questionnaires. The strength of these measures is that they allow for comparisons between groups of participants. However, the ability to perform a specific, valued activity may be more important to a person than his or her ability to perform a specified task item in a test situation or on a questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Kloppenburg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kloppenburg 2007</LINK>).The patient specific measures are developed to capture the activities and issues that are important to each participant (<LINK REF="REF-Jolles-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jolles 2005</LINK>). Consequently, a patient specific instrument should be included as a supplement to other health measures in studies of the effects of assistive technology. Moreover, it is vital that all of the instruments used have been tested for psychometric properties. New health status measures are rapidly being developed and existing ones are being revised. Any recommendations for specific instruments are, therefore, likely to be rapidly outdated. Stucki and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Stucki-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stucki 2007</LINK>) suggest instead that authors first define what should be measured and then recommend how to measure it, and which instrument to use.</P>
<P>This review documents the limited number of studies on the effectiveness of assistive technology in rheumatoid arthritis. No properly conducted RCTs were identified. A reasonable question to ask is whether RCTs are unethical or impractical to conduct within this field. An RCT can be unethical under certain conditions. An example of this is in a population of people with a complete spinal cord injury who use a wheelchair. In that case, there is no comparable control intervention to the wheelchair. Giving the control group another assistive device (for instance a walking device) or no device would be unethical. Furthermore, in this example the effect of the assistive device in improving functioning by increasing mobility is so obvious that it is unnecessary to test it. Some interventions have such a dramatic effect that biases can be excluded without randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 2007</LINK>). Therefore, the doubt regarding the effectiveness of a particular intervention should be compelling for an RCT to be conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Clegg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clegg 1997</LINK>). The rational for conducting an RCT under the present circumstances, in this population, might be that rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease which for most people is progressive. The progression is however usually slow. The need of an assistive device is seldom acute and, except for the use of devices following surgery, most people will be able to manage without the device for a short period. Rheumatoid arthritis is also a fluctuating condition. For this reason, RCTs are the best design to distinguish the effects of the device(s) from the changes in function caused by improvements or deterioration of the disease itself.</P>
<P>When designing a study, one should consider carefully which device(s) to investigate. When it comes to large assistive devices we recommend testing the effect of one device at a time. An example of such a study is an RCT where the effect of motorised scooters was tested in a sample of ambulatory people with arthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Hoenig-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoenig 2007</LINK>). When it comes to simple, low-cost devices, it seems a waste of time and resources to organise a full scale randomised controlled trial to demonstrate the effect (<LINK REF="REF-Fuhrer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuhrer 2001</LINK>). However, for testing minor assistive devices, the devices can be handled as a group if they are homogenous regarding potential outcomes. In this case emphasis should be put on devices that are common and widely used by persons with rheumatoid arthritis, such as aids for personal mobility, housekeeping, and personal care. In addition, very expensive and technologically complex devices could be explored on a cost-benefit basis. In summary, if the costs are moderate or high, and effects are uncertain or moderate, randomised controlled trials are worth the effort.</P>
<P>Blinding of participants and healthcare providers prevents performance bias. Although these ideals of the RCT design are impossible to meet when undertaking research on rehabilitation interventions such as assistive technology, the outcome assessors should be blinded to the group allocation of the study participants (<LINK REF="REF-Levack-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levack 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>N-of-1 RCT applies the principles of rigorous clinical trial methodology to overcome problems when determining the best treatment for an individual patient. In this design, each participant is randomised to receive the intervention or comparison at different times. Thus, the multiple cross overs will help the patient and provider to decide on which therapy is the best (<LINK REF="REF-Straus-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straus 2005</LINK>). A set of criteria should be met before an n-of-1 RCT is attempted (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1990</LINK>). There should be doubt whether an intervention has effect. The condition in question should be chronic and relatively stable. Furthermore the intervention, if effective, should be long term and the participants should be eager to collaborate. In addition, the intervention should have a rapid onset and termination. The reason we address this issue is that the included study (<LINK REF="STD-Averns-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Averns 1999</LINK>) had a similar study design. However, we consider only one cross over to be far too few to be classified as an n-of-1 RCT. When it comes to assistive technology, the effect lasts only during the intervention, so there is no risk of carry over. An n-of-1 RCT might therefore be a well-suited design for testing the effects of assistive technology for persons with rheumatoid arthritis. Another advantage with this design is that the participants are their own control, due to the cross overs, and fewer participants are needed to ensure satisfactory statistical power. Therefore, the n-of-1 RCT can be a good alternative when an RCT is difficult to perform due to ethical or practical circumstances. However, the first choice of study design when conducting studies on effectiveness should be a conventional RCT.</P>

<P>In general, there is insufficient evidence of the effect of assistive technology for adults with rheumatoid arthritis. A lack of high quality research prevents us from drawing further conclusions when it comes to implications for practice.</P>
<P>There is low quality evidence indicating that the use of a device to squeeze out eye drops may improve function and prevent adverse effects. In addition, the Opticare device is not a commonly used assistive device. In fact, only a proportion of the rheumatoid arthritis population might use this device, namely those with Sjögrens syndrome.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-08 06:44:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In future research the intervention can be, with a few exceptions, any class of assistive device used in work, leisure, school, or self-care activities. However, research should concentrate on devices of high usage with moderate or high costs, where the effect is uncertain or moderate. The comparison might be with an alternative intervention (for instance patient education), a dissimilar assistive device (for instance comparing different types of mobility devices), or no assistive devices (such as participants on a waiting list). Ethical considerations are important when selecting the comparative intervention.<BR/>
</P>
<P>There is a need for high quality research addressing the effectiveness of assistive technology for people with rheumatoid arthritis. We encourage more researchers to contribute to the generation of a better evidence base in this field. A well-performed RCT reduces the risk of bias significantly. An n-of-1 RCT might be a good substitute for a conventional RCT within this field. In future research reporting of an RCT should be conducted according to guidelines set out in the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>). To improve the methodological quality proper allocation of concealment should be performed. Likewise, procedures to blind the outcome assessor should be performed to prevent bias. Finally, the participant population should be homogeneous and care should be taken to ensure a close correspondence between the purpose of using a device and the outcome measure(s) used to test the effect of the device.</P>

<P>The first literature searches performed in August 2007 detected only one included study. For this reason, the search strategy was extensively broadened and additional study designs such as controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series were included in the final literature searches.</P>
<P>Available grey literature databases have changed from the time of writing the protocol to the time when the final literature searches were performed.</P>
<P>Due to new methodological guidelines for Cochrane reviews, the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group's grading of evidence system was replaced by the GRADE approach. Likewise, the 'Risk of bias' and 'Summary of findings' tables have been added to meet the new guidelines.</P>

<P>The study was a part of a larger study, that took place in the United Kingdom, in which the participants were attending an outpatients' follow up. Of the 340 participants included in the large study, 85 participants had symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome and 30 of these were included in an eye drop delivery study. Among the 29 participants followed, there were four losses to follow up for some of the outcome assessments.</P>
<P>In the large sample of 340 participants: median age was 50 years (range 22-93), median disease duration 12 years, age at onset of rheumatoid arthritis 45 years (range 6-86), and gender distribution 76% females and 24% males. The mean value of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) was 1.87 (range 0.12-2.75). In the small sample of 29 participants, the gender distribution was 86% female and 14% male, all participants were above 18 years of age, and all participants were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis by a rheumatologist (personal communication with first author).</P>
