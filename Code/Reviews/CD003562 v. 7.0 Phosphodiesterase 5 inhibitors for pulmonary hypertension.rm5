<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is high blood pressure in the lung circulation. It can occur without a known cause, or it can be caused by another lung disease or be secondary to abnormalities in the left side of the heart. The review sought to determine whether there was evidence that sildenafil (also known as Viagra), a drug which opens up the arteries and increases the flow of blood, could decrease pulmonary artery blood pressure and alleviate symptoms of PH. A limited number of studies of short term i duration indicated that the drug can open up the arteries. One small longer-term study found some favourable effects in terms of symptoms, but in the absence of longer term outcomes, we could not establish whether this meant that the people given the drug felt that their levels of daily activity were better. Future studies should be longer in duration, and should measure the impact of treatment on daily activities, mortality, quality of life and exercise capacity.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-15 15:47:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) can be either of unknown aetiology (primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH)) or due to a known underlying cause (secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH). Pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstriction is considered to be an important characteristic of PH. Therapies which aim to vasodilate are used to treat pulmonary hypertension.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical efficacy of sildenafil, a vasodilator which works through inhibition of the enzyme phosphodiesterase type V (PDE5I), administered via any route to people with pulmonary hypertension in primary or secondary forms.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-15 15:47:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched with pre-defined search terms. Searches were current as of October 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials were considered for inclusion in the review. We included studies which assessed the effects of sildenafil in participants with PPH and SPH.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted data from clinical trials. Data were entered in RevMan Analyses 1.0.2. Continuous data were pooled with an estimate on either WMD (weighted mean difference) or SMD (standardised mean difference) scales. Dichotomous data were pooled and a RR (relative risk) was calculated.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four studies recruiting 77 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review. Two studies assessed the acute effects of sildenafil. Two small crossover study assessed the effects of long term administration. The 'acute effect' studies indicated that sildenafil has a pulmonary vasodilatory effect. The two crossover studies showed improvement in symptoms. One study showed improvement in fatigue domains from a validated health status questionnaire. Both crossover studies reported that the drug was well tolerated.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The validity of the observed effects is undermined by small participant numbers and inadequate exploration of the different disease etiologies. The effects on long term outcome such as NYHA functional class, symptoms, mortality and exercise capacity require further validation. More studies of adequate size are required before the long term effects of sildenafil on clinically important outcomes can be established.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-05 17:06:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Pulmonary artery hypertension is characterised by resting mean pulmonary artery pressure of greater than 25 mm Hg. This can be divided into primary where there is no demonstrable cause identified and secondary where there are underlying causes.</P>
<P>Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a disease of unclear aetiology. It is sporadic and a familial predisposition has been observed in 10% of the cases. Observation suggests that pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstriction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PPH, characterised by pathologic demonstration of medial hypertrophy, impaired pulmonary vascular endothelial production of the vasodilator prostacyclin and nitric oxide and increased pulmonary vascular endothelial production of the vasoconstrictor endothelin. </P>
<P>The main symptoms of PPH are exertional dyspnoea, exertional chest pain, syncope, and oedema. Mean age upon diagnosis of PPH is 36 years.</P>
<P>Secondary pulmonary hypertension is mainly due to chronic hypoxaemia, parenchymal lung disease, chronic thromboembolic disease, left sided valvular or myocardial disease, congenital heart disease and systemic connective tissue disease.</P>
<P>Until now the efficacy of pulmonary vasodilator therapy has been limited due to the lack of potency and lack of selectivity, as almost all pulmonary vasodilators are also systemic vasodilators. Thus apparent benefits on the pulmonary circulation may be merely due to decreased venous blood return and decreasing right ventricular stroke output. Currently available proven therapeutic interventions for PPH include anticoagulation, vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers, epoprostenol infusion (prostacyclin analogue), nitric oxide, and lung transplantation. A Cochrane review examining the efficacy of prostacyclin has shown it to confer at least a short-term benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Paramothayan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paramothayan 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent, short acting vasodilator. Within the vascular smooth muscle it activates soluble guanylate cyclase, which generate cGMP, which in turn relaxes smooth muscle. cGMP is degraded by phosphodiesterase (PDE). Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of PDE-5, best known for its use as a treatment for male erectile dysfunction (Viagra). In addition to its high concentration in the corpora cavernosa, PDE-5 is abundant in the vascular, tracheal and visceral smooth muscle and in platelets. The work so far with PDE-5 inhibitors have shown improved haemodynamics in pulmonary hypertension.</P>
<P>The reviewers intend to summarise the evidence currently published<I> </I>concerning the use of sildenafil in pulmonary hypertension.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-08-15 16:27:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>For continuous data variables (e.g. blood pressure) a weighted mean difference was calculated by pooling the data from different studies together, where a common metric had been used. A standardised mean difference was calculated where studies had measured the same outcome but with different metrics (e.g. L/min and % predicted). We pooled data using a Fixed Effect model.</P>
<P>For dichotomous variables (e.g. side effects), an Odds Ratio (OR) was calculated based on the event rate data in the studies. Data were pooled using a Fixed Effect model.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was tested using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which measures the extent of heterogeneity not attributable to the play of chance. Where the statistic exceeds 20% Random Effects modelling was applied to see if the results altered.</P>
<P>Limited meta-analysis prevented the investigation of heterogeneity when the trials were combined. In anticipation of future studies meeting the inclusion criteria of this review, heterogeneity will be explored where the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic reaches 20%. Attempts will be made explore the differences based on the clinical characteristics of the included studies. Clinically dissimilar studies will not be statistically combined. However, when a group of studies with heterogeneous results appear to be clinically similar, the pooled effect estimates will be combined using both Fixed and Random effect models, and differences between the two types of modelling (if any) will be reported.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All studies with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Bharani-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bharani 2003</LINK> were well reported, and adequately randomised by computer generated randomisation schedules. However, in the two short term studies, blinding was not attempted. In clinical trials this may contribute to an overestimation of treatment effects, where there is subjective assessment of treatment effects, e.g. physician or patient rated clinical and/symptom scores. However, due to the short-term duration of the studies, this aspect may not have threatened internal validity. Due to the design of the two acute studies they have not measured longer term clinical symptoms, such as NYHA functional class status. The primary outcome of the review (change in NYHA functional class status), was measured in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bharani-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bharani 2003</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-15 15:55:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Four small studies have been included in this review. Due to the acute nature of two studies, and the limited assessment of functional class status in the remaining studies, firm conclusions regarding the effects of sildenafil on the course of PH are difficult to draw. Additionally, the participants in all the studies had very high pulmonary artery pressures, and in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Ghofrani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ghofrani 2002</LINK>, were recruited in an ITU setting. Therefore they were representative of patients from the more severe end of the spectrum. Only one study explicitly recruited participants who conformed to the <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK> classification of PH (<LINK REF="STD-Ghofrani-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Ghofrani 2002a</LINK>). Whilst this classification may become more commonly used in clinical trials in PH, there is currently limited evidence in our review to draw a distinction between this diagnostic model and others such as functional status (NYHA), threshold blood pressure levels or even disease etiology.</P>
<P>The positive physiological effects observed in the acute studies require replication in larger and more rigorously controlled trials, but would indicate that there is a vasodilatory effect in PH when sildenafil is administered. <LINK REF="STD-Bharani-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bharani 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sastry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sastry 2004</LINK> showed differences in terms of important outcomes such as symptoms and exercise capacity over two and six weeks. Nevertheless, these effects require confirmation on a larger scale, as well as its correlation with long term benefits including hospitalisation, mortality, and functional class status. Although <LINK REF="STD-Sastry-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sastry 2004</LINK> reported mild side-effects, the study design and duration means that we cannot exclude the possibility that sildenafil may have long term side effects. Data from small non-randomised studies in people with PH have not found any systemic side-effects, such as visual disturbance, flushing, headache and dyspepsia (<LINK REF="STD-Ghofrani-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ghofrani 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kothari-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kothari 2002</LINK>) which have been reported in one large study of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an uncontrolled trial <LINK REF="STD-Ghofrani-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ghofrani 2003</LINK> measured the effects of long term sildenafil treatment in addition to inhaled iloprost in severe pulmonary hypertension. The participants in the study were adults with mixed PH (PPH: N = 9, PH secondary to collagen vascular disease: N = 5), and were already deemed to have failed treatment with iloprost. After 12 months of additional sildenafil treatment improvements were noted in functional class status, exercise capacity and haemodynamic variables. <LINK REF="STD-Kothari-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kothari 2002</LINK> also assessed long-term effects of sildenafil in paediatric and adult populations with mixed PH (PPH: N = 9, PH secondary to surgical correction of heart defect: N = 5). After a follow-up period of 7.3 months (SEM 2.4), improvements were observed in terms of NYHA status, exercise capacity and right ventricular systolic pressure. Findings from these studies indicate that randomised studies measuring similar outcomes are warranted. In such studies the etiology of the disease should be considered as a potential explanation for different responses to treatment, and ideally studies should be limited to specific diagnostic groups e.g. solely PPH.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-15 15:55:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Current evidence from randomised studies does not indicate whether long term administration of sildenafil in PH is justified. The studies have shown that there may be a vasodilatory effect either in combination or in comparison with inhaled iloprost in selected patients. Two small studies reported differences on exercise capacity and symptoms over two to six weeks, which require validation in larger studies. Further work is urgently required to establish that the short term effects observed in these patients can be replicated in larger, more representative and better defined patient samples, and that short term improvements in haemodynamic variables correlate with long term outcomes. A more adequate side-effect profile is also required.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-15 15:55:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Further studies are required and should take account of the following methodological and clinical considerations:<BR/>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Adequate blinding of both study participant and trialist.</LI>
<LI>Trials should measure outcomes which are clinically relevant (e.g. mortality, NYHA functional class, hospitalisation) and which have been collected from adequate follow-up periods, so that long term effects can be established. Assessment of side-effects in larger samples of patients with PH would also be appropriate.</LI>
<LI>Disease etiology should be clearly described in future studies, and if possible data on participants with PPH and secondary PH should be analysed separately, to facilitate better identification of effects within these two subgroups.</LI>
<LI>Future studies should also assess the effects of treatment in less severe forms of PH.</LI>
<LI>To date the studies have recruited predominantly adult populations. The effects of sildenafil in children with PH needs also to be established.</LI>
<LI>Confirmatory studies are required to establish whether there is a dose response to sildenafil.</LI>
