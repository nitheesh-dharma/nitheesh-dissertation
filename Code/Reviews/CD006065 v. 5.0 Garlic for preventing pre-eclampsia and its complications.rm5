<P>Insufficient evidence to say if taking garlic can help to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia and its complications for pregnant women and their babies.</P>
<P>Pre-eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy occurring in about 2% to 8% of women. It is identified by increased blood pressure and protein in the urine, but women often suffer no symptoms initially. It can, through constriction of the blood vessels in the placenta, interfere with food and oxygen passing to the baby, thus inhibiting the baby's growth and causing the baby to be born too soon. Women can be affected through problems in their kidneys, liver, brain, and clotting system. Garlic may lower blood pressure (one of the problems with pre-eclampsia) and so may have a role in helping to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia. The review of trials found just one study of 100 women which showed no differences between dried garlic tablets and dummy tablets. However, the study was small and there are many varying forms of garlic, some with odour and some without, fresh cloves, powdered garlic, garlic capsules etc., and there may be differences between these preparations. Further trials are needed to assess any possible effect of garlic on pre-eclampsia and to assess any potential adverse effects.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January 2010).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included if they were randomised trials evaluating the effects of garlic on prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Data were entered on Review Manager software for analysis, and double checked for accuracy.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>One trial (100 women) of uncertain quality compared garlic with placebo. Another study was excluded as 29% of women were lost to follow up. There was no clear difference between the garlic and control groups in the risk of developing gestational hypertension (relative risk (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 1.00) or pre-eclampsia (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.93). Women allocated garlic were more likely to report odour than those allocated placebo (RR 8.50, 95% CI 2.07 to 34.88), but there were no significant differences in other reported side-effects. The only other outcomes reported were caesarean section (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.95), and perinatal mortality. There were no perinatal deaths in the study.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend increased garlic intake for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications. Although garlic is associated with odour, other more serious side-effects have not been reported. Further large randomised trials evaluating the effects of garlic are needed before any recommendations can be made to guide clinical practice.<BR/> </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2010-01-13 22:43:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Hypertension (high blood pressure) is common during pregnancy. Around 10% of women will have raised blood pressure at some point before delivery. The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy comprise a spectrum of conditions that is usually classified into four categories: (i) gestational hypertension, a rise in blood pressure during the second half of pregnancy; (ii) pre-eclampsia, usually hypertension with proteinuria (protein in urine) during the second half of pregnancy; (iii) chronic hypertension, a rise in blood pressure prior to pregnancy or before 20 weeks' gestation, and (iv) pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-NHBPEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEP 2000</LINK>). For women with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension, pregnancy outcome is similar to that for women with normal blood pressure. Outcome deteriorates if the blood pressure is very high, or if pre-eclampsia develops. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder involving the liver, kidneys, brain, and placenta. It affects 2% to 8% of pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>), and is associated with a substantive increase in morbidity and mortality for both the woman and her baby (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2002</LINK>). Complications for the mother may include eclampsia (seizures), stroke, liver or kidney failure, and abnormal blood clotting, and problems for the baby include poor growth and preterm birth. </P>
<P>The cause of pre-eclampsia is uncertain. Current belief is that reduced blood supply to the placenta leads to abnormal function of endothelial cells that line the woman's blood vessels, possibly as a result of oxidative stress (oxidative damage to cells caused by increased reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides). Endothelial cell dysfunction results in generalised vasoconstriction, platelet activation and thrombosis, and decreased plasma volume, with subsequent reduction of blood supply to multiple organs. Pre-eclampsia is discussed in more detail in the generic protocol for this review (<LINK REF="REF-Generic-Protocol-05" TYPE="REFERENCE">Generic Protocol 05</LINK>).</P>
<P>Garlic (<I>Allium sativum) </I>is part of the Allium, or onion, family.<I> </I>A hardy perennial herb, it probably originated in central Asia. Garlic is the most pungent of all the alliums, and has been widely used in many cultures for both medicinal and culinary purposes. It is also one of the most ancient herbs, recorded in Babylonian times (circa 3000 BC), found in the tomb of Tutankhamen, consumed in large quantities by the ancient Greeks and Romans, and used in both traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines. There are also many superstitions related to garlic, such as that it wards off evil spirits and vampires, or that chewing it will prevent competitors from getting ahead in races. The traditional medicinal uses of garlic include prevention of infection and treatment of colds, influenza, bronchitis, whooping cough, gastroenteritis, dysentery and skin problems. </P>
<P>Garlic's main active ingredient is thought to be allicin, a strong smelling sulphide. When raw garlic cloves are crushed or chewed, allicin is formed from garlic's main sulphur compound, alliin, by the action of enzyme alliinase. Although other constituents of garlic have been shown to be biologically active, the importance of different constituents in explaining health benefits of garlic is unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Amagase-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amagase 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>More recently, it has been suggested that garlic may have lipid lowering properties (<LINK REF="REF-Silagy-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silagy 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevinson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevinson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warshafsky-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warshafsky 1993</LINK>) which may be beneficial for the treatment of arteriosclerosis and diabetes, and for prevention of myocardial infarction. There is also some evidence that certain garlic preparations also inhibit lipid oxidation (<LINK REF="REF-Ide-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ide 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lau-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 2001</LINK>) and may thus prevent development of oxidative stress (<LINK REF="REF-Borek-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borek 2001</LINK>). A meta-analysis of eight trials (415 participants) reported reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure associated with garlic treatment in the form of dried powder (<LINK REF="REF-Silagy-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silagy 1994a</LINK>). Later trials failed to confirm these effects, however, and a subsequent systematic review reported no significant effect of garlic on blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2000</LINK>). Possible explanations for the more positive results seen in earlier studies are that recent trials may have used garlic preparations with poor delivery of garlic's active ingredient (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 2001</LINK>), or publication bias with failure to publish early negative studies, or the poor concealment of allocation in early studies may have led to overestimates of the effects of garlic (<LINK REF="REF-Silagy-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silagy 1994a</LINK>). Experimental studies have demonstrated that garlic inhibits platelet aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Ali-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ali 1999</LINK>), and may also increase the production of nitric oxide (<LINK REF="REF-Das-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 1995</LINK>), which is itself a platelet inhibitor and vasodilator. </P>
<P>The suggestions that garlic may lower blood pressure, reduce oxidative stress or inhibit platelet aggregation, or both, have led to the hypothesis that garlic may have a role in prevention of pre-eclampsia.</P>
<P>Many commercial preparations of garlic are available, falling into one of the following four categories: dehydrated garlic powder, garlic oil, garlic oil macerate, and aged garlic extract (<LINK REF="REF-Amagase-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amagase 2001</LINK>). These are available as a syrup, tablets, or capsules. As garlic's active compound allicin is unstable, and its formation depends on the presence of alliin and alliinase, commercial preparations must be prepared with considerable care. Processing of garlic may eliminate allicin or alliin, and decrease alliinase activity substantially. Moreover, stomach acid may also destroy alliinase, and digestion may be unpredictable despite the use of protective coatings (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 2001</LINK>). The bioavailability of allicin therefore remains uncertain. There are no recommendations for standard intake of garlic. In early studies that used raw garlic, the dosage required to obtain health benefits was relatively high, ranging from 7 to 28 cloves per day. In more recent studies that have used commercial preparations of garlic, the daily dosage has ranged from 600 mg to 1000 mg. </P>
<P>Garlic is generally well tolerated. In some communities, the breath and body odour may make it less acceptable. Other side-effects include minor gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and diarrhoea, and allergic reactions. Several reports suggest that there may be an increased tendency to bleed with concurrent use of anticoagulants (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>The purpose of this review was to assess the effects of garlic therapy for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analyses</HEADING>
<P>Statistical analyses were carried out using Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). Results are presented as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. At present, only one trial is included, but when sufficient data become available, we will assess heterogeneity between trials using the I<SUP>-</SUP>squared statistic. In the absence of significant heterogeneity, results will be pooled using a fixed-effect model. If substantial heterogeneity is detected (I-squared more than 50%), we will explore possible causes and perform subgroup analyses for the main outcomes. Heterogeneity that is not explained by subgroup analyses may be modelled using random-effects analysis, if appropriate.</P>

</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review includes one study with 100 primigravid women at 28 to 32 weeks. The participants were women at moderate risk of pre-eclampsia, as determined by a positive roll-over test. This test is positive when there is a rise in diastolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg between two blood pressure readings, the first taken with the woman lying on her left side, the second taken with her in the supine position. The study was conducted in Iran. Details of the study can be found in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table.</P>
<P>One study was excluded because 29% of women were excluded from the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Mose-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mose 2000</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The one included study was of uncertain methodological quality as there was no information on the exact methods used for allocation generation or concealment. Follow up was reported for all women. A placebo was used for blinding of participants, although garlic odour was reported by one third of the women in the active group. There was no blinding of caregivers or outcome assessment. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison: garlic versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>There was no clear difference between the garlic and control groups in the relative risk (RR) of gestational hypertension (one trial, 100 women; RR 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 1.00) or pre-eclampsia (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.93).</P>
<P>Women allocated garlic were more likely to report odour than those allocated placebo (RR 8.50, 95% CI 2.07 to 34.88), but there was no clear difference in other reported side-effects.</P>
<P>The only other outcomes reported were caesarean section (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.95), and perinatal mortality. There were no perinatal deaths in the study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the effects of garlic for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications. As only one trial with 100 women was identified for inclusion in the review, there is insufficient evidence for any reliable conclusions about the potential benefits or harms of garlic. </P>
<P>A potential methodological problem for future studies is the issue of how to adequately blind participants. In the Iranian study reported here, garlic was given in tablet form, and the tablets were claimed to be 'odour controlled'. Nevertheless, one third of women taking the active treatment reported odours, compared to only 4% on placebo. Such odours may be acceptable in communities with a high dietary intake of garlic, but may be unacceptable where garlic intake is lower. Moreover, pregnant women may be particularly sensitive to odour, which may influence compliance with the intervention in communities with low dietary intake.</P>
<P>Another problem with research into the effects of garlic is assessing the bioavailability of active constituents after ingestion. It has been recommended that commercial garlic preparations should be systematically tested for their ability to release allicin (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 2001</LINK>). It was not reported whether the garlic preparation used for the trial in this review was tested.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend increased garlic intake for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Garlic is a common constituent of food, especially in some parts of the world. There are reasonable theoretical grounds for suggesting garlic may help prevent pre-eclampsia and its complications. Although garlic is associated with odour, other more serious side-effects have not been reported. Further randomised trials to evaluate the effects of garlic for prevention of pre-eclampsia are justified, particularly in parts of the world where garlic intake is common. For reliable conclusions any such trials should be large. If garlic products are used, it is important to determine the amount of main constituents released in various garlic preparations. Further research is needed to clarify if potential health benefits are specific to particular preparations, constituents, or doses. <BR/> </P>
