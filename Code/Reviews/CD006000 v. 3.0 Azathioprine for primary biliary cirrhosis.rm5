<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>There is no evidence to support azathioprine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic disease of the liver that is characterised by destruction of bile ducts. Estimates of annual incidence range from 2 to 24 patients per million population, and estimates of prevalence range from 19 to 240 patients per million population. PBC primarily affects middle-aged women. The forecast for the symptomatic patient after diagnosis is between 10 and 15 years. The cause of PBC is unknown, but the dynamics of the disease resemble the group 'autoimmune disease'. Therefore, one might expect a noticeable effect of administering an immune repressing drug (immunosuppressant). This review evaluates all clinical data on the immunosuppressant azathioprine in relation to PBC.</P>
<P>The findings of this review are based on two clinical trials with 293 patients. The drug azathioprine was tested versus placebo or no intervention. The primary findings of the review are that azathioprine has no effect on survival, itching, progression of the disease (cirrhosis development), or quality of life. Patients given azathioprine experienced more adverse events than patients given placebo.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Azathioprine is used for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, but the therapeutic responses in randomised clinical trials have been conflicting.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the benefits and harms of azathioprine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Randomised clinical trials were identified by searching <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I>, the <I>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) </I>in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, <I>MEDLINE</I>, <I>EMBASE</I>, <I>Science Citation Index Expanded, The Chinese Biomedical Database</I>, and <I>LILACS</I>, and manual searches of bibliographies to September 2005. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised clinical trials comparing azathioprine versus placebo, no intervention, or another drug were included irrespective of blinding, language, year of publication, and publication status. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Our primary outcomes were mortality, and mortality or liver transplantation. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous outcomes were reported as weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD). We examined the intervention effects by random-effects and fixed-effect models. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified two randomised clinical trials with 293 patients. Only one of the trials was regarded as having low bias risk. Azathioprine did not significantly decrease mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.31, 2 trials). Azathioprine did not improve pruritus at one-year intervention (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.84, 1 trial), cirrhosis development, or quality of life. Patients given azathioprine experienced significantly more adverse events than patients given no intervention or placebo (RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.14 to 5.20, 2 trials). The common adverse events were rash, severe diarrhoea, and bone marrow depression.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence to support the use of azathioprine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Researchers who are interested in performing further randomised clinical trials should be aware of the risks of adverse events. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-16 17:36:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology. Ninety per cent of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are females and the majority are diagnosed after the age of 40 years (<LINK REF="REF-James-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1981</LINK>). Over the past 30 years, substantial increases in the prevalence of primary biliary cirrhosis have been observed (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2000</LINK>). Primary biliary cirrhosis is now a frequent cause of liver morbidity, and patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are significant users of health resources, including liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is classically defined on the basis of the triad: antimitochondrial antibodies, found in over 95 per cent of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Fregeau-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fregeau 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacerda-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacerda 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Invernizzi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Invernizzi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turchany-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turchany 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattalia-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattalia 1998</LINK>); abnormal liver function tests that are typically cholestatic (with raised activity of alkaline phosphatases being the most frequently seen abnormality); and characteristic liver histological changes (<LINK REF="REF-Scheuer-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheuer 1967</LINK>) in the absence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1996</LINK>). Patients may either be diagnosed during a symptomatic phase (the common symptoms being pruritus, fatigue, jaundice, liver enlargement, signs of portal hypertension, sicca complex, and scleroderma-like lesions), in which case survival is significantly decreased, or during an asymptomatic phase, in which one has a relatively favourable prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Beswick-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beswick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balasubramaniam-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balasubramaniam 1990</LINK>). However, 40% to 100% of these patients will subsequently develop symptoms of primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Nyberg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Metcalf-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metcalf 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prince-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although the aetiology remains unknown, primary biliary cirrhosis is analogous to the graft-versus-host syndrome in which the immune system is sensitised to foreign proteins. Most primary biliary cirrhosis patients have increased class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) histocompatibility antigen expression on bile duct cells (<LINK REF="REF-Ballardini-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballardini 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Oord-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Oord 1986</LINK>), and cytotoxic T-cells are infiltrating the bile duct epithelium (<LINK REF="REF-Yamada-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamada 1986</LINK>). Other duct systems of the body with a high concentration of HLA class II antigens on their epithelium, such as the lacrimal and pancreatic glands, may be involved in the disease process (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 1982</LINK>). </P>
<P>Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis have been subjected to many drugs. Ursodeoxycholic acid (a bile acid) is the most extensively used drug in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Verma-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verma 1999</LINK>). Other drugs have been immunomodulatory and other agents, such as colchicine (<LINK REF="REF-Warnes-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnes 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vuoristo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vuoristo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poupon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poupon 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2005b</LINK>), prednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchison-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchison 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prince-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2005</LINK>), chlorambucil (<LINK REF="REF-Hoofnagle-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoofnagle 1986</LINK>), cyclosporin A (<LINK REF="REF-Minuk-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minuk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiesner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiesner 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2005c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2005c</LINK>), D-penicillamine (<LINK REF="REF-Dickson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neuberger-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuberger 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2004</LINK>), methotrexate (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2005a</LINK>), or azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK>). </P>
<P>Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant, suppressing delayed hypersensitivity and cellular cytotoxicity more than antibody responses. The immunosuppressive action of azathioprine depends on its conversion to active 6-mercaptopurine by thiopurine S-methyl-transferase (<LINK REF="REF-Lennard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennard 1992</LINK>). Azathioprine is used for Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1998</LINK>), renal homotransplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Sandrini-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandrini 2000</LINK>), and severe, active rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Suarez_x002d_Almazor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suarez-Almazor 2000</LINK>). The first controlled therapeutic trial of azathioprine in primary biliary cirrhosis showed no efficacy and suggested the possibility of significant toxicity of azathioprine therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK>). In contrast, a large multicenter trial showed evidence of efficacy with very little toxicity (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK>). We have been unable to identify meta-analyses or systematic reviews on the beneficial and harmful effects of azathioprine in primary biliary cirrhosis.</P>

<P>
<B>Statistical methods <BR/>
</B>We used the statistical package RevMan Analyses 1.0.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) provided by The Cochrane Collaboration. We presented dichotomous data as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and continuous outcome measures by weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI. </P>
<P>We examined intervention effects by using both a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>) with the significant level set at P &lt; 0.05. If the results of the two analyses led to the same conclusion, we presented only the results of the fixed-effect model. In case of discrepancies of the two models, we reported the results of both models. We explored the presence of statistical heterogeneity by chi-squared test with significance set at P &lt; 0.10 and measured the quantity of heterogeneity by I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>) . </P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analyses<BR/>
</B>For primary outcome measures, we used a method to pool uncertainty intervals, which incorporates both sampling error and the potential impact of missing data (<LINK REF="REF-Gamble-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gamble 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>For secondary outcomes, we adopted 'available case analysis' at maximum reported follow-up. Therefore, in the review, the number of patients in the denominator changed according to the secondary outcomes investigated. </P>
<P>
<B>Bias exploration</B>
<B>
<I>

</I>
</B>Funnel plot was used to provide a visual assessment of whether treatment estimates were associated with study size. The performance of the available methods of detecting publication bias and other biases (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>) vary with the magnitude of the treatment effect, the distribution of study size, and whether a one- or two-tailed test is used (<LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>). Therefore, we intended to use the most appropriate method having good trade-off in the sensitivity and specificity, based on characteristics of the trials included in this review. </P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We identified a total of 190 references through electronic searches of <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I> (n = 16), the<I> Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials </I>in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (n = 46), <I>MEDLINE</I> (n = 27), <I>EMBASE </I>(n = 79), and <I>Science Citation Index Expanded</I> (n = 22). We excluded 184 duplicates or clearly irrelevant references through reading abstracts. Accordingly, six references were retrieved for further assessment. Of these, we excluded one, which is listed under 'Characteristic of excluded studies' with reasons for exclusion. Accordingly, five references referring to two randomised clinical trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included.</P>
<P>The two randomised clinical trials were parallel group trials published as full articles. All the included trials reported random allocation of 293 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis to azathioprine versus no intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK>) and azathioprine versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mean age of patients in the included trials was 53 years and 90% of the patients were women. Half patients had histological stage III or IV in <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK>. The entry and exclusion criteria varied across trials, but were generally well-defined, making it highly likely that all patients did have primary biliary cirrhosis. The dosage of azathioprine used in the <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial was around 30% higher than the one used in the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial. The trial duration (treatment plus follow-up) was 5 years in the <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> and 11 years in the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trials. Details are listed in the table of 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Generation of the allocation sequence was adequate in the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial. Allocation concealment was adequate in both trials, which used the sealed envelope technique. <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> used no intervention as a control group; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> treated the control group with identically looking placebo. The follow-up was adequately described in both trials: six patients were lost to follow-up and one patient withdrew from the <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial; 63 patients were lost to follow-up and 30 patients withdrew from the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial. We regard <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial as a low-bias risk trial.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<B>Mortality</B>
<BR/>Seventeen patients died in the <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial, whereas 119 patients died in the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial. We did not see a significant difference in mortality between azathioprine and control when only data on available patients were included (RR 0.88, 95 CI 0.74, 1.06) (Comparison 01-01). Considering the impact of missing data (eg, lost to follow-up or patients withdrawn), azathioprine did not significantly reduce the mortality risk (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.31, pooled uncertainty intervals) (Comparison 01-02). </P>
<P>
<B>Mortality or liver transplantation</B>
<BR/>No patients were liver transplanted so this composite outcome could not be assessed.</P>
<P>
<B>Pruritus at one-year intervention<BR/>
</B>At the start of the <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial, 18 of the 19 azathioprine-treated and 16 of the 20 control patients complained of pruritus. At one-year follow-up, 5 of the 18 treated and 7 of the 18 control patients complained of pruritus (RR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.84). Pruritus data were not extractable in the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>
<B>Hepatic histology<BR/>
</B>Ten of the 16 treated patients and 7 of the 12 control patients had developed cirrhosis after entry to the <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial (RR 1.07, 95 % CI 0.58 to 1.97). </P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life<BR/>
</B>Nine patients in each group remained fit and able to work for the whole period of the <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial. After combining data from the two trials, it seems that azathioprine did not improve the state of well-being among patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.08).</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse events</B>
<BR/>Both trials reported adverse events. The pooled data showed that patients given azathioprine had experienced more adverse events than patients given nothing or placebo (RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.14 to 5.20). The common adverse events were rash, diarrhoea, and marrow depression.<BR/> <BR/>We were unable to extract data on fatigue, liver complication, and liver biochemistry.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The results of our systematic review do not support azathioprine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Patients given azathioprine experienced more adverse events than patients given nothing or placebo, though not all adverse events were severe.</P>
<P>To our knowledge, only two trials have been conducted to evaluate the role of azathioprine in primary biliary cirrhosis. Therefore, this systematic review has a major limitation: a small number of trials included (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2001</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial included only 45 patients, did not use blinding, and only lasted five years. This is shorter than the estimated median survival of the disease, 10 to 15 years (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients given azathioprine did not have significantly lower risk of death than patients given nothing or placebo. The rate of missing data was 16% in the <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial and 38% in the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial. It is important to take account of the influence of these missing data. We, therefore, performed a sensitivity analysis using the pooled uncertainty intervals to incorporate the potential impact of missing data and sampling error, which resulted in a RR 0.80 with 95% CI 0.49 to 1.31. This result gives consistent finding with the result conditional on data of available patients. During the five-year follow-up in the <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial, 17 patients died, and no difference in survival between the two groups was observed. Standard survival analysis in the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial revealed no significant difference between the two groups. However, when adjustment for imbalances between the two groups (primarily serum bilirubin) was made, there was a slight, but statistically significant difference in survival favouring azathioprine (P &lt; 0.01). The first trial was clearly too small to have a reasonable chance of demonstrating or excluding any benefit of intervention. In contrast, the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial contained more patients with severe disease who were followed long enough to potentially showing an improvement in survival. However, even in this ideal clinical setting, demonstrating improvement in patient survival would still require statistical adjustment for baseline prognostic variables; this sort of analysis needs to be interpreted cautiously (<LINK REF="REF-Pocock-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the most important subjective aspects of primary biliary cirrhosis is pruritus. Azathioprine did not improve the degree of pruritus, though there was a consistently smaller number of patients complaining of pruritus in the treated group than in the control group (not statistically significant) (<LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK>). It was reported, in the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial that there was no significant difference in the number of patients requiring cholestyramine treatment for pruritus between the two groups. The <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial and the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial reported the results on liver biochemistry tests. However, we could not extract these data. There were no significant differences in the two groups in regard to the levels of serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatases, aspartate transaminase, cholesterol, serum albumin, and serum immunoglobulin M in the <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial. The effect of azathioprine did not reach statistical significance for any biochemical variable in the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial. Ten of the 16 treated versus 7 of the 12 control patients had developed cirrhosis (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.97) in the <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial. There were no significant differences in the two groups in regard to intralobular inflammation, peripheral cholestasis, piecemeal necrosis, granulomas, fibrosis (without cirrhosis), and histologic stages in the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial. </P>
<P>Another important aspect is quality of life. Both <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> measured this outcome in a similar manner. The <LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1976</LINK> trial did not find a beneficial effect of azathioprine, whereas the <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1985</LINK> trial claimed a marginal benefit (RR 0.63, P = 0.05). By pooling these two trials, we could not find a significant difference favouring azathioprine on quality of life (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.08).</P>
<P>The pooled data showed that patients given azathioprine had nearly 2.5 times more adverse events than patients given nothing or placebo (RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.14 to 5.20). Most of the patients who were withdrawn complained of rash, gastrointestinal disorder, and bone marrow depression. In addition, the immunosuppressive action of azathioprine depends on its conversion to active 6-mercaptopurine by thiopurine S-methyl-transferase (<LINK REF="REF-Lennard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennard 1992</LINK>). Patients who inherit a thiopurine S-methyl-transferase deficiency accumulate excessive concentrations of the active thioguanine nucleotides in blood cells. This can lead to severe and potentially life-threatening problems with the formation of blood cells among patients taking azathioprine.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support azathioprine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Patients taking azathioprine have higher risk of adverse events. Since patients with a thiopurine S-methyl-transferase deficiency would potentially have life-threatening haematopoietic toxicity, prescription of azathioprine should be monitored by laboratory tests, including full blood count and liver function.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Although the reviewed results of the two trials do not offer much optimism for a beneficial effect of azathioprine, researchers should recognize that only 293 patients have been randomised and the number of deaths were 136. These numbers may be considered too few, and investigators may wish to conduct further trials. If such trials are considered, then they ought to be closely monitored for both beneficial and adverse events. Any future trial should contain enough patients in concert with the sample size estimation, and patients should be followed long enough to allow observing potential improvement in survival. Any future trial ought to be reported according to the Consort Statement (www.consort-statement.org).</P>
