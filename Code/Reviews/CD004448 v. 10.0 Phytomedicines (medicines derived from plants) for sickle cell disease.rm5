Haemoglobin is the part of the red blood cell that carries oxygen across the body. Sickle cell disease occurs when people inherit faulty genes responsible for producing haemoglobin from both parents. A variety of complications and a reduced life expectancy are linked with sickle cell disease. Phytomedicines are medicines derived from plants in their original state.

Descendants of immigrants from the above geographical areas, living in other parts of the world may also inherit the gene and be affected. It is estimated that 1 in 50 people in sub-Saharan Africa suffers from SCD (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hickman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickman 1999</LINK>). Due to migration, persons affected with SCD are now found globally. A recent study estimates that 312,302 babies were delivered with SCD in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Piel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piel 2013</LINK>), the greatest burden of disease globally was found in three countries: Nigeria; Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); and India. Futhermore, 75.5%, 16.9% and 4.6% of babies affected by SCD are born in sub-Saharan Africa, Arab-India, and the Americas respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Piel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piel 2013</LINK>).</P><P>The homozygous state - sickle cell anaemia (SS) which occurs when a person has inherited two abnormal sickle genes (one from each parent) is a more severe form of the disease. Sickle cell disease has varying clinical manifestations and is associated with complications and a reduced life expectancy (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1994</LINK>). Clinically significant disease also occurs in individuals who inherit the sickle gene from one parent and another variant haemoglobin gene from the second parent such as haemoglobin C (SC) or a &#946;-thalassaemia gene (S&#946;+ or S&#946;O) (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Serjeant-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serjeant 2001</LINK>).</P><P>In SCD, haemoglobin (the part of the red blood cell that carries oxygen around the body) is abnormal. The red blood cell polymerizes (distort or change shape and become rigid) when giving up oxygen and this can lead to the blockage of small blood vessels, which in turn can stop oxygen delivery to the tissues, causing pain or organ damage (which includes the liver, lungs and kidney) or both. These red blood cells are destroyed, bilirubin (a break down product of haemoglobin) is produced and stored for excretion from the body in the gall bladder in bile (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Serjeant-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serjeant 2001</LINK>). Sickle cell disease is a risk factor associated with the formation of pigment gall stones, with its resultant ill health (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander_x002d_Reindorf-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander-Reindorf 1990</LINK>).</P><P>Factors shown to influence the rheology of sickled cells include temperature, pH, hydration status and biochemical milieu. Apart from advice to avoid cold and dehydration, particularly during intercurrent illness and the use of prophylactic antibiotics, and vaccination in children to prevent pneumococcal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Fleming-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirst-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirst 2014</LINK>), there is little treatment on offer until an individual is symptomatic. Treatment is supportive, with analgesia and blood transfusion. Hydroxyurea increases foetal haemoglobin (Hb F), which protects against the effects of sickle haemoglobin (Hb S), as well as prevents polymerization of the red blood cells in SCD (<LINK REF="REF-Nevitt-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nevitt 2017</LINK>). The prophylactic use of hydroxyurea, in the case of recurrent painful crises and following chest syndrome, reduces hospital admissions and the need for transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Nevitt-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nevitt 2017</LINK>). Although the long-term toxicity of the drug has been a concern (<LINK REF="REF-Nevitt-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nevitt 2017</LINK>), recent reviews have suggested it's long-term use over 17.5 years was safe (<LINK REF="REF-McGann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGann 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 2010</LINK>). Its use in people with SCD with splenic sequestration is less certain (<LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2011</LINK>), since it can cause regrowth of the spleen in older individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2003</LINK>).</P><P>There is significant mortality from SCD (<LINK REF="REF-Makani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makani 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lanzkron-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanzkron 2013</LINK>). In the lower-income areas of the world such as in parts of Africa, deaths from SCD occur in the first five years of life, with infants aged six months to one year mostly affected (<LINK REF="REF-Makani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makani 2011</LINK>). This is in contrast to the higher-income areas of the world with improved survival rates for children, with greater than 80% being reported (<LINK REF="REF-Quinn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 2010</LINK>). However, SCD related deaths in adults, even in the presence of comprehensive health care available in developed countries appears to be higher. In the USA, life expectancy with sickle cell anaemia was an average of 42 years for men and 48 years for women (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1994</LINK>) in 1994, while it was 33.4 years for men and 36.5 years for women in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Lanzkron-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanzkron 2013</LINK>).</P><P>Families bear the majority of the burden of care for people with SCD, as there are limited social or welfare provisions available, particularly in low- and lower-middle income countries, which have the largest number of affected people (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohiaeri-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohiaeri 2002</LINK>). There is disruption of family interactions, difficulty in parental coping, psychological distress and, with repeated hospitalizations and other treatments that are required, the consumption of scarce financial resources (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohiaeri-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohiaeri 2002</LINK>).</P><P>People with SCD, as such, remain a vulnerable group and could be at risk from remedies that they may encounter (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Awamy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Awamy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nzewi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nzewi 2001</LINK>). These remedies may include traditional medicines or herbal remedies, which may have true benefits or risks that might go unrecognised by the classically-trained medical fraternity.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-01-09 14:50:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>A phytomedicine may be defined as a medicine derived from plants in their original state and standardized for use in a dosage regimen.

Unfortunately, progress has been slow and largely guided by anecdotal reports of benefit in single patients, with little in the way of larger trials. Although most in vitro work has focused on single plants, some evaluation of cocktails of plant extracts (<LINK REF="REF-Ohnishi-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohnishi 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohnishi-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohnishi 2001b</LINK>) has also taken place.

The safety and efficacy of all phytomedicines available for people with SCD need to be scientifically evaluated. Following on from the in vitro studies, studies in humans have been conducted. The challenge remains to evaluate these therapies systematically, such that any true benefit and any risks to the individual with SCD are accurately reported. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) remain the gold standard in this regard.</P><P>This is an update of previously published versions of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Cordeiro-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cordeiro 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Oniyangi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oniyangi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oniyangi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oniyangi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oniyangi-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oniyangi 2015</LINK>).</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-08-19 11:35:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We aimed to assess the benefits and risks of phytomedicines compared to placebo or conventional therapy (including hydroxyurea and blood transfusion) or both in relation to symptoms and complications of all types of SCD.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-02-15 11:26:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-01-09 14:42:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2018-01-09 14:42:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>RCTs and quasi-RCTs.</P></CRIT_STUDIES><CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2017-11-27 12:06:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>People of all ages with SCD of any genotype in any geographic setting such as: homozygous (sickle cell anaemia (HbSS)) and compound heterozygotes including SC disease (HbSC) and &#946;-thalassaemia (S&#946;0/Sb+), proven by electrophoresis with family studies, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) tests or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as appropriate.</P></CRIT_PARTICIPANTS><CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-16 11:35:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke"><P>Administration (by any mode: topical; oral; or parenteral) of phytomedicines (defined as a remedy derived directly from plants or plant material and not synthesised) compared to placebo or conventional treatment, including blood transfusion and hydroxyurea.</P></CRIT_INTERVENTIONS><CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-08-19 11:41:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2010-08-19 11:41:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><OL><LI>Frequency, severity or duration of painful crises (as judged by validated pain scales, analgesia use and hospital utilisation) (change or absolute values)</LI><LI>Frequency of severe complications of SCD including sequestration crisis, acute sickle chest syndrome and leg ulcers (change or absolute values)</LI><LI>Frequency of hospital admissions from severe complications of SCD including painful crises, sequestration crises, acute sickle chest syndrome and leg ulcers (change or absolute values)</LI></OL></CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY><CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY MODIFIED="2010-08-19 11:41:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><OL><LI>Any adverse events including hepatic and renal toxicity</LI><LI>Frequency of blood transfusion (change or absolute values)</LI><LI>Level of anaemia (change or absolute values)</LI><LI>Quality of life measures (including exercise tolerance, employment and school attendance)</LI></OL></CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY></CRIT_OUTCOMES></SELECTION_CRITERIA><SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2018-02-15 11:26:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>We searched for all relevant published and unpublished trials without restrictions on language, year or publication status.</P><ELECTRONIC_SEARCHES MODIFIED="2018-02-15 11:26:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Information Specialist conducted a search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register for relevant trials using the following terms: (sickle cell OR (haemoglobinopathies AND general) AND phytomedicine.</P><P>The Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of the Cochrane Library) and weekly searches of MEDLINE.

However, from 2010 onwards, we have used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess the risk of bias for each trial (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This instrument comprises an assessment of the following domains.</P><OL><LI>Generation of allocation - was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</LI><LI>Concealment of allocation of assigned intervention - was allocation adequately concealed?</LI><LI>Blinding - how and who was blinded during the conduct and analysis of the trial, was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?</LI><LI>Incomplete outcome data - were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</LI><LI>Selective reporting - selective availability of data for outcomes (time points, subgroups or analyses); are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</LI><LI>Other potential sources of bias - was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</LI></OL><P>We have assessed these criteria as having either a low, unclear or high risk of bias.

Furthermore, self assessments for data collection may introduce bias as this is a subjective assessment and there was no correlation of clinicians' assessment and self assessments even though the authors mentioned that clinician data were compared to the participant data. Finally, most of the study participants were adolescents, although the age range was 2 to 42 years. This could affect the reporting of the primary outcomes such as the frequency of severe painful crises that are influenced by age. We therefore judge this risk of bias as 'unclear' as we need further information from the trial authors to adequately address this issue.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Ciklavit<SUP>® </SUP>versus placebo or conventional treatment</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Generation of allocation sequence</HEADING><P>This was described as using block randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Akinsulie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akinsulie 2005</LINK>).

Once one of the investigators saw an individual eligible for inclusion in the trial, after obtaining informed consent, the individual was sent to the clinic nurse, in another room, who held the envelopes. She selected the first randomly assigned envelope containing either the test product or placebo, which was unknown to either the participant or the nurse. For the subsequent eligible participant, the next envelope was selected until the block envelope was exhausted and the process was repeated for the next block. The participants and trial authors could not foresee the assignment of each participant as the allocation was done by central allocation by a third party not directly involved with the trial.

Further multicentre studies in humans are awaited. In this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wambebe-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wambebe 2001</LINK>), the results from several outcomes were not normally distributed and it was therefore not appropriate to analyse these in RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). Therefore, only the first six months of results are reported within this review.</P><P>The Ciklavit<SUP>®</SUP> trial was conducted as a single-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in children with SCD (<LINK REF="STD-Akinsulie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akinsulie 2005</LINK>). However, some limitations came to light in the reporting of the results. Most comparisons were made within groups rather than across groups. Different age groups receiving different doses of the medications were analysed within the same treatment arms, although ideally they should have been analysed separately. This may have added a confounder to the results. We recognize that the authors chose this approach as the data set were non-parametric. We were unable to compare across groups within the RevMan analyses given the skewed nature of the data (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). Our analyses aimed to compare data across intervention arms, rather than within intervention arms, and from these, we reached our conclusions regarding the trial.</P><P>The numbers examined in both trials (<LINK REF="STD-Akinsulie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akinsulie 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wambebe-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wambebe 2001</LINK>) were small and although no power calculations were stated in the original papers, it is likely that the trials were too under-powered to detect any but the largest effects.

The subjectivity of pain assessments in very young children by others limits its interpretation. In the Niprisan<SUP>® </SUP>trial, a clear definition of the pain scale used and health perception scales were not given, nor were there any data presented relating to their reliability or validity. In the Ciklavit<SUP>®</SUP> trial, baseline frequency of painful crises was measured by verbal recall across both groups. This may not have been accurate or truly representative of the events particularly in the younger children where there may have been difficulty in interpreting pain by their care givers and parents.

We identified two randomised controlled trials that compared the efficacy of phytomedicines to placebo in people with sickle cell anaemia. The included trials had individually assessed different outcomes of the review. However, collectively these trials had addressed most of the questions raised in the outcomes of the review, albeit with varying results.The evidence generated from both trials are therefore relevant to answer some of the review questions, although there are certain limitations in the conduct of the trials that may affect the evidence generated.</P><P>Of the different types of crises that occur in SCD, only the painful crises were evaluated by both trials. Neither the effects of phytomedicines on the frequency of severe complications of SCD including sequestration crisis, acute sickle chest syndrome and leg ulcers, nor on the blood transfusion rates were evaluated.</P><P>Both trials were conducted in areas of malaria endemicity, and as such, all participants received malaria prophylaxis as well as folic acid supplementation. Malaria is associated with precipitating painful crises and anaemia in SCD (<LINK REF="REF-Konotey_x002d_Ahulu-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konotey-Ahulu 1971</LINK>) and primary malaria prevention has been found to reduce these events (<LINK REF="REF-Oniyangi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oniyangi 2006</LINK>). If all the trial participants adhere to malaria prophylaxis, this is unlikely to confound results. However, we could not ascertain participants' adherence to a set dosing regimen of malaria prophylaxis. This may be relevant to the interpretation of observed difference in effects reported in the trials.</P><P>The participants in the Niprisan<SUP>®</SUP> trial were unpaid volunteers, although participants received transportation costs to encourage follow-up. As volunteers, they may not be truly representative of the general SCD population. In general it has been found that volunteers may exhibit outcomes different from non-volunteers, e.g. they may be healthier (<LINK REF="REF-MUSC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MUSC 2001</LINK>). They also may be more interested in the particular topic or have stronger opinions on that topic, which in turn may lead them to favour the treatment. The groups were reported as randomised even though the mechanism of randomisation was not stated. The blinding processes were deemed appropriate and the participants satisfied the inclusion criteria of the trial. Hence, these factors should not influence any potential differences in effect within the trial. However, the fact that the majority of the participants were adolescents may affect the reporting of some outcomes such as frequency of severe painful crises, which may be affected by age.</P><P>Furthermore, these trials had assessed only participants with sickle cell anaemia, and as such the results of the review are not applicable to people with other sickle cell genotypes. It is hoped that future trials will address this observed deficit.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-26 13:37:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>We judged the quality of the evidence from this review to be of low to very-low quality, depending on the outcome measured.</P><P>Low-quality evidence implies we can have some confidence in the result, but further research evidence would be helpful and is likely to change the estimate.

These studies highlighted the use of broccoli sprout homogenate (<LINK REF="STD-Doss-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Doss 2016</LINK>) and Gum arabic (<LINK REF="STD-Kaddam-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kaddam 2015</LINK>) as phytomedicines,</P><P>The mechanism of action of these herbal preparations differed from the anti-sickling properties for Niprisan<SUP>®</SUP> and Ciklavit<SUP>®</SUP> reported in the trials included in this review. These two substances, broccoli sprout homogenate and Gum arabic, cited in the more recent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Doss-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Doss 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaddam-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kaddam 2015</LINK>) were reported to increase foetal haemoglobin (Hb F) in persons with SCD. The mechanism of the third phytomedicine, the ayuverdic medicine (<LINK REF="STD-Panigrahi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Panigrahi 1997</LINK>) was not stated, but was noted to improve pain and haemoglobin levels, although in conjunction with folic acid administration, which is a haematinic (blood builder).</P><P>These studies cited above differed from the present review in neither being randomised nor controlled trials. They can therefore not be compared to the trials included in this Cochrane Review.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-11-27 12:20:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-11-27 12:20:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>Niprisan<SUP>®</SUP> and Ciklavit<SUP>®</SUP>, both phytomedicines for SCD, have been the subject of analysis in randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Akinsulie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akinsulie 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wambebe-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wambebe 2001</LINK>). However, both trials had small sample sizes and there was an absence of power calculations which limits the interpretation of their results. It is therefore likely that the trials were too under-powered to detect any but the largest effects. Moreover, as multiple comparisons are made, results of borderline significance are to be interpreted cautiously.</P><P>While Niprisan<SUP>®</SUP> appeared to be safe and effective in reducing severe painful crises over a six-month follow-up period, further trials are required to assess its role in the management of people with SCD. There is still no report of the planned multi-centre follow-up trials on this drug which would have provided additional information. No conclusions can be made at present regarding the efficacy of Ciklavit<SUP>®</SUP>.</P><P>Based on the published results for Niprisan<SUP>®</SUP> and in view of the limitations in data collection and analysis of both trials, phytomedicines may have a potential beneficial effect in reducing painful crises in SCD.This needs to be further validated in future studies. More trials are required on the safety and efficacy of phytomedicines in the management of SCD.</P><P>Therefore, at this stage, no recommendations can be made regarding the use of either of these medications in SCD.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-11-24 05:25:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Oluseyi  Oniyangi"><P>Trials investigating the use of phytomedicines in SCD need to be well-designed, with improved measures to validate self-assessment data. They should also be adequately powered with appropriate methods for analysing data. One of the difficulties in interpreting the results of the trials included in this review, is the lack of detail provided for assesments of pain and quality of life measures; and their validation. There is clearly a need for standard measures to be developed. Similarly, more research is needed to clarify the benefits of both drugs in SCD, particularly with the lack of benefit noted in the across-groups analysis of Ciklavit<SUP>®</SUP>. The potential for an adverse effect of Ciklavit<SUP>®</SUP> on anaemia needs to be clarified. For cross-over trials, an adequate washout period between treatment arms is required. Future research will need to address:</P><OL><LI>long-term effects (i.e. benefit and toxicity) of phytomedicines;</LI><LI>impact on other forms of SCD;</LI><LI>impact and safety profile in children and adults with SCD;</LI><LI>impact on use of transfusions in SCD;</LI><LI>impact on painful and sequestration crises, chest syndrome and other complications including leg ulcers;</LI><LI>impact on hospital admissions from complications of SCD;</LI><LI>approaches or measures to validate for data collected for the self assessments.</LI></OL></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-11-26 07:54:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Oluseyi  Oniyangi"><P>Professor Sally Davies for her help and support in organising this protocol.<BR/>Professor Rosalind Smyth for supervising the systematic review process.<BR/>Dr Nuno Cordeiro for the significant input into the development of the protocol and the initial review and first update.</P><P>Dr Temiye EO, contact author for the Akinsulie trial for clarifying issues related to the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Akinsulie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Akinsulie 2005</LINK>).</P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2018-01-09 14:49:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington"><P>Both authors: none known.</P></CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST><CONTRIBUTIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-19 10:52:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke"><P>Nuno Cordeiro (NC) conceived review and until January 2010 acted as guarantor.<BR/>NC and Oluseyi Oniyangi (OO) drafted and completed the protocol.<BR/>NC and OO independently evaluated studies found by the searches and completed the review.<BR/></P><P>As from January 2010, OO became lead author and guarantor of the review.

Details of randomisation provided by the trial authors were as follows: block randomisation was employed. The generation of random sequence was by shuffling the concealed allocation (in an opaque envelope in blocks of tens, which were shuffled and then numbered sequentially.
