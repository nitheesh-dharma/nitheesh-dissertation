<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:18:12 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The recognition of an inherited component to breast cancer has led to an increase in demand for information, reassurance, and genetic testing, which resulted in the creation of genetic clinics for familial cancer. Cancer genetic services can involve extended counselling, specialist screening and genetic testing for mutations. Risk assessment is the first step in the process of providing information and support to patients and their families about their risk of inheriting cancer. Information on evidence-based methods of delivering cancer genetic risk-assessment services is, however, sparse. For this review a systematic search, review, and assessment of the literature on the delivery of cancer genetic risk-assessment services for individuals concerned with familial breast cancer was undertaken.</P>
<P>This review included eight trials (10 papers) which covered the process of risk assessment for familial breast cancer. These focused on the psychosocial impact on patients, as well as other outcomes and aspects of service delivery, and provided data on 1973 participants. Due to the limited number of trials, this review found insufficient evidence to make any firm conclusions about the best way to deliver risk-assessment services for individuals concerned about a family history of breast cancer. All eight included studies did, however, demonstrate improvements in psychological well-being and a decrease in the levels of cancer worry as a result of the risk-assessment service. Although limited, the findings of this review suggest that cancer genetic risk-assessment services can help to reduce distress, improve the accuracy of the individual's perceived risk of breast cancer, and increase knowledge about breast cancer and genetics. Existing evidence suggests that such services do not cause patients any harm and, in the short-term, can have a positive effect by helping to ease distress and decrease cancer worry. From this review, it does not appear that the health professional delivering the risk assessment has a significant impact on these outcomes.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:17:30 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The specialised register maintained by the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group was searched on 16th February 2005. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycLIT, CENTRAL, DARE, ASSIA, Web of Science, SIGLE and LILACS. The original searches covered the period 1985 to February 2005. We also handsearched relevant journals. For this review update the search was repeated through to April 2011.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:17:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered trials looking at interventions for cancer genetic risk-assessment services for familial breast cancer for inclusion. Trials assessed outcomes such as understanding of risk, satisfaction and psychological well-being. We excluded studies if they concerned cancers other than breast cancer or if participants were not at risk of inherited breast cancer. We also excluded trials concerning the provision of general cancer genetic information or education as this review was concerned with the delivery of genetic risk assessment. Participants could be individuals of any age or gender, with or without a known BRCA mutation, but without a previous history of breast cancer or any other serious illness.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:17:46 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Additional information was sought from investigators as necessary. Due to the heterogeneity of both the interventions and outcomes, we reported data descriptively.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:17:52 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review update, we included five new trials, bringing the total number of included studies to eight. The included trials (pertaining to 10 papers), provided data on 1973 participants and assessed the impact of cancer genetic risk assessment on outcomes including perceived risk of inherited cancer, and psychological distress. This review suggests that cancer genetic risk-assessment services help to reduce distress, improve the accuracy of the perceived risk of breast cancer, and increase knowledge about breast cancer and genetics. The health professional delivering the risk assessment does not appear to have a significant impact on these outcomes.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:17:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found favourable outcomes for patients after risk assessment for familial breast cancer. However, there were too few papers to make any significant conclusions about how best to deliver cancer genetic risk-assessment services. Further research is needed assessing the best means of delivering cancer risk assessment, by different health professionals, in different ways and in alternative locations.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-16 16:25:25 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:18:23 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Advances in genetics have revealed that some cancers have a genetic component and can therefore, be inherited. It is estimated that between 5% and 10% of all incidents of breast cancer can be attributed to hereditary breast cancer susceptibility genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 (<LINK REF="REF-McPherson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McPherson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rahman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahman 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women who inherit a BRCA1/2 mutation have a 40% to 65% lifetime risk of breast cancer, and an 11% to 40% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Antoniou-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoniou 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2007</LINK>), with a typically young age of onset compared with sporadic cases of breast cancer. A mutation in the gene which causes a potentially high risk of cancer does not necessarily mean cancer will develop; nor does it predict at what age the cancer may appear. The development of the disease may also be affected by environmental factors and interactions with other genes (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recognition of the genetic component of breast cancer has led to greater public demand for information, reassurance, screening, and genetic testing, which has consequently led to significant increases in referrals to clinical genetic centres. The increase in referrals resulted in the development of a number of genetics clinics specifically dedicated to cancer. There has been little consensus about the delivery of cancer genetic services and differing arrangements exist, with wide variation in access and quality (<LINK REF="REF-Wonderling-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wonderling 2001</LINK>). However, there has been research interest in examining how these services are organised and delivered (<LINK REF="REF-Elwyn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elwyn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fry-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fry 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iredale-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iredale 2003</LINK>) and the best ways to meet the needs of patients with a family history of breast cancer. Going through a cancer genetic service is a complex process for patients and their families, involving different stages, which can include the assessment of a patient's risk of developing cancer, extended counselling, specialist screening, and genetic testing for mutations. Therefore, to review cancer genetic service delivery in its entirety would be difficult. However, as the first stage in the cancer genetic journey is usually the assessment of risk of developing a particular cancer, it is vital to assess the impact this has on patients.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:18:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The first step in the risk-assessment process is usually to compile a detailed pedigree to assess whether cancers are more likely due to an inherited susceptibility rather than a sporadic occurrence. Although variations exist in different countries, patients at risk of breast cancer are typically assigned a category - average (or low), moderate or potentially high risk of inheriting cancer, and each category is managed differently according to service guidelines. Risk-assessment services can provide appropriate information and support to patients and their families, offer genetic counselling, and undertake genetic testing for those at increased risk of familial breast cancer. Patients offered a cancer genetic clinic appointment can normally expect to see either a geneticist or a genetic counsellor. A consultation in a cancer genetic clinic is significantly longer than a primary care consultation as issues such as reproductive decision-making, employment, insurance, the likelihood of having a gene mutation, and options for reducing the risk of breast cancer may be covered. This usually occurs regardless of how the patient is managed, or by whom, or whether the first contact with cancer genetic services necessitates a detailed risk assessment.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:18:37 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The benefits of risk-assessment services have been demonstrated by comparing anxiety rates of patients before and after the consultation (<LINK REF="REF-Julian_x002d_Reynier-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Julian-Reynier 2001</LINK>). Studies suggest that while many patients do not experience increased distress as a result of the process, there are some who need additional psychological support (<LINK REF="REF-Hopwood-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopwood 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Roosmalen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Roosmalen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2000</LINK>) as a small but significant percentage of patients experience distress whilst waiting to learn their risk of breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phelps-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelps 2010</LINK>). Genetic counselling has also been found to lead to an increase in knowledge about breast cancer genetics but may not always improve accuracy of perceptions of risk (<LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Braithwaite-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braithwaite 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meiser-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meiser 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roshanai-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roshanai 2009</LINK>). Whilst much research has focused on the actual counselling process, less emphasis has been given towards the risk-assessment process that precedes this counselling.</P>
<P>It is possible for risk-assessment services to vary in a variety of ways and a number of pilot projects have explored alternative models of service delivery (see for example <LINK REF="REF-Coehlo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coehlo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lea-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lea 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tempest-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tempest 2005</LINK>). Studies have also focused on the experiences, expectations, and knowledge of referrers such as GPs, and the quality of their referrals (<LINK REF="REF-Elwyn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elwyn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucassen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucassen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2001</LINK>), and on computer-based risk-assessment tools (<LINK REF="REF-Braithwaite-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braithwaite 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Phelps-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelps 2004</LINK> compared the use of telephone calls and letters to transmit risk information to referred patients without bringing them to clinic. Alternatively, the risk assessment could be conducted via video-conferencing to provide cancer genetic services to rural populations (<LINK REF="REF-Gray-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meropol-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meropol 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Information on evidence-based methods of delivering cancer genetic risk-assessment services is sparse. Therefore, a systematic search, review, and assessment of the literature on the delivery of cancer genetic risk assessment for individuals concerned with familial breast cancer was undertaken, following the procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. Although mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have also been found to be associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer (e.g., <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Easton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Easton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Struewing-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Struewing 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whittemore-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittemore 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wooster-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wooster 1994</LINK>); this review focuses solely on familial breast cancer.</P>

<P>For the first full version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Sivell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sivell 2007</LINK>), the specialised register maintained by the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group was searched on the 16th February 2005 (details of search strategies used by the group for the identification of studies and the procedure used to code references are outlined in the group's module <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/BREASTCA/frame.html">http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/BREASTCA/frame.html</A>. Studies coded with the key words 'education', 'screen', 'psychosocial intervention/supportive care', 'prevent', 'diagnostic', 'genetic', 'high risk', as well as appropriate text words were extracted from the specialised register for consideration.</P>
<P>The search strategy used the recommended Cochrane search filter for RCTs to identify all relevant trials. This was adapted for the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycLIT, CENTRAL, DARE, ASSIA, Web of Science, SIGLE and LILACS. The searches covered the period 1985 to February 2005 and included all languages. We did not search literature before 1985 as genes relating to breast cancer began to be discovered in the late 1980s (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1990</LINK>) leading to the development of cancer genetic clinics (<LINK REF="REF-Eeles-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eeles 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>We handsearched the abstracts of identified articles from the updated search for possible inclusion in the review. We rejected articles if the article was not a report of a randomised trial, if the trial included women who had a previous cancer diagnosis, and if the intervention did not involve the delivery of a cancer genetic risk assessment for familial breast cancer. Two review authors (JH and RI) independently carried out study selection to determine whether studies met the inclusion criteria. Any disagreement about a particular study was resolved by discussion.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:19:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>For the update of this review, two review authors (JH and BC) assessed each included study independently using The Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely, sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, personnel or assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance). Due to the nature of the trials included in this review, it would have been impossible for the trials to have been fully blinded and hence we did not assess blinding of participants, personnel or assessors. We completed a 'Risk of bias' table for each eligible study. Any disagreement amongst authors was discussed to achieve a consensus. We presented an assessment of risk of bias using a 'Risk of bias' summary figure (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), which presents all of the judgments in a cross-tabulation of study by entry. Evaluating the validity of each study may assist the reader in interpreting and making conclusions about the study.</P>

<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2006</LINK> reported on a RCT comparing individual genetic counselling and group psychosocial counselling with a delayed counselling control group. Both studies recruited women from the greater Seattle area, USA. In <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2006</LINK>, only Ashkenazi Jewish women were recruited. In <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004</LINK>, the genetic counselling intervention comprised a single two-hour session with a genetic counsellor focusing on the patient's family history and each participant was provided with information regarding her own personal risk for breast cancer. The genetic counsellor provided information about breast cancer screening and participants were encouraged to discuss any concerns. Participants randomised to receive group psychosocial counselling met in groups of four to six participants for four, two-hour sessions. A trained health counsellor led each group covering four main topics: risk assessment and perception, screening, stress management and problem solving, and social support. Each participant received an individual risk-assessment sheet, which personalised the group discussion to her own risk status. The interventions used in <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2006</LINK> were similar except that genetic issues specific to Ashkenazi Jewish women and breast cancer were also discussed during the counselling sessions. Also, the individual genetic counselling session in <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2006</LINK> was one hour in duration compared with two hours in <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>The effects of different models of risk counselling for breast cancer were also examined in <LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK>, where in-person counselling and telephone counselling were compared with a delayed counselling control group. Women were recruited from a healthcare database in Washington state, USA. A family history of breast cancer was not required to take part in the study. In both counselling groups, participants reviewed their family history of breast cancer with a genetic counsellor and were provided with their individual breast cancer risk. Information about screening and breast cancer genes was given and genetic testing was discussed where appropriate, although genetic testing was not offered as part of this study.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 2005</LINK>, 72 women with a family history of breast cancer were randomised to either undergo risk counselling by a nurse specialist or to use a computerised tool that supports stratification of breast cancer risk, genetic risk assessment in the clinical environment (GRACE). Following completion of their family pedigree in GRACE, the GRACE software calculated and presented participants' breast cancer risk as either low, moderate or high. Participants received a personal risk report containing pedigree printouts, specific advice according to risk level, and recommendations about breast screening and genetic testing. In the nurse specialist group, pedigree information was gathered and the nurse assessed women's risk as low, moderate or high, based on the same guideline as that used in the GRACE. Participants were sent a letter summarising the content of the consultation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK> reported the results of a RCT comparing surgical consultations, with and without, genetic assessment for women with a family history of breast cancer, to determine the psychological impact of receiving genetic assessment. The standard service involved clinical input from specialist surgical staff. Participants received information on breast cancer surveillance and advice on risk management, surgical assessment of their risk of breast cancer, the option to enter the UK Tamoxifen Prevention Trial, and annual surgical review involving appropriate breast cancer surveillance and advice. Women were informed of their breast cancer risk based on nongenetic information including age, reproductive history, and minimal family history of breast cancer. In the intervention group, women received a multi-disciplinary genetic assessment service, including a specialist genetic consultation with a clinical geneticist and a genetic nurse specialist. The consultation focused on education about breast cancer genetics, assessment for breast cancer risk, and, where applicable, presymptomatic testing for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Two of the papers publishing data from this trial have been included in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK> presented data from 545 participants, analysed at all levels of risk at three time points. Secondary analyses of the same data were presented in an additional paper (<LINK REF="REF-Brain-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brain 2002</LINK>). The two study groups are compared at baseline and follow-up immediately after attending the clinic. In <LINK REF="REF-Brain-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brain 2002</LINK>, 653 participants were stratified into low-, moderate- or high-risk categories on the following outcomes: anxiety, worry, perceived risk and satisfaction.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fry 2003</LINK> reported a clustered RCT where 170 GP practices in the UK were randomised to either a novel community-based service (intervention) held in GP practices by a genetic nurse specialist or the existing multidisciplinary specialist service (control). In both groups, cancer genetic risk level was assessed based on family history of breast cancer. In the control group, women assessed as being at moderate or high risk were offered appointments at a familial breast cancer clinic where they discussed risk status with a genetic consultant and risk management with a specialist breast surgeon. In the novel service intervention group, women at increased risk (moderate and high) were offered an appointment at a regional centre with a geneticist and genetic nurse specialist.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Matloff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matloff 2006</LINK> investigated the effects of a personalised risk assessment and genetic counselling intervention compared with a delayed intervention control group. Participants were at least 40 years of age, with at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer and had gone through natural menopause. Women with a greater than 10% risk of carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation were excluded. The intervention included two 60-minute sessions with a genetic counsellor. Information was given to participants about the risks and benefits of menopausal therapy and the factors that influenced disease risk assessments. Womens' 10-year and lifetime risk of breast cancer was calculated and presented to women at the second visit. Participants also received a personalised risk assessment for endometrial cancer, heart disease and osteoporosis. After the risk-counselling sessions, each participant received a letter summarising her risk data.</P>
<P>Only women at low or average risk of familial breast cancer were included in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Young-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2006</LINK>. This study examined the method of communicating risk information for lower risk referrals to a familial breast cancer clinic in Scotland, UK. Eligible women were randomised to receive their risk assessment via letter or were invited to an interview with a genetic specialist or nurse. The interview was followed up with a personal letter summarising the discussion. All letters included information that despite being below the threshold for inclusion in a regular surveillance programme, risk of breast cancer was still real. Women were instructed to remain breast aware, report breast symptoms to their GP, and notify the familial breast cancer clinic of any change in their family history of breast or ovarian cancer.</P>

The assessment of these outcome measures was only conducted in the short-term; no study looked at the long-term implications for these outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Young-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2006</LINK> followed up participants three months after the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fry 2003</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Matloff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matloff 2006</LINK> conducted a six-month follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK> followed up participants at nine months.</P>
<P>The intervention and control groups were comparable at baseline in all of the studies.

Withdrawals in <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004</LINK> were 2.3% with no differences found between all participants who were randomised and only those who completed the follow-up survey. In <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2006</LINK>, the follow-up response rate was 96%. In <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK>, approximately a quarter of those randomised (26.35%) were withdrawn from the trial; five participants were excluded due to non-attendance in the surgical aspect of the multidisciplinary trial clinic and 190 were lost to follow up. In <LINK REF="STD-Fry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fry 2003</LINK>, there were a total of 129 withdrawals, 34.6% of the total number of patients randomised to the trial. Reasons given for the withdrawals were: lost to follow up (n = 19), not returning the baseline questionnaire (n = 65), withdrew from the study (n = 8), clinical reasons (n = 9), administration reasons (n = 27) and returning a blank questionnaire (n = 1). In <LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 2005</LINK>, 14 participants (22%) were lost to follow up three months after the intervention. Reasons for loss to follow up are not reported. Only 1.5% of participants did not return their three-month follow-up survey in <LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Matloff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matloff 2006</LINK>, analyses were confined to the 48 participants who completed all three assessments (75% of randomised participants) and those with missing data were excluded. Reasons for withdrawal are stated in <LINK REF="STD-Young-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2006</LINK> where only data from the 71 participants who returned their three-month follow-up questionnaire were analysed.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004</LINK>, few significant differences were found between the intervention groups (genetic counselling and psychosocial counselling) at the two assessment points (baseline and six months). At follow-up and in comparison to the control group, both counselling interventions showed significantly lower perceived risk of breast cancer (P &lt; 0.01) and cancer-specific worry (P &lt; 0.01) with no differential effects of counselling type. In comparison to those in the control group, participants in both counselling interventions decreased their cancer-specific worry; the interaction between time and study group was found to be statistically significant (F = 4.2; degrees of freedom (df) = 2344; P &lt; 0.01). Participants in the counselling interventions reported slightly lower levels of anxiety over time in comparison to the control group, with only a significant difference shown in participants in the psychosocial group. The interaction between time and counselling intervention was statistically significant (F = 3.0; df = 2344; P &lt; 0.01). A non-statistically significant decrease in depressive symptoms over time in both the intervention and control groups was also observed. Overall, there was a positive reaction to the counselling with almost all participants in both counselling interventions completing their counselling protocols (98% for genetic counselling, 96% for psychosocial counselling). The majority of participants reported that they liked the counselling activities "very much" (82% for genetic counselling, 71% for psychosocial counselling) although only one-third of participants read all of the written materials they received in either intervention group. Participants rated highly both the support they received from the counsellors and the experience of talking about their concerns during their counselling sessions. Eighty-six percent of participants in the genetic counselling group and 72% in the psychosocial group reported talking "quite a bit" about their concerns during counselling, which was found to be statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). In both interventions, over half the participants reported counselling to be "very useful" (65% for genetic counselling and 59% for psychosocial counselling).<BR/>
</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2006</LINK>, there were no differences at baseline for any of the variables among the study arms. Perceived risk and cancer-specific worry decreased over time (from baseline to six month follow-up) in both intervention groups. Cancer worry increased slightly in the control group. Awareness of genetic testing increased in all study groups, and interest in genetic testing and candidacy judgements decreased over time. There were significant interactions of time and study group for all study variables, with women in the intervention groups changing more over time than women in the control group for perceived risk (F = 13.6; df = 2211; P &lt; 0.001), cancer worry (F = 4.1; df = 2211; P &lt; 0.001), awareness of genetic testing (F = 8.7; df = 2211; P &lt; 0.001), and interest in genetic testing (F = 5.6; df = 2211; P &lt; 0.01). There were no significant differences between the genetic counselling and psychosocial counselling groups; all significant differences were between women in the control group and the two intervention groups. Multiple regression analyses showed that the only significant predictor of change in perceived risk in the counselling groups was level of baseline Jewish cultural identity (F = 6.2; df = 7138; P &lt; 0.001). Participants with lower levels of identification with Jewish culture reported larger decreases in perceptions of their own risk. <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2006</LINK> also examined beliefs about genetic testing. Endorsements of beliefs about stigma associated with genetic testing increased significantly in all groups between baseline and follow-up (F = 510; df = 2211; P &lt; 0.0001), with no differences between intervention and control groups. Women in the control group increased their endorsement of beliefs about unrestricted access to genetic testing, whereas women in both counselling groups decreased their beliefs compared with the control group over time (P &lt; 0.05). Participants with low levels of religious identity changed their interest in genetic testing less than those with higher levels of religious identity (P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK>, those who dropped out at baseline reported statistically significantly higher trait anxiety (mean = (study drop-outs) 43.07/ (participants) 39.67; standard deviation (SD) 11.12/10.37; P = 0.008), state anxiety (mean = 40.61/36.63; SD 10.40/11.33; P = 0.004) and lower personal risk (mean = 6.95/7.37; SD 1.49/1.24; P = 0.006) than participants who remained in the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK> also reported that the mean trait anxiety score of those who dropped out of the study was higher than population norms. At the first assessment after clinic, drop-outs were found to be significantly younger (mean = 37.85 versus 41.90) and were reporting higher baseline cancer worry than those who remained in the study (mean = 13.33/11.72; SD 4.01/3.13; P = 0.001). At the nine-month follow-up point, those who dropped out of the study were again significantly younger than those who remained in the study (mean = 37.15 versus 42.59), and were found to be reporting significantly higher baseline state anxiety (mean = 40.17/36.05; SD 13.10/11.07; P = 0.007), cancer worry (mean = 12.68/11.62; SD 2.84/3.16; P = 0.01), and perceived risk (mean = 7.82/7.31; SD 1.26/1.20; P = 0.002). <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK> reported some evidence of differential drop-out between the study groups themselves; participants in the control group were significantly less likely to return the questionnaire immediately after clinic (X<SUP>2 </SUP>(1) = 7.86; P = 0.005).</P>
<P>Few significant differences were found between the intervention (multidisciplinary genetic assessment service) and the control (standard service with input from specialist surgical staff) groups at the three assessment points (baseline, immediately after clinic and nine months); however, some significant differences were found between the different risk categories.</P>
<P>Some statistically significant differences were found between risk categories, between and within study groups for perceived risk, cancer worry and patient satisfaction reported in the subsequent publication. Significant differences in perceived risk were found between risk groups at both baseline (F(2, 637) = 17.48, P &lt; 0.001) and at the first follow-up (F(2, 640) = 128.56, P &lt; 0.001). At both baseline and the first follow-up, participants' perceived risk was significantly higher in the high-risk group compared with the low and moderate risk groups. A significant reduction in perceived risk of breast cancer from baseline to assessment immediately after the clinic was found for those in both the intervention (mean = 7.29/6.44) and the control (mean = 7.33/6.62) groups (95% CI -0.21 to 0.08). Perceived risk from immediate post-clinic assessment to the follow-up at nine months significantly increased; however the perceived risk at the nine-month follow-up was still significantly lower than at baseline, regardless of group allocation. On looking at differences across risk classification, a significant decrease in perceived risk was found for those at low and moderate risk from baseline to the first follow-up point (low risk: t(101) = 10.78, P &lt; 0.001; moderate risk: t(431) = 13.27, P &lt; 0.001), with no significant change found in those at high risk (t(96) = 0.00, P = 1.00). Within the intervention group, perceived risk decreased significantly for those at low (t(49) = 6.90, P &lt; 0.001) and moderate (t(221) = 11.83, P &lt; 0.001) risk, whereas for those at high risk in the intervention group, there was a marginal significant increase (t(53) = -1.72, P = 0.09). Within the control group, perceived risk decreased significantly for low (t(51) = 8.35, P &lt; 0.001) and moderate (t(209) = 7.03, P &lt; 0.001) risk women, with no difference for those at high risk (t(42) = 1.83, P = 0.07).</P>
<P>Anxiety levels remained within the normal range both before and after the study intervention, and the effect of study group or risk classification on anxiety was not significant. Anxiety significantly decreased from baseline to assessment immediately after clinic (intervention: mean = 35.93/34.33; control: mean = 35.54/33.14; 95% CI -0.75 to 1.41), and then significantly increased at nine months (intervention: mean = 36.38; control: mean = 35.18; 95% CI -0.85 to 1.98), although this increase did not exceed baseline levels. There was a significant decrease in cancer worry in both groups from baseline to post-clinic assessment (intervention: mean = 11.79/10.55; control: mean = 11.49/10.50; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.20) and from baseline to nine-month follow-up (intervention: mean = 10.55; control: mean = 10.63; 95% CI -0.59 to 0.05); the decrease from post-clinic assessment to nine-month follow-up was not significant. Cancer worry decreased significantly for those at low and moderate risk (low risk: t(106) = 5.92, P &lt; 0.001; moderate risk: t(443) = 12.13, P &lt; 0.001) but not for those at high risk (t(98) = 1.67, P = 0.10) (95% CI -0.88 to 2.35).</P>
<P>High patient satisfaction with counselling was reported in both groups and the effect of study group on satisfaction was not statistically significant (intervention: mean = 42.82; control = 42.29; 95% CI -0.16 to 0.76). However, a significant main effect of risk classification was found. Those at high risk reported significantly lower instrumental satisfaction than those at low or moderate risk, with women at moderate risk reporting significantly lower satisfaction than women at low risk (F(2 to 593) = 13.80, P &lt; 0.001). A small significant main effect of clinic venue was also found; participants seen at the well-woman clinic setting reported greater satisfaction than those seen in a hospital-based setting (mean = 42.96/41.95; SD 4.97/4.79; t(450) = 2.11; P = 0.04). A statistically significant increase in knowledge was found in both the intervention (mean = 1.54/2.17) and control (mean = 1.45/1.89) groups, where the degree of the increase was significantly greater for those in the intervention group (95% CI -0.001 to 0.27).<BR/>
</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Fry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fry 2003</LINK>, it was evident that only the characteristics of those who returned the baseline questionnaire were available so the authors looked for evidence of participation bias by comparing those participants who only returned the baseline questionnaire (n = 97) and those who completed the follow-up at four weeks (n = 276). A significantly greater number of the 'baseline only' group had been randomised to the intervention arm of the trial (61 versus 39%; X<SUP>2 </SUP>= 5.70, df = 1, P = 0.018) and were categorised as being at 'low risk' (54 versus 32%; X<SUP>2</SUP> = 14.01, df = 1, P = 0.000). This group was also found to be suffering 'case-level' distress at baseline (43 versus 31%; X<SUP>2</SUP> = 4.53, df = 1, P = 0.043) and scored significantly higher on the Cancer Worry Scale (mean = 12.18/11.10; SD = 3.29/2.98; t = 2.97, df = 367, P = 0.003) which may have had an impact on the results of the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Fry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fry 2003</LINK> found no significant differences between these two groups on any other psychological or socio-demographic variables.</P>
<P>No significant differences were found between the two trial arms (community-based and multidisciplinary services) on any of the variables at the three assessment points (baseline, four weeks and six months).</P>
<P>There was an improvement in objective understanding of genetics and mammography across all groups and participants of all risk categories during the study; post-hoc tests showed scores to have significantly improved between assessment at baseline and four weeks only (genetics: t = -14.37, df = 232, P &lt; 0.000; mammography: t = -5.56, df = 214, P &lt; 0.000). An overall significant improvement in subjective understanding of breast cancer genetic risk over time was found, where statistically significant improvement was only found between baseline and follow-up at four weeks (t = -14.97, df = 231, P &lt; 0.000). Participants at moderate and high risk of breast cancer scored significantly higher than those at low risk at both the four weeks (t = -2.69, df = 235, P = 0.008) and six months follow-up (t = -2.46, df = 109.214, P = 0.015). There was a significant improvement of subjective understanding of breast cancer genetic risk for participants in all risk categories (moderate/high risk: t = -13.70, df = 164, P = 0.000; low risk: t = -6.55, df = 66, P = 0.000) between assessment at baseline and follow-up at four weeks; this improvement was significantly greater for those at moderate and high risk of breast cancer than for those at low risk (t = -2.51, df = 230, P = 0.013). A significant interaction was found between the trial group, time and objective risk where differences between the risk groups were only statistically significant between baseline and four weeks follow-up (F(1, 226) = 5.27, P &lt; 0.023). A significant improvement in subjective understanding took place for participants at moderate and high risk of breast cancer in the control group (t = -11.64, df = 98, P = 0.000), and participants in all risk categories in the novel service intervention (moderate/high risk: t = -7.58, df = 65, P &lt; 0.000; low risk: t = -7.32, df = 41, P = 0.000) between assessment at baseline and four-week follow-up. There were no significant differences in the extent to which subjective understanding had improved between the intervention groups, however those at low risk of breast cancer in the standard intervention showed an improvement in subjective understanding between baseline and four-week follow-up.</P>
<P>Significantly fewer women in all risk categories perceived their risk as being low at four-week follow-up when compared with baseline (P = 0.011). A significantly greater proportion of participants at low objective risk of breast cancer perceived their risk to be low at the four-week (X<SUP>2 </SUP>= 19.94, df = 1, P &lt; 0.000) and six-month follow-ups (X<SUP>2</SUP> = 12.24, df = 1, P &lt; 0.002) in comparison to those at moderate or high risk. There was a significant reduction in scores on the Cancer Worry Scale for all participants over time with the greatest decrease between baseline and four-week follow-up (t = 5.86, df = 239, P = 0.000). There was a smaller, yet still significant decrease in scores between assessments at four weeks and six months (t = 3.05, df = 238, P = 0.003). There was also a decrease in the proportion of participants suffering 'case-level' psychological distress, which was found to be significant between baseline and four-week follow-up (t = 8.27, df = 1, P &lt; 0.004). There were no significant differences found in the proportion of women suffering 'case-level' distress between the groups or risk categories at the three assessment points. <LINK REF="STD-Fry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fry 2003</LINK> also examined the impact of attending genetics services on health behaviours and found that at four-week follow-up proportionately more women in the control group reported examining their breasts on a monthly basis as had been recommended (32% versus 23%), and proportionately more women in the intervention group reported breast self-examination more frequently than once a month (11% versus 4%; X<SUP>2</SUP> = 9.86, df = 4, P = 0.043). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the extent to which they reported performing health behaviours prior to counselling or reported change in performing these behaviours after counselling. At the six-month follow-up, there were no significant differences in the proportion of women who reported changing any health behaviours in the previous six months between the two groups.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 2005</LINK>, both participants who used the GRACE tool and received risk counselling by a nurse specialist increased accuracy in risk perceptions from baseline to three-month follow-up, with no significant difference between the groups. Significantly more women in the GRACE group than the specialist nurse group who had initially accurate risk perceptions maintained accurate risk perceptions after the intervention (P &lt; 0.05). There were no significant changes in comparative risk perceptions over time and no significant differences between groups. The interaction between study group and time approached statistical significance (P = 0.05), suggesting a greater reduction across time in elevated risk perceptions in the nurse counselling group compared with the GRACE group.</P>
<P>There were no significant between-group differences in anxiety and depression scores at any time point. Anxiety scores as measured by HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) decreased over time in both groups although this was not statistically significant. HADS depression scores decreased between baseline and three-month follow-up in the GRACE group and increased slightly in the counselling group. However, there were no significant changes in anxiety and depression scores across time and no interaction effects. There were significant changes across time (F = 41.20; P &lt; 0.001) and a significant treatment effect (F = 8.81; P &lt; 0.01) for state anxiety scores. State anxiety levels increased from baseline to post-intervention in both groups with scores falling slightly at three-month follow-up. However, state anxiety scores did not return to baseline levels. The increase in state anxiety from baseline to post-intervention was particularly prominent among women at increased risk, irrespective of treatment group. Cancer worry scores decreased significantly from baseline to follow up in both groups (P &lt; 0.01) and there were no significant effects of study group or interaction effects.</P>
<P>Satisfaction with the risk information was significantly higher for the nurse counselling compared with the GRACE (P &lt; 0.01). Perceptions of risk information in terms of credibility (P &lt; 0.01), trustworthiness (P &lt; 0.01), accuracy (P &lt; 0.05), clarity (P &lt; 0.01) and helpfulness (P &lt; 0.05) were significantly higher for the nurse counselling than the GRACE. Participants also rated more positively nurse counselling than the GRACE in terms of addressing concerns (P &lt; 0.01), being sensitive to these concerns (P &lt; 0.01), and helping them make a good choice (P &lt; 0.01).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK>, there were no baseline differences in demographic or background variables among any of the groups. Risk perceptions decreased in both counselling groups (in-person and telephone counselling) and increased in the control group from baseline to three-month follow-up. There was a significant effect of risk perception at baseline to risk perception at follow-up (F = 188.92; df = 2331; P &lt; 0.001). The effect of study group was also significant (F = 15.73; df = 2331; P &lt; 0.001). There was a significant difference between the intervention groups and the control group (mean difference = 10.41; CI 6.76 to 14.07; P &lt; 0.001), but not between the two intervention groups (mean difference = 1.26; CI -3.02 to 5.53; P = 0.564).</P>
<P>Cancer worry scores in all groups decreased over time. Significant effects were found on cancer worry at baseline to cancer worry at follow-up (F = 80.55; df = 1314; P &lt; 0.001) and a significant effect of study group (F = 6.20; df =2341; P = 0.002). There were significant differences between intervention groups and the control group (mean difference = 0.43; CI 0.19 to 0.68; P &lt; 0.001) but not between the two intervention groups (mean difference = 0.02; CI -0.27 to 0.30; P = 0.919).</P>
<P>With regards to breast health intentions, there were no significant differences between the groups at baseline or follow-up. Genetic testing intention scores increased in the control group from 2.20 to 2.71. Scores in the in-person counselling group decreased from 2.23 to 1.62 and also decreased in the telephone counselling group from 2.24 to 1.72. There was a significant effect of intentions to pursue genetic testing at baseline to pursue genetic testing at follow-up (F = 209.98; df = 1330; P &lt; 0.001). The effect of study group was also significant (F = 60.41; df = 2330; P &lt; 0.001). There was a significant difference between the intervention groups and control group (mean difference = 0.52; CI 0.43 to 0.62; P &lt; 0.001) but not between the two intervention groups (mean difference = 0.09; CI -0.02 to 0.20; P = 0.107).</P>
<P>There were no significant differences between intervention groups in terms of satisfaction with counselling and support received. However, 77.4% of women in the in-person counselling group felt that they were able to talk more about their concerns compared with 67.3% in the telephone counselling group (P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Matloff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matloff 2006</LINK>, no significant differences were found between the genetic risk-counselling group and the control group at baseline in terms of demographics, perceived risk of breast cancer, decisional intentions or decisional conflict about menopausal therapy. Participants' perceived risk was significantly lower in the intervention group at one-month follow-up (F(1, 44) = 14.08, P &lt; 0.008) and at six months post-intervention (F(1, 44) = 8.48, P &lt; 0.008). The intervention group was no less likely to rate their own risk for breast cancer as higher than that of the average woman than the control group at one month (F(1, 43) = 7.52, P &lt; 0.008) and six months (F(1, 43) = 4.43, P &lt; 0.008). For participants in the intervention group, discrepancy between perceived risk and actual risk of breast cancer was significantly lower than baseline at one month (t(21) = 3.10, P &lt; 0.008) and at six months (t(21) = 3.10, P &lt; 0.008). However, some women continued to overestimate their risk level after counselling.</P>
<P>With regards to medication usage, there were no group differences at either follow-up point in the proportion taking hormone replacement therapy (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.98, P = 1.00). No participants were taking raloxifene or tamoxifen at any time point in the study.</P>
<P>Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the counselling session including the information received (M = 85.64, SD = 16.93), the support received (M = 80.13, SD = 21.87), and the time involved (M = 80.39, SD=19.95), but less with the convenience of the session (M = 76.61, SD = 25.27).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Young-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2006</LINK> found no differences in cancer worry scores at three-month follow-up between those who received their risk assessment by letter or those who received their risk assessment face-to-face (t(69) = -0.636, P = 0.527). Significant between-group differences were reported for personal breast cancer risk estimates. Those who received their risk assessment during an interview (mean = 2.38) perceived their risk to be slightly higher than those who received their information by letter (mean = 2.0, t(69) = -2.246, P = 0.028). <LINK REF="STD-Young-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2006</LINK> reported no significant differences between groups for estimates of personal lifetime risk of breast cancer in the two items which measured risk estimates (t(64) =1.036 , P = 0.304, and t(69) = -0.249, P = 0.804).The authors noted that personal risk estimates were often inaccurate and there were poor correlations between estimates expressed in the different formats for the same respondent. As there were no baseline measures of any outcomes it is unknown whether cancer worry or risk perceptions changed after receiving genetic risk information. There were no reported differences between groups for actions since referral and for experiences since referral. There were also no differences between groups for concerns about personal breast cancer risk (t(69) = -0.705, P = 0.483). No significant differences were found between the 'letter' and 'interview' group for the subscores of the General Health Questionnaire.</P>
<P>In terms of satisfaction with the risk communication process, the mean scores in the letter group ranged from 'quite satisfied' to 'very satisfied'. Although for five items the group who received their assessment face-to-face expressed significantly higher levels of satisfaction than those who received their assessment via letter (P value range 0.020 to 0.001).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:21:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>All eight studies involved the process of risk assessment for familial breast cancer focusing on the psychosocial impact on patients, as well as looking at other outcomes and aspects of service delivery. Improvements in psychological well-being and a decrease in the levels of cancer worry were found in most studies. <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK> reported an overall decrease in anxiety and <LINK REF="STD-Fry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fry 2003</LINK> demonstrated a decrease in the proportion of patients suffering case-level psychological distress. <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004</LINK> also reported a decrease in depressive symptoms over-time. <LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 2005</LINK> reported a small non-significant decrease in anxiety as measured by the HADS. However, state anxiety levels increased in both groups from baseline to post-intervention and had not returned to baseline levels at the three-month follow-up. It is important to note that the higher levels of psychological distress in the participants who withdrew from the <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fry 2003</LINK> trials compared with those who remained in the trial, may have had an impact on the results. <LINK REF="STD-Young-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2006</LINK> only reported outcomes at one time point, three months after participants had received their 'lower risk' information via letter or in a face-to-face interview. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of cancer worry, adverse and positive effects of receiving risk information, concerns about breast cancer risk and general psychological health. However, it is unknown whether there were any changes in any of the outcomes over time due to the lack of baseline data.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2006</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Matloff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matloff 2006</LINK> reported an overall reduction in participants' perceived risk of breast cancer. Similarly <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK> reported an overall reduction in perceived risk; however <LINK REF="REF-Brain-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brain 2002</LINK> did report significant differences across the differing risk categories. Overall, those at high risk had a slightly higher perceived risk than those at low and moderate risk, and while levels of risk perception for those at low and moderate risk decreased over time, no changes in perceived risk were observed among high-risk participants. In both the intervention and control study groups, risk perceptions of those at low and moderate risk again decreased over time. However, risk perceptions of those at high risk in the intervention group increased over time whereas risk perceptions of those at high risk in the control group marginally decreased over time. <LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 2005</LINK> reported increased accuracy of breast cancer risk in both groups. Whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK>, participants' risk perceptions decreased in both counselling groups and increased in the control group from baseline to follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Fry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fry 2003</LINK> reported an overall improvement in subjective understanding of breast cancer genetic risk. <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK> looked at changes in participants' knowledge of hereditary breast cancer, reporting a significant increase over-time. <LINK REF="STD-Fry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fry 2003</LINK> reported an improvement in objective understanding of breast cancer and mammography across all groups and all risk categories. <LINK REF="STD-Young-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2006</LINK> found that women who received their low-risk information face-to-face perceived their risk to be slightly higher than those who were informed by a letter only. Both groups appeared to be uncertain of their risk level at the three-month follow-up in terms of lifetime risk estimates of breast cancer but there were no significant differences between the two groups.</P>
<P>In terms of health behaviours, <LINK REF="STD-Fry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fry 2003</LINK> found proportionately more patients in the control group examining their breasts on a monthly basis, and proportionately more women in the intervention group examining their breasts more than once a month. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK> found no differences between groups in terms of breast health intentions. <LINK REF="STD-Matloff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matloff 2006</LINK> found no differences between groups in menopausal therapy decisions or use of menopausal therapy. Genetic testing beliefs and intentions were explored in <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK>. Awareness of and interest in genetic testing increased more in the intervention group than the control group in <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2006</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK>, genetic testing intention scores increased in the control group and decreased in both counselling groups.</P>
<P>Positive reactions to counselling and high satisfaction with the service were found in many studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matloff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matloff 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK> found that those at high risk reported less instrumental satisfaction than those at moderate and low risk, and those at moderate risk were less satisfied than those at low risk. Participants in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 2005</LINK> were significantly more satisfied with the nurse counselling than the GRACE computerised risk assessment. There also appeared to be no differences in satisfaction between telephone and in-person risk counselling, except women in the in-person counselling group felt more able to talk about their concerns (<LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Young-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2006</LINK>, participants in the face-to-face interview group expressed significantly higher levels of satisfaction with the process of receiving their risk information for five out of the twelve items than those who received their risk information via letter. However, mean satisfaction scores in the letter group indicated that they were satisfied with the process.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:21:23 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>This review suggests that there are benefits to receiving a specialist cancer genetic risk assessment in that it can help to reduce psychological distress and worry about breast cancer, and improve the accuracy of perceived risk about breast cancer, while helping to increase knowledge of breast cancer and genetics. Although there is some fluctuation in these outcomes among individuals when measured at different time points, this review found no evidence to suggest that undergoing cancer genetic risk assessment for breast cancer causes any harm to the psychological well-being of patients, although this was not followed up for any longer than nine months. Further longitudinal research is needed to assess long-term effects, particularly since the cancer genetics journey can involve many genetic counselling sessions and a protracted period of waiting for the results of genetic testing. Some of the included studies in this review only explored the impact of cancer genetic risk assessment on women at average or moderate risk of breast cancer. As those at high risk of cancer were sometimes shown to have different outcomes to those at lower risk (<LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fry 2003</LINK>), some caution is warranted when generalising the conclusions of this review to high-risk groups. This review also indicates that patients are generally satisfied with genetic counselling with the type of health professional delivering the risk assessment, having minimal impact on the observed outcomes. High patient satisfaction was reported in all included studies. It is worth noting that <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK> found a small significant effect related to venue with those participants seen outside the traditional hospital setting reporting greater satisfaction than those seen in a hospital-based setting. This suggests that further research as to the best location of cancer genetic service delivery is warranted. Also this review suggests that patients report slightly higher levels of satisfaction with face-to-face communication of genetic risk compared with a computer programme, telephone counselling or receiving risk assessment via a letter.</P>
<P>Demand for cancer genetic services is likely to increase particularly in light of the discovery of new cancer predisposing genes and greater public and media awareness. Consequently cancer genetic services will experience increases in referrals from people concerned about their family history of breast cancer. Escalating demand, coupled with limited resources, make it important for cancer genetic clinics to deliver a consistently high quality service for every new patient referred. This updated review only identified three studies that compared alternative means of service delivery over face-to-face contact (<LINK REF="REF-Braithwaite-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braithwaite 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helmes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Helmes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2006</LINK>). This review found no randomised trials assessing the impact of genetic consultations via telemedicine, which studies show could help meet the increasing demand for specialist genetic services and be a cost-effective alternative to consultations in clinic (<LINK REF="REF-Lea-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lea 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meropol-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meropol 2011</LINK>). Those studies that do exist focus on establishing the validity of services through pilot projects and feasibility studies rather than comparing alternative means of delivery. This review found no RCTs that compared the duration or frequency of counselling sessions for breast cancer. Also interventions did not include any substitution of place, person or procedure at the time of the review. This review also highlights the need for trials of cancer genetic risk assessment to examine decision-making about cancer screening behaviours and genetic testing at all risk levels as additional outcome measures.</P>

<P>For cancer genetic risk assessment it is not possible to blind participants and clinicians to the treatment arm. Randomisation was generally adequate, although methods of allocation concealment were often not specified in the studies included in this review. Many of the included trials did not report on the characteristics of participants drop-outs or state reasons for withdrawal. As shown in <LINK REF="STD-Brain-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Brain 2000a</LINK>, participants who decline from cancer genetic risk assessment may have high levels of anxiety and therefore attrition bias should be assessed where possible in similar trials.</P>

<P>Results from this review are similar to that of a review of cancer genetic counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Braithwaite-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braithwaite 2004</LINK>), which showed improvements in cancer knowledge after genetic counselling but no long-term increases in anxiety, cancer worry or depression. The impact of genetic counselling on risk perception was less clear, with some studies reporting no change in risk perception while others report significant differences before and after counselling. Other studies have also reported patient high satisfaction with genetic counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Bober-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bober 2007</LINK>) and satisfaction is generally comparable for face-to-face counselling and remote counselling via telephone or videoconferencing (<LINK REF="REF-Coehlo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coehlo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gray-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2000a</LINK>). However, these reviews and studies tend to focus on the psychological impact of genetic counselling and, to our knowledge, there are no other reviews of the impact of cancer genetic risk assessment for familial breast cancer.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:21:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:21:27 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review suggests that cancer genetic risk assessment is beneficial for patients at risk of familial breast cancer. However, more studies are required to assess the best means of delivering these services by different health professionals and in alternative locations, through a variety of interventions. We acknowledge that cancer genetic services are delivered differently within different healthcare systems, with varying ways for patients to access those services. In some cases, patients may have previously purchased additional services, such as genetic tests, which may further affect how services are delivered. This however does not negate the fact that risk-assessment services delivered to patients can be examined in standardised ways through the use of rigorous methods such as RCTs.</P>
<P>This review suggests that many patients are satisfied with the existence of cancer genetic risk-assessment services. Nevertheless, as cancer genetics has become more common and the inherited components of other diseases are elucidated, evaluation rigour will have to improve and pilot studies and exploratory projects will no longer be sufficient. The challenge for cancer genetic services is to develop services that adequately reassure inappropriately worried individuals (who are still at average risk) and to identify those at moderate and potentially high risk who require further information, management and support. Involving patients in these processes will be crucial.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-11 15:21:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Despite the differences in the provision of cancer genetic services in different countries, more research is needed into the effectiveness and efficiency of these services. There is much more to cancer genetic services than simply assessing patients' risk for a genetic predisposition to developing familial cancer. Therefore, the full scope of cancer genetic services and patient journeys through these services needs to be examined, including decisions to undertake predictive genetic testing and the impact on other decision-making such as the uptake of preventive measures such as prophylactic surgery. More research is also needed looking at how risk is presented (i.e. verbal, numerical, graphical), the duration of, where and how risk assessment takes place (e.g. face-to-face or videoconferencing), the availability of, and types of support or after care, or both, and the type of information which is available to patients. However as the full range of services is unlikely to be examined in one RCT, this will require a meta-analysis of prospective studies. In the current review, many studies only included patients at average or moderate risk of breast cancer.The impact of cancer genetic risk assessment for those at high risk is an important area for further research, as these women are generally eligible for genetic testing and may have the option for increased screening or prophylactic surgery, or both.Patient preferences, as well as the psychological impact of all aspects of cancer genetic services on patients should be measured, as should the acceptability of these services to healthcare professionals. A genetic predisposition is something that an individual carries for the duration of their lifetime; hence there is a need for longitudinal studies to reflect this.</P>

<PUBLIC_NOTES>
<P>While it was our original intention - as stated in the protocol - to evaluate all aspects of cancer genetic service delivery, we soon discovered it was beyond the scope of this review to look at more than one aspect of cancer genetic service delivery. As each stage brings with it a potentially unique set of issues and concerns, we have chosen to focus just on genetic risk assessment.</P>

<P>At both baseline and the first follow-up, participants' perceived risk was significantly higher in the high-risk group compared with the low- and moderate- risk groups. A significant reduction in perceived risk of breast cancer was found for those in both the intervention (mean = 7.29/6.44) and the control (mean = 7.33/6.62) groups (95% CI -0.21 to 0.08). Perceived risk from immediate post-clinic assessment to the follow-up at 9 months significantly increased; however the perceived risk at the 9-month follow-up was still significantly lower than at baseline, regardless of group allocation.</P>
<P>Anxiety significantly decreased from baseline to assessment immediately after clinic (intervention: mean = 35.93/34.33; control: mean = 35.54/33.14; 95% CI -0.75 to 1.41), and then significantly increased at 9 months (intervention: mean = 36.38; control: mean = 35.18; 95% CI -0.85 to 1.98), although this increase did not exceed baseline levels.</P>
<P>There was a significant decrease in cancer worry in both groups from baseline to post-clinic assessment (intervention: mean = 11.79/10.55; control: mean = 11.49/10.50; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.20) and from baseline to 9 months follow-up (intervention: mean = 10.55; control: mean = 10.63; 95% CI -0.59 to 0.05); the decrease from post-clinic assessment to 9-month follow-up was not significant. Cancer worry decreased significantly for those at low and moderate risk (low risk: t(106) = 5.92, P &lt; 0.001; moderate risk: t(443) = 12.13, P &lt; 0.001) but not for those at high risk (t(98) = 1.67, P = 0.10) (95% CI -0.88 to 2.35).</P>
