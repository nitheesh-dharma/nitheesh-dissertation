<P>Quinine given through the rectum may be as effective as intravenous and intramuscular quinine for treating uncomplicated <I>Plasmodium falciparum </I>malaria.

Administration of intrarectal quinine (made less acidic by adjustment to a pH of 4.5) is significantly less painful than intramuscular injection of quinine.

The trials reporting on these outcomes were small, which resulted in large confidence intervals for all outcomes apart from duration of hospitalization. One large trial (898 children) reported that intrarectal was less painful than intramuscular administration.</P>

<P>We detected no difference in the effect on parasites and clinical illness for intrarectal quinine, but most trials were small. Pain may be less with intrarectal proprietary, buffered quinine preparations (made less acidic by adjustment of the pH to 4.5).

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-04 10:52:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> malaria often causes serious illness, and occurs mainly in Africa, South-East Asia, and South America. It is estimated that 300 to 500 million episodes of clinical malaria and more than one million deaths occur in children aged less than five years in Africa every year (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Uncomplicated malarial illness is usually treated with drugs given orally (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Vomiting is a prominent feature in 30 to 50 per cent of people with <I>P. falciparum </I>malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Piarroux-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piarroux 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kortepeter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kortepeter 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anothay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anothay 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sowunmi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sowunmi 2000</LINK>). People who present to hospital with severe malaria or persistent vomiting (regardless of severity of disease) require other routes of administration, sometimes by intravenous infusion (into a blood vessel), intramuscular injection (direct into the muscle) (<LINK REF="REF-White-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1982</LINK>), or via the nasogastric route (tube from the nose to the stomach). These different routes of administration require trained staff and equipment, which may be in short supply in low-income and middle-income countries.</P>
<P>Despite emerging resistance to commonly used drugs, such as chloroquine and mefloquine, the malaria parasites remain sensitive to quinine in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Bjorkman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorkman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jelinek-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jelinek 1995</LINK>). In some parts of South-East Asia, however, decreasing sensitivity to quinine has been detected (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although intramuscular injection is the most common route of quinine administration used in low-income and middle-income countries, adverse effects have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Barennes-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barennes 1999a</LINK>). In some of these countries, it is the most common cause of lower limb paralysis when given mistakenly into the sciatic nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Carayon-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carayon 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bourrel-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourrel 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barennes-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 1993</LINK>). Other reported harmful effects of intramuscular quinine injections are bacterial and viral infections including tetanus (<LINK REF="REF-Yen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yen 1994</LINK>), poliomyelitis (<LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 1992</LINK>), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (<LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoelscher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoelscher 1994</LINK>). Intramuscular injection involves causing pain repeatedly with each dose, and venepuncture for establishing intravenous access is painful and may have to be repeated. A less painful and safer alternative to intravenous and intramuscular administration is therefore worth evaluating.</P>
<P>The intrarectal route has been used to give quinine (<LINK REF="STD-Barennes-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 1996a</LINK>). Health workers with minimal training can give intrarectal quinine to people who are either vomiting or comatose. This provides early treatment of the illness and is one of the strategies of the World Health Organization initiative 'Roll Back Malaria' (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2002</LINK>). However, disadvantages of using the intrarectal route are local irritation, diarrhoea, and expulsion of the medication (<LINK REF="STD-Barennes-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 1999b</LINK>). The likelihood of intrarectal irritation has been reduced by the development of less acidic quinine gluconate (in Quinimax), which is adjusted to a pH of 4.5. People may also reject suppositories and other intrarectal formulations in preference for the intramuscular route because injections are perceived as a more effective treatment, particularly in people who are seriously ill (<LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review summarizes existing trials that compare the effectiveness and safety of intrarectal quinine with other routes of administration in people with malaria caused by <I>P. falciparum</I>.</P>

<P>The search strategy identified 19 potentially relevant studies.

<P>The trials recruited children up to 15 years of age who were hospital inpatients in Burkina Faso (three trials), Niger (five trials), Togo (one trial), or Uganda (one trial). The trials' inclusion criteria included the degree of parasitaemia (six trials), vomiting (five trials), and disease severity (three trials). Different exclusion criteria were used: diarrhoea (all trials); treatment with antimalarial drugs before admission (nine trials); other documented causes of fever (six trials); and forms of severe malaria (six trials).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial comparisons</HEADING>
<P>We grouped the trials according to whether they compared intrarectal with intravenous or intramuscular quinine.</P>
<P>Seven trials (397 children) compared intrarectal with intravenous quinine.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-04 10:58:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight out of the 10 trials that met the inclusion criteria included less than 80 participants. This small number of participants increased the probability of missing a clinically important difference between groups. Neither data from individual trials nor pooled data were able to prove equivalence of intrarectal quinine with other modes of administration. To demonstrate equivalence for the outcome mortality with a difference in mortality of 2% as a range of equivalence and 8% mortality with a power of 80% and a two-sided 95% CI for the difference in mortality, a sample size of at least 3893 would be required in each group. For an equivalence trial with coma recovery time of four hours as range of equivalence and 12 hours as standard deviation, at least 189 participants would be required in each group to demonstrate equivalence with 80% power and a 95% CI for the difference (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenhut-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenhut 2008</LINK>). A lack of a power calculation may have led to small trial sizes. Only for the outcomes of death, fever clearance time, and mild diarrhoea (an adverse event) were there two or more trials available for a meta-analysis. Only three of the trials documented the use of adequate randomization; adequate randomization was particularly important because blinding of participant and carer was not possible. This has increased the risk of a selection bias. All but one trial were conducted with participation of one author, H Barennes. The only pharmaceutical company producing a intrarectal quinine preparation, Quinimax, sponsored six of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barennes-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barennes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barennes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pussard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pussard 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barennes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Achan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Achan 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference between intrarectal and parenteral quinine administration in terms of death, course of <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria, or diarrhoea. Intrarectal administration also had the benefit of being less painful.</P>
<P>Parasite clearance time was longer in participants given intrarectal quinine as compared with intramuscular treatment in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Barennes-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 1995</LINK>). More participants in the intramuscular quinine group had cleared their parasites compared with the intrarectal group (<LINK REF="STD-Pussard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pussard 2004</LINK>). Parasite clearance was not different when intrarectal administration was compared with intravenous administration in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Barennes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 1998</LINK>), and parasite clearance by 48 hours was not different between intrarectal and intravenous groups in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pussard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pussard 2004</LINK>). These discrepancies may have arisen by chance because of the small trial sizes, and in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Barennes-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 1995</LINK>) parasite clearance time may have been shorter in the intramuscular group because parasitaemia was higher at baseline in the intrarectal group.</P>
<P>We observed statistically significant heterogeneity when analysing the mild diarrhoea adverse event outcome. This may have been due to different definitions of diarrhoea, which was only clearly defined in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Barennes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 2006</LINK>), and the large weight attributed in the meta-analysis to one small trial in which two out of five participants in the control group were affected (<LINK REF="STD-Barennes-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 1995</LINK>). Persistent pain at the injection site due to inflammation with the recurrence of fever seemed to be common with intramuscular injection and is an adverse effect not observed with the intrarectal route. It has to be taken into consideration in the design of future trials comparing the two modes of administration. The occurrence of rectal mucosal ulcerations with intrarectal administration and its significance should also be assessed in all future trials. Adverse effects unique to the methods of intramuscular administration (sciatic nerve injury, infections with other viral and bacterial pathogens through contaminated needles) or intravenous injection (infections) are absent in intrarectal administration and cannot be addressed in a trial setting where administration is performed by trained personnel with adequate supply of consumables.</P>
<P>Future systematic reviews need to address whether other antimalarial drugs like artemisinin derivatives are comparable in effectiveness administered rectally compared to intravenous or intramuscular applications in severe malaria in all age groups.</P>
<P>The trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria for this review included only children, and the results may therefore not be equally applicable to adults.</P>
<P>Only three small, randomized controlled trials (245 children) that included participants with severe malaria compared intrarectal with intravenous (<LINK REF="STD-Barennes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Achan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Achan 2007</LINK>) or intramuscular treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Barennes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barennes 2001</LINK>). Limited data are therefore available on the effectiveness of intrarectal quinine in life-threatening forms of malaria.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-11-06 15:58:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No differences in effectiveness with intrarectal administration has been detected in this review, and the intrarectal route is associated with less pain than parenteral administration one trial. Thus intrarectal application may be preferred for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children in cases in which administration of antimalarial drugs by mouth is not possible. There is insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of intrarectal quinine in severe <I>P. falciparum </I>malaria in children.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-06 15:59:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To investigate this further would require large-scale randomized controlled trials, with adequate methods to conceal allocation to investigate intrarectal quinine in severe <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria in children and in all forms of <I>P. falciparum </I>malaria in adults. Such trials need to be adequately powered by use of a sample size calculation based on key outcomes including mortality. Ongoing studies evaluating artemisinin derivatives in severe malaria need to be considered as they may be potential comparators. Further trials should focus on adverse effects including short-term and long-term effects on the rectal mucosa with intrarectal administration. Persistent pain at the injection site due to inflammation with the recurrence of fever seemed to be common with intramuscular injection and is an adverse effect not observed with the intrarectal route. It has to be taken into consideration in the design of future trials comparing the two modes of administration.Trials investigating the use of intrarectal quinine in the primary care setting, its role in preventing hospital admission, and early treatment in the community preventing complications associated with late presentation at healthcare facilities are also desirable, although the results of the forthcoming trial of artemisinin derivatives to prevent severe malaria developing will need to be considered in planning these studies.</P>

<P>2005, Issue 1 (first review version): We used the term 'parasitaemia' in the 'Types of outcomes' in the protocol to encompass commonly used outcomes describing the presence of parasites in trial participants. We changed this to the more specific term 'parasite clearance' in the review because this is the most commonly used outcome in trials and hence the most useful outcome category for the review.</P>
