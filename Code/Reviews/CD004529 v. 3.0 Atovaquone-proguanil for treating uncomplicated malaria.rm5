<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Atovaquone-proguanil appears to be more effective than individual drugs for treating uncomplicated malaria, but there are few data comparing atovaquone-proguanil to other combination therapies</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Many conventional treatments for uncomplicated malaria are failing because malaria parasites develop resistance to them. This can be reduced by treating people with combination drugs such as atovaquone-proguanil. The review found 10 trials, most of low methodological quality and most funded by a single pharmaceutical company. In addition, trials were small and had few participants thus evidence suggesting atovaquone-proguanil as more effective than a number of single drug treatments at eliminating the <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> malaria parasite from the blood was limited. There were few good quality data comparing atovaquone-proguanil with other new combination therapies. There were not enough data to assess adverse events, but all trials recorded some adverse events.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Many conventional treatments for uncomplicated malaria are failing because malaria parasites develop resistance to them. One way to combat this resistance is to treat people with a combination of drugs, such as atovaquone-proguanil.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare atovaquone-proguanil with other antimalarial drugs (alone or in combination) for treating children and adults with uncomplicated <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> malaria.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (June 2005), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2005), EMBASE (1980 to June 2005), LILACS (1982 to June 2005), reference lists, and conference abstracts. We also contacted relevant pharmaceutical manufacturers and researchers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing atovaquone-proguanil with other antimalarial drugs for treating children and adults confirmed to have uncomplicated <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-12 12:33:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias in the trials, and extracted data for an intention-to-treat analysis (where possible). We used risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. We contacted trial authors for additional information where needed.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Ten trials, with a total of 2345 participants, met the inclusion criteria. The trials were conducted in four geographical regions and were often small, but they included comparisons across eight drugs. Nine trials were funded by a pharmaceutical company, only three carried out an intention-to-treat analysis, and allocation concealment was unclear in seven. Atovaquone-proguanil had fewer treatment failures by day 28 than chloroquine (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.57; 27 participants, 1 trial), amodiaquine (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.36; 342 participants, 2 trials), and mefloquine (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.73; 158 participants, 1 trial). There were insufficient data to draw a conclusion for this outcome from comparisons with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (172 participants, 2 trials), halofantrine (205 participants, 1 trial), artesunate plus mefloquine (1063 participants, 1 trial), quinine plus tetracycline (154 participants, 1 trial), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine-trimethoprim-primaquine (161 participants, 1 trial). Adverse events were mainly common symptoms of malaria and did not differ in frequency between groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Data are limited but appear to suggest that atovaquone-proguanil is more effective than chloroquine, amodiaquine, and mefloquine. There are insufficient data for comparisons against sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, halofantrine, artesunate plus mefloquine, quinine plus tetracycline, and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine-trimethoprim-primaquine in treating malaria. There are not enough data to assess safety, but a number of adverse events were identified with all drugs. Large trials comparing atovaquone-proguanil with other new combination therapies are needed.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-07 21:39:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Malaria is a parasitic, mosquito-borne disease that causes about 300 million clinical cases and more than one million deaths each year (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). Young children, pregnant women, and non-immune people who move into endemic regions are most vulnerable. Over 90% of deaths occur in children under five years of age living in sub-Saharan Africa (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). The associated economic burden of the disease means malaria is a significant impediment to human development in poor countries, where it accounts for 40% of public health expenditure, 30% to 50% of inpatient admissions, and up to 50% of outpatient visits (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are four species in the genus <I>Plasmodium</I> that cause malaria in humans: falciparum, malariae, vivax, and ovale. <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> accounts for 93% of all cases in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2005</LINK>). Falciparum malaria can present as uncomplicated or severe forms. Uncomplicated malaria is diagnosed when the plasmodium parasite is seen in the blood and the person has fever (&gt; 37.5 °C) and any of the following symptoms: headache, chills and rigors, general weakness, joint or muscle weakness, abdominal pain, and vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). The disease is said to have progressed to severe malaria when, in addition to the above clinical features, the person also develops a life-threatening complication such as anaemia (low haemoglobin concentration), convulsions, hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar), or cerebral malaria (malaria with altered level of consciousness or coma) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Malaria treatment is complicated by the ability of the parasites to develop resistance to antimalarial drugs. Many antimalarial drugs are no longer effective at treating malaria when used alone (monotherapy). For example, 30% of people have chloroquine-resistant malaria in Uganda (<LINK REF="REF-Kamya-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamya 2002</LINK>). One way in which this resistance manifests is through recrudescence, which is the re-appearance of the same parasite that had been treated earlier. Recrudesced parasites can be distinguished from new ones using a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Distinguishing new infections from treated infections can help researchers measure the effectiveness of an antimalarial drug (<LINK REF="REF-Brockman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brockman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohrt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohrt 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a need for safe and effective new therapies to treat malaria. Atovaquone-proguanil (brand name Malarone) is a combination therapy used to treat multiple-drug-resistant malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Blanchard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sabchareon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabchareon 1998</LINK>), or prevent it (<LINK REF="REF-Overbosch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overbosch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sukwa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sukwa 1999</LINK>). In combination therapy, two or more drugs with independent modes of action and different biochemical targets in the parasite are used together. This delays the development of resistance to the component drugs thereby prolonging the life span of still effective antimalarial drugs. Combination therapies are recommended for malaria contracted in areas where there is resistance to multiple antimalarial drugs (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2001a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Atovaquone-proguanil may be taken as a fixed-dose combination or as the individual drugs co-administered together. The fixed-dose combination (Malarone) contains 250 mg atovaquone and 100 mg proguanil hydrochloride per adult strength tablet and 62.5 mg atovaquone and 25 mg proguanil hydrochloride per child strength tablet. Atovaquone is a synthetic hydroxynaphthoquinone that inhibits mitochondrial electron transport in the parasite (<LINK REF="REF-Fry-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fry 1992</LINK>). It is a compound with a high affinity for lipids, and its rate and extent of absorption is increased by dietary fat. It is highly protein bound (&gt; 99%) and is predominantly eliminated unchanged through faeces. The elimination half life is two to three days in adults and one to two days in children (<LINK REF="REF-Beerahee-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beerahee 1999</LINK>). Proguanil is a biguanide derivative that works by inhibiting the parasite's dihydrofolic reductase enzyme via a cyclic triazine metabolite (cycloguanil) (<LINK REF="REF-Dollery-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dollery 1991</LINK>). Proguanil is partially metabolized and partially excreted in urine. The excretion of its principal metabolite, cycloguanil, is also through urine. Both have elimination half lives of 12 to 15 hours in adults and children, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Beerahee-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beerahee 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The combination of atovaquone-proguanil appears to act synergistically (<LINK REF="REF-Canfield-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canfield 1995</LINK>), that is each constituent potentiates the effect of the other against the plasmodium parasite, thereby facilitating its role in the treatment of drug-resistant malaria. When used alone, either individual agent is associated with high numbers of treatment failures. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Looareesuwan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Looareesuwan 1996</LINK> studied 317 people with uncomplicated malaria in Thailand and showed failure rates of 33% when atovaquone was used alone. But when combined with proguanil, treatment failure was less than 3% (<LINK REF="REF-Looareesuwan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Looareesuwan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sabchareon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabchareon 1998</LINK>). However, there are concerns that high failure rates for atovaquone may ultimately affect the useful lifespan of atovaquone-proguanil if it is used widely (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Vugt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Van Vugt 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse effects associated with atovaquone-proguanil include abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, diarrhoea, headache, and cough (<LINK REF="REF-Looareesuwan-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Looareesuwan 1999b</LINK>). Neuropsychiatric effects, such as strange and vivid dreams, insomnia, dizziness and vertigo, anxiety, and depression, have also been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Hogh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogh 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Overbosch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overbosch 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Atovaquone-proguanil is an expensive antimalarial drug, costing US$42 for an adult treatment dose (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2001b</LINK>). Due to its effectiveness against malaria resistant to first-line therapies, the manufacturers GlaxoSmithKline decided to donate one million doses of the drug for the management of uncomplicated malaria in poor countries where first-line therapies have failed (Malarone Donation Programme). The impact and consequences of this programme have been hotly debated (<LINK REF="REF-Bloland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foege-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foege 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oyediran-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oyediran 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ringwald-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ringwald 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shretta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shretta 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shretta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shretta 2001</LINK>). It was discontinued in September 2001 following the pilot phase, which ran for two and a half years in Kenya and Uganda, due to the conclusion that it would not be an efficient or effective use of malaria resources (<LINK REF="REF-Oyediran-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oyediran 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Partnerships-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partnerships 2002</LINK>). This review evaluates the reported evidence on the effectiveness and safety of atovaquone-proguanil. It also aims to help policy makers make an informed choice of antimalarial for treating uncomplicated <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria.</P>

<P>Once we had included all the trials in the primary analysis, we intended to conduct sensitivity analyses for each of the methodological quality factors. However, this was not possible as there were not enough data for a meaningful analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial selection</HEADING>
<P>We identified 11 trials of which 10 fulfilled our inclusion criteria. These are described below and detailed in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'. We excluded one trial because the protocol was amended after 40 participants had been recruited so that participants in the comparator group received chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine instead of the original chloroquine (<LINK REF="STD-Bustos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bustos 1999</LINK>). We also excluded 533 participants from <LINK REF="STD-Van-Vugt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Van Vugt 2002</LINK> because they received a combination of atovaquone-proguanil and artesunate, but this did not upset randomization of the trial.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>There were 2345 participants aged three months to 70 years in the 10 trials. Two trials recruited only children (<LINK REF="STD-Anabwani-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anabwani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borrmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borrmann 2003</LINK>), and three recruited only adults (<LINK REF="STD-Bouchaud-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchaud 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Alencar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">De Alencar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Giao 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Atovaquone-proguanil</HEADING>
<P>Atovaquone and proguanil were given in a daily dose of 1000 mg and 400 mg respectively for three days in all except three trials, which recruited children. One trial used a fixed combination containing 62.5 mg atovaquone and 25 mg proguanil hydrochloride (<LINK REF="STD-Borrmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borrmann 2003</LINK>). In the other two trials, participants received doses of 15 to 20 mg/kg atovaquone and 8 mg/kg proguanil (<LINK REF="STD-Anabwani-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anabwani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Vugt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Van Vugt 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Control drugs</HEADING>
<P>One trial used chloroquine (<LINK REF="STD-Llanos_x002d_Cuentas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Llanos-Cuentas 2001</LINK>). This trial's protocol was amended and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine replaced chloroquine after 25 participants were recruited because the cure rate was 8% with chloroquine; it was unclear if the amendment was a result of a formal pre-planned measure. The comparator drugs in the other trials were amodiaquine (<LINK REF="STD-Borrmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borrmann 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Radloff-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Radloff 1996</LINK>), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (<LINK REF="STD-Mulenga-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mulenga 1999</LINK>), quinine plus tetracycline (<LINK REF="STD-De-Alencar-1997" TYPE="STUDY">De Alencar 1997</LINK>), halofantrine (<LINK REF="STD-Anabwani-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anabwani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bouchaud-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchaud 2000</LINK>), mefloquine (<LINK REF="STD-Looareesuwan-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Looareesuwan 1999a</LINK>), artesunate plus mefloquine (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Vugt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Van Vugt 2002</LINK>), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine-trimethoprim-primaquine (<LINK REF="STD-Giao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Giao 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All ten trials reported results for treatment failure on or by day 28, parasite clearance and fever clearance times, and adverse events. Two trials used PCR to separate new infections from recrudescence (<LINK REF="STD-Borrmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borrmann 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Vugt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Van Vugt 2002</LINK>), but the PCR findings for <LINK REF="STD-Borrmann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borrmann 2003</LINK> were not reported in the publication, and consequently we were unable to include them in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Giao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Giao 2004</LINK> reported on recrudescence without genotyping based on the assumption that, due to low transmission rates, recrudescence during the first two weeks was more likely than reinfection. <LINK REF="STD-Mulenga-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mulenga 1999</LINK> reported the outcome progression to severe disease.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Length of follow up</HEADING>
<P>Eight trials followed up participants to day 28, one to day 35 (<LINK REF="STD-Bouchaud-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchaud 2000</LINK>), and one to day 42 (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Vugt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Van Vugt 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Giao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Giao 2004</LINK> followed a subset of 92 participants up to 56 days.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Drug resistance</HEADING>
<P>Chloroquine resistance was reported in three study areas (<LINK REF="STD-Llanos_x002d_Cuentas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Llanos-Cuentas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulenga-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mulenga 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Radloff-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Radloff 1996</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-07 21:39:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review set out to assess the effectiveness and safety of atovaquone-proguanil compared with other antimalarial drugs (used alone or in combination) for treating children and adults with confirmed uncomplicated <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria. Many conventional therapies for malaria are failing because malaria parasites are developing resistance to them. The main interest of this review was to determine whether the combination atovaquone-proguanil may be an effective and safe replacement.</P>
<P>Although over 2300 participants are included in the review, the comparisons are across eight different drugs and four geographical regions, thus statistical power to detect differences is low and generalizations are not possible. All the included trials followed up participants to day 28. However, it is now thought that patients receiving drugs with a half life of more than seven days, such as chloroquine (10 days) and mefloquine (10 to 40 days) should be followed up to day 42 (<LINK REF="REF-Stepniewska-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepniewska 2004</LINK>). The trial using artesunate plus mefloquine followed up participants to day 42, but the trial using chloroquine followed up participants to day 28. Few trials used PCR to determine cure rates and re-infection. Of the 10 included trials, seven had unclear methods of concealment, which allows potential for bias. Most of the trials reported data only for the participants deemed "evaluable" as per the protocol, usually those who completed the scheduled study period of 28 days. Only three trials carried out an intention-to-treat analysis, thus results may be subject to attrition bias.</P>
<P>Within the limitations described above, atovaquone-proguanil performed better than chloroquine, amodiaquine, and mefloquine in terms of treatment failure on or by day 28. However, data for only 25 participants treated with chloroquine were available. All other treatment comparisons, including those with other combination therapies (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, halofantrine, artesunate plus mefloquine, quinine plus tetracycline, and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine-trimethoprim-primaquine), found no difference in treatment failure on or by day 28. This may be partly due to the small size of the trials. In addition, one of the two halofantrine trials was conducted on non-immune participants who had contracted malaria from various endemic countries and their varying immune responses may be a contributory factor.</P>
<P>Atovaquone-proguanil cleared parasites faster than quinine plus tetracycline and mefloquine. However, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and halofantrine worked faster than atovaquone-proguanil at clearing parasites. These latter trials recruited fewer participants. No difference was found between atovaquone-proguanil and either chloroquine, amodiaquine, or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine-trimethoprim-primaquine in clearing parasites peripherally. It is worth noting that one of the two trials that used amodiaquine as a comparator reported parasite clearance time and fever clearance times as medians with ranges and thus did not form part of the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The fever clearance times exhibit a skewed distribution, thus some caution is required in the interpretation of the pooled mean differences as they do not form a good representation of the data. However, atovaquone-proguanil reduced fever quicker in comparison to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and quinine plus tetracycline; 22% (35/154) of the randomized participants were not included in the calculation of fever clearance time, which could be a potential source of bias. There was no difference in fever clearance time between atovaquone-proguanil and either chloroquine, amodiaquine, halofantrine, mefloquine, or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine-trimethoprim-primaquine. Clearance times for artesunate plus mefloquine have not been discussed since the data are not explicit; we are awaiting clarification from trialists and will include these data in a future update.</P>
<P>One participant treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine progressed from uncomplicated malaria to severe malaria with renal insufficiency that required dialysis. None of the recipients of atovaquone-proguanil developed this complication. Other adverse events were reported to be mostly typical of symptoms of malaria. Most of the trials reported the number of participants experiencing a particular event as a fraction of the total number of participants in that group.</P>
<P>Apart from the effectiveness of a drug, there are a number of other factors that should be taken into account when deciding which treatment to use. There are concerns that malaria parasites may quickly develop resistance to atovaquone-proguanil because resistance to atovaquone is already high (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Vugt-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Van Vugt 2002</LINK>). Consequently, this combination should be used with due consideration, and the emergence of any resistance should be closely monitored. Malaria burdens the developing world, which can least afford the therapies to combat the disease. Thus, the cost of malaria treatment is a crucial factor in adopting a therapy. Atovaquone-proguanil is expensive, and an objective cost-benefit analysis could assist clinicians to judge which antimalarial would most benefit each patient.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although the data are limited, in terms of treatment failure on or by day 28, atovaquone-proguanil performed better than chloroquine, amodiaquine, and mefloquine. There is insufficient data for comparisons against sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, halofantrine, artesunate plus mefloquine, quinine plus tetracycline, and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine-trimethoprim-primaquine. Hence knowledge about the performance of this drug in areas with multiple-drug resistance is limited. </P>
<P>Atovaquone-proguanil clears parasites quicker than mefloquine and quinine plus tetracycline, is comparable to chloroquine, amodiaquine, and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine-trimethoprim-primaquine, but slower than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and halofantrine. </P>
<P>There are not enough data to assess safety, but a number of adverse effects of all drugs were identified.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We recommend that trialists conduct large randomized controlled trials comparing atovaquone-proguanil with new combination therapies, and follow participants for at least 28 days (if the drug half life is less than seven days) or 42 days (if the drug half life is more than seven days). Allocation concealment should be achieved through reliable means, such as sealed envelopes. We stress that data at all time points should be kept on any randomized person (irrespective of whether they are withdrawn) to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. Vulnerable groups such as children under five years of age should also be considered for inclusion. </P>
<P>Trials should assess the safety and effectiveness of atovaquone-proguanil compared with existing best regimens for malaria, such as artemisinin-based combination therapies.</P>

<P>Trial protocol initially randomized participants to receive chloroquine or atovaquone-proguanil. However, after 40 participants had been recruited, the cure rate for chloroquine was found to be &lt; 35%, thus subsequent participants in the chloroquine arm were given sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in addition. This ultimately resulted in a 3-arm study. Participants in the atovaquone-proguanil arm at the time of the protocol amendment should have been separated from those who were recruited after the amendment in order to make the comparisons</P>
