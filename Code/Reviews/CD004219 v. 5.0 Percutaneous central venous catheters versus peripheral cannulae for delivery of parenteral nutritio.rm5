<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-25 04:04:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question: </B>In newborn infants receiving parenteral nutrition, does delivery into deep veins (via percutaneous central venous catheters) versus superficial veins (via peripheral cannulae) affect nutrition, growth and development, and adverse events including infection or skin damage?</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> Preterm or sick newborn infants are often fed with special nutrient solutions delivered directly into the veins. These solutions can be given into a superficial vein through standard, short (peripheral) cannulae or into a large deep vein via long (central) catheters.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>We found six small randomised controlled trials (enrolling 549 infants in total) that addressed this question. The trials generally were of good methodological quality, although study findings may be biased by the inability to blind caregivers and investigators to the type of intervention provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>These trials provided only limited evidence on the effects of the interventions on nutrition. Analysis of data from three trials revealed that infants in the percutaneous central venous catheter group needed about four fewer catheters or cannulae during hospitalisation. Combined data from all trials showed no evidence of an effect on risk of bloodstream infection.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions: </B>Use of central venous catheters has been thought to increase the risk of bloodstream infection in newborn infants, but this review of randomised trials found no evidence that this was the case. More trials are needed to determine which method is better for improving nutrition and growth and development in newborn infants.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-24 17:12:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neonatal parenteral nutrition may be delivered via peripheral cannulas or central venous catheters (umbilical or percutaneous). As the result of complications associated with umbilical catheters, many neonatal units prefer to use percutaneous catheters after initial stabilisation. Although they can be difficult to place, these catheters may be more stable than peripheral cannulae and require less frequent replacement. These delivery methods may be associated with different risks of adverse events, including acquired invasive infection and extravasation injury.</P>

<P>We found six trials recruiting a total of 549 infants.

Infants in the percutaneous central venous catheter group needed significantly fewer catheters/cannulae (MD -4.3, 95% CI -5.24, -3.43). Meta-analysis of data from all trials revealed no evidence of an effect on the incidence of invasive infection (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.25; typical risk difference (RD) -0.01, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-25 04:03:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from one small trial suggest that use of percutaneous central venous catheters to deliver parenteral nutrition increases nutrient input. The significance of this in relation to long-term growth and developmental outcomes is unclear. Three trials suggest that use of percutaneous central venous catheters decreases the number of catheters/cannulae needed to deliver nutrition. No evidence suggests that percutaneous central venous catheter use increases risks of adverse events, particularly invasive infection, although none of the included trials was large enough to rule out an effect on uncommon severe adverse events such as pericardial effusion.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-24 22:22:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-24 22:11:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Appropriate methods of feeding neonates vary with gestational age and clinical state. Some neonates, particularly those who are preterm or sick, are slow to tolerate the introduction of enteral feeds because of delayed gastric emptying and intestinal peristalsis. As early postnatal nutrition may affect important outcomes, including long-term neurodevelopment, these infants often receive parenteral (intravenous) nutrition during the period of establishment of enteral nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thureen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thureen 2001</LINK>). Parenteral nutrition may also be delivered during periods when enteral nutrition is not possible, as when maternal expressed breast milk is lacking or when feeding is specifically contraindicated because of gastrointestinal disease such as necrotising enterocolitis. As modern perinatal care has improved the survival rate of preterm and sick newborn infants, the number of infants who require prolonged parenteral nutrition has increased.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-09-24 22:21:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Parenteral nutrition usually consists of a glucose and electrolyte solution. More nutritionally complete formulations - "total parenteral nutrition" - can include an amino acid solution with minerals and vitamins, in addition to fat, as the principal non-protein energy source. Solutions are infused via short narrow-gauge peripheral venous cannulae or by means of longer central venous catheters that extend into larger veins such as the venae cavae (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trotter-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotter 1996</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Central venous catheters</HEADING>
<P>In neonatal practice, a central venous catheter is usually placed percutaneously for delivery of parenteral nutrition, although an umbilical venous or arterial catheter may also be used to deliver parenteral nutrition, particularly during the first week after birth. Surgical placement, in which a deep vein is surgically exposed before cannulation and for which the infant may require a general anaesthetic, is done less often. This review will focus on the specific comparison of percutaneous central venous catheters versus peripheral cannulae.</P>
<P>The most common complication associated with percutaneous central venous catheter use is nosocomial infection, which can include bacteraemia and invasive fungal infection. Micro-organisms can enter the bloodstream through the catheter entry site or, less commonly, via the catheter hub (<LINK REF="REF-Salzman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salzman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzman 1995</LINK>). Catheter-associated thrombosis can act as a nidus for infection (<LINK REF="REF-Thornburg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornburg 2008</LINK>). It is often necessary to remove the catheter to clear the infection (<LINK REF="REF-Karlowicz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlowicz 2002</LINK>). Reported incidences of catheter-related invasive infection in the neonatal intensive care unit vary from 5% to nearly 40%, depending on the precise criteria used to define catheter-related infection and the population studied (<LINK REF="REF-Hruszkewycz-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hruszkewycz 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neubauer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neubauer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garland-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohki-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohki 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2009</LINK>). Extremely low birth weight infants (birth weight &lt; 1000 g) are particularly at risk. Additional putative risk factors include prolonged use of parenteral nutrition and insertion of the catheter after the first week of life (<LINK REF="REF-Mahieu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahieu 2001</LINK>). However, it is uncertain whether percutaneous central venous catheter use further increases the risk of infection in an "at-risk" population (<LINK REF="REF-Sohn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sohn 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Invasive infection increases the risk of mortality and a range of important morbidities, including the need for intensive care and mechanical ventilation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, hepatic dysfunction and prolonged hospitalisation, and adds to the cost of neonatal care (<LINK REF="REF-Saint-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahieu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahieu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chapman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Payne-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams_x002d_Chapman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams-Chapman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hermans-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermans 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lahra-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lahra 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2013</LINK>). Bloodstream infection is associated with higher rates of several adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, long-term disability, vision and hearing impairment and cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bassler-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 2009</LINK>). Use of a percutaneous central venous catheter to deliver parenteral nutrition may be associated with iatrogenic injury, including embolism (air or thrombus) and infusate extravasation into tissue spaces. Cardiac tamponade following migration of the catheter tip to the pericardial space has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Darling-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darling 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Peripheral cannulae</HEADING>
<P>Although it may be technically easier to site peripheral cannulae than to site central venous catheters, peripheral cannulae are less stable and may require more frequent replacement. Once placed, a central venous catheter should remain <I>in situ</I> longer than a peripheral cannula, thus reducing the number of potentially painful procedures to which the infant is exposed (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1973</LINK>). The need for frequent replacement of a peripheral cannula might result in a significant cumulative period of interruption to the delivery of parenteral nutrition and in a nutrient deficit that can have long-term consequences for growth and development (<LINK REF="REF-Embleton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Embleton 2001</LINK>). Another concern with use of a peripheral cannula for delivering parenteral nutrition is the risk of extravasation injury. Subcutaneous infiltration of a hypertonic and irritant parenteral nutrition solution can cause local skin ulceration, secondary infection and scarring.<BR/>

<P> </P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-25 03:18:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found six randomised controlled trials that compared use of percutaneous central venous catheters versus peripheral cannulae for newborn infants who require parenteral nutrition. A total of 549 infants participated in these trials. Data from one trial suggest that use of percutaneous central venous catheters to deliver parenteral nutrition increases nutrient input. No trials assessed effects on growth nor long-term outcomes after hospital discharge. Three trials suggest that use of percutaneous central venous catheters decreases the numbers of catheters/cannulae needed to deliver nutrition. We found no evidence that percutaneous central venous catheter use increased the risk of adverse events, particularly invasive infection, although none of the included trials was large enough to rule out an effect on uncommon severe adverse events such as pericardial effusion.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-09-25 04:13:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one of the six trials assessed nutrient input. <LINK REF="STD-Ainsworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ainsworth 2001</LINK> found that infants randomly allocated to receive parenteral nutrition via peripheral cannulae had a statistically significantly higher nutritional deficit during the trial period when compared with infants who received nutrition via central venous catheters. The 7% difference in deficit, if accumulated over a period of one week, would result in loss of one-half of one day's nutrient requirements. The importance of this in relation to long-term growth and developmental outcomes is unclear. Nutritional deficits during this very critical period of brain growth may have adverse consequences for long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, when enteral nutrition is introduced, catch-up growth may compensate for deficiencies experienced during the early neonatal period.</P>
<P>All trials reported the incidence of invasive (bloodstream) bacterial or fungal infection. Meta-analysis revealed no statistically significant differences, but this finding should be interpreted with caution, as no trials blinded caregivers and investigators to the nature of the intervention, and surveillance bias may have affected results. However, the direction of this bias is more likely to have caused a relative overestimation of the risk of infection in the percutaneous central venous catheter group because clinicians may have had a lower threshold for investigating or diagnosing infection in these infants. This situation is further compounded by the difficulty associated with diagnosing true invasive infection versus contamination of blood cultures with skin commensal organisms. Reported infection rates in the central venous catheter group might have been artificially high, as clinicians, already more concerned about risks of infection, might have attributed symptoms to organisms isolated in contaminated cultures. Although they are frequently blamed for increasing risk of invasive bacterial or fungal infection, percutaneous central venous catheters are not the only pieces of 'plastic' used in the high-risk neonate that bypass the body's innate defences. A high proportion of infants with percutaneous central venous catheters have or have had endotracheal tubes, nasogastric tubes or peripheral cannulae, as well as an immature gastrointestinal mucosa, which predisposes them to infection. Results of this meta-analysis and of three non-randomised cohort studies suggest no significant differences between invasive infection rates among infants receiving parenteral nutrition via central venous catheter or via peripheral cannula (<LINK REF="STD-Cairns-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cairns 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parellada-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Parellada 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liossis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Liossis 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is thought that percutaneous central venous cannulae are more stable than peripheral cannulae and therefore need to be replaced less frequently. We found evidence for this advantage. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Annibale-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Annibale 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Janes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barria-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Barria 2007</LINK>) found that mean numbers of cannulae/catheters used were statistically significantly lower in the percutaneous central venous catheter group than in the peripheral cannula group. On average, infants needed about four fewer cannulae/catheters during the trial period. <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2007</LINK> reported the number of skin punctures required to maintain venous access. It is unclear whether these data show actual numbers of catheters or cannulae or whether they include 'failed' attempts. We need to obtain additional data from the lead investigator before we can assess whether this study should be included in future updates. Numbers of catheters/cannulae may indirectly reflect the number of painful procedures performed in these infants. However, it is not clear whether insertion of a catheter (usually through a larger-bore needle and technically more difficult) is more painful for the infant than is insertion of several peripheral cannulae over time. No study has specifically addressed the issue of pain, and none have used pain scores in this respect.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-09-25 03:31:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The numbers of infants in these studies were too small to permit conclusions regarding the effects of catheters or cannulae on serious clinical adverse effects such as extravasation injury and cardiac tamponade, although one such case was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Hosseini-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hosseini 2014</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Cartwright-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cartwright 2004</LINK> reported on use of 2186 catheters in one unit and found that, with careful adherence to policies for insertion, placement and aseptic precautions during times when the lines are accessed, percutaneous central venous catheters can be used safely to deliver parenteral nutrition in neonates.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-09-25 03:32:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our main concern with the review process is the possibility that findings may reflect publication bias and other reporting biases. We attempted to minimise this threat by screening the reference lists of included trials and related reviews and by searching the proceedings of major international perinatal conferences to identify trial reports that are not (or are not yet) published in full form in academic journals. The meta-analyses that we performed did not include a sufficient number of trials for exploration of symmetry of funnel plots as a means of identifying possible publication or reporting bias.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-09-25 03:33:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Limited data from one small trial suggest that use of a percutaneous central venous catheter rather than a peripheral cannula is associated with a statistically significant smaller deficit in delivered parenteral nutrition. Use of percutaneous central venous catheters resulted in fewer painful procedures (venepunctures) than were seen with peripheral cannula use. We found no evidence of increased risk of adverse effects, particularly invasive infection.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-09-25 03:35:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Additional large and adequately powered randomised controlled trials are needed to determine whether use of percutaneous central venous catheters rather than peripheral cannulae to deliver parenteral nutrition provides important benefits for newborn infants. Trials should examine the effects of this intervention on growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, particularly in very preterm infants for whom early nutritional intake may play an important role.</P>
