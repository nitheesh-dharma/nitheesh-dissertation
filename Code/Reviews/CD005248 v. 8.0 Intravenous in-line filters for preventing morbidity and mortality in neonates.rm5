<P>
<B>Review question</B>: Does the use of in-line filters on intravenous lines reduce morbidity and mortality in neonates?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>: Preterm or sick newborn infants are often fed with nutrients and fluids that are delivered directly into a vein. This intravenous delivery can be associated with infection, toxins released by bacteria, and tiny particles that may be in the fluids, such as rubber and plastic, going into the blood. In adults, placing a filter in the intravenous line has been reported to be effective in reducing such risks, and filters are increasingly being recommended for use in newborn infants.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>: The review authors searched the medical literature and identified four eligible studies that recruited a total of 704 newborns.</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings</B>: Septicaemia and illness, deaths or problems with the intravenous lines were no different with or without a filter.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>: There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of intravenous in-line filters to prevent morbidity and mortality in newborn infants.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-28 21:31:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous access is an essential part of caring for the sick neonate; however, problems associated with intravenous infusion therapy include contamination of fluids with bacteria, endotoxins and particulates (<LINK REF="REF-Bethune-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bethune 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infusion therapy carries a risk for catheter-associated septicaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geiss-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geiss 1992</LINK>). Infection can originate from the catheter tubing, the ports, at the cannula site or from contaminated infusion fluid. Factors cited as increasing the risk for catheter-related infection include type of intravenous fluid, for example total parenteral nutrition solutions or solutions with high concentrations of dextrose (<LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1996</LINK>). While not all infections lead to septicaemia, immunocompromised patients such as neonates, are at greater risk, and infection becomes a major problem (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 1989</LINK>). In adult patients, use of the bacterial retention filter lead to fewer clinically significant bacteremias (<LINK REF="REF-Quercia-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quercia 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Contamination of intravenous administration sets with gram-negative bacteria has been reported to lead to rapid proliferation of endotoxins (<LINK REF="REF-Bethune-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bethune 2001</LINK>). In adults, endotoxins have been implicated in several serious disease processes, including respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Parsons-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 1989</LINK>), septic shock (<LINK REF="REF-Glauser-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glauser 1991</LINK>), multiple organ failure, endotoxic shock, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Casale-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casale 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glauser-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glauser 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suffredini-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suffredini 1989a</LINK>). Cardiovascular changes such as increased heart rate, decreased vascular resistance and depressed left ventricular function (<LINK REF="REF-Suffredini-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suffredini 1989b</LINK>), and increased intestinal permeability (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Dwyer-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Dwyer 1988</LINK>) have also been reported. Periventricular leukomalacia is an ischaemic lesion of the periventricular white matter that is primarily seen in premature neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volpe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpe 2001</LINK>). Animal studies have demonstrated the development of periventricular leukomalacia in the brains of newborn kittens following injection of endotoxins (<LINK REF="REF-Gilles-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilles 1977</LINK>) and it has been postulated that endotoxins may be involved in the pathogenesis of a proportion of cases of periventricular leukomalacia in the human neonate (<LINK REF="REF-Volpe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpe 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Particulate matter may cause localised phlebitis (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1987</LINK>). The duration of cannulation has been found to contribute to the development of infusion-related phlebitis (<LINK REF="REF-Maki-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maki 1991</LINK>), and this may require the cannula to be replaced. Frequent cannula change is an added cost to treatment and may cause the patient pain and distress (<LINK REF="REF-Chee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chee 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse systemic effects of particulate matter including granulomata formation in the lung (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1987</LINK>) and ischaemic necrosis, are a common finding in necrotising enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Ballance-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballance 1990</LINK>). Garvan examined intravenous fluids available in Australia, England, Europe and the United States of America for the presence of particulates. Microscopic analysis found rubber particles, crystals, cellulose fibres, fungal spores, starch granules, and a crustacean claw (<LINK REF="REF-Garvan-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garvan 1964</LINK>). More recent studies found glass fragments from the opening of glass ampoules (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1985</LINK>), and particles from rubber stoppers and intravenous equipment (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkpatrick-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkpatrick 1988</LINK>). Inorganic elements such as calcium, silicon, aluminium, lead and iron, that may have originated from the manufacture and packaging processes (<LINK REF="REF-Backhouse-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Backhouse 1987</LINK>), have also been found. Positively-charged in-line filters are reported to be effective in the retention of endotoxins (<LINK REF="REF-Barnett-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnett 1996</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-28 21:46:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are two main intravenous filter pore sizes; the 0.22 micron filter is used for aqueous solutions, and the 1.2 micron filter is recommended for larger molecule solutions such as lipids. The 0.22 micron filter has also been reported to remove air, micro-organisms and particulate matter. In addition, endotoxin retention is reportedly achieved by using a positively charged filter membrane; toxic macro-molecules are released by gram-negative bacteria and are claimed to be effective for up to 96 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Bethune-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bethune 2001</LINK>).<B>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-07-31 09:11:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intravenous in-line filters were conceived and first utilised in the 1960s for the retention of particulate contamination. Since then, filter systems have been further refined. Intravenous in-line filters are currently claimed to be an effective strategy for the removal of bacteria, endotoxins and particulates associated with intravenous therapy in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Ball-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ball 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunac-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunac 1999</LINK>), and more favourable patient outcomes, such as shorter hospital length of stay (<LINK REF="REF-Koekenberg-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koekenberg 1983</LINK>). Several adult studies have shown that intravenous in-line filtration significantly reduces the incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Chee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chee 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1994</LINK>) and delays the onset of phlebitis (<LINK REF="REF-Chee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chee 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allcutt-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allcutt 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1994</LINK>), resulting in extended-line survival (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1994</LINK>), fewer recannulations (<LINK REF="REF-Chee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chee 2002</LINK>) and lower costs.The use of in-line filters in adults has been shown to be effective in the removal of particulates,especially those precipitates caused from the administration of drugs, such as antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Ball-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ball 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chee 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1994</LINK>). In addition, a large randomised trial found that in-line filtration reduced severe complications and length of stay in the paediatric intensive care unit (<LINK REF="STD-Jack-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jack 2012</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-07-31 09:11:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several authors have challenged the benefits of using intravenous in-line filters in the adult population. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the filtration of all infusates during the manufacturing process in preference to the use of intravenous in-line filters as a more cost-effective and practical way to remove particulates (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Grady-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Grady 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1996</LINK>). In support of this recommendation, <LINK REF="REF-Friedland-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedland 1985</LINK>, reported that some solutions caused a reduction in flow rate or clogging of the filter and that certain drugs, such as antibiotics, may be retained in the filters, causing a reduction in potency. There are no known adverse effects from the use of intravenous in-line filters. The need to change the filters when they become blocked may lead to the need for increased manipulation of the intravenous administration set, increasing the risk of bacterial contamination. However, blocking of the filter is claimed to be indicative of complications such as those associated with microprecipitation occurring within the intravenous line which is a potentially harmful source of particulate matter which may then become dislodged entering the venous circulation (<LINK REF="REF-Bethune-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bethune 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Friedland-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedland 1985</LINK>, also argued that filters could not reduce the risk of infection caused by contaminants entering the line below the in-line filter. A study by <LINK REF="REF-Newell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 1998</LINK>, found no difference in the rate of septicaemia between children in an oncology unit who had filters fitted and those who did not. They concluded from their results that the added cost of using intravenous in-line filters was not warranted.</P>
<P>Intravenous in-line filters are recommended for use in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Bethune-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bethune 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunac-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunac 1999</LINK>). Therefore, the aim of this review is to systematically assess the evidence on the effectiveness of in-line filters on intravenous lines in neonates.</P>

<OL>
<LI>Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias): For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:Low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);High risk (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);Unclear risk.</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias): For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:Low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);High risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes; alternation; date of birth);Unclear risk.</LI>
<LI>Blinding (checking for possible performance bias): For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We planned to categorise blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:Low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for participants;Low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for personnel;Low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for outcome assessors.</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations): For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:Low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);High risk (&#8805; 20% missing data);Unclear risk.</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting bias: For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:Low risk (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);High risk (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);Unclear risk.</LI>
<LI>Other sources of bias: For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:Low risk;High risk;Unclear risk.</LI>

The manufacturer recommends using this filter for the elimination of particles, microbes, air and endotoxins. All intravenous fluids in the study group (with the exception of lipids which were administered through a 1.2 micron Lipipor<SUP>TM</SUP> filter) were given through the 0.22 micron in-line filter, and the administration sets were changed every four days. The intravenous sets in the control group and the Lipipor<SUP>TM</SUP> filters (that are not able to retain endotoxins) were changed daily. The filters were positioned at the distal end of the intravenous administration catheter after a series of stopcocks. The authors noted that this construction guaranteed that all clear fluids, including intravenous medication were administered via the filter.

All intravenous fluids in the study group (with the exception of lipids, blood or blood products) were given through the in-line filter and the administration sets were changed every four days. The intravenous sets in the control group were changed daily. In the study group, bacterial cultures were obtained at the time of change from both sides of the discarded filter and from the lipid solution. For the control group, bacterial cultures were obtained from the intravenous fluids every four days. In addition, catheter tips were cultured after removal. Blood was cultured only when sepsis was suspected. No information was provided on cannula site preparation. <LINK REF="STD-van-Lingen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Lingen 2004</LINK> reported that four patients in the control group died from "causes unrelated to catheter usage" i.e. necrotising enterocolitis, pulmonary bleeding, severe intraventricular haemorrhage, circulatory insufficiency.

The filters in the study group were positioned before the cannulae, except where fluids such as blood, plasma protein fraction, fresh frozen plasma or emulsions were being administered. On these occasions, the filter was positioned upstream of the three way tap used for adding such fluids to the primary infusion line. In the control group, an extension set was substituted for the filter. This was included as it provided an equal number of connections and manipulations in the lines for both groups. The intravenous lines and filters were changed every 24 hours in the control and study groups. Cannula site preparation was limited to swabbing the skin with isopropyl alcohol. Following cannulation, the site was covered with a sterile dressing. No extra cannula site care was performed (such as application of antibiotic cream or spray) during the study. Cannula life was assessed by duration of patency and volume of intravenous fluid passed by the site. Nursing staff observations of the infusion site were used to subjectively determine the end point.

<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Hoogen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van den Hoogen 2006</LINK> compared the costs of disposable materials per patient per four days. In the study group, two filters (clear fluid and lipid) and intravenous sets were changed every 96 hours and the intravenous sets in the control group were changed daily. The total cost per neonate in the control group was EUR 241.76 and EUR 238.63 in the study group, showing that the cost of using an in-line filter was compensated by the reduced consumption of intravenous administration sets. <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Hoogen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van den Hoogen 2006</LINK> also used filters for fat emulsions that had to be changed daily. Without the inclusion of these filters in the calculation, costs of disposable materials in the in-line filter group would have been much lower at EUR 107.73 over the four day period, less than half that in the control group. This study also found that the time necessary for changing the intravenous administration sets was significantly longer in the non-filter group: the mean time was 14 minutes plus +/- 7 minutes in the non-filter group, compared to 10 minutes +/- 5 minutes in the filter group (P = 0.000).</P>
<P>For the <LINK REF="STD-van-Lingen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Lingen 2004</LINK> study, costs attributable to patients in both control and study groups were calculated on a 'cost of disposables' basis during a standard eight day stay. Additionally, the time taken for line change was calculated by 'direct assessment', and an estimate of the relative nursing costs was built into the analysis. In the study group, filters and intravenous sets were changed every 96 hours and in the control group, the intravenous sets were changed daily. However, unlike the <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Hoogen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van den Hoogen 2006</LINK> study, lipid filters were not included in the calculation. The total cost per neonate in the control group was EUR 85.75 and for the study group was EUR 37.44, showing a saving of EUR 48.31 per neonate, over a period of eight days.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Bennion-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bennion 1991</LINK> study reported the average cost of an administration system as approximately GBP 17.28 per day for the control group compared to GBP 8.84 per day in the study group (showing a daily saving of GBP 8.44 in the treatment group). This was calculated by dividing the total cost of the equipment used by the number of cot days occupied by infants in each group. The intravenous sets were changed every 96 hours in the control group and daily in the study group.<BR/>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Bennion-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bennion 1991</LINK> study, precipitate was found to clog the filter and the flow of intravenous fluids. The intravenous in-line filter also became blocked in one patient in the <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Hoogen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van den Hoogen 2006</LINK> study; that was reported to be possibly due to the administration of very high glucose concentrations (50%).</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of intravenous in-line filters to prevent morbidity or mortality in neonates. However, cost savings were found with the less frequent changing of the intravenous sets when a 0.2 micron intravenous in-line filter (that removes endotoxins) was used, without an increase in adverse outcomes.</P>

<P>Further trials are needed to be able to assess the effectiveness of 0.22 micron positively charged 96-hour intravenous in-line filters and 1.2 micron intravenous in-line filters used for lipid administration for use in term and preterm neonates. These trials should include the outcomes of periventricular leukomalacia, necrotising enterocolitis, systemic and local thrombus and local phlebitis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Jack-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jack 2012</LINK>: Single centre, prospective, randomised controlled trial that randomised 807 critically ill children admitted to paediatric intensive care unit either to control (n = 406) or filter group (n = 401), with the latter receiving in-line filtration</P>
<P>The study included subjects less than 18 years of age (mean age 5 to 6 years). The primary endpoint was reduction in the rate of overall complications, which included the occurrence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, organ failure (circulation, lung, liver, kidney) and thrombosis. Secondary objectives were a reduction in the length of stay in the paediatric intensive care unit and overall hospital stay. Duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality were also analysed</P>
<P>Analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the overall complication rate (n = 166 [40.9 %] vs n = 124 [30.9 %]; P = 0.003) for the filter group. In particular, the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome was significantly lower (n = 123 [30.3 %] vs n = 90 [22.4 %]; P = 0.01). Moreover the length of stay in paediatric intensive care unit (3.89 [95 % confidence interval 2.97-4.82] vs 2.98 [2.33-3.64]; P = 0.025) and duration of mechanical ventilation (14.0 [5.6-22.4] vs 11.0 [7.1-14.9] h; P = 0.028) were significantly reduced.</P>
