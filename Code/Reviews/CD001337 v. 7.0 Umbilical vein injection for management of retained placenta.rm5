<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-05 16:05:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The placenta provides nourishment for the baby in the womb (uterus) through the umbilical cord. It is usually delivered shortly after the baby. If the placenta remains in the womb (retained placenta), women have an increased risk of bleeding heavily (haemorrhage), infection and very occasionally death. Manual removal of the placenta involves an operation to remove the placenta, but it can have adverse effects.</P>
<P>The injection of oxytocin solution into the umbilical cord after the cord is cut is an inexpensive and simple intervention that could be performed while placental delivery is awaited. There was some evidence from the review of 15 trials, involving 1704 women, that an injection of oxytocin into the umbilical vein could reduce the need for manual removal of retained placenta after childbirth. However, high-quality randomized trials show that the use of oxytocin has little or no effect. Around half of the retained placentas will come out spontaneously if left; the optimal timing of manual removal is not known.</P>

<P>We included 15 trials (1704 women). The trials were of variable quality. Compared with expectant management, UVI of saline solution alone did not show any significant difference in the incidence of manual removal of the placenta (risk ratio (RR) 0.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.16). UVI of oxytocin solution compared with expectant management showed no reduction in the need for manual removal (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03).</P>
<P>Oxytocin solution compared with saline solution alone showed a reduction in manual removal of the placenta, but this was not statistically significant (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00). When only high-quality studies were assessed, there was no statistical difference (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01). We detected no differences in any of the other outcomes.</P>
<P>UVI of oxytocin solution compared with UVI of plasma expander showed no statistically significant difference in the outcomes assessed by the only one small trial included. Prostaglandin solution compared with saline solution alone was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence in manual removal of placenta (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.82) but we observed no difference in the other outcomes evaluated. Prostaglandin plus saline solution showed a statistically significant reduction in manual removal of placenta when compared with oxytocin plus saline solution (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.75), and we also observed a small reduction in time from injection to placental delivery (mean difference -6.00; 95% CI -8.78 to -3.22). However, there were only two small trials contributing to this meta-analysis.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-04-12 10:07:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-03-08 04:21:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Normally the uterine contractions that occur immediately after the delivery of the baby result in the spontaneous detachment of the placenta from the uterine wall and subsequent delivery. The term 'retained placenta' is used when the placenta has not been delivered within one hour after the birth of the baby (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>). Retained placenta is a potentially life-threatening complication of the third stage of labour. If untreated, as may happen after home births in developing countries, there is a high risk of maternal death from haemorrhage or infection. The current standard management of retained placenta, by manual removal, aims to prevent these problems, but it is unsatisfactory. Manual removal involves the clinician passing a hand through the vagina into the cavity of uterus, and usually requires general or regional anaesthesia in hospital. It is an invasive procedure with its own serious complications of haemorrhage, infection or genital tract trauma. Any management simple and safe enough to be performed at the place of delivery which reduces the need for manual removal of placenta could be of major benefit to women worldwide. The umbilical vein injection (UVI) of saline solution or any other fluid alone or plus an uterotonic drug (to induce uterine contractions) seems a promising intervention. Uterotonic drugs are those that increase the uterine tone and/or contractility and include ergot alkaloids, oxytocin and prostaglandins. Injection of the solution into the umbilical vein in the cord after delivery of the baby is an inexpensive and simple intervention.</P>
<P>UVI for the management of retained placenta was first described by Mojon and Asdrubali in 1826 (<LINK REF="REF-Koerting-1926" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koerting 1926</LINK>). In the early twentieth century, various authors reported the use of UVI of saline solution with volumes that have varied widely between 200 ml and 400 ml (<LINK REF="REF-Gabaston-1914" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabaston 1914</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jarcho-1928" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarcho 1928</LINK>). Subsequent studies have concentrated on smaller volumes of UVI of saline solution plus oxytocin, although most of these were uncontrolled (<LINK REF="REF-Golan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golan 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Golan-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golan 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hauksson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauksson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heinonen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinonen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neri-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neri 1966</LINK>).</P>
<P>The hypothesized beneficial effect of the UVI is that it may reduce the need for manual removal of the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Carroli-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroli 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to evaluate the available evidence about the possible benefits and risks of the use of UVI versus expectant management for retained placenta. We also evaluated benefits and risks of the use of umbilical injection with different fluids and uterotonic drugs.</P>

<P>The search strategy identified 18 relevant studies that we assessed for inclusion. Of these, 15 (1704 women) fulfilled the selection criteria and were included in the meta-analyses. We incorporated three of them (659 women) in this update since the last publication of this review. Five trials were published in the late 1980s, six in the 1990s, two since 2000 and two studies are still unpublished. Twelve studies are small and three are relatively large. The largest trial includes 577 women. We have categorized included trials into six subgroups according to the type of fluids or drugs being compared (<I>see</I> below).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The agents and uterotonic drugs used in these trials include: saline solution alone, plasma expander alone, oxytocin plus saline solution and prostaglandin plus saline solution injected into the umbilical vein.</P>
<P>Saline solution alone versus expectant management was compared in four trials including 403 women. Oxytocin plus saline solution was compared to expectant management in five trials with 444 women. Oxytocin plus saline solution versus saline solution alone was compared in 12 trials including 1276 women. Oxytocin plus saline solution versus plasma expander was compared in only one trial with 109 women. Prostaglandin plus saline solution versus saline solution alone was compared in two small trials (51 women). Prostaglandin plus saline solution versus oxytocin plus saline solution was compared in the same two small studies (62 women). The volume injected into the umbilical vein was mostly 20 ml (10 studies) whereas four trials used a higher dose (30 ml) and only trial used a lower dose (10 ml). Seven studies used 10 IU of oxytocin, two studies used 20 IU, two used 30 IU, three trials used 50 IU and only one used a dose of 100 IU of oxytocin (<LINK REF="STD-Wilken_x002d_Jensen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wilken-Jensen 1989</LINK>). Prostaglandin doses used were 20 mg of F2&#945; in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bider-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bider 1996</LINK>) and 800 mcg of E1 analog (misoprostol) in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2007</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection bias at entry to the trial</HEADING>
<P>Four trials describe clearly the random method generation and concealment of allocation, making selection bias at entry to the trials unlikely (<LINK REF="STD-Carroli-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carroli 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frappell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Frappell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weeks-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Weeks 2009</LINK>). In another four trials, concealment of allocation (coded by the pharmacist) was sound; the possibility of selection bias is unlikely but none of them describe the random generation method (<LINK REF="STD-Hansen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hansen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huber-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Huber 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selinger-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Selinger 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilken_x002d_Jensen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wilken-Jensen 1989</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Calderale-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Calderale 1994</LINK>, although described as double blind with a placebo administered, does not clearly state the allocation concealment. <LINK REF="STD-Gazvani-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gazvani 1998</LINK> describes clearly the random generation and the concealment of allocation by sealed envelopes. <LINK REF="STD-Thiery-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Thiery 1987</LINK> describes only the concealment allocation method which is by sealed envelopes. Finally, three trials did not describe the random generation nor the allocation concealment method and, consequently, are open to selection bias at entry (<LINK REF="STD-Bider-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bider 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristiansen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kristiansen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makkonen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Makkonen 1995)</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Sivalingam-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sivalingam 2001</LINK>, the method of randomization is described as 'use of box containing equal number of envelopes' that were taken randomly; however, no attempt to conceal the randomization sequence is described and, therefore, this study could be prone to selection bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection bias after entry to the trial</HEADING>
<P>No withdrawals were stated to have occurred from 10 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Calderale-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Calderale 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gazvani-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gazvani 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hansen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hansen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristiansen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kristiansen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makkonen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Makkonen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selinger-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Selinger 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivalingam-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sivalingam 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thiery-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Thiery 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weeks-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Weeks 2009</LINK>), so the likelihood of selection bias after entry to these trials is low. In <LINK REF="STD-Huber-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Huber 1991</LINK>, 4.5% of the women were excluded from the analyses for violations of the treatment protocol, and in <LINK REF="STD-Carroli-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carroli 1998</LINK>, 1.7% of the participants were lost to follow-up, giving these two trials a very low risk of selection bias after entry.

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Oxytocin solution versus saline</HEADING>
<P>Twelve trials were included in this comparison. Oxytocin solution compared with saline alone showed a reduction in manual removal of the placenta, but this was not statistically significant and the data had some heterogeneity (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00, number needed to treat (NNT): 18; 95% CI 9 to 948; I² = 45%, P = 0.05). The NNT and its 95% confidence interval for this outcome was 18 (95% CI 9.00 to 948). Exploration of the data revealed that none of the three biggest studies (which together contributed over 70% of the data (911/1276)) found any difference in outcome either individually or combined (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09). When small but high-quality studies were added there remained no statistically significant difference (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01) (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) and we found no publication bias for this analysis when the funnel plot was produced (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Dosage appeared to have no effect as the four studies that used 30 units of oxytocin or more (<LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivalingam-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sivalingam 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weeks-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Weeks 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilken_x002d_Jensen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wilken-Jensen 1989</LINK>) together showed no significant difference (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Prostaglandin solution versus saline</HEADING>
<P>There were two small studies included in this comparison. UVI of prostaglandin solution compared with UVI of saline alone showed a lower incidence of statistical significance in manual removal of placenta (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.82) but no difference in blood loss, fever, abdominal pain, and addition of therapeutic uterotonics (for treatment effects and 95% CI see 'data and analyses' tables).</P>

UVI of prostaglandin solution versus UVI of oxytocin solution showed a significant difference in manual removal of placenta favourable to the prostaglandin group (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.75) and a slight decrease of statistical significance in time from injection to placental delivery (mean difference -6.00; 95% CI -8.78 to -3.22) but no statistical differences in blood loss, fever, abdominal pain and oxytocin augmentation (for treatment effects and 95% CI see 'data and analyses' tables).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Saline versus expectant management</HEADING>
<P>One question is whether UVI of saline compared with expectant management reduces the need for manual removal of the placenta. Although this is based in the only four available randomized controlled trials with a small overall sample size, the answer extracted from this systematic review is that there seem to be no advantages in using this intervention to reduce the above-mentioned main outcome. There was a similar lack of effect on secondary endpoints such as blood loss, blood transfusion curettage, hospital stay or any difference in postpartum haemoglobin level.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Oxytocin solution versus expectant management</HEADING>
<P>In this comparison, UVI of oxytocin solution showed a 13% risk reduction in the incidence of manual removal of placenta, but this benefit is not statistically significant with confidence intervals compatible with a risk reduction of 26% and a marginal risk of increase of 3%. There was no advantage with regards to secondary endpoints such as blood loss, haemoglobin, blood transfusion, curettage, infection and hospital stay.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Oxytocin solution versus saline</HEADING>
<P>This is the comparison in which most studies have been done and contributes the largest sample size of all the comparisons included in this systematic review. Overall the results are complex as they show the need for manual removal to be of borderline statistical significance of beneficial effect to the oxytocin solution group and of borderline heterogeneity. When subgroup analysis by quality of studies was performed, the high-quality group showed low heterogeneity and confidence intervals compatible with anything between a risk reduction of 17% and a marginal risk increase of 1% (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Post-hoc exploration by oxytocin dose and by funnel plot does not reveal any alternative source of heterogeneity. Dealing with this data will, therefore, be controversial, especially as two of the authors of this review (A Weeks and G Carroli) are first authors for the two largest studies.</P>
<P>Overall, it appears unlikely that there is a major effect of umbilical oxytocin injection on main outcomes. However, with a number needed to treat of 18 (95% confidence interval 9.00 to 948), it could be argued that with no harmful effects found with its administration, and as an inexpensive and simple intervention that could be performed while placental delivery is awaited, it would still have a role in the management of retained placenta. If the intervention is performed within 15 to 30 minutes after delivery of the baby, it may slightly reduce the need for further interventions for retained placenta. This small potential beneficial effect could still be important in settings where resources are scarce and there is no immediate availability of facilities for manual removal.</P>
<P>It should be noted that we found no differences in length of third stage of labour, blood loss, postpartum haemorrhage, haemoglobin, blood transfusion, curettage, infection, hospital stay, fever, abdominal pain and addition of therapeutic uterotonics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Oxytocin solution versus plasma expander</HEADING>
<P>UVI of oxytocin solution compared with UVI of plasma expander showed higher, but not statistically significant, incidence of manual removal of placenta and did not show any difference in blood loss but, as it was shown, there is only one trial available to date and considering the poor methodological quality and the small size of it, these results should be interpreted cautiously.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prostaglandin solution versus saline</HEADING>
<P>The use of UVI of prostaglandin solution compared with UVI of saline alone showed a statistically significant risk reduction in manual removal of placenta but did not show any difference in blood loss, fever, abdominal pain, and addition of therapeutic uterotonics. The results of this comparison should be taken cautiously as there were only two small trials with 51 women in total and both studies were considered of low methodological quality due to the lack of proper blinding and therefore, prone to bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prostaglandin solution versus oxytocin solution</HEADING>
<P>The UVI of prostaglandin solution compared with UVI oxytocin solution showed again a significant difference in manual removal of placenta as well as for time to placental delivery favourable to the first group. No other differences reached statistical significance. However, as for the previous comparison, these results should be interpreted guardedly as only two small unblinded trials were included in the meta-analysis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-12-02 11:23:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given that the meta-analysis of all the main three comparisons showed no major effect, it would not be appropriate to suggest widespread implementation of intra-umbilical oxytocin injection for the treatment of retained placenta. Furthermore, if there is an effect, it does not appear to be large; the number of cases that need to be treated to prevent one manual removal is unlikely to be less than nine and could be high as 948. However, those who currently use the technique can be reassured that there is no evidence of harm, and they may therefore, wish to continue using it. Indeed, with many retained placenta delivering spontaneously with no intervention at all, there may be a benefit to just waiting for a further 30 minutes to allow time for this spontaneous expulsion. However, the risk of bleeding increases with the length of the third stage and so facilities for manual removal and blood transfusion should be readily available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-03-08 05:08:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is little evidence of the optimal time to wait prior to manual removal of placenta, and a study of immediate versus delayed manual removal would help to evaluate the risks and benefits of this strategy. There is also some evidence that the UVI of plasma expander or prostaglandins are beneficial, and so further research in this area is justified.</P>
<P>The evidence extracted from this review does not support further research on the use of UVI of saline solution alone in comparison to expectant management.</P>
