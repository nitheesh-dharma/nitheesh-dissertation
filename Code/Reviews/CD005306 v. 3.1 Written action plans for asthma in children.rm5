I am happy to proceed with publication of the current version. I have run spell check and only altered the sentence in the discussion about oral steroids not being effective in preventing emergency visits (there is plenty of evidence for efficacy of oral steroids). The point you make about the Charlton protocol is very fair.&lt;br&gt;When you come to do the update you may be able to get better Variance data from Wensley and ask her about Concealment allocation, but this can wait for now.&lt;br&gt;Good work,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;========================================================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;March 18, 2006 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank-you for compiling the comments from the peer reviewers of our review entitled, &amp;quot;Written action plans for children with asthma.&amp;quot; Please note that our response is provided after each query, in BLUE TEXT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All changed text appears in red in the Cochrane review for your perusal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanjit Bhogal&lt;br&gt;PhD (candidate)&lt;br&gt;Joint Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health&lt;br&gt;McGill University&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract: &lt;br&gt;Are there any papers from 2005 (date of last search Nov 2004)? It is splitting hairs to say there is a total absence of trials on providing WAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of November 2004 there was an absence of trials comparing WAP vs. no WAP where all co-interventions were the same. Following this comment, we updated the search until Feb 2006 and identified one possible trial meeting this criterion. This trial will be considered for inclusion in future updates. Meanwhile, we have tone down this statement and called for additional trials (in the abstract and elsewhere in the text).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of studies: &lt;br&gt;It needs to be clearly stated that some trials (e.g. Wensley) used a blinded PEF reading with an electronic spirometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of blinded PEF reading by Wensley was added to description of the studies under the &amp;quot;step recognition&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;intensity of monitoring&amp;quot; as well as in the Table of characteristics of included studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcome measures: &lt;br&gt;In view of the mild/mod asthma of participants would symptom-free days or symptom scores be more sensitive than exacerbations as primary outcome?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selection of &amp;quot;exacerbations requiring an acute care visit&amp;quot; as the primary outcome was done at the protocol level and cannot be changed. This outcome was chosen because it was meaningfully relevant to parents, patients, physicians, and the health care system and thus more likely to change practice that other outcomes. Furthermore, since the focus of the traditional definition of an action plan is to decrease the severity of exacerbations, it made sense to choose a variable that would reflect such an outcome. Other outcomes may indeed be more sensitive; sensitivity is not necessarily the most important factor in the selection of a primary outcome. Other outcomes, including symptom-free days and symptom scores, were analysed as secondary outcome measures. Of note: not all patients had mild to moderate asthma; indeed three studies also included patients with severe asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors do comment on the issue of the effectiveness of the clinical advice, which is the basis of the written management plan. If however the advice is not particularly effective in practice (and this is the situation for younger children) then the outcome for the two groups (with and without peak flow meter) will of course be the same. This is a critical issue. The issue has been raised in some previous trials of asthma education/self-management for very young children, where clearly the advice is ineffective. In relation to older children, the evidence that, for instance, doubling inhaled corticosteroids might be beneficial is lacking. This needs very careful discussion, since the nature of the advice is critical to the argument concerning the effectiveness or not, of peak flow monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion was re-worded to reflect this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: &lt;br&gt;1.The term &amp;quot;interlocutor&amp;quot; is ambiguous to most non-North American readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;quot;interlocutor&amp;quot; has been changed to &amp;quot;Person targeted&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.The use of terms such as &amp;quot;6th grade&amp;quot; is maybe meaningless outside the North American context and an age group should be given instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added the description of 6 schooling years; 11 years of age in brackets to help clarify what &amp;quot;6th grade&amp;quot; means. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.Similarly the use of &amp;quot;step 1&amp;quot; as on page 13, is also ambiguous to most readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To clarify we added a brief definition of the condition of the steps: step 1 (well being), step 2 (asthma symptoms), and step 3 (severe respiratory distress) throughout the methodology, results and discussion sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion:&lt;br&gt;Generally the results are reflected in the Discussion, but a number of issues need to be clarified including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.The appropriateness of the clinical interventions, which were the basis for the comparison between peak flow and non-peak flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes made to discussion to reflect this issue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.The fact that blinded peak flow recordings were carried out in at least one of the trials, providing interesting comparisons between thresholds for symptoms and peak flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We added that while Wensley et al. employed blinded peak flow reading, comparison of thresholds for action between symptoms and peak flow peak flow reading could not be made as no comparison was not provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.Issues such as thresholds for action (70%, 80% &amp;#8230;) and whether the threshold is based on a mean or best peak flow for an adequate period of run-up or after optimal therapy (for instance with oral steroids). These are variables, which are important in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes were made to the discussion section to address this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.Some exploration of the cost/benefit ratio of dissecting the components of guided self-management might be worthwhile. Just how far do we need to go in this regard?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this is a valid point, there is no data available regarding the issue of cost-benefit ratio of self-management. The issue of cost-benefit has been added to Implication to Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. I feel that the authors have been far too negative about the existing asthma education/written management plan evidence for children. There is good evidence that in some circumstances, the process of education/written management plan is effective. The problem arises in the ambiguity of the two terms &amp;quot;asthma education&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;guided self-management&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more of gap of knowledge/evidence rather than an issue of non-effectiveness. Wording has been changed to reflect this difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implications for Practice:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I disagree with the first paragraph of this section. The authors are too negative. This is in fact a rather subjective view, and not up to the usual standards of a systematic review of this type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more of gap of knowledge/evidence rather than an issue of non-effectiveness. Wording has been changed to reflect this deference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the second point in their implications for practice is justified. However, I am not sure about the last word in that paragraph - what is a &amp;quot;poor demonstrator&amp;quot;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;quot;poor demonstrator&amp;quot; has been removed from this paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations for further research:&lt;br&gt;Again I think that there are a number of RCTs that compare the efficiency of written vs. no action plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of November 2004, there were no RCTs comparing the efficacy of written action plan vs. no action plan in which the co-interventions were the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one of the trials did in fact use blinded peak flow monitoring. A sham control procedure was indeed used in one of the studies. This could in fact be a criticism: it complicates the activities of the control with no obvious value to the subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correct although in this case, the peak flow monitoring could be presented to patients as essential to determine one important outcome variable (improvement in lung function). It would also serve to assess adherence to monitoring and to step-up recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.3 Beta&lt;br&gt;Peer Reviewer Feedback Feb 28&lt;br&gt;Abstract: Are there any papers from 2005 (date of last search Nov 2004)?

I am also keen that the authors go back to Wensley for data on outcomes based on &amp;quot;one patient outcomes&amp;quot; as shown in one of the figures. The text SE is not appropriate for our purposes and there is only one PEF graph. Also to reconsider whether Wensley should be in the subgroup for symptomatic or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing Jan 25&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the further work on this. &lt;br&gt;1. Acute care visits per step 2 is not a correct analysis as some patients will contribute multiple episodes. I have added a rider to this effect.&lt;br&gt;2. I am convinced that the SEM in Wensley is misprinted and is too small by a factor of 10. The printed SEM does not tally with the CI in Figure 2 that measures roughly 5% giving an SEM of around 2 not 0.2 Could you check this with Prof Silverman as the larger SEM is in line with Yoos and I am sure is correct. The SDs therefore will need to be increased by a factor of ten for FEV1 from Wensley. This is not your mistake but a probable misprint in the paper. I have adjusted this according the Figure results and would be grateful if you could recheck with the authors whilst we get this peer reviewed.&lt;br&gt;3. I am quite happy with the other changes that you have made. The NNT is most reliably calculated from OR and I have therefore changed this. The confidence interval you quoted was much too small and I have amended it. (I am not sure where you got it from?)&lt;br&gt;For the sake of speed I have amended the SDs as above and will carry on with Peer Review whilst you clarify the FEV1 data with Mike Silverman.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;January 23, 2006 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank-you for your thorough review and comment of our review entitled, &amp;quot;Written action plan for children with asthma.&amp;quot; Please note that our response is provided after each query, in BLUE TEXT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All changed text appears in red in the Cochrane review for your perusal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanjit Bhogal&lt;br&gt;PhD (candidate)&lt;br&gt;Joint Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health&lt;br&gt;McGill University&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;*****Is acute care visits per step 2 really dichotomous? Can you confirm that this is the number of individual patients NOT episodes? If it is the latter this is not a correct analysis. &lt;br&gt;THIS OUTCOME VARIABLE IS REALLY A RATIO, AND NOT A CONTINUOUS OUTCOME. THIS OUTCOME REPRESENTS A DENOMINATOR, THE NUMBER TIMES THE STEP 2 (YELLOW ZONE) WAS ACTIVATED AND A NUMERATOR, THE NUMBER OF EPISODES WHICH LED TO AN ED/ER VISIT. AS SUCH, IT CANNOT BE DISPLAYED AS A CONTINOUS OUTCOME SINCE IT IS NOT A MEAN WITH A STANDARD DEVIATION. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also we no longer enter lung function as negative numbers so please change this back to positive for change in lung function and absolute lung function, and then reverse the labels under the graph.&lt;br&gt; TJL: LABELS AND NEGATIVES SWITCHED ****&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have done the same with symptoms or QOL can these be reversed as well please.

ALTHOUGH, SINCE THE SYNPOSIS IS MEANT FOR A LAYPERSON WE THOUGHT THAT THIS INTERPRETATION MIGHT BE APPERCIATED. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: I have pruned this considerably to get it nearer the 450-word limit.&lt;br&gt;WE ARE FINE WITH THE PRUNING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Crossover design would not be suitable this type of intervention so I have removed it from types of studies for inclusion. *** &lt;br&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Types of interventions - Garrett 1998 has no reference, please add to other references**** &lt;br&gt;REFERENCE ADDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are changing WMD to MD as advised by statisticians and I have corrected the description of SMD.&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: &amp;quot;Intensity of monitoring&amp;quot; Yoos 2002 is described as daily and symptomatic monitoring. If this represents two arms please make this clear (in action plan format section).&lt;br&gt;YOOS 2002 WAS A THREE-ARMED STUDY. THIS IS NOTED IN THE LAST SENTENCE UNDER DESCRIPTION OF STUDIES, INCLUDED STUDIES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? SDs of Yoos 2002 and Wensely 2004 are very different. ===THE SEMS IN THE WENSLEY PAPER ARE REPORTED AND ARE VERY SMALL (0.2 &amp;amp; 0.23). === &lt;br&gt;BOTH YOOS AND WENSLEY, IN RESPONSE TO THE LETTERS WE SENT THEM, STATED THAT THEY PROVIDED US WITH THE SEM. WE CONVERTED THE SEM INTO SD. I DOUBLE CHECKED THE VALUES THAT WERE PROVIDED TO US, AND THEN DOUBLE CHECKED THE CALCULATION OF THE COVERSION OF THE SEM INTO THE SD, AND HAS VERIFIED NO ERRORS IN OUR CALCULATIONS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: &lt;br&gt;*Charlton found more courses of steroids using PEF but how do you interpret this???? &lt;br&gt;THIS RESULT IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE RESULTS OF OUR PRIMARY OUTCOME, IN WHICH CHILDREN IN THE PEAK FLOW GROUP REQUIRED MORE ACUTE CARE VISITS THAN CHILDREN ASSIGNED TO SYMPTOM-BASED MONITORING. THERE ARE SEVERAL PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATIONS TO THIS RESULT, FOLLOWING THE SAME LOGIC AS TO WHY THE PEAK FLOW GROUP REQUIRED MORE ACUTE CARE VISITS (SEE PARAGRAPH 5 OF THE DISCUSSION SECTION), NAMELY INEQUALITIES OF THE ZONES DESCRIBED BY NUMERICAL CUT-OFF LEVELS FOR THE PEAK-FLOW GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING SYMPTOM DESCRIPTIONS. AN ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION TO YOUR QUESTION IS THAT THE CHILDREN WHO INITIATED ORAL STERIODS ALSO SOUGHT MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY RATHER THAN ALLOWING THE STEROIDS TO TAKE EFFECT. ACCORDING TO THE WRITTEN INSTRUCTION OF STEP 3 IN CHARLTON'S PEF-BASED PLAN (&amp;lt;50%), THE PLAN INSTRUCTED THE CHILD TO &amp;quot;START ORAL PREDNISOLONE (20 MD DAILY FOR CHILDREN) AND CONTACT GENERAL PRACTICIONER&amp;quot;. IT IS LIKELY THAT MANY GENERAL PRACTIONERS WOULD RECOMMEND AN ACUTE CARE VISIT FOR A PATIENT WHOSE PEAK-FLOW WAS &amp;lt; 50% Of PERSONAL BEST, THUS NOT ALLOWING THE ORAL STEROIDS TO PREVENT AN ACUTE CARE VISIT, AND MAKING IT CONSISTENT WITH OUT PRIMARY OUTCOME. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Auto-trigger of steroids at a certain peak flow could be good or bad as Charlton allowed home initiation of steroids at step 3!&lt;br&gt;CHARLTON ALLOWED AUTO-TRIGGER IN STEP 3 OF THE PEAK FLOW PLAN, WHICH ALSO INSTRUCTED PATIENTS TO CONTACT THEY GP, AND STEP 4 INSTRUCTED PATIENTS TO SEEK URGENT CARE. THE SYMPTOM BASED PLAN HAD SIMILAR INSTRUCTIONS, BUT WAS ASSIGNED TO STEP 5. AUTO-TRIGGER OF STEROIDS WAS NOT SEEN AS A PROTECTIVE OR PREVENTATIVE STRATEGY BUT OCCURRED CONCURRENTLY WITH CONTACT WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Hospital admission is not contentious&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Does the imbalance in the male/female plans in Wensley suggest that allocation concealment failed or it this just chance do you think?&lt;br&gt;ACCORDING TO THE PUBLISHED METHODS OF WENSLEY'S STUDY, IT WAS UNCLEAR IF CONCEALED ALLOCATION WAS EMPLOYED. WE DID CONTACT THE AUTHORS OF ALL INCLUDED STUDIES TO CONFIRM THE PEDro SCORING FOR METHODOLGOICAL QUALITY OF THE STUDY. DURING THIS PROCESS, DR. SILVERMAN DID CONFIRM THAT CONCEALED ALLOCATION WAS NOT USED. HE DID; HOWEVER, CONFIRM THAT RANDOM ALLOCATION WAS UTILIZED. SINCE THIS IS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, AND WE RECEIVED CONFIRMATION OF THIS, WE ASSUMED THAT THE RANDOMIZATION WAS CARRIED OUT ADEQUATELY. THIS FACT IS SUPPORTED BY THE OBSERVATION THAT THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FOR THE OTHER 12 BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS MEASURED IN TABLE 1. IT IS; THEREFORE, OUR OPINION THAT THE OBSERVED IMBALANCE IN THE MALE/FEMALE RATIO IS DUE TO CHANCE ALONE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.3 Beta&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 18 Jan 06 - Please see *** action points *** below.

We speculate that it may be due to earlier recognition of exacerbations with symptoms than the peak flow threshold of 70% or 80% used, : there are several references that show this is the case :&lt;br&gt;Gibson PG, Wlodarczyk J, Hensley MJ, Murree-Allen K, Olson LG, Saltos N. &lt;br&gt; Using quality-control analysis of peak expiratory flow recordings to guide&lt;br&gt;therapy for asthma.&lt;br&gt;Ann Intern Med. 1995 Oct 1;123(7):488-92. &lt;br&gt;PMID: 7661491 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2: Gibson PG, Wong BJ, Hepperle MJ, Kline PA, Girgis-Gabardo A, Guyatt G,&lt;br&gt;Dolovich J, Denburg JA, Ramsdale EH, Hargreave FE. &lt;br&gt; A research method to induce and examine a mild exacerbation of asthma by&lt;br&gt;withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroid.&lt;br&gt;Clin Exp Allergy. 1992 May;22(5):525-32. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chan-Yeung M, Chang JH, Manfreda J, Ferguson A, Becker A. &lt;br&gt; Changes in peak flow, symptom score, and the use of medications during acute&lt;br&gt;exacerbations of asthma.&lt;br&gt;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 1996 Oct;154(4 Pt 1):889-93. &lt;br&gt;===========================================================================&lt;br&gt;PLEASE BE CAREFUL TO USE THE VERSION OF THE REVIEW THAT I SENT BACK TO YOU.

<P>We did not find any trial examining the benefit of providing versus not providing a written action plan to children with asthma.<BR/>Four clinical trials with 355 children were identified which compared the effect of symptom-based versus to peak flow written action plans when all other co-interventions were similar.

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>While all asthma consensus statements recommend the use of written action plan (WAP) as a central part of asthma management, a recent systematic review of randomised trials highlighted the paucity of trials where the only difference between groups was the provision or not of a written action plan. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives of this review were firstly to evaluate the independent effect of providing versus not providing a written action plan in children and adolescents with asthma, and secondly to compare the effect of different written action plans.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (November 2004), which is derived from searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, as well as handsearched respiratory journals, and meeting abstracts. We also searched bibliographies of included studies and identified review articles. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials were included if they compared a written action plan with no written action plan, or different written action plans with each other. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently selected the trials, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four trials (three RCTs and one quasi-RCT) involving 355 children were included. Children using symptom-based WAPs had lower risk of exacerbations which required an acute care visit (N = 5; RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99). The number needed to treat to prevent one acute care visit was 9 (95% CI 5 to 138). Symptom monitoring was preferred over peak flow monitoring by children (N = 2; RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.46), but parents showed no preference (N = 2; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.18 to 2.11). Children assigned to peak flow-based action plans reduced by 1/2 day the number of symptomatic days per week (N = 2; mean difference: 0.45 days/week; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.26). There were no significant group differences in the rate of exacerbation requiring oral steroids or admission, school absenteeism, lung function, symptom score, quality of life, and withdrawals.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence suggests that symptom-based WAP are superior to peak flow WAP for preventing acute care visits although there is insufficient data to firmly conclude whether the observed superiority is conferred by greater adherence to the monitoring strategy, earlier identification of onset of deteriorations, higher threshold for presentation to acute care settings, or the specific treatment recommendations.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-01 16:36:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma exacerbations are often viewed as discrete episodes of deterioration triggered by a virus, exercise, or allergen (<LINK REF="REF-Chan_x002d_Yeung-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan-Yeung 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1998a</LINK>). However, in many cases, exacerbations occur on a background of chronic sub-optimal asthma control. Optimal daily asthma control results in less asthma lability (for example less frequent and less severe exacerbations) in response to various triggers. Since all individuals diagnosed with asthma are susceptible to asthma exacerbations, patients with asthma should know how to prevent and manage these episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2004</LINK>). The need for active participation on the part of the parent or individual with asthma to prevent exacerbations has led to the universal recommendation by national and international asthma guidelines to provide written action plans (WAP), also termed self-management action plans, for home management of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Asthma-Handbook-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asthma Handbook 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lemiere-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemiere 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAEPP" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Mutius-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Mutius 2000</LINK>). Such action plans consist of a written set of instructions given to patients with asthma for the management of chronic symptoms as well as for the prevention and management of exacerbations. </P>
<P>A written action plan probably serves several functions. First, it acts as a communication tool between the health care professional and the patient. Next, it functions as a reminder to patients of the treatment plan, including instructions for step-up and step-down therapy in response to deterioration and improvement. It is believed that a written action plan should be tailored to the patient and the type and severity of asthma. It should specify which medications should be used as maintenance therapy (when the patient is well); when, how, for how long to modify medications in case of deterioration; and when to access the medical system in the event of worsening asthma. Individualisation is thus expected in the choice and dosage of medication, type of inhalation device(s), and personal indicators of deterioration. </P>
<P>In adults with asthma, self-management education (including regular reviews and a written action plan) clearly leads to improved health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2003</LINK>). Several paediatric reviews have examined the effectiveness of asthma education in children with conflicting results. An earlier systemic review of randomised controlled trials was unable to document any consistent favourable effect of self-management education in children (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-Bonnin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard Bonnin 1995</LINK>). A Cochrane review of controlled and randomised trials reported a favourable effect of asthma education (including, but not limited to, a written action plan) on lung function, self-efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2002</LINK>), activities, and emergency department visits. The effect appeared stronger with more severe asthma and in studies using peak flow rather than symptom-based strategies. </P>
<P>Patients tend to have a positive perception regarding the use of action plans, and found that actions plans were useful for the management of their asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Douglass-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglass 2002</LINK>). Yet a written action plan cannot be viewed in isolation. It is usually part of a multifaceted intervention, including education sessions by a trained educator (covering avoidance of triggers, recognition of signs of deterioration, and instructions for the prevention and management of exacerbations), medical review, and prescription of medications. While a recent review of randomised controlled trials suggested some key elements for successful action plan in adults (i.e., 2 to 4 action points, recognition of deteriorations based on symptoms or personal best peak expiratory flow (PEF), dose doubling of inhaled corticosteroids and/or self-initiation of oral corticosteroids during exacerbations), the groups also differed by the presence (in the written action plan group) or the absence (in the no written action plan group) of educational co-interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2003</LINK>). A recent systematic review of randomised trials highlighted the paucity of trials where the only difference between groups was the provision or not of a written action plan (<LINK REF="REF-Lefevre-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefevre 2002</LINK>). The authors concluded that the application of written action plan may be a waste of useful resources and may have been inappropriately recommended as indicator of quality of care. </P>
<P>Therefore, there exists a need to confirm the efficacy of written action plans in the paediatric population. The paediatric population has several characteristics that make this assessment particularly challenging. First, is the person targeted for application of a written action plan (child or teenager-centred, parent-centred or both) which likely varies not only with the child's age, maturity, but also with child rearing philosophy and specific family interaction. Second, is the use of proxy (e.g. parents or legal guardians) for the recognition of symptoms, particularly for younger children. Parents and child perception of symptoms and quality life are not always in agreement and the discrepancy increases with child's age (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 1999</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Braun_x002d_Fahrlander-89" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braun-Fahrlander 89</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Renzoni-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renzoni 1999</LINK>). Other possibly important factors include the (1) complexity, attractiveness, clarity, and reading level of the written action plan particularly when the child is the person targeted, (2) adherence to the treatment dictated by the written action plan, (3) parent's acceptance of the diagnosis and comfort with treatment, (4) parental worry about safety of chronic administration of medication, (5) type of asthma (episodic versus persistent), and (6) the limited effective treatment strategies for the self-management of exacerbations in childhood asthma. Indeed, in paediatric, the only intervention consistently proven effective for preventing exacerbation is the use of daily anti-inflammatory therapy (rather than episodic treatment during exacerbations), with no apparent benefit from increasing the dose of anti-inflammatory therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Volovitz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volovitz 2001</LINK>) and conflicting benefit (and unknown safety) of self-initiation of oral steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Garrett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horowitz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horowitz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oommen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oommen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steven-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steven 2002</LINK>) at onset of exacerbations.<BR/> <BR/>Clearly asthma education is beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2002</LINK>) but what is the independent contribution of the provision of a written action plan to this effect and what elements of a written action plan are most effective? </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to evaluate the independent effect of providing a written action plan vs. not providing a written action plan in children and adolescents with asthma. More specifically we wish to quantify any beneficial effect on asthma morbidity associated with the provision of a written action plan. We also wish examine the efficacy of different types of action plans to identify the key elements of a written action plan that may be associated with greater effectiveness in terms of format, instructions for daily treatment, instructions for step-up therapy, other ancillary instructions, and specific symptom versus peak-flow based instructions as to when to seek emergency help. </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-09-01 16:34:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised (or quasi-randomised) controlled trials with a parallel-group design were included, irrespective of blinding or the presence of placebo. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Children aged 0 to 17 years inclusively in whom asthma was diagnosed according to standard ATS criteria of reversibility and response to inhaled beta-2 agonist and/or anti-inflammatory treatment. In children less than two years, an additional criterion consisted of three or more episodes of wheezing, in order to reasonably exclude bronchiolitis. All settings of recruitment (emergency room, observation unit, in-patients, out-patients, general practice and home) were included as long as self-management plan at home was examined. Trials including adults and children were included if subgroup analyses on children and adolescents were available. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The intervention must have been a written action plan for asthma management. The control group must have been assigned to receive no written action plan or another type of written action plan. Studies were included if they compared: <BR/>1. written action plan (Intervention) with no written action plan (Control); <BR/>2. written action plan (Intervention A) with a different written action plan (Intervention B). <BR/>All other medical and non-medical co-interventions were required to be similar between groups in order to determine the net benefit of a written action plan. No minimum duration of time was required. </P>
<P>We defined a written action plan as written set of instructions given to patients/parents that: <BR/>1. was intended to stay in their hands until the next visit (thus excluding pharmacy prescriptions);<BR/>2. provided instructions for daily treatment;<BR/>3. provided instructions for initiation/step-up treatment in the event of deterioration; and<BR/>4. provided information regarding when to seek urgent medical consultation. </P>
<P>Of note, we expanded definition of an action plan suggested by the Global Initiative for Asthma (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2005</LINK>) by adding the first two criteria. We made explicit the first criterion, which was previously implied. Second, we felt important that the WAP was structured to allow the recording of effective recommendations. We added the second criteria because in pediatrics, the evidence derived from randomised controlled trials has identified maintenance inhaled steroids as the single most effective way to decrease exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>). Indeed, an increased dose of inhaled steroids during exacerbations have not been shown superior to just adding relief short-acting ß2-agonists in children or adults. (<LINK REF="REF-FitzGerald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">FitzGerald 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garrett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volovitz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volovitz 2001</LINK>). </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measure was the number of patients with an asthma exacerbation requiring an unscheduled medical or emergency department visit, as indicative of failure of the written action plan. </P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures included: (1) measures reflecting the severity of exacerbations including the rate of patients requiring rescue oral steroids whether self-initiated as per the written action plan and/or initiated by a physician and the proportion of patients requiring hospital admission; (2) measures reflecting chronic asthma control such as change in asthma control score, change in pulmonary function tests, days/nights with/without symptoms, symptom scores, quality of life/functional status, and use of rescue short-acting beta-2 agonist, days/night with/without rescue beta-2 agonist, school absenteeism/days lost from usual activities, and parent days lost from work/usual activities; (3) parent and patient perception/satisfaction, adherence to maintenance and/or step-up therapy; (4) changes in measures of inflammation such as expired nitric oxide was also considered; (5) rates of adverse effects and withdrawal rates. </P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We identified trials using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from systematic searches of systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, and hand searching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. All records in the Specialised Register coded as 'asthma' were searched using the following terms: </P>
<P>(educat* OR self-manag* OR "self manag*" OR "action plan*" OR action-plan* OR self-care OR "self care" OR self-medicat* OR "self medicat*" OR "management-plan" OR "management plan" or "management program*") AND (child* OR paediat* OR pediat* OR infant* OR toddler* OR bab* OR young* OR school* OR newborn* OR new-born* OR neo-nat* OR neonat* OR parent*) </P>
<P>Handsearched respiratory journals, and meeting abstracts were surveyed using the same terms. We also searched bibliographies of included studies and identified review articles. <BR/>We carried out the searches in November 2004 and we will update these annually.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selection of trials </HEADING>
<P>From the title, abstract or descriptors, two authors (SB and RZ) independently reviewed the titles, abstracts and citation of all trials identified by the literature search. Those appearing to address the subject of a written action plan in the paediatric population were selected for full text review to determine if they meet inclusion criteria. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus with the involvement of a third author (FD).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality assessment </HEADING>
<P>Two authors (SB and RZ) independently assessed the quality of all studies included for review. Inter-rater reliability was measured using the simple agreement and kappa-weighted statistics. Using the Cochrane Collaboration approach to the assessment of allocation, all trials were graded using the following grades:</P>
<P>Grade A - Adequate allocation concealment<BR/>Grade B - Unclear allocation concealment<BR/>Grade C - Inadequate allocation concealment<BR/>Grade D - Allocation concealment not used</P>
<P>Due to the large weight given to blinding in the Jadad's scale (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2002</LINK>) a design characteristic difficult to implement in this field, we selected the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) for the assessment of study methodology. This scale, developed by the Centre for Evidence-Based Physiotherapy (CEBP) (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2002</LINK>), includes 10 methodological criteria, each of which was scored 1 if present or 0 if absent. The PEDro scale recognizes that while blinding is important, it is not always feasible. Accordingly, the PEDro scale assesses blinding at three different levels and other important criteria such as concealed allocation, intention to treat analysis and adequacy of follow up. Therefore, studies that are unable to be double blinded due to the study question, but that otherwise demonstrate high internal validity, are not unjustly penalized. The maximum score a study can receive was 10. Scale items consist of:</P>
<P>1. Participants were randomly allocated to groups (in a crossover study, participants were randomly allocated to order in which treatments were received).<BR/>2. Allocation was concealed.<BR/>3. The groups were similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators.<BR/>4. There was blinding of all participants.<BR/>5. There was blinding of all therapists who administered the therapy.<BR/>6. There was blinding of all assessors who measured at least one key outcome.<BR/>7. Measurement of the main outcome in more than 85% of the participant randomised.<BR/>8. All participants for whom outcome measures were available received the treatment or control condition as allocated or, where this was not the case, data for at least one key outcome was analysed by "intention to treat".<BR/>9. The results of between-group statistical comparisons are reported for at least one key outcome.<BR/>10. The study provides both point measures and measures of variability for at least one key outcome.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies were categorized as excellent (score 9 to 10), good (score 6 to 8), fair (score 4 to 5) and poor (score 3 or less) according the levels of evidence outlined by <LINK REF="REF-Foley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foley 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>We only considered intention-to-treat analysis employed if the trial explicitly stated than an intention-to-treat analysis was performed or if the study experienced no dropouts or losses to follow up and stated that patients were analysed according to the original group assignment.</P>
<P>Blinding of assessors was considered adequate if the reader can be satisfied that the apparent effect (or lack of effect) of the treatment was not due to the assessor's bias impinging on their measured outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data extraction </HEADING>
<P>Two authors (SB and RZ) independently extracted data for the trials and entered into the Cochrane Collaboration software program, Review Manager, Version 4.2. We asked primary study authors to confirm the methodology and data extraction and asked to provide additional information and clarification for the trial, as needed. If necessary, we performed expansions of graphic reproductions and estimations from other data presented in the paper.</P>

<P>All trials were combined using RevMan Analyses, For dichotomous variables, we calculated individual and pooled statistics, as Relative Risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For continuous variables, individual and pooled statistics were calculated as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD), as indicated, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Homogeneity of effect sizes between studies being pooled were tested with the DerSimonian &amp; Laird method, with P &lt; 0.05 and I2 = 25% (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) being used as the cut-off level for significance. If heterogeneity was suggested, we applied the DerSimonian &amp; Laird random-effects model to the summary estimates. Unless otherwise specified, fixed-effect model was reported, as it is better equipped for detecting small effect sizes compared to the random-effect methods (<LINK REF="REF-Fields-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fields 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>If two control-intervention comparisons used the same group twice as comparator (for example a three-arm study had two intervention arms but only one control arm), the number of participants in the group used twice (in this instance the control group) was halved to avoid over-representation. For event rate, the denominator was also halved in the control group.</P>
<P>Studies designed to test equivalence in treatment efficacy require a different analytical approach to that used for trials in which the hypothesis under test was that one treatment has greater efficacy than its comparator. This was because small trials may favour the conclusion that there was no difference between treatments, since the confidence intervals for the two treatments were wide and therefore more likely to include the line of no difference between the two treatments. We assumed equivalence if the point estimate and the 95% confidence limits of the relative risks were between 0.9 to 1.1.</P>
<P>Number Needed to Treat (NNT) was derived from the pooled Odds Ratio using Visual Rx (an online calculator at www.nntonline.net) (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2002</LINK>). NNT was calculated only for the primary outcome.</P>

<P>Of note, the intensity of monitoring (daily or only when symptomatic) was added after publication of the protocol when included trials were reviewed, but before data extraction. This factor, which had not been forecasted, served to stratify trials into daily PF monitoring and/or PF monitoring only when symptomatic.</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analyses to investigate the potential effect of: (1) methodological quality, (2) publication bias, and (3) funding bias on the study results. Funnel plots were used to test for the presence of possible publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>). The fail-safe N test was used to assess the robustness of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Gleser-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleser 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>We examined differences in the magnitude of effect attributable to these subgroups with the residual Chi-squared test from the Peto Odds Ratio (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>).

<P>The initial literature search identified 349 citations. Of these, 345 were excluded for the following reasons: (1) duplicate references (N = 16); (2) not a randomised controlled trial (N = 57); (3) only included an adult patient population (N = 48); (4) included both adult and paediatric patient population without subgroup analysis of the paediatric population (N = 8); (5) medical condition under study was not asthma (N = 11); (6) intervention under study did not include a WAP (N = 170); and (7) group difference in co-interventions did not allow for the determination of the 'net benefit' of the WAP (N = 35). Of note, no RCT was excluded for failing to meet our expanded definition of an action plan. In other words, all RCTs met both the GINA and our definition of a written action plan with perfect agreement between assessors on this issue. Given the large number of exclusion, the references and reasons for exclusion are listed for only for RCT with asthma as the medical condition under study under 'Characteristics of excluded studies'.</P>

<B>Included Studies </B>
<BR/>A total of four citations met eligibility criteria, all of which were full-text publications. The current review aggregated four trials, representing 355 patients. No trial compared the efficacy of the provision of a written action plan versus none in which all other co-interventions were kept equal. All included trials compared one type of action plan to another, namely the provision of a symptom-based versus peak-flow-based action plan, with all other educational co-interventions kept equal. However, the peak-flow based interventions differed in the intensity of monitoring: daily monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>) versus monitoring only when symptomatic (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>); a three-arm study (<LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>) contributed data to both types of monitoring.</P>

<BR/>
<B>
<I>Run-in</I>
</B> <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK> included a four-week run-in period prior to randomisation, while <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK> included a three-month run-in period prior to randomisation. No run-in phase was reported for the other trials.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Study duration </I>
</B>The duration of the intervention phase was three months for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>) while the <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK> study included a 24-month intervention phase. <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK> also included a one-year post-exit phone interview and medical record review of all patients who completed the intervention phase.<BR/>Co-intervention applied to both treatment arms. Asthma education was provided in each study. One study included a nurse visit every two week (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK> 1990). One study included a two-week period of daily practice with their particular form of symptom monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>). In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK> required that all families received asthma education related to the pathophysiology of asthma, asthma triggers, medications, and treatment goals; they were provided with written material reinforcing this information and received training in asthma symptom recognition, that is early and late symptoms indicative of inadequate asthma control, as well as in symptom management. <LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK> provided an educational session for all children at enrolment.</P>
<P>
<B>Characteristics of patients </B>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Age</I>
</B> All trials focused on school-aged children with one study (<LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>) also including teenagers: more specifically, the age range was 7 to 14 years (<LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>), 6 to 12 years (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>) and 6 to 19 years (<LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002a</LINK>). Although the original exclusion criteria of this review was meant to exclude adolescents aged 18 and above, we included the study by Yoos et al., assuming the proportion of participants 18 and 19 years old was likely small and because it was the only included study examining the intervention in the adolescent population. While <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK> included both adults and children, the age range of the paediatric subpopulation was not available.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Gender </I>
</B>All studies included both male and female patients. A larger proportion of males were recruited, with males making up 53.2%, 59% and 63.9% of the total sample size of the <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK> trials respectively. The proportion of males and females recruited into the <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK> was not available. The male to female ratio across study groups within each study were similar (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>: 60% PEF-group versus 68% symptom group), except for one trial in which there was a larger proportion of male in the peak flow group compared to the symptom group, 68% and 39% respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Severity</I>
</B> Asthma severity ranged from mild to severe: it was described as mild to moderate (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>) and moderate in <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>, and moderate to severe (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>). The average severity of airway obstruction was moderate (FEV &lt; 80%) in <LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK> and mild (FEV &gt; 80%) in Yoos (1), although three visits to the ED for asthma in the previous 12 months was an inclusion criteria for Yoos (1). <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK> reported that while all participants met at least BTS-2 severity level, 30% of the peak-flow-based and 20% of the symptom-based group exceeded this severity level.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Recruitment set-up</I>
</B> Patients were recruited from primary care centres only (<LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002a</LINK>), from both primary and secondary care centres (<LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>), and from asthma clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>)</P>

<BR/>
<B>
<I>Person Targeted</I>
</B> All studies formatted WAPs to target both children and parents.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Simplicity</I>
</B> One study identified that the language and reading level of the WAP instructions were at the 6th grade reading level (i.e. a reading level achieved after six years of schooling or roughly that of an 11 year old) (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>). Reading levels for all other WAPs were not available.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Number of Steps </I>
</B>The written action plan generally contained three steps for both intervention groups in all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>), which used four steps for PEF, and five for symptom-based WAP groups. In other words, most studies had only one step-up before the step that recommended seeking medical assistance for both the PEF and symptom-based WAPs (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK> had two and three step-ups before seeking medical assistance in the PEF and Symptoms-based WAP respectively.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Colours and graphics associated with steps</I>
</B> Three studies associated the steps of their WAP with the streetlight colour approach (green-yellow-red) (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>). One study did not specify if any colours or graphics were associated with each step on the WAP (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Step recognition</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Symptom-based WAP</I>
</B> In the three-steps WAPs, step 1 referred to ' normal well-being' while step 2 was associated with 'symptoms of asthma' and step 3, with symptoms suggestive of ' severe respiratory distress'. Symptoms were usually generic although one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>) listed signs and symptoms of distress, which were specific for each child after the child was trained in subjective asthma symptom recognition. Generic symptoms listed under step 2 included persistent cough, dyspnea, wheezing and symptoms of common cold (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>) or increasingly severe asthma symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>). No specific description was provided by <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>. Symptoms indicative of step 3 included: less than two-hour relief following bronchodilator, shortness of breath during normal activities, uncontrolled coughing, or difficulty speaking (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>), "severe symptoms" (<LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>), signs and symptoms of distress specific for the child (<LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>). In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK> listed symptoms of asthma in four steps of increasing severity with the last step being less than 30-minute relief following bronchodilator and difficulty talking.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Peak flow-based WAP</I>
</B> All studies established zones based on the personal best PEF reading of the patient. In the three-steps WAPs, Step 1 referred to peak normal above 70% (<LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>) or above 80% of personal best (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>). Step 2 was a PEF below that of step 1 value but above 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>) or 60% of personal best (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>). Step 3 referred to a PEF less than 60% (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>) or 50% of personal best (<LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>). As for <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>, four steps were provided, namely step 1 greater than 70%, step 2 ranged from 50% to 70%, and step 3 ranged from 30% to 50% and step 4 less than 30%.<BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Intensity of monitoring</I>
</B> There was two intensities of peak flow monitoring namely, daily monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>) or monitoring only when symptomatic (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>). Generally, patients were instructed to record the best of three consecutive peak flow readings daily (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>). All trials required a daily dairy for both symptom-based group except for <LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK> who required recording on symptoms only upon deterioration. <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK> required twice daily dairy recording for all patients and <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK> required twice daily recording for both groups using an electronic spirometer in the blinded mode for the symptom group and in the unblinded mode for the peak flow group. The number of daily recordings required to be made my patients was not available for <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Action plan instructions </B>
<BR/>
<U>
<I>Step 1</I>
</U> Daily anti-inflammatory therapy with inhaled corticosteroid constituted step 1 for both the symptom-based and peak flow-based self-management plans in all trials, except for <LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK> which instructed patients to avoid triggers and take "daily preventative medication", which was taken by 55% of patients. <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK> added an additional step which we considered as fitting between Step 1 and 2 which called for the two puffs of bronchodilator every four hours for the symptom-based WAP only.<BR/>
<U>
<I>Step 2</I>
</U> The initiation of ß2 agonist and the doubling of the dose of inhaled steroids was the recommended instructions in all trials (considered step 3 in <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK> symptom plan).<BR/>
<U>
<I>Step 3</I>
</U> The third step recommended that patients or parents were instructed to call the office or present to the emergency room (red zone) all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>). In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK> included the possible self-initiation oral prednisolone as part of the red zone while <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK> requested the initiation of a course of oral prednisolone and contact with the patient's general practitioner (considered step in <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK> symptom plan).<BR/>

<P>
<B>Funding </B>
<BR/>None of the funding was provided by manufacturers or distributors of peak-flow meters. One study was partially funded by a grant from the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>), one study was funded by NIH grants (<LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002a</LINK>), and one study was supported by grants from the United Kingdom National Asthma Campaign (<LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>). Only one trial was noted to have received some form of private funding, from Glaxo SmithKline, UK, (<LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All studies were parallel group designs. Three trials were identified as being truly randomised-controlled trial, while one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>) reported as a randomised trial actually used a quasi-randomisation scheme. In this trial patients were allocated to one of two interventions based on the last digit of their medication record number as assigned by computer: patients with medical record number ending in an odd number received the PEF-based asthma action plan, whereas those with even numbered records received a symptom-based asthma action plan. </P>
<P>Based on PEDro scores, one study was rated as being of good quality with a PEDro score of 7 (<LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>), two as fair quality with PEDro scores 5 and 4 (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>) and one as poor quality with a PEDro score of 3 (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>). One study was identified as concealing allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>). Allocation was clearly not concealed in one trial that assigned patients according to their hospital number (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>) and whether allocation was concealed was unclear in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>). All trials except one assessed baseline comparability (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>) and adequately followed up patients (<LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>). Blinding of patients, therapist or administrator of WAP was not feasible in any trial. Only one study reported using blinded outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Yoos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yoos 2002</LINK>). No study specified use of intention-to-treat principle.</P>

<B>
<I>Number of patients with asthma exacerbation requiring unscheduled medical or emergency department visits </I>
</B>[Table 01.01]. All studies documented the number of patients requiring at least one acute care visit. Children assigned to symptom monitoring were significantly less likely to require acute care visits for asthma (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).<BR/>The number needed to treat to prevent one acute care visit is nine (95% CI 5 to 138) (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). The fail-safe N test was 1.93 indicating that only two trials reporting no group difference would be needed to reverse this finding. There was too few studies to assess the likelihood of publication or other bias via the funnel plot.</P>
<P>Although there was no evidence of heterogeneity between trials, we conducted the a priori planned subgroup analyses to examine the potential effect of these variables on the risk of patients with an acute care visit. Since all trials identified both the child and family as targeted person, failed to report the reading level (with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>), used the personal best PEF as reference for step identification, and step-up therapy with rescue ß2-agonists and an increased dose of inhaled steroids, we were unable to perform subgroup analysis on these factors.</P>
<P>
<I>Number of steps/colour and graphics</I> [Tables 02.01 and 02.02]. In the more than 3-step WAP with no graphics, significantly less children assigned to symptom-monitoring required acute care visit (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.94) while there was no group difference in the 3-step streetlight WAP (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.13); however, there was no significant difference when the two subgroups were compared with each other (chi2 = 1.28, 1 df, P = 0.26).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review identified four trials comparing symptom-based to peak-flow based written action plans but was unable to identify any trial comparing the benefit of providing versus not providing a written action plan, when all other co-interventions were kept similar. Children assigned to symptom-based action plan had a significantly lower risk of exacerbations requiring an acute care visit and intended more frequently to continue using their plan after the study. Children assigned to peak flow-based action plans experienced a greater reduction in the number of symptomatic days per week. There was no significant difference between the two types of written action plan for any other outcomes, namely need for rescue oral steroids, admission, school absenteeism, lung function, symptom scores, quality of life, or withdrawals. </P>
<P>The relative risk of exacerbation was 27% lower in children who were prescribed an action plan based on symptoms instead of peak-flow. Only nine children needed to receive an action plan based on symptoms to prevent an exacerbation requiring an acute care visit. While the beneficial effect is large, caution is advised in the interpretation of these results because only two trials showing no group differences would be needed to loose statistical significance. Although the results were homogeneous between the five contributing between-group comparisons, we sought to investigate whether any characteristics of the written action plan was associated with greater protection. As the trials were similar, we could not evaluate the effect of the targeted person, reading level, step recognition, prescribed maintenance therapy or recommended step-up therapy on the magnitude of the protection. The small number of relatively homogeneous studies precluded any firm conclusion regarding the number of steps, use of streetlight signs or other graphics, and the intensity of peak flow monitoring on the main outcome. </P>
<P>Regarding secondary analyses, most outcomes showed no group differences between peak flow and symptom based WAPs. However, children assigned to peak flow monitoring experienced a greater reduction (by an extra half day) in the number of symptomatic days per week. There was no significant differences in withdrawal between symptom and peak flow monitoring WAP, and no adverse side effects were reported with the use of in these studies. No unusual patient withdrawal or dropouts were observed across the included studies (drop-outs ranged from 0% to 8%), suggesting that both options were acceptable. Thus, the application of symptom or peak-flow based WAP in the paediatric population appears to satisfactory for children and parents, safe, and not associated with any adverse effects. </P>
<P>Why would the symptom-based action plan be superior to peak-flow based plans for reducing emergency visits? We speculate that it may be due to (1) earlier recognition of exacerbations with symptoms than the peak flow threshold of 70% or 80% used, allowing for earlier intervention for asthma symptoms (step 2), (2) perhaps a higher threshold for presentation to the emergency room in face of severe respiratory distress (step 3) and/or (3) the more acceptable monitoring strategy for child and hence better adherence. Evidently, the first and last hypotheses are only valid if the proposed management is effective; a condition that is not necessarily met for the advice provided in step 2 (asthma symptoms) or 3 (severe distress). The use of maintenance anti-inflammatory medication when the child is well (Step 1) has been clearly shown to be the most effective means to maintain good asthma control and prevent deterioration in children with persistent asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 2003</LINK>). With regards to dealing with new asthma symptoms (step 2), the action plans typically recommended two interventions namely a dose doubling of maintenance inhaled steroids and the addition of rescue inhaled ß2-agonists as needed. Clinical trials have failed to show the superiority of doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) over maintaining the same dose in adults (FitzGerald 2004; <LINK REF="REF-Rice_x002d_McDonald-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rice-McDonald 2005</LINK>) and in children (<LINK REF="REF-Garrett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volovitz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volovitz 2001</LINK>). Thus, if the superiority of symptom-based action plan is based on earlier recognition of symptoms of deterioration (step 2), then earlier treatment with short-acting ß2-agonists likely plays the major role. In this review, three trials allowed the home initiation of oral steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Letz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Letz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>) but fail to distinguish courses of oral steroids initiated at home from those prescribed by the acute care physician. Of interest, in <LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>, which allowed the home initiation of systemic steroids at an earlier step for the peak-flow than the symptom-based group (step 3 versus 4), children managed based on peak-flow measures used more rescue systemic steroids and still presented more often to the emergency visits than their counterparts. These findings may be due to the timing between the administration of oral steroids and the instruction to present to the emergency department. By study design, the peak-flow group in Charlton 1990 was instructed to start oral steroids and then contact their physician. We speculate that most physicians when made aware that the peak flow was less than 50% of personal best, would have recommended an immediate medical visit, thus not allowing time for oral steroids enough time to reduce airway inflammation and prevent an acute care visit.</P>
<P>Irrespective of the efficacy of recommended treatment, there is clear evidence supporting the first hypothesis, namely the earlier recognition of deterioration using symptoms rather than peak flow measures (<LINK REF="REF-Chan_x002d_Yeung-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan-Yeung 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 1995</LINK>). Thus, one important issue is the concordance of step thresholds between the symptom- and the peak-flow based action plans. In other words, perhaps the peak flow cut-offs for step-up therapy (step 2) corresponded to greater severity than the corresponding symptom cut-offs, allowing for delayed intervention, if one is effective. All trials based the peak flow thresholds on personal best rather than reference values, thus probably improving accuracy although no comparative data were available to confirm this assumption. One important potential confounder is the adherence to the recommendations. To determine if the observed benefit was conferred truly conferred by the step-up therapy perhaps initiated earlier, we examine the ratio of acute case visits over number of times the step 2 was activated (outcome 01.02); only two small studies contributed data thus prevented any firm conclusion due to insufficient power. </P>
<P>Our second hypothesis implied that the threshold for presentation to acute care setting (step 3) may have identified exacerbations of lesser severity in the peak-flow than the symptom-based groups, thus artificially increasing acute care visits in the peak flow WAP group. A study with blinded peak flow monitoring for symptom-based action plan and unblinded monitoring for the peak flow based group would contribute fascinating information on the equivalence of the thresholds used. Although one study did use this design (<LINK REF="STD-Wensley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wensley 2004</LINK>), it failed to report any observation regarding the equivalence of the thresholds used. Of interest, the need for medical attention was not only based on symptoms but also failure to respond to short-acting bronchodilator in the symptom-based group while this requirement was consistently absent in peak-flow based action plans. This may suggests that responsiveness to treatment should be considered as a critical indicator for recommending urgent medical attention.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the symptom-based action plan may be associated with better compliance to maintenance therapy (step 1), as well as to steps 2 and 3 instructions. Non-compliance associated with self-management plans are often related to failure to adhere to basic recommendations related to asthma trigger avoidance, (<LINK REF="REF-Desjardins-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desjardins 1993</LINK>) peak flow measurements (<LINK REF="REF-Verschelden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verschelden 1996</LINK>) and importantly daily preventive medication (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 2005</LINK>). In this review, more children of the symptom-based group intended to continue using their action plan at the end of the study than those assigned to the peak flow-based plan, presumably because of easier monitoring. Parents showed no preference. Does the more laborious daily monitoring with peak flow measurements decreased adherence to treatment? In absence of adherence to monitoring, daily management or step-up treatment, this important question cannot be answered. Clearly, adherence should be not only monitored but may even be considered as an outcome. </P>
<P>Why would the peak flow-based action plan be more effective in reducing the number of symptomatic days if it was associated with more emergency visits? Perhaps, the half-day gain resulted in longer treatment of the deterioration (step 2) in the peak flow over the symptom-based groups, thus improving asthma control. It is also possible that the gain was artificially induced by the twice daily peak flow monitoring, thus allowing for earlier detection of improvement than the once daily symptom monitoring. </P>
<P>To our knowledge, this is the first review to examine the efficacy of WAPs in the paediatric population only. While <LINK REF="STD-Toelle-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Toelle 1993</LINK> have examined the provision of WAP in adults and children, they included only one study that enrolled children and adults (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>) with six adult trials. The present review included three additional strictly pediatric trials and one mixed adult and pediatric trial (with sub-group paediatric data (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 1990</LINK>) for a total of 355 children. Thus, the result directly applies to school-aged children with mild to severe asthma; it should not be generalized to preschool-aged children until trials are conduced in this age group. Indeed, the targeted persons for the youngest children are clearly parents who will be responsible for symptom recognition without any substantial hope to validate their impression with peak flow measures. While adherence to monitoring and instructions were not reported, the selection of our primary outcome, the number of children requiring acute care visits for asthma, provides a strong basis for implementation; use of the symptom-based action plan reduced health care resources utilisation in childhood asthma. </P>
<P>The results of this review are strengthened by its methods. This review only includes randomised controlled trials and one quasi-randomised controlled trial, thus reducing bias. Although there was a significant imbalance in the male/female ratio between groups in the Wensley paper, this imbalance is believed to be a chance event, supported by the observation that there were no significant differences for the other 12 baseline characteristics. We obtained confirmation of methodology and data, as well as additional data from all primary authors. There was no evidence of funding bias; yet, there are not enough trials to rule out publication bias. </P>
<P>The findings should be interpreted in the light of the following limitations. First, only four studies were identified. The small number of trials limits the power of detecting significant difference in secondary outcomes and hindered the conduct of our subgroup and sensitivity analyses on our primary outcome to identify key determinants of an effective WAP. Secondly, as with most educational interventions, blinding of intervention is difficult, thus explaining the overall lower methodological quality of included studies than possible with drug trials. Sensitivity analyses, although not powerful, revealed no evidence of bias, due to poor quality. Thirdly, several outcomes such as adherence to monitoring were not or inconsistently reported, thus preventing meta-analysis. Finally, despite our extensive search, this systematic review identified no RCTs addressing whether the provision or not of a WAP is an effective addition to asthma education in children with asthma: this review highlights the paucity of data in this area. Given the universal recommendation calling for the provision of a written action plan to all children with asthma, there is need for trials evaluating the impact of providing or not providing a WAP with asthma education in which all co-interventions were kept equal. </P>
<P>All included trials used our expanded definition of a written action plan, i.e., including recommendations for daily management, in addition to the management of exacerbations. While this review does not provide any comparison between the traditional and our expanded definition of action plan, there is sufficient literature to support the efficacy of daily management in the prevention of exacerbations. There is insufficient evidence to recommend an optimal format and set of instructions for WAP in children. Although it remains unclear which aspect or recommendations of the action plan mediated the beneficial effect, it would appear reasonable to build on prior experience and use the 3-step, streetlight colours/graphics action plan with recommendation for daily anti-inflammatory therapy to serve as comparator for other plans.</P>
<P>If the symptoms-based written action plan is superior to a peak-flow based plan, is there any further need for placebo-controlled trials to prove the efficacy of providing an action plan per se? We believe so because, in absence of such trials, there is no evidence to confirm if peak-flow-based plans are superior, equivalent or inferior to not providing an action plan (placebo). Such study would thus be ethically justified. In view of the low rate of provision of action plans by physicians (<LINK REF="REF-Mangione_x002d_Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangione-Smith 2005</LINK>) clear evidence for efficacy should be provided if one hopes to convince physicians that the extra time and burden of writing an action for every asthmatic (in addition to completing the medical chart and the prescription) is worth their effort. </P>
<P>Participation of both the parent(s) and the young school-aged child are required for appropriate and optimal application of WAP; as such child's preference in monitoring should be favoured. Supported by children's higher endorsement of ongoing use of symptom- over peak-flow based WAP and the uncertainty about matching symptom and peak-flow cut-offs, we would recommend that peak flow-based WAP be reserved to poor perceivers or demonstrators or both.</P>

<LI>There is a gap in knowledge to support the provision of a written action plan as essential element of asthma education to reduce asthma morbidity in children.</LI>
<LI>In a plan recommending daily maintenance steroids with step-up therapy using B2-agonist and increased steroids before urgent medical consultation, the use of symptom-based written plans is more effective than peak-flow based plan for preventing exacerbations requiring an acute care visit and should probably be favoured over peak flow monitoring for most school-aged asthmatic children. Symptom-based action plans are preferred by children. Peak-flow based action plans appear more effective in reducing the number of symptomatic days but this finding may be artificially induced by design. It seems reasonable to reserve peak flow monitoring for children who are poor perceivers of their asthma symptoms.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>There is a need for RCTs comparing the efficacy of WAP versus no WAP in which all other (educational and medical) co-interventions are kept equal, for all study participants; this should be done in several settings (acute care, clinic, hospital) and in different age groups (preschool-aged, school-aged, and adolescents).</LI>
<LI>Further randomised controlled trials are also needed to assess the efficacy of symptom-based versus peak flow-based action plan with good documentation of important outcomes such as symptoms, lung function, use of rescue b2-agonists, quality of life and importantly, adherence to instructions. Preference should be to report change from baseline for all continuous outcomes, with complete reporting of standard deviations.</LI>
<LI>In order to distinguish the efficacy of the WAP as communication tool between health care professionals and patient/parents over its specific treatment recommendation, we suggest that future studies be sufficiently powered to measure and report adherence and treatment as recommended by the WAP, using medication dose counters. Adherence to monitoring strategy should also be documented (e.g., daily peak flow measurement versus measurement only when symptomatic) using peak flow digital recording for example. Preference (or intention to continue) use of monitoring strategy and action plan should also be ascertained.</LI>
<LI>When comparing two types of action plans, it is critical to ensure that the thresholds for action are similar. A study with blinded peak flow monitoring for symptom-based action plan and unblinded monitoring for the peak flow based group would contribute fascinating information on the equivalence of the thresholds used.</LI>
<LI>We are proposing the use of a new outcome termed "acute care visits per number of times step 2 was initiated;" this outcome adjusts for the step activations.</LI>
<LI>Due to the difficulty in blinding, randomised controlled trials should ensure concealment of allocation, blinded assessment of outcomes, minimizing drop-outs, using intention to treat analysis, and consider a sham control procedure in order to meet the standard for high methodological quality.</LI>
<LI>There is a need for the exploration of the cost/benefit ratio of the WAP per se, symptom-based versus peak-flow-based WAP, and its components of guided self-management.</LI>

IF PEAK FLOW IS LESS THAN 70% of normal: 1. Double dose of inhaled steroid for number of days required to achieve previous baseline, 2. Continue on this increased dose for same number of days, 3. Return to previous dose of maintenance treatment. IF PEAK FLOW IS LESS THAN 50% of normal: 1. Start oral prednisolone 40 mg daily (20 mg for children) and contact general practitioner, 2. Continue on this dose for the number of days required to achieve previous baseline. 3. Reduce oral prednisolone to 20 mg daily (10 mg daily for children) for same number of days. 4. Start prednisolone. IF PEAK FLOW IS LESS THAN 30%: 1. Contact general practitioner urgently or, if unavailable. 2. Contact ambulance or, if unavailable, 3. Go directly to hospital</P>
<P>CONTROL GROUP<BR/>Symptom only self management plan with the following description: WHEN YOU FEEL NORMAL continue maintenance treatment: (a) Bronchodilator two times a day or when needed, (b) Inhaled steroid two times a day. IF YOU GET A COLD OR START TO FEEL TIGHT use your bronchodilator two puffs every four hours. IF YOU WAKE WITH WHEEZING AT NIGHT OR HAVE A PERSISTENT COUGH: 1. Double dose of inhaled steroids for number of days it takes you to return to normal, 2. Use bronchodilator two puffs every four hours. IF YOU BRONCHODILATOR ONLY LAST TWO HOURS AND YOU FIND DOING NORMAL ACTIVITIES MAKES YOU SHORT OF BREATH: 1. Start oral prednisolone 40 mg daily (20 mg daily for children) and contact general practitioner, 2. Continue to use this dose for the number of days required to return you to normal, 3.
