<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>What is the effectiveness and safety of a combination of recombinant luteinizing hormone (rLH) and recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) compared to rFSH alone for ovarian stimulation in women undergoing in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>In natural ovarian cycles, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are necessary for the maturation of ovarian follicles. One of the various stimulation regimens in IVF or ICSI cycles is ovarian stimulation with rFSH in combination with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. GnRH analogues prevent premature luteinizing hormone surges. Since they deprive the growing follicles of luteinizing hormone, the question arises as to whether supplementation with recombinant luteinizing hormone (rLH) would increase live birth rates.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found 36 randomized controlled trials comparing rLH combined with rFSH versus rFSH alone among 8125 women undergoing IVF/ICSI. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review, first published in 2007. The evidence is current to June 2016. Only seven of the 36 studies clearly stated that they were funded by government or research institutes. Six were funded by pharmaceutical companies and the rest did not state their source of funding.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found no clear evidence of a difference between rLH combined with rFSH and rFSH alone in rates of live birth or OHSS. The evidence for these comparisons was of very low-quality for live birth and low quality for OHSS. We found moderate quality evidence that the use of rLH combined with rFSH may lead to more ongoing pregnancies than rFSH alone. There was also moderate-quality evidence suggesting little or no difference between the groups in rates of miscarriage. There was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of cancellation due to low response or imminent OHSS, but the evidence for these outcomes was of low or very low quality.</P>
<P>We conclude that the evidence is too limited to encourage or discourage stimulation regimens that include rLH combined with rFSH in IVF/ICSI cycles.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were risk of bias (associated with poor reporting of methods) and imprecision.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined data to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Our primary outcomes were live birth rate and incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-12 12:37:12 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 36 RCTs (8125 women). The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were risk of bias (associated with poor reporting of methods) and imprecision. </P>
<P>Live birth rates: There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between rLH combined with rFSH versus rFSH alone in live birth rates (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.06; n = 499; studies = 4; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63%, very low-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if the live birth rate following treatment with rFSH alone is 17% it will be between 15% and 30% using rLH combined with rFSH.</P>
<P>OHSS: There may be little or no difference between rLH combined with rFSH versus rFSH alone in OHSS rates (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.01; n = 2178; studies = 6; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 10%, low-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of OHSS following treatment with rFSH alone is 1%, it will be between 0% and 1% using rLH combined with rFSH.</P>
<P>Ongoing pregnancy rate: The use of rLH combined with rFSH probably improves ongoing pregnancy rates, compared to rFSH alone (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.42; participants = 3129; studies = 19; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 2%, moderate-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if the ongoing pregnancy rate following treatment with rFSH alone is 21%, it will be between 21% and 27% using rLH combined with rFSH.</P>
<P>Miscarriage rate: The use of rLH combined with rFSH probably makes little or no difference to miscarriage rates, compared to rFSH alone (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.36; n = 1711; studies = 13; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if the miscarriage rate following treatment with rFSH alone is 7%, the miscarriage rate following treatment with rLH combined with rFSH will be between 4% and 9%.</P>
<P>Cancellation rates: There may be little or no difference between rLH combined with rFSH versus rFSH alone in rates of cancellation due to low response (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.10; n = 2251; studies = 11; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 16%, low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if the risk of cancellation due to low response following treatment with rFSH alone is 7%, it will be between 4% and 7% using rLH combined with rFSH.</P>
<P>We are uncertain whether use of rLH combined with rFSH improves rates of cancellation due to imminent OHSS compared to rFSH alone. Use of a fixed effect model suggested a benefit in the combination group (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89; n = 2976; studies = 8; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 60%, very low quality evidence) but use of a random effects model did not support the conclusion that there was a difference between the groups (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.97).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-21 14:20:38 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-13 16:06:28 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>About 15% of couples fail to achieve conception after a year of unprotected intercourse (<LINK REF="REF-Te-Velde-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Te Velde 2000</LINK>). Such couples may choose to undergo an assisted reproductive technology procedure such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-13 16:11:40 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>One of the various stimulation regimens in IVF or ICSI consists of daily administration of subcutaneous injections of recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) to induce multiple follicle growth in the ovaries. An integral part of this stimulation regimen is daily subcutaneous injections of a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue to prevent a premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. Two kinds of GnRH analogues are available, a GnRH agonist or a GnRH antagonist.</P>
<P>The intervention to be compared with this stimulation regimen is the addition of daily subcutaneous injections of recombinant luteinizing hormone (rLH) to rFSH.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-10-21 14:20:38 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Growing follicles become increasingly sensitive to, and ultimately dependent on, the presence of both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) for their development. As described in the classic 'two cell - two gonadotrophin' theory, LH is needed to provide the granulosa cells with androgen precursors for estradiol biosynthesis by FSH (<LINK REF="REF-Short-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Short 1962</LINK>). LH is also needed for the resumption of meiosis and for progesterone production after ovulation to sustain the endometrium. The profound pituitary downregulation with GnRH agonists blocks the output of LH for at least 10 days after cessation of the GnRH agonist and deprives the growing follicles completely of LH stimulation during the entire stimulation phase (<LINK REF="REF-Broekmans-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broekmans 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smitz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smitz 1988</LINK>), while during downregulation with a GnRH antagonist, the output of LH remains present during the stimulation phase and the blockage of LH takes place periovulatory for only three to five days.</P>
<P>In view of the endocrinology of the normal menstrual cycle and the negative impact of the pituitary downregulation on folliculogenesis, the intervention of ovarian stimulation with rLH combined with rFSH in downregulated IVF/ICSI cycles may have beneficial effects for growing follicles and may lead to better pregnancy outcomes compared to rFSH alone. A meta-analysis showed that urinary human menopausal gonadotrophins (HMG), a combination of FSH and hCG in a 1:1 ratio, leads to significantly higher rates in live birth and ongoing pregnancy than rFSH in IVF or ICSI cycles, emphasising a possible role for hCG/LH (<LINK REF="REF-van-Wely-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Wely 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-10-13 16:28:24 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>This is an update of a review first published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Mochtar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mochtar 2007</LINK>). International guidelines do not specify a particular stimulation regimen for IVF or ICSI as regimen of first choice (European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE), American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Nederlandse Vereniging voor Obstetrie en Gynaecologie (NVOG)). Since 2006 a substantial amount of new data on rLH combined with rFSH in comparison to rFSH became available. The continuing uncertainty regarding a role for rLH in ovarian stimulation is still ongoing due to conflicting results from a large number of trials.</P>

<P>There was no evidence of a difference in the live birth rate between women undergoing ovarian stimulation with recombinant luteinizing hormone (rLH) combined with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) and women undergoing ovarian stimulation with rFSH alone, regardless of the type of downregulation.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference in the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome rate or the miscarriage rate following ovarian stimulation with rLH combined with rFSH compared to rFSH alone in gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue downregulated in-vitro fertilisation/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) cycles. There was also no clear evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of cancellation due to low response or imminent OHSS.</P>
<P>However the evidence suggested a higher ongoing pregnancy rate in women treated with rLH combined with rFSH compared to rFSH alone in GnRH analogue downregulated IVF/ICSI cycles.</P>
<P>When studies of women identified as low responders were compared with studies not restricted to women identified as low responders, the ongoing pregnancy rate was higher in women identified as low responders. However the subgroup of low responders was very small (n = 79). This finding requires very cautious interpretation and should be regarded as exploratory.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-18 14:37:24 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>This Cochrane Review sought to evaluate the effectiveness of rLH combined with rFSH compared to rFSH alone for ovarian stimulation in downregulated IVF or ICSI cycles. We included 36 RCTs, totaling 8125 women. The sample sizes in the studies ranged between 30 and 999. Only four of the included studies, totalling 499 women had data on the primary outcome measure, live birth rate. To be able to show a difference of 5% compared to a standard live birth rate of 17%, one would require to include at least 1970 couples. Six of the included studies had data on the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome rate. The evidence is generally applicable to women undergoing the conventional stimulation regimens in GnRH analogue downregulated IVF/ICSI cycles.</P>
<P>The sample size for the subgroup analysis in women with poor ovarian response and in women of advanced age was small, therefore there is insufficient evidence to make a conclusive judgement of any beneficial effect of rLH combined with rFSH in IVF or ICSI cycles compared to rFSH alone in these women.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-04-12 12:38:11 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was very low for live birth, low for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and moderate for ongoing pregnancy and miscarriage. The main limitations in the evidence for the primary outcome live birth rate and for the secondary outcome miscarriage was imprecision, due to the small amount of data. We downgraded the quality of evidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and ongoing pregnancy because there was risk of bias associated with poor reporting of study methods.</P>
<P>Only seven of the 36 studies (19%) clearly stated that they were funded by government or research institutes. Six (17%) were funded by pharmaceutical companies and the rest (64%) did not state their source of funding.</P>

<P>Our results are in agreement with those of a previous systematic review and meta-analysis, comparing rLH combined with rFSH to rFSH alone in GnRH antagonist in downregulated IVF/ICSI cycles (<LINK REF="REF-Xiong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xiong 2014</LINK>).

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-04-12 12:17:45 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no clear evidence of a difference between rLH combined with rFSH and rFSH alone in rates of live birth or OHSS. The evidence for these comparisons was of very low-quality for live birth and low quality for OHSS. We found moderate quality evidence that the use of rLH combined with rFSH may lead to more ongoing pregnancies than rFSH alone. There was also moderate-quality evidence suggesting little or no difference between the groups in rates of miscarriage. There was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of cancellation due to low response or due to imminent OHSS, but the evidence for these outcomes was of low or very low quality.</P>
<P>We conclude that the evidence is too limited to encourage or discourage stimulation regimens that include rLH combined with rFSH in IVF/ICSI cycles.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-04-12 12:36:41 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We suggest a systematic review and meta-analysis addressing the head-to-head comparison of whether HP-HMG or rLH combined with rFSH is the most effective and safe in GnRH analogue downregulated IVF/ICSI cycles. We suggest a cost-effectiveness analysis on the combination of rLH and rFSH compared to rFSH alone in GnRH agonist downregulated IVF/ICSI cycles. In addition, we suggest an individual patient data analysis on the effectiveness of rLH combined with rFSH in women with poor ovarian response and in women of advanced age.
