<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-12 11:53:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Large bleeds in the centre of the brain can cause disability or death in preterm babies. Unstable blood pressure and blood flow to the brain are believed to cause intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (bleeding into the fluid-filled cavities of the brain (ventricles). The drug phenobarbital is believed to stabilise blood pressure and, therefore, potentially help prevent IVH. The review of trials found that there was not enough evidence that postnatal phenobarbital is effective in preventing IVH. Furthermore, phenobarbital suppresses breathing in infants who are breathing spontaneously, causing a need for mechanical ventilation.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-14 20:07:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) is a major complication of preterm birth. Large haemorrhages are associated with a high risk of disability and hydrocephalus. Instability of blood pressure and cerebral blood flow are postulated as causative factors. Another mechanism may involve reperfusion damage from oxygen free radicals. Phenobarbital has been suggested as a safe treatment that stabilises blood pressure and may protect against free radicals.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-08-09 09:09:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effect of postnatal administration of phenobarbital on the risk of IVH, neurodevelopmental impairment or death in preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-08-09 09:09:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the search strategy of the Neonatal Collaborative Review Group. The original review author (A Whitelaw) was an active trialist in this area and had personal contact with many groups in this field. He handsearched journals from 1976 (when cranial computed tomography (CT) scanning started) to October 2000; these included: <I>Pediatrics</I>, <I>Journal of Pediatrics</I>, <I>Archives of Disease in Childhood</I>, <I>Pediatric Research</I>, <I>Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology</I>, <I>Acta Paediatrica</I>, <I>European Journal of Pediatrics</I>, <I>Neuropediatrics</I>, <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>, <I>Lancet </I>and <I>British Medical Journal</I>. We searched the National Library of Medicine (USA) database (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2012, Issue 10) through to 31 October 2012. We did not limit the searches to the English language, as long as the article included an English abstract. We read identified articles in the original language or translated.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-08-09 09:09:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Elisa Smit">
<P>We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials in which phenobarbital was given to preterm infants identified as being at risk of IVH because of gestational age below 34 weeks, birthweight below 1500 g or respiratory failure. Adequate determination of IVH by ultrasound or CT was also required.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-08-09 09:09:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Elisa Smit">
<P>In addition to details of patient selection and control of bias, we extracted the details of the administration of phenobarbital. We searched for the following endpoints: IVH (with grading), posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilation or hydrocephalus, neurodevelopmental impairment and death. In addition, we searched for possible adverse effects of phenobarbitone, for example hypotension, mechanical ventilation, pneumothorax, hypercapnia and acidosis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-09 09:09:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Elisa Smit">
<P>We included 12 controlled trials that recruited 982 infants. There was heterogeneity between trials for the outcome IVH, with three trials finding a significant decrease in IVH and one trial finding an increase in IVH in the group receiving phenobarbital. Meta-analysis showed no difference between the phenobarbital-treated group and the control group in either all IVH (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.91; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.08), severe IVH (typical RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.04), posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilation (typical RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.38 to 2.08), severe neurodevelopmental impairment (typical RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.41 to 5.04) or death before hospital discharge (typical RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.21). There was a consistent trend in the trials towards increased use of mechanical ventilation in the phenobarbital-treated group, which was supported by the meta-analysis (typical RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.32; typical risk difference 0.129; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.21), but there was no significant difference in pneumothorax, acidosis or hypercapnia.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Postnatal administration of phenobarbital cannot be recommended as prophylaxis to prevent IVH in preterm infants and is associated with an increased need for mechanical ventilation.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-08-09 09:09:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) is a major complication of preterm birth and large haemorrhages or haemorrhages associated with parenchymal brain lesions have a high rate of disability (<LINK REF="REF-Vohr-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vohr 1989</LINK>). Massive IVH may result in death from hypovolaemia and large haemorrhages may result in hydrocephalus in infants who survive (<LINK REF="REF-Volpe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpe 1995</LINK>). IVH in preterm infants originates, not from an artery, but from capillaries of the subependymal germinal matrix. The particular vulnerability of premature infants is thought to result from a) a subependymal germinal matrix that is rich in immature vessels poorly supported by connective tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Hambleton-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hambleton 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gould-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 1987</LINK>), b) marked fluctuations in cerebral blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Perlman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 1983</LINK>), and c) severe respiratory problems that result in major swings in intrathoracic and venous pressure that are then transmitted to the fragile germinal matrix (<LINK REF="REF-Nakamura-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakamura 1990</LINK>). In addition, there is evidence that ischaemia followed by reperfusion plays a role in the pathogenesis and that cerebral ischaemia may result from IVH. This may take the form of periventricular haemorrhagic infarction (PHI) (<LINK REF="REF-Volpe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpe 1995</LINK>). PHI lesions are typically unilateral and in continuity with the margin of the lateral ventricle. The aetiology is thought to be obstruction of venous drainage by a blood clot in the germinal matrix. Interventions aimed at prevention of IVH or its consequences might be targeted at any one (or more) of the above mechanisms.</P>
<P>The non-invasive diagnosis of IVH during life was first made by cerebral computed tomography (CT) but the need for transport and the ionising radiation made this method unsuitable for studies of whole populations.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis of intraventricular haemorrhage by ultrasound</HEADING>
<P>Cranial ultrasound can be carried out at the cot side and exposes the infant to no ionising radiation. This enables whole populations of infants to be safely and ethically examined. Papile's classification of IVH was originally developed for CT (<LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK>), but was quickly implemented by ultrasonographers. Grade I haemorrhage is confined to the subependymal germinal matrix with no blood clot in the lumen. Grade II haemorrhage is a small haemorrhage within the ventricular lumen without ventricular dilation. Grade III haemorrhage is a large haemorrhage sufficient to expand the ventricle from the amount of blood. Grade IV haemorrhage is IVH plus parenchymal haemorrhagic venous infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Volpe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpe 1995</LINK>). Although ultrasound diagnosis of germinal matrix haemorrhage is not perfect with sensitivity of 61% and specificity 78%, the diagnosis of IVH shows high sensitivity (91%) and specificity (81%), as does diagnosis of parenchymal haemorrhage (sensitivity 82% and specificity 97%) (<LINK REF="REF-Hope-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 1988</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Timing of intraventricular haemorrhage</HEADING>
<P>Approximately 80% of IVH occurs within 72 hours of birth but a considerable proportion of IVH is visible on the first scan within a few hours of birth (<LINK REF="REF-Levene-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levene 1982</LINK>). This means that interventions to prevent IVH should ideally start before delivery and should be commenced soon after birth.</P>

<P>Phenobarbital is a barbiturate that acts on the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors in the central nervous system. Phenobarbital prolongs and potentiates the action of GABA on GABAA receptors and at higher concentrations activates the receptors directly.

<P>In addition, review authors independently assessed study quality and risk of bias using the following criteria documented in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). </P>
<UL>
<LI>Sequence generation: was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</LI>

<LI>Incomplete outcome data for each main outcome or class of outcomes: were incomplete data adequately addressed?</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting: are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</LI>
<LI>Other sources of bias: was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? We will give particular attention to baseline imbalance in factors and to the length of follow-up studies to identify whether any benefits claimed were robust.</LI>

<P>The infants participating were relatively similar, being preterm infants who were at risk of IVH either because of gestational age below 34 weeks, birthweight below 1500 g, respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation or a combination of these factors. Cranial ultrasound was carried out before trial entry in only five trials and infants who already had IVH were thereby excluded. It is very likely that some infants in the trials already had IVH before randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Donn-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Donn 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anwar-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Anwar 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruth-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ruth 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mas_x002d_Munoz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Mas-Munoz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sluncheva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sluncheva 2006</LINK>). Despite randomisation, three trials had unbalanced treatment groups at randomisation. Kuban's trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kuban-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kuban 1986</LINK>) had lower gestational age and birthweight in the phenobarbital group, Sluncheva's trial had greater gestational age and birthweight in the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Sluncheva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sluncheva 2006</LINK>), and Porter's trial had lower Apgar score in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Porter-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Porter 1985</LINK>).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sluncheva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sluncheva 2006</LINK> used no loading dose of phenobarbital (infants were treated with 5 mg/kg for five days). The other 11 trials started treatment by injection of a loading dose, the dose varying between 20 mg/kg (nine trials) and 30 mg/kg (two trials). Seven of the trials divided the loading dose into two separate injections with 30-minute, four-hour or 12-hour intervals. In 10 trials, maintenance therapy with phenobarbital was given for three to seven days. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Sluncheva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sluncheva 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Liang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2009</LINK>, blood levels of phenobarbital were measured in all the trials, but were not revealed to the clinicians in the two double-blind trials (<LINK REF="STD-Whitelaw-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Whitelaw 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuban-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kuban 1986</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes in included studies</HEADING>
<P>The main outcome, IVH, was ascertained by ultrasonography in 10 trials and by CT in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Liang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2009</LINK>). IVH was classified in a way that made it possible to grade them as mild (grade I or II according to Papile) or severe (grade III or IV according to Papile). In Whitelaw's original paper (<LINK REF="STD-Whitelaw-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Whitelaw 1983</LINK>), this type of grading was not used, but the scan reports by ultrasonographers blinded to treatment have been reclassified by Dr Whitelaw (who did have knowledge of treatment by this time).</P>
<P>Ten reports gave some data on mortality. Mortality data from Kuban's trial were not given in the original publication (<LINK REF="STD-Kuban-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kuban 1986</LINK>), but were subsequently supplied as a personal communication from Dr Kuban to Dr Horbar (<LINK REF="REF-Horbar-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horbar 1992</LINK>). The age-limit for ascertainment of mortality was not stated by <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Liang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2009</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Sluncheva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sluncheva 2006</LINK> recorded mortality up to 10 days of age. <LINK REF="STD-Ruth-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ruth 1988</LINK> provided mortality data up to 27 months of age.</P>
<P>Data on potential adverse effects were provided in many of the reports, for example hypotension in three, hypercapnia in five, acidosis in six and mechanical ventilation in all cases where ventilation was not a mandatory inclusion criterion. The numbers of days during which data were recorded for hypotension, hypercapnia and acidosis varied between the trials from one to seven days. The definition of acidosis varied, being less than 7.2 in three trials, less than 7.15 in two trials and need for sodium bicarbonate therapy in one trial.</P>

This suggests that prophylactic phenobarbital treatment would, on average, result in one extra infant receiving mechanical ventilation for every eight preterm infants treated.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-08-09 10:59:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Horbar's systematic review of postnatal phenobarbital for preterm infants included eight trials and noted the heterogeneity between trials concerning any IVH and severe IVH (<LINK REF="REF-Horbar-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horbar 1992</LINK>). The author concluded that postnatal phenobarbital could not be recommended but the question was raised that, in specific settings, phenobarbital might be beneficial. Horbar's review did not present data on ventricular dilation, neuromotor impairment, mechanical ventilation, hypotension, pneumothorax or acidosis.</P>
<P>In the original review, it was possible to include one more trial than in Horbar's systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Horbar-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horbar 1992</LINK>), and to include more data from Whitelaw's trial (<LINK REF="STD-Whitelaw-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Whitelaw 1983</LINK>). The updated reviews in 2007 and 2012 included additional studies (one in 2007 and two in 2012). The original and subsequent updated reviews also covered ventricular dilation and neuromotor impairment, as well as possible cardiorespiratory and acid-base side effects of the intervention. The statistical heterogeneity concerning all grades of IVH persists but no longer applied to severe IVH. This review supports Horbar's conclusion that phenobarbital does not reduce the frequency of IVH, severe IVH or death and provides new evidence that phenobarbital increases the need for mechanical ventilation. The data now available do not identify any specific setting where prophylactic phenobarbital might reduce the risk of IVH.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological considerations</HEADING>
<P>There is some clinical heterogeneity between the 12 trials but the infants recruited were all similar in that they were preterm, and at risk of IVH because of their immaturity or respiratory failure or both. Although the dosages of phenobarbital varied, they all gave plasma phenobarbital concentrations in the recommended anticonvulsant range for 72 hours, the period during which IVH usually occurs. There does not appear to be a publication bias as illustrated by the funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). The risk of bias in the included studies is summarised graphically (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>A cause for concern was that seven of the trials did not have a normal cranial ultrasound scan as an entry criterion. The three trials that found that postnatal phenobarbital reduced IVH were open trials that lacked a pre-randomisation cerebral ultrasound scan (<LINK REF="STD-Donn-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Donn 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2009</LINK>). Some of the IVH reported could have arisen before the administration of phenobarbital. The double-blind trial by <LINK REF="STD-Kuban-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kuban 1986</LINK> was planned with adequate sample size; however, randomisation did not result in the two groups having similar risk factors for IVH since the group receiving phenobarbital had a significantly greater risk for IVH than did the control group at the time of randomisation. These factors in the trials by <LINK REF="STD-Donn-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Donn 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuban-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kuban 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2009</LINK> could contribute to the heterogeneity found for the outcome, all grades of IVH. It is important to point out that only one of the trials showed a significant difference for severe IVH (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2009</LINK>), but the meta-analysis did not show a significant difference.</P>
<P>It is worth noting the relatively late timing of the initial injection of phenobarbital and the splitting of the loading dose so that it would have been well after 12 hours, in some cases, before anticonvulsant plasma concentrations of phenobarbital could have been achieved. Many IVHs have started by 12 hours of age. The difficulty in achieving therapeutic blood levels of phenobarbital before many IVHs have started was one reason for testing antenatal maternal administration of phenobarbital. <LINK REF="STD-Sluncheva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sluncheva 2006</LINK> did not use a loading dose. Prophylactic antenatal phenobarbital is the subject of a separate Cochrane systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2010</LINK>, which concluded that the trials with most reliable methodology showed no evidence that the intervention was effective in reducing IVH.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Absence of therapeutic advantage</HEADING>
<P>The results from the meta-analyses of postnatal phenobarbital for preterm infants showed no significant difference between the phenobarbital-treated group and the control group with respect to all grades of IVH, severe IVH, death, posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilation or neurodevelopmental impairment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential side effects</HEADING>
<P>In the current review, the only adverse effect associated with phenobarbital that reached statistical significance was mechanical ventilation, with no significant difference with respect to hypotension, acidosis, hypercapnia or pneumothorax. Increased need for mechanical ventilation is a clinically relevant adverse effect because of the associated iatrogenic risks such as tube blockage, infection, trauma to the larynx and the increased level of equipment and nursing required. Clearly, respiratory depression in spontaneously breathing infants with inadequate monitoring is potentially dangerous.</P>
<P>Since the original publication of this review, it has become apparent that administration of antiepileptic drugs in the newborn period may have a harmful effect on the developing brain. Phenobarbital has a proapoptotic effect in newborn rat brains (<LINK REF="REF-Bittigau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bittigau 2002</LINK>). More recently, it has been shown that neonatal rat exposure to a single dose of phenobarbital results in reduced synaptic connectivity in the striatum (<LINK REF="REF-Forcelli-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forcelli 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other approaches</HEADING>
<P>Postnatal phenobarbital is not generally used in preterm infants as prophylaxis against IVH but a general decrease in IVH has been noted in developed countries since the 1980s despite an increase in survival of very immature infants. Maternal corticosteroid administration before preterm delivery has been mainly responsible for this decrease in IVH as demonstrated in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Of the other pharmacological interventions assessed, indomethacin appeared promising, but results of a multicentre trial of indomethacin recruiting 1200 infants with birthweights below 1100 g showed that the reduction in IVH was not accompanied by an improvement in survival without disability (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2001</LINK>). Although IVH has been reduced in many centres, posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus remains a problem without an effective treatment and requires further research into mechanisms and treatment. See Cochrane reviews on diuretic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 2001b</LINK>), repeated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tapping (<LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 2001</LINK>) and intraventricular streptokinase (<LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 2001a</LINK>).</P>
