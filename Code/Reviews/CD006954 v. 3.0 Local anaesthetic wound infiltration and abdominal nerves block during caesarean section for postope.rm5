<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-06 09:12:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Childbirth by caesarean section is becoming more frequent. Caesarean section requires an anaesthetic, either spinal, spinal epidural, epidural block or general anaesthesia. Postoperative pain is managed with a combination of an opioid such as morphine or pethidine and other analgesics. Opioids cause sedation and they can transfer to breast milk, also sedating the newborn infant. Childbirth is a deeply emotional experience and involves bonding with the newborn and starting breastfeeding. Improvements in pain relief that make the postanaesthesia period less uncomfortable are important. During the operation, local anaesthetic can be injected to block the nerves before cutting the skin or after closing the skin at the end of the operation (abdominal nerve block) or the wound can be irrigated or infiltrated with local anaesthetic solution to reduce postoperative pain (pre-emptive wound analgesia).</P>
<P>The authors identified twenty randomised controlled trials of sufficient quality involving 1150 women. These trials were carried out in both developed and developing countries. In general, local anaesthesia wound infiltration was of benefit in women having a caesarean section requiring regional anaesthetics because of a reduction in the use of opioid analgesia. Women undergoing general anaesthesia who had wound infiltration with local anaesthetics and peritoneal spraying required lower amounts of opioids in the first 24 hours post-operation compared to saline control. Those who had a general anaesthetic and the abdominal wall nerves blocked had reduced pain scores within the first 24 hours postoperative.</P>
<P>Women who had regional anaesthesia and abdominal nerves blocked also benefited by decrease in opioid requirements. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provided additional pain relief but with more side effects of pruritus. The commonly used local anaesthetic agents do have side effects but these are very rare, ranging from allergy to cardiovascular and central nervous system effects. There was no report of side effects in infants following local anaesthetic infiltration but the number of women studied was small. The longer theatre time and cost of the local anaesthetic may be offset by less use of postoperative analgesia. The effect on the development of chronic pelvic pain should be an important area of research.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-05 16:31:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Twenty studies (1150 women) were included. Women who had caesarean section performed under regional analgesia and had wound infiltration had a decrease in morphine consumption at 24 hours (SMD -1.70mg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75 to -0.94) compared to placebo.</P>
<P>In women under general anaesthesia, with caesarean section wound infiltration and peritoneal spraying with local anaesthetic (one study, 100 participants), the need for opioid rescue was reduced (risk ratio (RR) 0.51; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.69). The numerical pain score (0 to10) within the first hour was also reduced (mean difference (MD) -1.46; 95% CI -2.60 to -0.32).</P>
<P>Women with regional analgesia who had local anaesthetic and non-steriodal anti-inflammatory cocktail wound infiltration consumed less morphine (one study, 60 participants; MD -7.40 mg; 95% CI -9.58 to -5.22) compared to local anaesthetic control.</P>
<P>Women who had regional analgesia with abdominal nerves blocked had decreased opioid consumption (four studies, 175 participants; MD -25.80 mg; 95% CI -50.39 to -5.37).</P>
<P>For the outcome of visual analogue scale 0 to 10 over 24 hours, no advantage was demonstrated in the single study of 50 participants who had wound infiltrated with a mixture of local analgesia and narcotics versus local analgesia.</P>
<P>Addition of ketamine to the local analgesia in women who had regional analgesia does not confer any advantage.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-06 09:12:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Caesarean section delivery is becoming more frequent and is one of the most common major operative procedures performed worldwide. Widely varying rates of caesarean section have been quoted from around the world. What is certain is that the rate is increasing. In the United States, a caesarean section rate of 26% for all births is reported (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2002</LINK>). It approaches 25% in Canada and is over 20% in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2001</LINK>). In the private health sector in South Africa, one study noted a much higher figure of 57% (<LINK REF="REF-Tshabangu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tshabangu 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Childbirth is a profound emotional experience for a woman and her family. The mother needs to bond with the newborn baby as early as possible. The need for early breastfeeding cannot be over-emphasised. Breastfeeding is economical, and it is emotionally satisfying to most women. It helps to contract the uterus and accelerates the process of uterine involution in the postpartum period. It promotes mother-infant bonding. It may also protect the breast against future cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Pernoll-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pernoll 1991</LINK>). Any form of intervention that leads to improvement in pain relief can positively impact on early breastfeeding. Prompt and adequate postoperative pain relief is therefore an important component of caesarean delivery that can make the immediate postdelivery period less discomforting and more emotionally gratifying. Management of postoperative pain after caesarean section has mostly involved the use of opioids in combination with other forms of analgesics (multimodal analgesic regimen). Any intervention that can alleviate postoperative pain is worthy of investigation, and any procedural intervention that is performed while carrying out the surgery needs to be adequately assessed before being widely accepted as the norm.</P>
<P>Caesarean section is done under spinal anaesthesia, spinal epidural, epidural block or general anaesthesia. Intraoperatively, short- or medium-acting sedatives, narcotics and local anaesthesia have been employed as an adjunct to anaesthesia or to alleviate postoperative pain. Local anaesthetics cause reversible blockade of impulse propagation along the nerve fibres by preventing the influx of sodium ions through the cell membrane of the nerve fibres. Several studies have given reports on pre-emptive local anaesthetics (local anaesthetic given during operation to prevent or reduce pain after operation) to relieve postoperative pain, ranging from being beneficial (<LINK REF="STD-Ganta-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ganta 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 1997</LINK>) to no benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The timing of local anaesthetic administration may either be by pre- or post-incisional abdominal nerve block (local anaesthetics injected to block the nerves before cutting the skin at the beginning of operation, or after closing the skin at the end of operation) (<LINK REF="STD-Trotter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Trotter 1991</LINK>) or pre- or post-incisional abdominal wound infiltration (<LINK REF="STD-Ganta-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ganta 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1999</LINK>). It may also be by continuous wound irrigation (<LINK REF="STD-Givens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Givens 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several local anaesthetic agents have been used as pre-emptive analgesia (xylocaine, bupivacaine or ropivacaine at different concentrations), either on their own or in combination with opioids. The commonly used local anaesthetic agents have side effects, even though very rare, ranging from allergy to cardiovascular and central nervous system effects. The effects on wound healing may be beneficial as the local anaesthetic agent is often combined with vasoconstrictors. Ropivacaine on its own has an intrinsic vasoconstricting property. Local anaesthetics eventually get absorbed systemically and secreted in breast milk but side effects on breastfed babies have not yet been documented. This is in sharp contrast to morphine or pethidine, both of which have a significant transfer to breast milk and may have a sedative effect on the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Pernoll-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pernoll 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is also important to consider the additional cost implication of this intervention. Should it prove to be of benefit, the actual cost of the local anaesthetic and the added time needed to carry out the procedure may be justified, considering the long-term sequelae of pain and immobility in the immediate post-caesarean section period.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Wound infiltration with local anaesthetics only versus control</HEADING>
<P>Women who had caesarean section performed under regional anaesthesia and had wound infiltration had a decrease in morphine consumption at 24 hours (three studies, 126 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.70mg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75, -0.94) compared to placebo. There was no difference in visual analogue pain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Peritoneal spraying/instillation and abdominal wound infiltration involving all layers</HEADING>
<P>In women under general anaesthetic, who had the caesarean section wound infiltrated and peritoneal spraying with local anaesthetic (one study, 100 participants), the need for opioid rescue was reduced (risk ratio (RR) 0.51; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.69). Numerical pain score (0 to 10) within the first hour was reduced (MD -1.46; 95% CI -2.60 to -0.32).</P>
<P>The amount of oral tramacet (375 mg paracetamol + 150 mg tramadol) consumed was reduced in the local anaesthetic group compared to saline control (MD -2.35 mg; 95% CI -3.62 to -1.08).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Local anaesthetics versus local anaesthetic and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) mixture</HEADING>
<P>Women operated under regional anaesthesia and who had a local anaesthetic and NSAID cocktail wound infiltration consumed less morphine in the first 18 hours (one study, 60 participants; MD -7.40 mg; 95% CI -9.58 to -5.22) compared to local anaesthetic only control. There was no difference in the occurrence of vomiting or reduction in antiemetic usage (RR 1.40 mg; 95% CI 0.90 to 2.16).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Anterior abdominal nerves block with local anaesthetic versus control</HEADING>
<P>Women who had regional anaesthesia and had the abdominal nerves blocked had decreased opioid consumption (four studies, 175 participants; MD -25.80 mg; 95% CI -50.39 to -5.37) but no difference in visual analogue pain score (0 to 10) (one study, 59 participants; RR -5.00; 95% CI -11.27 to -1.21).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Local anaesthetics versus local anaesthetics + narcotics</HEADING>
<P>for the outcome visual analogue scale over 24 hours, no advantage was demonstrated in the single study of 50 participants who had wound infiltration with a mixture of local anaesthetic and narcotics versus local anaesthetics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">6. Local anaesthetics versus local anaesthetics + ketamine</HEADING>
<P>Addition of ketamine to the local anaesthetic in women who had regional anaesthesia, does not confer any advantage neither in terms of narcotic consumption nor patient satisfaction. (One study and fifty participants)</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-06 09:29:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Minimising pain after caesarean section is best achieved using a multimodal approach. Local anaesthetics from lidocaine to the more recent ropivacaine have been used as pre-emptive analgesics since the 1980s. Clinical trials were only published in the early 1990s. Local anaesthetic has been used with women undergoing general anaesthetic, regional anaesthesia and rarely purely under local anaesthetic when other anaesthesia was unavailable or unsafe. Various routes of administration have been tested such as subcutaneous wound infiltration, infiltration through all layers of the abdomen, continuous wound instillation or iliohypogastric/ilioinguinal nerve blocks. Ultrasound guided nerve blocks may soon be explored. Local anaesthetic has been used either alone or in combination with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents or ketamine.</P>
<P>This review showed that women undergoing regional analgesia who had local anaesthetic infiltration or abdominal nerve block had reduction in the use of postoperative opioids. Addition of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to the local anaesthetic for caesarean section wound infiltration conferred additional advantage. This may be explained because of the addition of another type of analgesic with a different mode of action. Opioid consumption may not be the optimal method of pain assessment because of being influenced by the patients' fear of dependency, but this effect is balanced by the randomisation process. Significant results must be regarded with caution because of testing at multiple times and the results are mostly based on single trials involving few women.</P>
<P>None of the trials addressed the effect on chronic pelvic pain and cost implications.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-11-09 19:37:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In general, local anaesthesia is of benefit in women having a caesarean section by reduction in opioid consumption. It can be recommended, with consideration to affordability, as part of the multimodal approach to pain relief.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-02-06 14:12:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A cost-benefit analysis is needed. There will be more theatre time spent and cost of the local anaesthetic and accessories. This may be offset by less use of postoperative analgesia. A pharmacokinetic study of local anaesthetic absorption following wound and peritoneal infiltration is necessary. Ultrasound guided direct block of anterior abdominal wall nerves in caesarean section should be explored. An important research agenda will also be the effect of the intervention on chronic pelvic pain.</P>
