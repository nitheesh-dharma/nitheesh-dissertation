<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence for the effects of music interventions on functional outcomes in adults with acquired brain injury.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Acquired brain injury (brain damage through accident or illness, including stroke, that is unlikely to degenerate further) can cause problems with movement, language, sensation, thinking, or emotion. Any of these can severely reduce a survivor's quality of life. Many new treatments have been developed to help recover lost functions and to prevent depression. Music interventions involve using music to aid rehabilitation. Specific treatments may include using rhythm to aid movement and walking; playing music instruments to improve movement; singing to improve speaking and voice quality; listening to music to improve pain management, mood, or thinking; and playing and composing music to improve a sense of well-being.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We aimed to identify research studies that tested music interventions combined with standard care for adults with acquired brain injury who were receiving rehabilitation in hospital or community settings. We looked for research that tested the effects of music interventions on walking, moving, communicating, thinking, emotions, pain, and well-being. Interventions included moving to music, singing, listening to music, composing, playing musical instruments, or a combination of these. We identified and included 29 trials involving 775 adult participants. The evidence is current to June 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The results suggest that music interventions using rhythm may be beneficial for improving walking in people with stroke, and this may improve quality of life. Music interventions may be beneficial for improving the speed of repetitive arm movements and communication in people with stroke. Music interventions that use a strong beat within music may be more effective than interventions where a strong beat is used without music. Treatment delivered by a trained music therapist might be more effective than treatment delivered by other professionals. Information was insufficient to examine the effects of music interventions on other outcomes. We found no studies that reported on harmful effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the research was generally low. We found only one study that we considered as having a low risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for walking speed and stride length was moderate. The quality of the evidence for other aspects of walking was low. The quality of the evidence for the speed of repetitive arm movements was very low, as was the quality of the evidence for overall communication. The quality of the evidence for quality of life was low. Further clinical trials are needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-08 12:51:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Acquired brain injury (ABI) can result in impairments in motor function, language, cognition, and sensory processing, and in emotional disturbances, which can severely reduce a survivor's quality of life. Music interventions have been used in rehabilitation to stimulate brain functions involved in movement, cognition, speech, emotions, and sensory perceptions. An update of the systematic review published in 2010 was needed to gauge the efficacy of music interventions in rehabilitation for people with ABI.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-11-08 12:51:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To assess the effects of music interventions for functional outcomes in people with ABI. We expanded the criteria of our existing review to: 1) examine the efficacy of music interventions in addressing recovery in people with ABI including gait, upper extremity function, communication, mood and emotions, cognitive functioning, social skills, pain, behavioural outcomes, activities of daily living, and adverse events; 2) compare the efficacy of music interventions and standard care with a) standard care alone, b) standard care and placebo treatments, or c) standard care and other therapies; 3) compare the efficacy of different types of music interventions (music therapy delivered by trained music therapists versus music interventions delivered by other professionals).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-11-08 12:51:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1946 to June 2015), Embase (1980 to June 2015), CINAHL (1982 to June 2015), PsycINFO (1806 to June 2015), LILACS (1982 to January 2016), and AMED (1985 to June 2015). We handsearched music therapy journals and conference proceedings, searched dissertation and specialist music databases, trials and research registers, reference lists, and contacted relevant experts and music therapy associations to identify unpublished research. We imposed no language restriction. We performed the original search in 2009.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-11-08 12:51:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared music interventions and standard care with standard care alone or combined with other therapies. We examined studies that included people older than 16 years of age who had ABI of a non-degenerative nature and were participating in treatment programmes offered in hospital, outpatient, or community settings. We included studies in any language, published and unpublished.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-10-12 14:58:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We contacted trial researchers to obtain missing data or for additional information when necessary. Where possible, we presented results for continuous outcomes in meta-analyses using mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used post-test scores. In cases of significant baseline difference, we used change scores. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of the randomisation method.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-19 11:36:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We identified 22 new studies for this update. The evidence for this update is based on 29 trials involving 775 participants. A music intervention known as rhythmic auditory stimulation may be beneficial for improving the following gait parameters after stroke. We found a reported increase in gait velocity of 11.34 metres per minute (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.40 to 14.28; 9 trials; 268 participants; P &lt; 0.00001; moderate-quality evidence). Stride length of the affected side may also benefit, with a reported average of 0.12 metres more (95% CI 0.04 to 0.20; 5 trials; 129 participants; P = 0.003; moderate-quality evidence). We found a reported average improvement for general gait of 7.67 units on the Dynamic Gait Index (95% CI 5.67 to 9.67; 2 trials; 48 participants; P &lt; 0.00001). There may also be an improvement in gait cadence, with a reported average increase of 10.77 steps per minute (95% CI 4.36 to 17.18; 7 trials; 223 participants; P = 0.001; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Music interventions may be beneficial for improving the timing of upper extremity function after stroke as scored by a reduction of 1.08 seconds on the Wolf Motor Function Test (95% CI -1.69 to -0.47; 2 trials; 122 participants; very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Music interventions may be beneficial for communication outcomes in people with aphasia following stroke. Overall, communication improved by 0.75 standard deviations in the intervention group, a moderate effect (95% CI 0.11 to 1.39; 3 trials; 67 participants; P = 0.02; very low-quality evidence). Naming was reported as improving by 9.79 units on the Aachen Aphasia Test (95% CI 1.37 to 18.21; 2 trials; 35 participants; P = 0.02). Music interventions may have a beneficial effect on speech repetition, reported as an average increase of 8.90 score on the Aachen Aphasia Test (95% CI 3.25 to 14.55; 2 trials; 35 participants; P = 0.002).</P>
<P>There may be an improvement in quality of life following stroke using rhythmic auditory stimulation, reported at 0.89 standard deviations improvement on the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale, which is considered to be a large effect (95% CI 0.32 to 1.46; 2 trials; 53 participants; P = 0.002; low-quality evidence). We found no strong evidence for effects on memory and attention. Data were insufficient to examine the effect of music interventions on other outcomes.</P>
<P>The majority of studies included in this review update presented a high risk of bias, therefore the quality of the evidence is low.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-08 12:52:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Music interventions may be beneficial for gait, the timing of upper extremity function, communication outcomes, and quality of life after stroke. These results are encouraging, but more high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed on all outcomes before recommendations can be made for clinical practice.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-08 12:54:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-08 12:53:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Acquired brain damage embraces a range of conditions involving rapid onset of brain injury, including trauma due to head injury or postsurgical damage, vascular event such as stroke or subarachnoid haemorrhage, cerebral anoxia, toxic or metabolic insult such as hypoglycaemia, and infection or inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-RCP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 2012</LINK>). Acquired brain injury (ABI) can result in impairments in motor function, language, cognition, sensory processing, as well as emotional disturbances. Hemiplegia and hemiparesis are common and may severely reduce a survivor's quality of life. Consequently, a primary concern in rehabilitation for ABI is the restoration of motor function. The improvement of ambulation and upper extremity function directly affects the level of independence of the person with ABI related to activities of daily living. The affected individual is likely to be left with communication impairments, such as a severely reduced ability to understand, speak, and use spoken and written language, which can result in isolation. Furthermore, brain damage often leads to disturbances in memory, learning, and awareness. Sensory disturbances and neuropathic pain can result from damage to the nervous system. Finally, there may be behavioral implications resulting in disinhibition, apathy, and a lack of motivation. Recovery of lost functions and skills after acquired brain damage is typically incomplete, putting survivors at increased risk for depression. Poststroke depression and apathy are estimated to be as high as 33%, impeding functional recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Matsuzaki-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuzaki 2015</LINK>). Mood disorders are considered to be one of the greatest barriers to reintegration back into the community, affecting motivation to engage in rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Giles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2006</LINK>). Effective treatment of depression may bring substantial benefits by improving medical status, enhancing quality of life, and reducing pain and disability (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Port-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Port 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whyte-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acquired brain injury causes significant levels of disabilities that tend to result in long-term problems. There were an estimated 316,080 people living with disabilities stemming from stroke, and a further 170,000 people per year who sustained a traumatic brain injury in the UK in 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-NA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NA 2014</LINK>). Figures from the US exceed those in the UK, with an estimated 3.5 million people sustaining a traumatic brain injury each year (<LINK REF="REF-Coronado-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coronado 2012</LINK>), of whom 125,000 will be left with long-term disability (<LINK REF="REF-Selassie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selassie 2008</LINK>). Approximately 5.3 million Americans, or 2% of the population of all ages, have long term or lifelong needs for help in performing personal activities of daily living following traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Selassie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selassie 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thurman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaloshnja-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaloshnja 2008</LINK>). In 2010, 16.9 million people had a first stroke, and the worldwide prevalence of stroke was 33 million (<LINK REF="REF-Mozaffarian-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozaffarian 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Global health burden attributed to ABI resulting from stroke and traumatic brain injury is considerable. Furthermore, with the population ageing, even if the stroke incidence stagnates, the number of people with stroke requiring medical and rehabilitation care will rise dramatically (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>). In Europe alone in 2010, estimated costs were EUR 64.1 billion for stroke and EUR 33.0 billion for traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Gustavsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gustavsson 2010</LINK>). In the USA, traumatic brain injury annual costs are estimated at USD 221 billion, comprising USD 14.6 billion for medical costs, USD 69.2 billion for work loss, and USD 137 billion for lost quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Orman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orman 2011</LINK>). Acquired brain injury therefore has significant effects on society in terms of human and economic costs.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-08 12:53:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Many innovative therapy methods have been developed to help restore lost functions and aid in the prevention and treatment of depression in ABI. Music therapy has been used in rehabilitation settings to stimulate brain functions involved in movement, cognition, speech, emotions, and sensory perceptions. Music interventions range from the use of rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) to aid in the execution of movement and normalisation of gait parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Thaut-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 1993</LINK>), to music listening and singing to reduce pain (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2005</LINK>), to the use of music listening, music improvisations, composition, and song discussions to address emotional needs and enhance sense of well-being (<LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2000</LINK>). While music interventions are traditionally implemented by trained music therapists, other health professionals may also use music to facilitate therapeutic outcomes. For example, music listening has been used by other health professionals in rehabilitation settings to enhance cognitive recovery and to improve mood (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00e4_rk_x00e4_m_x00f6_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Särkämö 2008</LINK>). Music interventions utilised in therapy are distinguished from passive music listening or recreational music activities when the following components are present: 1) implementation of goal-directed music interventions by a trained health professional, or 2) the use of music experiences individualised to the need of the person with ABI. In rehabilitation settings, these interventions may include 1) listening and moving to live, improvised, or pre-recorded music as well as RAS, 2) performing or creating music on an instrument, 3) improvising music spontaneously using voice or instruments or both, 4) singing or vocal activities to music, 5) music-based speech and language activities, 6) composing music, and 7) music combined with other modalities (e.g. imagery, art) (<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magee-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magee 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magee-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magee 2009</LINK>). Music therapy (in comparison with music interventions more broadly) is delivered by a professional with specific clinical training in music therapy, who offers a systematic therapeutic process including assessment, treatment, and evaluation. Music therapy treatment involves the presence of a therapeutic process and the use of personally tailored music experiences.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-08 12:54:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Biomedical theories suggest that neurophysiological processes may be activated through musical stimulation and used to affect non-musical behaviour and encourage neuroplasticity (<LINK REF="REF-Thaut-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thaut 2014a</LINK>). Following neurological injury, major neural reorganisation is common. Music interventions aim to capitalise on this naturally occurring neuroplastic change by enriching the environment of the person with ABI to promote functional gains (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00e4_rk_x00e4_m_x00f6_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Särkämö 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Music is physiologically arousing, entrains movement, and can motivate exercise and override pain perception. In particular, rhythm in music is a strong driving stimulus for motor function (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2016</LINK>). This influence of rhythm may be useful in physical rehabilitation, for example gait retraining and upper limb co-ordination (<LINK REF="STD-Thaut-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thaut-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 2002</LINK>). Speech and language skills can also be addressed using music interventions. Singing is a motivating way to practice the structured movement behaviours necessary for speech rehabilitation, as it requires controlled deep breathing, phonation, pitch control, rhythmic accuracy, controlled volume, and articulation of lyrics (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2011</LINK>). Furthermore, melodic intonation therapy uses the unimpaired singing ability of a person with brain injury to rehabilitate impaired language skills (<LINK REF="REF-Norton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Music is processed diffusely in the brain, meaning that music interventions can be targeted to address a wide range of cognitive deficits and behavioural and emotional issues. The repetitive and predictable structures in music can act as cues for learning. For example, songs can chunk information to aid in memory formation and recall (<LINK REF="REF-Thaut-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thaut 2014b</LINK>). In addition to its utility in physical rehabilitation, music has been reported to have positive effects on mood and social participation (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2006</LINK>). During music participation the brain releases neurochemicals that increase feelings of pleasure and alertness, and decrease anxiety and stress (<LINK REF="REF-Altenmuller-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altenmuller 2013</LINK>). Used in a group setting, music participation can provide opportunities for peer support and building social skills to facilitate increased independence (<LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-11-08 12:54:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Many research studies on the use of music in rehabilitation of ABI have suffered from small sample size, making it difficult to achieve statistically significant results. In addition, differences in factors such as study designs, methods of interventions, and intensity of treatment have led to varying results. The first edition of this review included only music therapy interventions involving a trained professional music therapist. However, in order to fully investigate the effects of music interventions in ABI rehabilitation, in this update we have included music interventions delivered by a music therapist or trainees in a music therapy programme, by other medical professionals, or by other health professionals with training in rehabilitation. This systematic review aimed to gauge more accurately the efficacy of music interventions in rehabilitation for people with ABI as well as to identify variables that may moderate any effects.</P>

<P>Participants usually cannot be blinded in a music intervention trial, with the exception of studies where pre-recorded music is used in a comparative trial that compares different types of music. For this reason, we did not downgrade studies for not blinding the participants. As for the personnel delivering the intervention, in many music intervention studies the professional delivering the intervention cannot be blinded because they are actively making music with the participants or providing music for the intervention. We therefore applied downgrading for not blinding personnel only in studies that used interventions where blinding was possible, for example in studies in which listening to pre-recorded music was the treatment condition and control group participants were provided with headphones but no music (such as a blank CD). This included studies that examined the use of metronome beat as part of the RAS intervention.</P>

<P>One review author (JB) entered all trials included in the systematic review into Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). JB conducted the data analysis, and WM reviewed the analysis for accuracy. We presented the main outcomes in this review as continuous variables. We calculated SMDs for outcome measures using the results from different scales, and computed MDs for results using the same scales. We calculated pooled estimates using the random-effects model. We determined levels of heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). We calculated 95% CIs for each effect size estimate. This review did not include any categorical variables.</P>
<P>For cross-over trials, we used the guidelines by <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK> for the inclusion of cross-over trials in meta-analyses that include both parallel-group and cross-over trials. When statistical information regarding the within-individual comparison of treatment was available, we used or computed estimates of the treatment effects and associated standard errors. If these data were not available, we opted to use data from the first period only if those data were reported separately. A third option was to treat the results as if they came from a study of parallel-group design. We favoured this option the least, as according to Elbourne and colleagues it ignores the within-patient correlation and results in an underestimate of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>Sixteen studies used rhythm-based methods to address motor disorders including gait and UEF.

RAS and RAC involve the use of rhythmic sensory cueing of the motor system, engaging entrainment principles in which "rhythmic auditory cues synchronize motor responses into stable time relationships. The fast-acting physiological entrainment mechanisms between auditory rhythm and motor response serve as coupling mechanisms to stabilise and regulate gait patterns" or reaching arm movements (<LINK REF="STD-Thaut-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 2007</LINK>, p 455). The rhythmic stimulus used in the majority of studies was a beat provided by a metronome, although one study used pitched tones (<LINK REF="STD-Suh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Suh 2014</LINK>). Two other studies used modified versions of RAS or RAC: <LINK REF="STD-Park-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2010a</LINK> used fast-tempo RAS, and <LINK REF="STD-Van-Delden-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Van Delden 2013</LINK> used modified bilateral arm training with RAC (mBATRAC), which targeted rhythmic flexion and extension movements.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Types of interventions: active versus receptive methods</HEADING>
<P>Six studies evaluated the effects of active music-making using musical instruments. Three music therapy studies used active music-making (<LINK REF="STD-Mueller-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mueller 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paul-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pool-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pool 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mueller-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mueller 2013</LINK> used instrument playing to train endogenous task shifting; <LINK REF="STD-Pool-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pool 2012</LINK> used simple instrument playing tasks to train attention; and <LINK REF="STD-Paul-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 1998</LINK> required participants to actively play electronic music devices that demanded active shoulder flexion and elbow extension and that enabled easy sound manipulation by the participants. Electronic paddle drums were individually set to the maximum range of motion of each participant. This was compared with a control intervention that involved a physical exercise group in which participants were encouraged to reach their affected extremity as far as they could in different directions. <LINK REF="STD-Jeong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeong 2007</LINK> combined RAS with instrument playing using dynamic rhythmic movements; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2007</LINK> used music-supported training that addressed fine motor skills through playing a MIDI keyboard or gross motor skills by playing an electronic drum set with eight pads, or both. Music exercises were adapted to participant need and increased incrementally over 10 levels of difficulty. <LINK REF="STD-Tong-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tong 2015</LINK> used an audible percussion instrument in comparison to a muted musical instrument that resembled the audible instrument, but was made of sponge. The muted musical instrument thus inhibited the participants from hearing sound during the music-supported therapy training.</P>
<P>Other active methods included songwriting to address mood state (<LINK REF="STD-Pool-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pool 2012</LINK>), and neurologic music therapy methods to address cognition (<LINK REF="STD-Mueller-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mueller 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pool-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pool 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thaut-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thaut 2014a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Receptive methods are those in which the participant is directed to listen to recorded music or live music presented by the interventionist, and thus is not required to be actively involved in making the music him or herself. Five studies used receptive methods (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Kelly-2014" TYPE="STUDY">O'Kelly 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e4_rk_x00e4_m_x00f6_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Särkämö 2008</LINK>). Two of these studies involved heavily dependent participants emerging from coma with whom active methods would not be viable (<LINK REF="STD-Fernandes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Kelly-2014" TYPE="STUDY">O'Kelly 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four trials examined the effects of music therapy on communication outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Conklyn-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Conklyn 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jungblut-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jungblut 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e4_rk_x00e4_m_x00f6_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Särkämö 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Meulen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van der Meulen 2014</LINK>). Each of these used a different music intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Jungblut-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jungblut 2004</LINK> employed SIPARI, a music therapy method to address aphasia using singing, intonation, prosody embedded in physiologically appropriate breathing. This method also employs instrumental and vocal rhythmic exercises and music improvisations to practice communication scenarios. <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e4_rk_x00e4_m_x00f6_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Särkämö 2008</LINK> used receptive methods where participants listened to recordings of participant-preferred music. <LINK REF="STD-Conklyn-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Conklyn 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Meulen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van der Meulen 2014</LINK> used melodic intonation therapy, a method that involves repetitive singing of short phrases in conjunction with left hand tapping of the rhythm.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dosage of interventions and trial designs</HEADING>
<P>Frequency and duration of treatment sessions varied greatly among the studies. The total number of sessions ranged from one to 60. The duration of sessions varied widely due to the range of interventions being used to address a diverse set of outcomes.

However, the results were inconsistent across studies, with the larger study, <LINK REF="STD-Thaut-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 2007</LINK>, showing a greater cadence improvement (22.00 steps/minute, 95% CI 16.94 to 27.06; N = 78) than the other studies (ranging from 3.86 to 12.78 steps/minute).</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis compared studies in which the intervention was delivered by a music therapist, <LINK REF="STD-Lichun-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lichun 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Thaut-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 1997</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Thaut-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 2007</LINK>, with studies in which the intervention was delivered by another professional, <LINK REF="STD-Cha-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Cha 2014a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cha-2014b" TYPE="STUDY">Cha 2014b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2012a</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Suh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Suh 2014</LINK>. This analysis revealed that studies with music therapist interventionists led to greater improvements (MD 11.51, 95% CI -2.57 to 25.60; P = 0.11) than studies with non-music therapist interventionists (MD 7.65, 95% CI 4.43 to 10.86; P &lt; 0.0001), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.6). The effect size of the music therapist interventionist subgroup was no longer statistically significant. The heterogeneity within the music therapist interventionist subgroup (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 94%) was much larger than that of the non-music therapist interventionist group (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). This was due to the large effect sizes reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Thaut-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 2007</LINK> study (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>RAC was examined as an added music intervention to visual locomotor imagery training and kinaesthetic locomotor imagery training in an RCT with 15 stroke participants (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2011a</LINK>). This review included only the visual locomotor imagery training as the control condition with added RAC as the music intervention. We measured changes of peak-to-peak joint angular displacement using electromyographic analyses, and so we could not include these results in the meta-analysis. Increased activation in a greater number of lower limb muscles involved in gait and an improvement in lower limb joint angular displacement were reported when auditory step rhythm was integrated into locomotor imagery. During the swing phase there were significant differences for all four muscles for the rhythm condition: quadriceps (F = 3.398; P &lt; 0.05); hamstring (F = 9.324; P &lt; 0.05); tibialis anterior (F = 5.089; P &lt; 0.05); and gastrocnemius (F = 3.639; P &lt; 0.05). Activation was increased significantly during the stance phase in the hamstring (F = 4.815; P &lt; 0.05) and the gastrocnemius (F = 4.087; P &lt; 0.05) for the rhythm intervention. Peak-to-peak joint angular displacement was significantly different for the ankle joint with rhythmic auditory cueing (F = 6.519; P &lt; 0.05).</P>

No significant differences were found in mood states between conditions after eight weeks. Mean scores showed that mood states improved slightly following eight weeks of standard care (control) for each mood state but worsened slightly following music therapy intervention at the same time point. Although non-significant, an improvement in mean mood scores for all moods states was noted after 16 weeks for music therapy intervention beyond the scores for standard care.</P>

However, it should be noted that baseline scores were already very low (RAS: 2.11; control: 2.81), providing a narrow window for change.</P>
<P>Two further RCTs examining physical functioning as the primary outcome also reported on mood subscales in their results, specifically the Stroke Impact Scale emotion subscale (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Delden-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Van Delden 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whitall 2011</LINK>).

Behaviours of 21 participants with disorders of consciousness were observed across conditions of baseline silence, non-music therapy conditions (white noise, recordings of disliked music), and music therapy conditions (live, participant-preferred music and live, improvised music entrained to the participant's respiration). Differences in eye blink rate in vegetative participants were significant across conditions (F(2.3, 13.9) = 3.6; P = 0.019), with a peak response during the participant-preferred live music condition when compared with baseline silence (F(1, 11) = 8.2; P = 0.029). <LINK REF="STD-Fernandes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandes 2014</LINK> also reported on changes in facial expression, including muscular facial relaxation, eye opening, mouth movements, head movements, yawning, smiling, and eyebrow movements in response to recorded music.

However, the reported means and standard deviations suggested that the authors computed the total score differently: <LINK REF="STD-Cha-2014b" TYPE="STUDY">Cha 2014b</LINK> appears to have computed the total score by adding the participant's rating of each item, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Jeong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeong 2007</LINK> computed the total score by averaging all the ratings.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Gait</HEADING>
<P>The results of 10 studies suggest that RAS may have a beneficial effect on gait velocity in people with stroke with an average of 11.34 metres per minute compared with standard treatment. RAS may also improve stride length by about 0.12 metres and general gait by an average of 7.67 units as measured on the Dynamic Gait Index in people with stroke compared with standard treatment. One study found significant improvement in peak-to-peak joint angular displacement in the lower limbs during RAC. RAS may have a beneficial effect on gait cadence for people with stroke; however, the degree of improvement across studies was inconsistent. We found no evidence of effect for music interventions on gait symmetry and balance.</P>

<P>The music interventions used for UEF varied across nine studies, including rhythm-based instrument-playing tasks in music-making (<LINK REF="STD-Paul-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 1998</LINK>), RAS within music-making (<LINK REF="STD-Jeong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeong 2007</LINK>), RAS using rhythmic pulse without music (<LINK REF="STD-Chouan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chouan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thaut-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 2002</LINK>), fast-tempo auditory stimulation with and without music (<LINK REF="STD-Tong-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tong 2015</LINK>), bilateral arm training with RAC (BATRAC) or a modified version of BATRAC (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Delden-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Van Delden 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whitall 2011</LINK>), and music-supported training (<LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2007</LINK>). The results of two studies indicated that music interventions may improve the timing of UEF by about one second. One study found significant improvements in elbow extension angle using RAS with reduced variability of timing (35%) and reduced reaching trajectories (45%) (<LINK REF="STD-Thaut-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 2002</LINK>). We found no evidence of effect for music interventions for general UEF, range of motion (shoulder flexion), hand function, upper limb strength, and manual dexterity.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Communication outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The results of this review suggest that music interventions may have a moderate effect (SMD = 0.69) on overall communication. This pooled effect size was derived from three studies. The results of two small studies suggested that music interventions may benefit the expressive language outcome of naming (9.79 units on the Aachen Aphasia Test) and the speech outcome of repetition (8.9 units on the Aachen Aphasia Test) for people following stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Jungblut-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jungblut 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Meulen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van der Meulen 2014</LINK>).

Meta-analysis of these three studies was not possible due to: 1) the use of different versions of the same measure (POMS), and 2) reporting of selected subscales or total score only. Two studies found significant improvements in mood states. One music-listening study found improvements in depression and confusion, with the positive effects on depression sustained at six months' follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00e4_rk_x00e4_m_x00f6_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Särkämö 2008</LINK>).

A third study that we could not include in the meta-analysis also used auditory rhythmic training (<LINK REF="STD-Hill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 2011</LINK>).

<P>The primary reason noted for referral to music therapy in rehabilitation settings is the rehabilitation of social skills (<LINK REF="REF-Magee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magee 2007</LINK>). However, we identified only one study that measured this as an outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Jeong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeong 2007</LINK> reported significant improvements in social skills following rhythmic movement to music and active music-making with stroke participants.</P>
<P>Based on the results of one study, we found no evidence for the effect of music listening on pain for people with ABI (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial reported positive effects for reducing agitation in people with post-traumatic amnesia following a severe head injury, using both live and recorded music (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>). Two studies examined the effects of music interventions on a range of behavioural outcomes in people with disorders of consciousness (<LINK REF="STD-Fernandes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Kelly-2014" TYPE="STUDY">O'Kelly 2014</LINK>). We could not combine the results for meta-analysis due to insufficient data reporting. The severity of injury in this population means that participants are heavily dependent, and only receptive methods can be used. One study reported significant changes in behaviours to music conditions compared with baseline silence (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Kelly-2014" TYPE="STUDY">O'Kelly 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Based on two trials, we found no strong evidence for the effect of music interventions on cognitive functioning, specifically memory or attention (<LINK REF="STD-Pool-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pool 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e4_rk_x00e4_m_x00f6_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Särkämö 2008</LINK>). One trial found significant effects for orientation in response to listening to live or recorded music in comparison with no music in participants with post-traumatic amnesia (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>). We found no studies that examined activities of daily living or adverse events as outcomes.</P>
<P>More research is needed for all secondary outcomes before reliable conclusions can be drawn.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-11-08 13:09:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This review included 29 studies with a total of 775 participants. The results suggest that music interventions may improve gait, communication, and quality of life in people with ABI. While there is much cross-over in treatments for people with ABI resulting from stroke and traumatic injury, 90% of participants included in this review were stroke survivors, and thus our findings may be more relevant for this population.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses for gait velocity provide important information about the impact of the type of music intervention and the professional delivering the intervention on the treatment effect. Studies that used trained music therapists to deliver the music interventions resulted in significantly greater improvements in gait velocity than studies in which the intervention was delivered by a non-music therapy healthcare professional. It should be noted that the subgroup analysis reflects the results of different trials and not direct comparisons of interventionists within a trial. The results of studies that used a trained music therapist were consistent across studies. Furthermore, the subgroup analyses indicated that interventions that use RAS (e.g. metronome beat) embedded within music may be more effective than using non-music RAS alone. These results provide support for using professionals who are trained in delivering music interventions, such as music therapists, rather than just a metronome. Subanalyses for gait cadence suggested greater improvements when the intervention was delivered by a music therapist, and also when the music was combined with auditory stimulation. Although we had planned to complete a subanalysis for dosage of intervention, there was too much heterogeneity amongst the RAS studies in terms of the number of treatment sessions, the frequency of sessions, the duration of individual sessions, and the total course of treatment to complete this analysis; therefore, recommendations for dosage could not be made. Reporting was problematic for several studies included in this review, particularly concerning blinding of the outcome assessor. The results indicate that interventions implemented by a trained music therapist may result in greater treatment benefits than those delivered by other professionals. This could be explained by the training that music therapists have in delivering interventions using live music that matches the participant's in-the-moment physical responses. However, we acknowledge that other factors may have confounded this comparison.</P>
<P>Music interventions may improve the timing of UEF. The findings of this review were influenced by the large variance in the number of participants within studies examining UEF and the variance in reported improvements. Furthermore, one large study reported that there was a large variance in deficit severity of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Whitall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whitall 2011</LINK>, N = 92). All of these factors may have contributed to the non-significant results for general UEF, hand function, and upper limb strength. Rhythmic stimulation appears to induce temporal stability and enhance motor control in walking. It could be that rhythmic cueing has a similar effect on some aspects of UEF, such as timing of movements. Even though functional arm movements, unlike gait, are "discrete, biologically non-rhythmic, and volitional" (<LINK REF="STD-Thaut-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thaut 2002</LINK>, p1074), rhythmic stimuli are successfully used to enhance the execution of motor skills in non-rehabilitation areas such as music performance and sports (<LINK REF="REF-Karageorghis-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karageorghis 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karageorghis-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karageorghis 2012b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although this review included more studies with an increased number of speech and language outcomes than our previous review, the selected subdomains in speech and language outcomes were inconsistent across music intervention studies. This prevented more outcomes being examined in a meta-analysis. Standardised communication-specific measures included the Aachen Aphasia Test (<LINK REF="STD-Jungblut-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jungblut 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Meulen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van der Meulen 2014</LINK>), the Amsterdam-Nijmegen Everyday Language Test (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Meulen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van der Meulen 2014</LINK>) and the Sabadell (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Meulen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van der Meulen 2014</LINK>). However, all of these studies examined slightly different subdomains, preventing meta-analysis of a greater number of outcomes. Similarly, although we were able to report on the effects of music interventions on four cognitive outcomes (memory, attention, mental flexibility, and orientation), we were unable to report on a further 13 cognitive outcomes examined in research studies due to the lack of agreement between studies in the subdomains examined and outcome measures used.</P>
<P>We identified only three studies of sufficient methodological quality that included mood as an outcome. This is surprising given the high incidence of depression following stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Matsuzaki-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuzaki 2015</LINK>), and that mood disorders can affect motivation to engage in rehabilitation and impede re-integration back into the community (<LINK REF="REF-Giles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2006</LINK>). Two of the three studies reported greater improvements in mood in the music intervention group compared with the control group. However, inconsistent reporting of results prevented meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Given the importance of improving and maintaining mood after ABI, it is also important to examine the relationship between functional gains and mood during rehabilitation. Several studies tested the effects of music interventions on a functional outcome as well as mood (N = 3) or quality of life (N = 3). Two trials examined cognitive and mood outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Pool-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pool 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e4_rk_x00e4_m_x00f6_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Särkämö 2008</LINK>). Three trials examined the effects on motor function (gait) and quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Cha-2014b" TYPE="STUDY">Cha 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeong 2007</LINK>), and one trial examined motor function (gait) and mood (<LINK REF="STD-Jeong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeong 2007</LINK>). Effects on combined domains also reflect clinical practice, which typically aims to address function in combination with mood rather than individual domains alone. Motivating interventions are important for brain-injured populations, who may experience a loss of motivation due to brain injury.</P>
<P>The benefit of using music as a medium for addressing human function is its flexibility and the range of activities it offers, such as singing, playing, composing, and listening. The music used in therapeutic interventions also can be adapted through varying its multiple components, such as rhythm, tempo, articulation, melodic contour, dynamic range, and harmonic progression, to meet a person&#8217;s specific needs (<LINK REF="REF-Schneck-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneck 2006</LINK>). This flexibility enables music to be applied in a number of ways within tasks, and it can also be adapted within that task to match or drive the person's level of functioning. Music also provides a motivational force to enhance engagement and participation through stimulating the pleasure and reward networks in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Schneck-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneck 2006</LINK>). However, this flexibility is not advantageous when trying to make meaningful comparisons of interventions and dosage. Given the heterogeneity of interventions across the range of domains that are targeted in ABI rehabilitation, recommendations for dosage cannot be made based on this review. Interventions for motor outcomes (gait and UEF) were relatively homogenous, using rhythm-based interventions (RAS, variations of RAS, or instrument playing to rhythmic music). However, other interventions for any one outcome were more varied. For example, the interventions addressing mood illustrate the heterogeneity of treatments, ranging from rhythm-based movement to music (<LINK REF="STD-Jeong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeong 2007</LINK>), receptive listening to participant-selected recorded music (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00e4_rk_x00e4_m_x00f6_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Särkämö 2008</LINK>), and active music-making through songwriting methods (<LINK REF="STD-Pool-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pool 2012</LINK>). In order to generate high-quality evidence, future trials need to standardise and clearly describe details of music-based methods so that meta-analysis provides more meaningful information about interventions and dosage.</P>

Four studies did not use allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jungblut-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jungblut 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichun-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lichun 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2007</LINK>), and a further seven were unclear in reporting on this criterion (<LINK REF="STD-Conklyn-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Conklyn 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandes-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandes 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mueller-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mueller 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tong-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tong 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whitall 2011</LINK>). Reporting the blinding of participants, interventionists, and outcome assessors needs improving in research trials using music interventions. Blinding of participants in music intervention studies is usually not possible unless two music interventions are being compared (e.g. music listening and music-making). The lack of participant blinding is problematic when studies examine subjective outcomes such as mood or quality of life. Blinding of interventionists is often not possible in music intervention studies when active music-making is examined. Where interventionists cannot be blinded, they should be blinded to the purpose of the study where possible. In either case, blinding should be reported or discussed. We found attrition to be problematic, rating it inadequate in six studies and not adequately reported in a further nine studies.</P>
<P>Most of the included trials used small sample sizes (average N = 28; range of sample size 9 to 111), except for <LINK REF="STD-Whitall-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whitall 2011</LINK> (N = 111). For the majority of the outcomes measured, results were inconsistent across studies. However, this was due to some studies reporting much larger treatment benefits than other studies. All treatment benefits were in the desired direction. In <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, large confidence intervals were reported for gait velocity, gait cadence, general UEF, and overall communication. Small sample sizes, combined with high risk of bias and wide confidence intervals, require that the results of this review be interpreted with caution. In summary, the quality of the evidence was low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-11-08 13:09:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The strength of this review is based in the search of all available databases and a comprehensive number of music therapy journals (English, German, and Japanese). This update omitted an updated search of the Science Citation Index from August 2009; however, given the extensive cross-referencing between databases, it is unlikely that potential studies would be cited on this database alone. We also checked the reference lists of all relevant trials, contacted relevant experts in order to identify unpublished trials, and included publications in any language. In spite of such a comprehensive search, it is still possible that we missed some published and unpublished trials. We requested additional data for all trials we considered for inclusion where necessary, which allowed us to obtain accurate information on the trial quality and data for most trials, assisting us in making well-informed trial selection decisions.</P>
<P>It is possible that we did not identify some grey literature; however, it is doubtful that this would have had a significant impact on our results. Grey literature tends to include trials with relatively small numbers of participants and inconclusive results (<LINK REF="REF-McAuley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAuley 2000</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-01-19 11:36:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The aim of this review was to update the previous version examining the effects of music therapy on adults with ABI (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2010</LINK>). In this update, we expanded our criteria to include trials that examined the effects of music interventions more broadly, including music interventions delivered by professionals other than trained music therapists, such as other medical or health professionals with training in rehabilitation. This revision enabled the inclusion of a greater number of studies.</P>
<P>In our previous review, we could include only two studies for meta-analysis. This previous analysis showed significant improvements in gait cadence, stride length, and symmetry. A recent review by <LINK REF="REF-Yoo-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoo 2016</LINK> detailed the findings of 11 trials examining the effects of RAS on motor rehabilitation in people with stroke. Meta-analyses of outcomes from seven trials examining gait function demonstrated large effect sizes for gait parameters (walking velocity, cadence, and stride length) and UEF. Another recent review by <LINK REF="REF-Nascimento-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nascimento 2015</LINK> compared the effects of cadence cueing and walking training alone following stroke (seven trials, 211 participants). Meta-analyses of six trials with 171 participants also demonstrated improvements in walking velocity, cadence, stride length, and gait symmetry. The positive effects of RAS on gait in the current review are consistent with previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nascimento-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nascimento 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoo-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoo 2016</LINK>). Our review also provided evidence to support previous findings from <LINK REF="REF-Yoo-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoo 2016</LINK> indicating greater effects from rhythmic cueing combined with music in comparison with metronome cueing alone.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Yoo-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoo 2016</LINK> also examined the effects of RAS on UEF. Meta-analysis of Fugl-Meyer Assessment outcomes reported in three studies yielded large effect sizes for UEF. In our updated review, the pooled effect of five studies examining the effect of music-based interventions on UEF using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment was not statistically significant, nor were there significant pooled effects for shoulder flexion, hand function, upper limb strength, manual dexterity, or elbow extension angle.</P>
<P>We also included one additional outcome that is important in brain injury rehabilitation, namely cognitive functioning. However, there were not enough studies at this time to provide strong evidence for an effect of music interventions on cognitive outcomes.</P>
<P>In summary, the results of this review provide new insights and further evidence of the effects of music-based interventions in ABI rehabilitation.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-19 11:36:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-01-19 11:36:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Rehabilitation of mobility is crucial in stroke rehabilitation. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) may help improve gait velocity, stride length, and general gait in people with stroke, and it may be beneficial for gait cadence. Intervention for gait may be enhanced when a trained music therapist delivers the intervention and the RAS is embedded in music. RAS may also be beneficial for improving the timing of upper extremity function (UEF). Although encouraging, more high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed before conclusions can be made for clinical practice due to the inconsistent use and heterogeneity of outcome measures. Small sample sizes and high risk of bias also limit the research in this area. Rhythm may be a primary influencing factor in music-based interventions, facilitating functional gains in motor performance in this population. The results of this review thus suggest that using music with a strong and consistent beat may have a greater effect than RAS without music.</P>
<P>Music interventions may be helpful in improving overall communication, although we are unable to draw conclusions as to whether active or receptive methods are most beneficial. Active methods involving singing may be beneficial for addressing difficulties in naming and repetition, however these conclusions were based on a small number of studies with small sample sizes.</P>
<P>Music interventions may improve mood states. We are unable to draw conclusions about which interventions are most beneficial. Rhythm-based methods in combination with patient-preferred music to address gait disorders may also improve quality of life outcomes.</P>
<P>Listening to patient-preferred music may be most beneficial in improving agitation. Although listening to live patient-preferred music may be beneficial for orientation, we are unable to make further conclusions about the use of music interventions to improve cognition. Conclusions about optimal frequency, duration, and intensity of any music intervention for people with ABI cannot be made based on the findings of this review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-08 13:10:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This review shows encouraging results for the effects of RAS on gait parameters; however, more RCTs with greater numbers of participants are needed to strengthen the current data. It is important to specify whether the effects of RAS on stride length are measured on the affected or unaffected legs, or to provide a computed average for both. More research on the effects of RAS on gait cadence and gait symmetry is needed.</P>
<P>Since 13 of the studies producing significant results in this review involved rhythm-based methods to address upper limb and gait functioning, we recommend more RCT investigations of RAS across functional domains. Future research would benefit from improving the consistency of the music interventions used across studies and descriptions of how these interventions are delivered. Rhythm appears to be the important component in music interventions to address UEF. However, it is unclear whether rhythm is optimally used with music or without music in rehabilitation of UEF. Additional RCTs are needed to further examine the potential benefits of RAS on UEF. Although the results of this updated review suggest that there is greater improvement when rhythmic auditory cues are embedded in music, further research is warranted comparing the effectiveness of RAS with and without music.</P>
<P>Continued commitment to researching the efficacy of music interventions for UEF in people with hemiparetic stroke is paramount, with a focus on which music interventions are most effective. Future research needs to report the severity of impairment of participants at baseline, and future systematic reviews should plan to perform subanalyses of deficit impairments that are reported.</P>
<P>More RCTs are needed to examine the effect of music interventions on communication in people with acquired brain injury (ABI). Although six trials reported on speech or language outcomes, or both, in this review, we could include the results of only three trials in meta-analyses due to the wide range of outcomes examined across trials, which could not be combined. Identifying a core outcome set in clinical trials is a prescient issue (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2012</LINK>). This has been noted to be particularly problematic in previous Cochrane reviews examining speech and language therapy for people with aphasia following stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2012</LINK>), as reflected in this review. Greater consensus is needed as to a core outcome set for the subdomains of both communication and cognition in research on music interventions in ABI.</P>
<P>Greater consistency in the choice of outcome measures in populations with ABI and greater accuracy in reporting on how these are used would also strengthen the research. For example, three studies used the Stroke Impact Scale to examine quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Cha-2014b" TYPE="STUDY">Cha 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeong 2007</LINK>). However, these studies seem to have used the Stroke Impact Scale in different ways, as the ranges of scores between the studies were highly variable. The Profile of Mood States was used in all three studies examining mood due to its validity for neurological populations (<LINK REF="STD-Jeong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jeong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pool-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pool 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00e4_rk_x00e4_m_x00f6_-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Särkämö 2008</LINK>). This measure, in its different versions, is formed of several subscales for specific moods. Although the one outcome measure for mood was used across studies, different versions of the measure were used. The subscales of the different versions varied too much to allow comparison. This prevented meaningful combination of outcome data from subscales. Total scores need to be reported for the measures used, as well as scores for the relevant subscales, where appropriate, so that these can be combined for meta-analysis. The direction of improvement (i.e. a higher score indicates improvement) should also be reported for each subscale and total score to aid with translation to practice.</P>
<P>It is promising that this review update included a small number of trials examining outcomes in the domains of mood and emotions, social skills and interactions, quality of life, and cognitive functioning, all of which were not included in our previous review. Although this review examined gait as the primary outcome in clinical trials examining music interventions with ABI, this is inconsistent with music therapy clinical practice. Communication and psycho-emotional domains tend to be the primary reason for referral (<LINK REF="REF-Magee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magee 2007</LINK>). More research is needed to examine how music interventions may benefit outcomes in these domains in addition to behavioural and cognitive outcomes. This is particularly relevant for more complex populations such as post-traumatic amnesia and disorders of consciousness.</P>
<P>Populations with significant impairments following profound brain injury pose considerable challenges for researchers in terms of determining meaningful outcomes and finding appropriate measures. There is a growing number of studies examining the effects of music interventions using neurophysiological and imaging methods with severely impaired brain damaged populations. We thus recommend that a separate review be conducted on the effect of music interventions on these non-behavioural outcomes of interest.</P>
<P>Further trials are needed to examine how music interventions may have a combined impact on functional outcomes and mood/quality of life, as music has been noted to be physiologically arousing and motivating, and offers a strong driving stimulus for motor functions (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2016</LINK>). Research examining the effect of music interventions on both motor skills and mood or quality of life, or both, in the same study, is needed.</P>
<P>We did not include any studies that examined activities of daily living and adverse events. Future trials should consider examining the benefits of music interventions on all of these outcomes.</P>
<P>Future RCTs should ensure that the quality criteria absent in previous trials are addressed and also reported, particularly for selection, detection, and attrition biases. Random group allocation should be used, and the method of group allocation should be reported. Blinding of outcome assessors needs to improve in music intervention studies, ensuring that this is incorporated into the design and is reported in publications. Reporting of whether interventionists are blinded to the purpose of the study also needs to be improved in RAS studies. Finally, many studies in this review used a small sample size (eight to 22 participants). Future studies need to include power analyses so that sufficiently large samples are used.</P>

<P>We planned to update our search of the Science Citation Index electronic database. However, this database was omitted in the initial search by our search specialist. Although we attempted to correct this omission when we updated our searches in January 2016, a change in search specialist personnel resulted in no specialist who was available to undertake this search at that time. Although Science Citation Index is a major database, we believe that research relating to the topic under investigation (health and music) is most likely to have been published on primarily healthcare databases, for which searches were performed.</P>
