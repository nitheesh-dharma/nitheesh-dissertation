<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-13 12:00:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In recurrent corneal erosion repeated episodes of breakdown of the corneal surface produce disabling eye symptoms and predispose the cornea (the transparent part at the front of the eye) to infection. Recurrent corneal erosions may happen after trauma to the cornea. Management may be required to prevent the recurrence of the erosions following corneal trauma or once the diagnosis is made, or both. Most episodes of recurrent corneal erosion resolve with simple medical therapy such as topical eye drops and ointment. When such simple measures fail or recurrences become too frequent, alternative treatment strategies are required. This review included seven trials with a total of 443 participants. The trials were conducted in Germany, People's Republic of China, Japan, Sweden and three in the UK. The quality of the trials was poor and the authors found the level of evidence insufficient for the development of management guidelines. There was limited evidence that oral tetracycline or topical prednisolone, or both, and excimer laser ablation, may be effective treatments for recurrent corneal erosion. More good-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to guide the management of recurrent corneal erosion.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-08 14:29:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recurrent corneal erosion is a common cause of disabling ocular symptoms and predisposes the cornea to infection. It may follow corneal trauma. Measures to prevent the development of recurrent corneal erosion following corneal trauma have not been firmly established. Once recurrent corneal erosion develops simple medical therapy (standard treatment) may lead to resolution of the episode. However, some patients continue to suffer when such therapy fails and once resolved further episodes of recurrent erosion may occur. A number of treatment and prophylactic options are then available but there is no agreement as to the best option.</P>

<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 6), MEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2012), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to June 2012), the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT) (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/">www.controlled-trials.com</A>), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en">www.who.int/ictrp/search/en</A>).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-13 11:17:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven randomised and one quasi-randomised controlled trial were included in the review. The trials were heterogenous and of poor quality. Safety data presented were incomplete. For the treatment of recurrent corneal erosion, a single-centre trial in the UK with 30 participants showed that oral tetracycline 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks or topical prednisolone 0.5% four times daily for one week, or both, in addition to standard treatment, accelerated healing rates and improved symptoms. A single-centre trial in Sweden with 56 participants showed that excimer laser ablation in addition to mechanical debridement may reduce the number of erosions and improve symptoms. Furthermore, in a single-centre trial in Germany with 100 participants, transepithelial technique for excimer laser ablation had the same efficacy as the traditional subepithelial excimer laser technique but caused less pain. In a small study of 24 participants in UK, therapeutic contact lens wear was inferior to lubricant drops and ointment in abolishing the symptoms of recurrent corneal erosion and had a high complication rate, although the contact lenses used were the older generation with low oxygen permeability. A recent study in Hong Kong with 48 participants found diamond burr polishing to reduce episodes of recurrent corneal erosion. For prophylaxis of further episodes of recurrent corneal erosion, there was no difference in the occurrence of objective signs of recurrent erosion between hypertonic saline ointment versus tetracycline ointment or lubricating ointment in a small Japanese study with 26 participants. Also, in a single-centre study in the UK with 117 participants, there was no difference in symptom improvement between hypertonic saline versus paraffin ointment when used for prophylaxis. In a UK study with 42 participants, lubricating ointment at night in addition to standard treatment to prevent recurrence following traumatic corneal abrasion (erosion) caused by fingernail injury led to increased symptoms of recurrent corneal erosion compared to standard therapy alone.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-17 14:25:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-17 14:25:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recurrent corneal erosion is a relatively common clinical disorder that is characterised by repeated episodes of breakdown of the corneal epithelium (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chandler-1945" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandler 1945</LINK>). Erosions can occur spontaneously, following superficial corneal injury, in certain corneal dystrophies (such as epithelial basement membrane (map-dot-fingerprint) dystrophy or lattice dystrophy), and in systemic illnesses such as epidermolysis bullosa. Patients with this condition experience repeated episodes of ocular discomfort and blurred vision and some may require prolonged therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Heyworth-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyworth 1998</LINK>). Abnormal formation of hemidesmosomes or anchoring filaments (cellular attachments) at the basal layer of the corneal epithelium are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of recurrent corneal erosion (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1984</LINK>). Matrix metalloproteinases (extracellular proteolytic enzymes) may have a role in degrading epithelial cell attachments (<LINK REF="REF-Dursun-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dursun 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Bernauer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernauer 1996</LINK> and colleagues proposed that the lids may adhere to the cornea overnight due to thinning of the tear film. A shearing force on the corneal epithelium may then occur due to movement of the lid on waking or of the eye during rapid eye movement sleep thus producing a corneal erosion.</P>
<P>The incidence and prevalence of recurrent corneal erosion is not known with certainty. In a retrospective case series of 104 patients with recurrent corneal erosion a history of trauma was reported in around half of patients, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy in around a third of patients and the majority of the remaining patients had a history of both trauma and epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Reidy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reidy 2000</LINK>). The mean age of presentation has been reported as 43 years (range 14 to 77 years) with a preponderance of recurrent corneal erosion in women (<LINK REF="REF-Reidy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reidy 2000</LINK>). Traumatic corneal abrasion, a leading precipitating cause for recurrent corneal erosion, is one of the commonest causes for attendance in eye casualty and general emergency departments (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1986</LINK>). The incidence of recurrent corneal erosion following traumatic corneal abrasion has been estimated at one in 150 cases (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1960</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recurrent corneal erosion is typically diagnosed on the basis of a clinical history of repeated episodes of ocular discomfort that develop with or without a prior corneal epithelial abrasion or injury. Patients will report episodes of pain, watering of the eye, increased sensitivity to light and blurring of vision, typically on waking. These episodes are interspersed with periods where the eye is relatively quiet or completely asymptomatic. The characteristic complaint is of early morning eye pain with or without preceding trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1984</LINK>). Symptoms result from the breakdown of the corneal epithelium. Erosions can resolve quickly and may be missed on examination.</P>
<P>Two types of recurrent corneal erosion have been described (<LINK REF="REF-Chandler-1945" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandler 1945</LINK>). In the macroform type (macroerosions) there is extensive loss of corneal epithelium accompanied by severe symptoms that may take several days to resolve. In the microform type (microerosions) there is a small area of epithelial loss; this type of erosion occurs more frequently but is milder and of shorter duration (<LINK REF="REF-Chandler-1945" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandler 1945</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1984</LINK>). However, this terminology is not in routine clinical use and there is evidence that there is no clear distinction between these types of recurrent corneal erosion (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1976</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are no specific diagnostic tests for recurrent corneal erosion. Signs of recurrent corneal erosion are best visualised with slit-lamp examination using a cobalt-blue light following the instillation of topical fluorescein. A frank epithelial defect or loose epithelium will be seen (<LINK REF="REF-Reidy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reidy 2000</LINK>). In some patients clinical signs or evidence of an underlying epithelial basement membrane disorder such as microcysts and epithelial lines may aid the diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Chandler-1945" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandler 1945</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1984</LINK>). Meibomian gland dysfunction has been reported to co-exist in patients with recalcitrant recurrent corneal erosion (<LINK REF="REF-Hope_x002d_Ross-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope-Ross 1994b</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-08 14:29:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Simple medical therapy may be used, e.g. ointment at night following traumatic corneal abrasion (<LINK REF="STD-Eke-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eke 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Standard (empirical) therapy involves topical ointments, patching of the eye, dilation of the pupil and topical antibiotics, used alone or in combination (<LINK REF="STD-Eke-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eke 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hope_x002d_Ross-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope-Ross 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hykin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hykin 1994</LINK>). Their safety or effectiveness have not been established in clinical trials. A Cochrane review has found that patching simple corneal abrasions, following trauma or a foreign body, does not improve healing rates or reduce pain (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alternative strategies, when the above do not work, include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Removal of the loose epithelium by mechanical debridement, superficial keratectomy or excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) (<LINK REF="REF-Maini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ohman 1998</LINK>). Diamond burr polishing produces less recurrences compared to simple epithelial debridement (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2009</LINK>). Alcohol delamination (<LINK REF="REF-Dua-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dua 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2007</LINK>) has been described as a safer and less invasive procedure compared to mechanical or laser debridement.</LI>
<LI>A therapeutic contact lens has been used for recalcitrant recurrent erosion involving the visual axis.</LI>
<LI>Nd:YAG laser treatment, needle anterior stromal puncture or microdiathermy have been used to promote epithelial stability via the production of subepithelial scar tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Geggel-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geggel 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLean-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLean 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1984</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Oral tetracycline 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks or topical prednisolone 0.5% four times daily for seven days, or both (<LINK REF="STD-Hope_x002d_Ross-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Hope-Ross 1994a</LINK>), or oral doxycycline 50 mg twice daily and topical corticosteroid (either methylprednisolone 1%, prednisolone acetate 1% or fluoromethalone 0.1%) three times a day for two to three weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Dursun-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dursun 2001</LINK>) have been added to standard treatment regimens. Autologous serum eye drops three to eight times per day for three to six months have been used in patients not improving on the standard therapy and/or who have failed antibiotic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-del-Castillo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">del Castillo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ziakas-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ziakas 2010</LINK>).</LI>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-08 15:29:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard treatments are given on basis of symptomatic relief and prophylaxis for infection. The theoretical basis of the alternative therapies is outlined below:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Removal of loose epithelium by mechanical debridement, superficial keratectomy or PTK. This is thought to strengthen the adhesion of the basal epithelial cells to the basement membrane (<LINK REF="REF-Maini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maini 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ohman 1998</LINK>). Alcohol delamination is thought to be a superior method because it does not seem to disrupt the lamina lucida (<LINK REF="REF-Menucci-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menucci 2010</LINK>) and therefore has a reduced risk of excessive scarring and/or alteration of the optical properties of the cornea.</LI>
<LI>A therapeutic contact lens may protect the epithelium from the shearing force of the lids but requires monitoring of the patient for microbial keratitis (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1985</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The production of subepithelial scar tissue is thought to strengthen the junction between epithelium and basement membrane. It has been observed that eyes with penetrating corneal injuries are less likely to get recurrent corneal erosion (RCE) as a complication.</LI>
<LI>Oral tetracyclines and topical steroid regimens are thought to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases and hence reduce protein breakdown to preserve the bond between the epithelium and basement membrane.</LI>
<LI>Autologous serum therapy is thought to provide fibronectin which promotes epithelial migration and anchorage.</LI>

<P>Recurrent corneal erosion is a common, painful and debilitating ocular condition. However, as the many different prophylactic and treatment options available suggest, there is no agreement as to the best management. In this review we aimed to analyse evidence from randomised trials to determine the risks and benefits of prophylactic and treatment modalities available for recurrent corneal erosion. However, as different therapies have been trialled for the prophylaxis and treatment of recurrent corneal erosion episodes and for averting the occurrence of recurrent corneal erosion after a corneal injury, we analysed the trials on recurrent corneal erosion in three groups. Regimes to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>avert the development of recurrent corneal erosion following a traumatic corneal erosion (prophylaxis of the development of recurrent corneal erosion);</LI>

The review authors were not masked to the report authors and trial results during the assessment. We resolved disagreements by discussion. We considered four parameters: allocation concealment and method of allocation to treatment (selection bias), masking of participants and examiners (performance bias and detection bias) and exclusions after randomisation and losses to follow-up (attrition bias). We assessed each parameter of trial quality according to the 'Risk of bias' table and judged as 'low risk', 'high risk' or 'unclear risk'.

At two years, on review of the case notes, 2/42 patients had presented back to the trial centre with recurrent corneal erosion, one in the treatment group and one in the control (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.05 to 15.49). <LINK REF="STD-Eke-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eke 1999</LINK> did not state explicitly whether recurrences required further treatment.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-24 10:20:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The majority of acute episodes of recurrent corneal erosion can be treated with simple medical (standard) therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Hykin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hykin 1994</LINK>). Following resolution of an episode of recurrent erosion there is no firm evidence from the trials to suggest the best prophylactic regimen in patients with recurrent corneal erosion. There was no difference in the prophylactic effect of tetracycline ointment and hypertonic saline ointment (<LINK REF="STD-Yamada-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Yamada 1998</LINK>) or between paraffin (lubricating) ointment and hypertonic saline ointment (<LINK REF="STD-Hykin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hykin 1994</LINK>). Indeed, despite prophylaxis with ointment many participants may continue to suffer with symptoms of recurrent erosion and require ongoing therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Eke-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eke 1999</LINK>). Current clinical practice is to treat an episode of recurrent corneal erosion with antibiotic or lubricating ointment and/or drops, which may be continued once the episode has resolved to prevent further episodes of recurrent corneal erosion. Diamond burr polishing has been shown to reduce episodes of recurrent corneal erosions compared to epithelial debridement but there are no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing epithelial debridement and conservative management (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>For averting the development of recurrent corneal erosion following a traumatic corneal abrasion due to a fingernail injury, lubricating ointment at night for two months in addition to standard treatment (cyclopentolate drops, then chloramphenicol ointment for five days) led to increased development of the symptoms of recurrent corneal erosion at three months compared to standard therapy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Eke-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Eke 1999</LINK>). This was the only included study to examine measures to avert the development of recurrent corneal erosion following traumatic corneal abrasion; clearly more studies are needed. It is common practice to treat a traumatic corneal abrasion with antibiotic and/or lubricating ointment, however, such therapy is not always continued for months.</P>
<P>Safety data for these treatments were limited. An early study reported that excimer laser did not to change the vision, intraocular pressure or refraction (<LINK REF="STD-Ohman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ohman 1998</LINK>). However, hyperopic shift has been reported with a subepithelial excimer laser ablation technique for recurrent erosion (<LINK REF="STD-Hutz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hutz 2010</LINK>). Diamond burr polishing can cause astigmatism, although the rate of this complication is less than for epithelial debridement (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2009</LINK>). Oral tetracyclines disturbed the gastrointestinal system in two patients (<LINK REF="STD-Hope_x002d_Ross-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Hope-Ross 1994a</LINK>) and therapeutic contact lens wear was complicated by loss of the epithelium or contact lens, or both (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1985</LINK>). Newer lens styles may avoid such complications. The number of patients treated in the trials by anterior stromal puncture or superficial keratectomy was too small for conclusions to be reached on the effectiveness and safety of these treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Hykin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hykin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamada-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Yamada 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-08 14:29:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The limited evidence from the trials suggests that the symptoms and signs of recurrent corneal erosion may be reduced or controlled by one of the following treatments: the addition of oral tetracycline 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks or topical prednisolone 0.5% four times daily for one week, or both, to standard treatment (preservative-free cyclopentolate and chloramphenicol drops, and paraffin (lubricating) ointment at night combined with manual debridement of loose epithelium) (<LINK REF="STD-Hope_x002d_Ross-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Hope-Ross 1994a</LINK>); or excimer laser ablation alone (<LINK REF="STD-Hutz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hutz 2010</LINK>) or in addition to mechanical debridement (<LINK REF="STD-Ohman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ohman 1998</LINK>). However, patients in <LINK REF="STD-Hope_x002d_Ross-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Hope-Ross 1994a</LINK> had a high rate of meibomian gland dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Hope_x002d_Ross-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope-Ross 1994b</LINK>); oral tetracyclines and topical prednisolone may have improved this condition rather than recurrent corneal erosion. Therapeutic contact lenses were inferior to lubricants in abolishing the symptoms of recurrent erosion and had a high complication rate. Newer lenses with higher oxygen transmission and reduced complication rates are now available (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1985</LINK>). Indeed newer generation contact lenses are currently used to treat some episodes of recurrent corneal erosion that do not respond to medical therapy and to prevent further episodes of recurrent corneal erosion.</P>
<P>For recurrent erosion it is difficult to assess accurately on examination the number of erosions a patient may have had after treatment, as erosions typically resolve quickly and therefore may be missed if the patient is examined only at fixed intervals. Patient history (symptoms) may provide a more accurate measure of the number of erosions experienced by a patient. However, in the trials we examined a variety of symptoms were measured in different ways and no study used a validated instrument for their measurement. Non-validated assessments are open to bias and ambiguity. Future trials should use standardised and validated measures to assess patients' symptoms in order to provide an appropriate outcome measure for trials of recurrent corneal erosion. The examiner and patients should be masked, though for trials of therapeutic contact lens wear, patching and ointment use this may not be possible for participants. Appropriate safety information is also essential when selecting treatments. Standardised ocular and, if appropriate, systemic safety data should be explicitly collected and stated by all trials to allow treatment success to be weighed against the risks. The trials assessed in this review do, however, highlight regimens that are in use for recurrent erosion or its prevention and may provide the direction for future studies. Future trials of recurrent corneal erosion should standardise inclusion and exclusion criteria, improve the allocation process, ensure masking of participants and examiners where possible, use validated outcome measures, define standard therapy and, like the current trials, ensure there are no significant losses to follow-up.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-08-08 14:29:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The included trials were heterogenous and possibly of poor quality. In particular, inclusion criteria were variable, allocation concealment was inadequate and therefore a source of potential bias, masking unclear and outcome measures were not validated. We made attempts to contact the authors to clarify issues regarding the possibility of allocation, performance, detection and attrition bias in these trials. However, no response was received from the authors. Three of the seven studies were published prior to publication of the CONSORT statement in 1996 and this may account for their variable quality. The variability and inadequacies of these trials meant that it was not appropriate to directly compare the trials; thus, it could not be determined if one prophylaxis or treatment regimen was superior to another or to no treatment. Indeed, the treatment regimes examined in the trials are all utilised in current clinical practice, reflecting the lack of firm evidence for the efficacy or safety of any treatment. The one study that examined a regimen to avert the development of recurrent corneal erosion following traumatic corneal abrasion was of poor quality and did not provide firm evidence for the development of clinical guidelines.</P>
<P>Two additional trials included in this update, <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hutz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hutz 2010</LINK>, showed substantially superior quality in their assessment of bias when judged using current standards. However, the fact that only two additional trials are included since the last update highlights the difficulty in performing randomised controlled trials for recurrent corneal erosion. Improved collaboration, such as the establishment of an international working group, may be needed to improve the quality of evidence to guide the management of recurrent corneal erosion.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-08-08 14:29:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Randomised controlled trials have investigated a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic regimens to improve the clinical management of recurrent corneal erosion and to avert the development of recurrent corneal erosion following traumatic abrasion. Unfortunately the trials included in this review have been of insufficient quality to provide firm evidence to inform the development of management guidelines in recurrent corneal erosion. The trials to date have been informative in describing the therapies that exist and some of their risks, such as the potential for complications with therapeutic contact lenses. Newer contact lenses with higher oxygen transmissibility, however, may avert such risks. This information could be used to provide patients with information on the treatments available and their possible complications but not on their success or complication rates. Mechanical debridement also appears to be an effective treatment for second-line therapy although the best method of debridement remains to be determined.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-08 15:00:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Investigators planning clinical trials in recurrent corneal erosion can use this review and its included studies to design trials to investigate the success and risks of different prophylactic and therapeutic regimens for recurrent corneal erosion. Future trials of recurrent corneal erosion should examine regimes to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>avert the development of recurrent corneal erosion following traumatic corneal abrasion (prophylactic regimen). These trials should include people with traumatic corneal abrasions;</LI>
<LI>prevent the occurrence of further episodes once a diagnosis of recurrent corneal erosion has been made (prophylactic regimen); and</LI>
<LI>treat episodes of recurrent corneal erosion (treatment regime).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The latter two types of trial should include people with recurrent corneal erosion occurring spontaneously, following corneal trauma, or with evidence of epithelial basement membrane dystrophy. Recurrent corneal erosion should be diagnosed based on the typical history of eye pain, watering and increased sensitivity to light on waking. A validated patient symptom questionnaire should be developed to allow the accurate identification of recurrent corneal erosion. Participants with any corneal dystrophy other than epithelial basement membrane dystrophy and with systemic diseases known to be associated with recurrent corneal erosion, such as epidermolysis bullosa, should be excluded.</P>
<P>Medical and surgical treatments for recurrent corneal erosion, including excimer laser therapy, should be trialled. Such treatments should be compared to each other and to no treatment. Patients should be randomised into the treatment (or no treatment) groups and where possible both the participant and observer should be masked. Outcomes that should be measured include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>recurrence after treatment (number in total, number improved and requiring further treatment, and time to recurrence);</LI>
<LI>symptom recurrence and severity; and</LI>
<LI>safety data (including the best-corrected visual acuity, conjunctival injection, intraocular pressure, development of cataract, refraction and occurrence of an ocular or systemic adverse event).</LI>
