<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-19 10:57:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Stomach contents can regurgitate up the gullet into the wind pipe and enter the lungs when there is no cough reflex, e.g. during general anaesthesia. Solid food can block airways and cause breathing difficulties. The acidic liquid from the stomach can damage the lungs. This is called aspiration pneumonitis or Mendelson&#8217;s syndrome. It can lead to serious illness or even death. Many caesarean sections now are undertaken using epidural or spinal anaesthesia, and here the risk is much lower because the woman stays awake and the cough reflex remains intact. A breathing tube, which provides a seal, is normally placed in the windpipe when setting up a general anaesthetic to try to prevent this problem. However, aspiration can still occur before the tube is inserted and when it is removed.  It is thought that both the acidity and amount of fluid inhaled contribute to how much damage occurs in the lungs in the event of inhalation of the fluid into the lungs and how sick people become.  </P>
<P>Thirty-two studies were included in this review. However, only 22 studies, involving 2658 women, provided data for analysis, looking at interventions given prior to caesarean section for reducing the risk of aspiration. There were several different drugs and drug combinations being considered and the studies were generally of poor or questionable quality. Antacids (like sodium citrate), H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists (like ranitidine), proton pump antagonists (like omeprazole), all reduced the acidity of the stomach contents. An antacid plus an H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonist also reduced acidity. In theory, a combination like this, where the antacid acts quickly and the H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists takes a little longer, should protect at periods of greatest risk, i.e. the beginning and end of the procedure (i.e. intubation and extubation). More research is needed to identify the best combination of drugs and to check for possible adverse effects.</P>

<P>Thirty-two studies were included in this review. However, only 22 studies, involving 2658 women, provided data for analysis. All the women in the included studies had a caesarean section under general anaesthesia. The studies covered a number of comparisons, but were mostly small and of unclear or poor quality.</P>
<P>When compared with no treatment or placebo, there was a significant reduction in the risk of intragastric pH &lt; 2.5 with antacids (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.32, two studies, 108 women), H<SUB>2 </SUB>antagonists (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.18, two studies, 170 women) and proton pump antagonists (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.46, one study 80 women). H<SUB>2</SUB> antagonists were associated with a reduced the risk of intragastric pH &lt; 2.5 at intubation when compared with proton pump antagonists (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.97, one study, 120 women), but compared with antacids the findings were unclear. The combined use of 'antacids plus H<SUB>2</SUB> antagonists' was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of intragastric pH &lt; 2.5 at intubation when compared with placebo (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.15, one study, 89 women) or compared with antacids alone (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.92, one study, 119 women).</P>

<P>The quality of the evidence was poor, but the findings suggest that the combination of antacids plus H<SUB>2</SUB> antagonists was more effective than no intervention, and superior to antacids alone in preventing low gastric pH. However, none of the studies assessed potential adverse effects or substantive clinical outcomes.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-05-21 10:29:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Aspiration pneumonitis was first described by Mendelson in the 1940s (<LINK REF="REF-Mendelson-1946" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendelson 1946</LINK>). It occurs when gastric acid gains access to the lungs in the absence of a cough reflex. Although rare, during anaesthesia for caesarean section, aspiration pneumonitis is still a cause of maternal mortality even in well-resourced countries such as the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-CEMD-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CEMD 2001</LINK>). Aspiration pneumonitis is largely associated with general anaesthesia, with passive regurgitation of gastric contents being the main risk factor. In contrast, vomiting is an active process and is not necessary for aspiration to occur. As regional anaesthesia is now used more frequently for caesarean section, the incidence of aspiration pneumonitis is very rare. However, prophylaxis against acid aspiration (also known as gastric aspiration) and aspiration pneumonitis is still important as there will be situations that require general anaesthesia for caesarean section (for example, emergency caesarean section or where regional anaesthesia has failed or is contraindicated). Restricting food and fluids in labour is another intervention aimed at reducing the risk of aspiration pneumonitis; however, evidence on the effectiveness of this is covered in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Singata-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singata 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-10-30 07:59:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several different types of drugs have been used to reduce the risks and effects of acid aspiration. These include antacids, H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs, either alone or in combination. This wide range may reflect the absence of an ideal regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Grieff-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grieff 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sweeney-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeney 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tordoff-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tordoff 1990</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antacids</HEADING>
<P>Antacids (such as sodium citrate) are alkaline agents used to directly neutralise gastric acid. Antacids are often given just prior to induction of general anaesthesia, and while they increase intragastric pH, they also increase intragastric volume, and may cause more harm than benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Bond-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bond 1979</LINK>). It is possible that aspiration of antacid solutions may also cause lung damage. Non-particulate antacids (such as sodium citrate) are thought to be less likely to increase the risk of severe pneumonitis compared to particulate antacids (magnesium trisilicate) should aspiration occur (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 1979</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists/inhibitors</HEADING>
<P>H<SUB>2 </SUB>receptor antagonists (such as ranitidine) act by inhibiting the secretion of acid into the stomach, which reduces both the volume and acidity of the stomach contents (<LINK REF="REF-Thwaites-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thwaites 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Proton pump antagonists</HEADING>
<P>Proton pump antagonists (such as omeprazole) act by blocking the production of stomach acid by interfering with the pump which secretes protons (acid) into the stomach (<LINK REF="REF-Browne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browne 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prokinetic drugs</HEADING>
<P>Prokinetic drugs increase gastric motility and therefore accelerate gastric emptying and reduce gastric volume. The most commonly used prokinetic drug is metoclopramide which may also act as an anti-emetic (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1984</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Nasogastric tube aspiration</HEADING>
<P>Nasogastric aspiration or suction is the process of physically draining the stomach's contents using a nasogastric tube, to remove gastric secretions and swallowed air. It can be used in preparation for surgery and to extract gastric liquid for research purposes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessing effectiveness</HEADING>
<P>As aspiration pneumonitis is a rare event, it is difficult to conduct a randomised controlled trial large enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of an intervention to reduce risk.  For this reason, clinical trials on prophylactic drugs have focused on the surrogate measures of gastric pH and volume. This is a disadvantage because there is no guarantee that a change in the surrogate measure will reflect a difference in outcome of interest (i.e. aspiration pneumonitis). The pathophysiology of aspiration pneumonitis relates to both the volume and the acidity of the fluid aspirated.  An intragastric pH lower than 2.5 and a volume greater than 0.4 mL/kg are the traditionally described criteria for increased risk of severe lung injury and mortality. These criteria were originally described by Mendelson (<LINK REF="REF-Mendelson-1946" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendelson 1946</LINK>), and were derived from animal experiments (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1974</LINK>). However, the evidence that these surrogate measures increase the risk of aspiration pneumonitis in pregnant women undergoing caesarean section under general anaesthesia is absent. Failure to adequately raise intragastric pH and lower intragastric volume may not be due to the specific drug, but due to other factors, such as the time interval between administration and surgery, or to interaction with other drugs. Opioids in particular slow down gastric emptying and can reduce the effectiveness of prophylactic drugs used. Measurements are usually taken just after induction of anaesthesia and just before extubation (removal of the endotracheal tube) to reflect the intragastric conditions at the time of greatest aspiration risk (<LINK REF="REF-Ewart-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewart 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tripathi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathi 1995</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-03 22:44:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>The administration of an antacid and H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonist, and sometimes a prokinetic and antiemetic drug (such as metoclopramide, a phenothiazine-like drug aimed at accelerating gastric emptying and reducing nausea, vomiting and aspiration pneumonitis), has been standard practice prior to caesarean section in maternity units in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>). However, clinical practice has varied across the world. Some countries including the UK also routinely administer drugs (such as ranitidine) to all women in labour with the aim of reducing the risk of aspiration pneumonitis should anaesthesia be required for caesarean section, even though the evidence for such practice is poor (<LINK REF="REF-Gyte-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyte 2006</LINK>). Any pharmacological intervention may produce side effects or serious complications, including anaphylaxis. Pharmacological antiemetics are associated with a number of side effects such as excessive sedation, restlessness, dystonic reactions (abnormal muscle tone) and extra pyramidal symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Numazaki-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Numazaki 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a need to review the evidence of effectiveness of pharmacological drugs to reduce aspiration pneumonitis for women who have caesarean sections. The evidence of effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent nausea and vomiting for women who have caesarean sections will be considered in a separate review on 'Interventions for reducing nausea and vomiting at caesarean section'.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged to be sufficiently similar.  If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects analysis to produce an overall summary, if this was considered clinically meaningful.  If an average treatment effect across trials was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine heterogeneous trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results have been presented as the average treatment effect and its 95% confidence interval, the 95% prediction interval for the underlying treatment effect, and the estimates of Tau² and I². </P>
<P>We combined results of trials using drugs that have the same mechanism of action if the treatment regimens were assessed to be compatible.

The assessment of incomplete data showed half the studies having low risk of bias here and in the other half it was unclear.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-15 22:25:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Aspiration pneumonitis is a rare outcome and therefore the primary outcome measure in the studies that we identified were surrogate measures, i.e. intragastric pH and intragastric volume. The validity of these surrogate markers, however, is uncertain as it is based on work on animal experiments from 1974 (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1974</LINK>). Many studies have defined and reported high risk of aspiration as a combination of low intragastric pH (less than 2.5) and raised intragastric volume (greater than 25 mL). This combined measure was not a pre-specified outcome in our review but we have included and presented the data on this for completeness. The studies did not answer the broader question of whether the surrogate markers (of pH and gastric volume) actually correlate with clinical outcome in the context of aspiration pneumonitis.</P>
<P>All but two of the studies that we identified in this review included women who had caesarean section (CS) under general anaesthesia. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1996</LINK>) studied women who had CS under spinal anaesthesia and the type of anaesthesia used was unclear in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Zue-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zue 1999</LINK>). The majority of studies included women who had elective CS (N = 16); five studies included women who had emergency CS, hence we are unable to draw conclusions about the differences between elective and non-elective CS. The findings of this review are generally applicable for women having CS under general anaesthesia (or those who convert from regional to general anaesthesia). Aspiration under regional anaesthesia is exceptionally rare, but may occur in the presence of other serious clinical problems such as seizures and life-threatening haemorrhage.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-12-15 22:25:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of studies included in this review was generally poor. Only one study was assessed to have adequate sequence generation and concealment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Orr-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1993</LINK>). It was unclear whether or not randomisation sequence generation and allocation concealment were adequate in the majority of studies. The majority of studies were not blinded, although this could have been done feasibly.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-04-29 21:55:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The possibility of introducing bias was present at every stage of reviewing process. We attempted to minimise bias in a number of ways; two review authors assessed eligibility for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias. Each worked independently. Nevertheless, the process of assessing risk of bias, for example, is not an exact science and includes many personal judgements.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-11-10 11:20:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Current practice in the UK mostly includes the administration of the combination of antacids and H<SUB>2</SUB> antagonists prior to CS (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>). However, this is not routine practice in many centres worldwide. The findings from this review suggest that the combined use of antacids and H<SUB>2 </SUB>antagonists have a role in reducing intragastric pH less than 2.5, and hence possibly in reducing the risk of aspiration pneumonitis during CS, particularly under general anaesthesia.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-08-05 11:44:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>In summary, the quality of the evidence was poor, but the findings suggest that the combination of antacids plus H<SUB>2</SUB> antagonists was shown to be more effective than no intervention, and superior to antacids alone in increasing gastric pH.  When a single agent is used, antacids alone are superior to H<SUB>2</SUB> antagonists, which are superior to proton pump inhibitors for increasing gastric pH. The effects of treatments on gastric volume are less consistently reported. These findings are relevant for all women undergoing caesarean section, particularly those under general anaesthesia. Whether women undergoing caesarean section under regional anaesthesia should receive aspiration prophylaxis is a clinical judgement; however, since the treatments are relatively well tolerated, and inexpensive, their use should be strongly considered in view of the potential of benefit, particularly as aspiration still is a cause of maternal mortality.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-12-15 22:25:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>This review confirms the efficacy of many of the commonly used aspiration prophylaxis regimens compared with placebo in reducing gastric pH and volume. However, many studies, particularly those examining combinations of different modalities of prophylaxis, were small and of generally poor quality. Large well-designed studies that include women having emergency and elective caesarean section under regional and general anaesthesia are required to confirm the conclusions of this review.</P>
<P>Further work is required to validate the suitability of surrogate markers (of pH and gastric volume) for clinical outcomes in the context of aspiration pneumonitis.</P>

<LI>The title was changed from 'Drugs at caesarean section for preventing nausea, vomiting and aspiration pneumonitis' to 'Interventions at caesarean section for reducing aspiration pneumonitis' because we wished to include complimentary medicines and mechanical methods (however, we found no studies). In addition, it was felt that the interventions to reduce nausea and vomiting during caesarean section should be a separate review. This second review will look at the effect of 'Interventions given during caesarean section to reduce nausea and vomiting'.</LI>
<LI>We modified the 'Types of participants' from 'Healthy pregnant women with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy at term undergoing elective or emergency caesarean section under general or regional anaesthesia' to 'Pregnant women undergoing elective or emergency caesarean section under general or regional anaesthesia' because we felt the interventions needed should be applicable to a wider range of women.</LI>
<LI>We removed reference to route of administration in the inclusion criteria. Relevent studies will be included regardless of the route of administration of the trial medication. A comparison of the efficacy of different routes of administration will be included in subgroup analysis if sufficient data exist.</LI>
<LI>We removed the pharmacological and non-pharmacological subgroups because we felt the interventions should be considered more individually. We added elective caesarean section and emergency caesarean section subgroups because we felt the outcomes may be different in these two differing situations.</LI>
<LI>Several papers reported gastric volume and pH as continuous outcomes, and 'at risk of aspiration'. These were not pre-specified in our protocol but we have included them in the review as they are informative. In the protocol we had prespecified dichotomous outcomes for gastric pH as greater than 2.5, however we changed this to pH less than 2.5 as this is what the majority of papers have reported, and is intuitively easier to interpret.</LI>
<LI>We have taken out general versus regional anaesthesia as a subgroup comparison as all the randomised controlled trials that investigate this outcome were in women who had general anaesthesia.</LI>
<LI>We have updated the methods to the current standard methods used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. </LI>
