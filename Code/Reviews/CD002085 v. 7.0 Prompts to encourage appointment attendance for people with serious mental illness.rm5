<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>First appointments at a mental health clinic can be a daunting prospect. Failure to attend is common, wastes time, and can result in important delays in getting proper care. A gentle prompt, near to the time of appointment, would, if effective, seem a cost effective way of encouraging attendance. This review sought evidence for the effects of telephoning or sending a letter, in the days just before the appointment. Relevant studies were found, and although none were conclusive, all suggested that a simple prompt could indeed encourage attendance.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Prompts to encourage attendance at clinics are often used in day-to-day practice by diligent carers of people with mental health problems. These may take the form of telephone prompting, financial incentives or issuing a copy of the referral letter to the appointee.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-02-16 10:10:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Matthew Rowett">
<P>To estimate the effects of simple prompting by professional carers to encourage attendance at clinics for those with suspected serious mental illness.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-06-14 11:00:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2009) and reference lists, as well as contacting authors of studies. We updated this search on 17 May 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-02-16 09:57:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Matthew Rowett">
<P>All relevant randomised (or quasi-randomised) studies comparing the addition of 'prompts' to standard care for those with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Prompts had the stated purpose of encouraging attendance or contact with mental health teams and could be text-based, (for example in the form of a letter), electronic, by telephone call, by personal visit, or could employ financial or other rewards.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies and data were independently selected and extracted. For homogeneous dichotomous data the random effects relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data the reviewers calculated weighted mean differences.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-14 11:01:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only four relevant trials were identified (total n=789). It is not clear whether there is any real difference between attendance of those prompted by telephone one or two days before the appointment, and those given the standard appointment management system (2 RCTs, n=457, RR missed appointment 0.84 CI 0.7 to 1.1). Text-based prompts in the form of a letter, a few days before the appointment day, may increase clinic attendance when compared with no prompt (3 RCTs, n=326, RR missed appointment 0.76 CI 0.43 to 1.32). Only one small study (n=61) reported data on the combination of telephone and text-based prompts versus no prompt, no real difference between groups was apparent (RR missed appointment 0.7 CI 0.4 to 1.2). When telephone prompts were compared with text-based prompts (1 RCT, n=75), the latter, in the form of an 'orientation statement' (a short paragraph, taking about 30 seconds to read, explaining the programme of care, the fee system, and providing gentle encouragement) may be somewhat more effective than the telephone prompt (RR missed appointment 1.9 CI 0.98 to 3.8). One study (n=120) compared a standard letter prompt with a letter 'orientation statement'. Overall, results tended to favour the orientation statement approach rather than the simple letter prompting attendance but the results did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (RR missed appointment 1.6 CI 0.9 to 2.9). When prompts were considered regardless of their type, the results were of greater significance and suggested an effect to increase the rate of attendance (RR missed appointments 0.80 CI 0.65 to 0.98). The inclusion of five new studies to the awaiting classification section may affect results when assessed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-01-19 07:31:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence that a simple prompt to attend clinic, very close to the time of the appointment may encourage attendance, and a simple orientation-type letter may be more effective than a telephone prompt. This simple intervention could be a more cost effective means of encouraging compliance at first attendance, but supplementing these data with the results of large, well designed, conducted and reported randomised studies would be desirable.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-22 11:29:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Matthew Rowett">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-01-18 17:20:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A delicate balance must be struck in the care of those with serious mental health problems. On one hand a person's right to autonomy and privacy must be respected, and on the other, illnesses that erode insight and cause a downward spiral in quality of life have to be managed (<LINK REF="REF-Mechanic-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mechanic 1997</LINK>). Effective management of those with severe mental health problems is often difficult to achieve when those most in need of care can be the hardest to approach (<LINK REF="REF-Tyrer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyrer 1999</LINK>). Even early on in a person's illness, if initial support and treatment are not provided, people are rendered more vulnerable to relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Commander-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commander 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is difficult to measure the effects of poor clinic/follow-up attendance for people with serious mental illness, their carers and society. A survey in the UK showed that every week each family practitioner in the country has at least four appointments for consultations made but not attended. This leads to longer waiting times for other patients (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS 1995</LINK>). The situation may be worse for those with mental health problems. Compliance at clinic is especially important for those with severe mental illness, since those who drop out after their first contact may experience significant deterioration in their mental state (<LINK REF="REF-Killaspy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killaspy 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Killaspy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killaspy 2000</LINK>) and are more likely to require compulsory admissions (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several patient characteristics amongst those with serious mental illness are associated with poor treatment compliance. For example, one study indicated that factors suggesting some stability in a person's life, such as having a telephone, correlated more closely with treatment compliance than general demographic, socio-economic or clinical variables (<LINK REF="REF-Hershorn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hershorn 1993</LINK>). Another, later investigation suggested that increased compliance is associated with good patient satisfaction, high levels of supervision, the patient having a positive view of the disorder and stable family circumstances (<LINK REF="REF-Barnard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnard 1998</LINK>). Decrease in compliance is to be expected when the treatment regimen is complex, and when factors such as adverse effects, social isolation, substance abuse and increased duration of therapy are involved (<LINK REF="REF-Little-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Barnard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnard 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-01-18 17:22:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prompts to encourage attendance at clinics, or compliance with medication, are often used in day-to-day practice by diligent carers. These may take the form of telephone prompting (<LINK REF="STD-Burgoyne-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Burgoyne 1983</LINK>) with or without specific visits to the home (<LINK REF="STD-Thi-Phan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thi Phan 1995</LINK>). Sometimes financial incentives are employed (<LINK REF="REF-Giuffrida-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giuffrida 1997</LINK>). Issuing a copy of the referral letter to the appointee may prompt attendance for the initial appointment (<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 1999</LINK>). All such prompts may be embedded within complex care packages, especially for those with ongoing illness. The value of the element of prompt is, however, unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Smoller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smoller 1998</LINK>) and there are no guidelines that describe when prompts should be employed. This is especially topical where mental health strategies strive to ensure close supervision of mentally ill people either in hospital or local clinics (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>The reviewers (SR, MR, SM) independently inspected all reports of identified studies. It was usually possible to resolve any disagreement by consensus; however, where doubt remained the full article was acquired. The reviewers independently decided whether these met the review criteria. No blinding to the names of authors, institutions and journal of publication took place. Again, any disagreements were resolved by consensus. When this proved impossible, further information was sought and, in the interim, these trials were added to 'Awaiting assessment' list.</P>

<P>Again working independently, SR, and MR assessed risk of bias using the tool described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). This tool encourages consideration of how the sequence was generated, how allocation was concealed, the integrity of blinding at outcome, the completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other biases. We would not have included studies where sequence generation was at high risk of bias or where allocation was clearly not concealed. If disputes arose as to which category a trial has to be allocated, again, resolution was made by discussion.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-03-15 14:41:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the random-effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For statistically significant results we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using Visual Rx (<A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/">http://www.nntonline.net/</A>) taking account of the event rate in the control group.</P>
<P>2. Continuous data<BR/>2.1 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated a random-effect weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups. We did not calculate effect size measures.</P>
<P>2.2 Endpoint versus change data<BR/>We preferred to use scale endpoint data, which typically cannot have negative values and is easier to interpret from a clinical point of view. Change data are often not ordinal and are very problematic to interpret. If endpoint data were unavailable, we used change data.</P>
<P>2.3 Skewed data<BR/>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aim to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above will be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants were entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and were entered into syntheses.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2010-01-18 17:47:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).<BR/>Where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies, we presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation co-efficient of their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.<BR/>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).<BR/>If cluster studies has been appropriately analysed taking into account intraclass correlation co-efficient and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>2. Cross-over trials<BR/>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carryover effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia, we will only use data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
<P>3. Studies with multiple treatment groups<BR/>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, the additional treatment arms were presented in comparisons. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, these data were not reproduced.</P>

<P>Where possible we employed a random-effect model for analyses. We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed or random-effect models. The random-effect method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects.

For this reason we favour using fixed-effect models employing random-effect only when investigating heterogeneity.</P>

We would have wanted to explore heterogeneity. We pre-specify no characteristics of studies that may be associated with heterogeneity except quality of trial method. If no clear association could be shown by sorting studies by quality of methods a random-effect meta-analysis was performed. Should another characteristic of the studies be highlighted by the investigation of heterogeneity, perhaps some clinical heterogeneity not hitherto predicted but plausible causes of heterogeneity, these post-hoc reasons will be discussed and the data analysed and presented.

While the intent of this review is to look at encouraging attendance at clinic appointments in general, all four included studies looked at attendance at first appointment.</P>
<P>1. Participants<BR/>No trial met the original inclusion criteria of focusing only on "anyone having been diagnosed with, or suspected of, a serious mental illness such as schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses, diagnosed by any criteria. (Please see '<LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>: Limited data'). The inclusion of studies where all participants were due to attend their first appointments at community mental health centres and general adult clinics allows some speculation on how prompting may affect attendance of seriously mentally ill people. Certainly, a high proportion of those attending such centres should suffer from undiagnosed serious mental illnesses. While this may result in a more heterogeneous study population, it is more likely to accurately reflect the effects of prompts in the first attender population. The demographic background of the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Burgoyne-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Burgoyne 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Swenson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Swenson 1988</LINK> was not described but people entering the <LINK REF="STD-Kluger-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kluger 1983</LINK> study were, on average, in their thirties, over 70% male and over 60% from African-American or Hispanic background. The <LINK REF="STD-Burgoyne-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Burgoyne 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kluger-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kluger 1983</LINK> studies were both set in urban North American cities. <LINK REF="STD-Swenson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Swenson 1988</LINK>, on the other hand was run from a Community Mental Health Centre that served a small urban and rural population in the Midwest of the USA. <LINK REF="STD-Kitcheman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kitcheman 2008</LINK> looked at people attending the outpatient clinic for the first time, in seven study clinics for different psychiatric sub-specialities, in an urban population in the north of England. Some of these sub-specialities would have a low rate of serious mental illness such as schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses. Analysis of data from this study was therefore limited to the general adult clinic sample as it was felt this group would have the higher rate of serious mental illness. The funnel plot in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> shows that, prior to the inclusion of this small subgroup, there may have been a publication bias towards positive effects.</P>
<P>2. Interventions<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Burgoyne-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Burgoyne 1983</LINK> compared telephone prompt (48 hours before clinic) with a control (no telephone call). <LINK REF="STD-Kluger-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kluger 1983</LINK> also compared a telephone prompt, this time 24 hours before clinic, with a control. This study had two additional groups. One received an orientation statement and the other an orientation statement and a telephone call. The orientation statement was a short paragraph, taking about 30 seconds to read, explaining the programme of care, the fee system, and providing gentle encouragement. <LINK REF="STD-Swenson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Swenson 1988</LINK> compared a very similar statement delivered either 72 or 24 hours before appointment, with a standard letter prompt, again 72 or 24 hours before the clinic appointment was due. The control group in <LINK REF="STD-Swenson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Swenson 1988</LINK> was issued the standard appointment card. <LINK REF="STD-Kitcheman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kitcheman 2008</LINK> compared an individualised pro-forma letter in the form of an 'orientation statement' (on headed paper explaining the time of the appointment, name of the doctor, description of the clinic and its routine, a map and a request to bring a list of medication and a friend or family member) sent 72 hours before the appointment plus standard care (of either an appointment card within 13 weeks of the appointment or an opt-in partial booking system) with standard care alone.</P>
<P>3. Outcomes<BR/>All four trials reported attendance as a primary outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Burgoyne-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Burgoyne 1983</LINK>, however, reported the outcomes for people with telephones as well as for those without. As people were randomised before it was known whether they had a telephone, and those with telephones were clearly evenly balanced in the two groups, it suggests that the randomisation process was effective. Only these data are presented, as any subtle effect of prompting would be likely to have been masked by the attendance figures for those who could not have received the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Kitcheman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kitcheman 2008</LINK> reported a number of secondary outcomes for their total population but did not provide these data for each sub-speciality.</P>

<P>1. COMPARISON 1. PROMPT BY TYPE versus NO PROMPT (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>)<BR/>Telephone and text-based prompts were compared separately with 'standard care'. The two were then combined and, again, compared with usual care.<BR/>
<BR/>1.1 Did not attend appointment<BR/>1.1.1 Telephone prompts<BR/>Most data are available for telephone prompts (2 trials, n=457). The confidence intervals make it difficult to know whether there were in fact any real differences between attendance of those prompted by telephone one or two days before the appointment, and those given the standard appointment management system (RR missed appointment 0.84 CI 0.7 to 1.1).</P>
<P>1.1.2 Text-based prompts<BR/>Again, confidence intervals make it difficult to know if there is a true effect of a text-based prompt. There were fewer people randomised than in the telephone prompts comparison (3 trials, n=326). Text-based prompts, a few days before the appointment day, appeared to increase clinic attendance but this effect did not make statistical significance (RR missed appointment 0.76 CI 0.43 to 1.32).</P>
<P>1.1.3 Combination of telephone and text-based prompts<BR/>Only one study reported data on this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Kluger-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kluger 1983</LINK>, n=61). Again there is a suggestion of an effect in favour of the prompts but the confidence intervals make it difficult to know whether there was in fact any real difference between the two approaches (RR missed appointments 0.7 CI 0.4 to 1.2).</P>

<BR/>2.1 Did not attend appointment<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Kluger-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kluger 1983</LINK> again provided data for this comparison (n=75). A telephone prompt was compared with an 'Orientation statement'. This was a short paragraph, taking about 30 seconds to read, explaining the programme of care, the fee system, and providing gentle encouragement. The results appeared to favour the text-based prompt although, again the result is not quite statistically significant (RR missed appointments 1.9 CI 0.98 to 3.8).</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 3. TEXT LETTER PROMPT versus TEXT ORIENTATION STATEMENT PROMPT (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>)<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Swenson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Swenson 1988</LINK> (n=120) provided data for this comparison.<BR/>
<BR/>3.1 Did not attend appointment<BR/>3.1.1 Any period before appointment<BR/>Overall, results tended to favour the orientation statement approach rather than the simple letter prompting attendance (RR missed appointments 1.6 CI 0.9 to 2.9), although this effect fails to reach conventional levels of statistical significance.</P>
<P>3.1.2 One or three days before appointment<BR/>Subgroups of the same study present data for attendance for those randomised to receive the different interventions one or three days before clinic. No results are statistically significant, but, if anything, there is a suggestion that an orientation-type prompt within a day of appointment may be best.</P>
<P>4. COMPARISON 4. ANY PROMPT versus NO PROMPT (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>)<BR/>
<BR/>4.1 Did not attend appointment<BR/>Data for all methods of prompting were combined to give a measure of the effect of any kind of prompt on attendance at first appointment (4 trials, n=789). This gave a statistically significant result in favour of prompts encouraging attendance (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>, RR missed appointments 0.80 CI 0.65 to 0.98). On visual inspection the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Kitcheman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kitcheman 2008</LINK> seem at odds with those of the earlier studies. We checked the data and found no unit-of-analysis errors. The <LINK REF="STD-Kitcheman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kitcheman 2008</LINK> study sub-group examined here has a small number of participants resulting in a confidence interval that overlaps with the findings of the earlier studies. The I-squared statistical measure of heterogeneity is only 2% showing little variability between studies that cannot be explained by chance.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-14 10:57:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. COMPARISON 1. PROMPT BY TYPE versus NO PROMPT<BR/>Telephone prompts near to the time of the appointment may have a weak effect and encourage attendance. Even this effect could be very cost-effective, considering financial implications of missed appointments. A large study would be needed to quantify the effect with any confidence. Text-based prompts may also have an effect to reduce non-attendance. Too few data are available to confidently suggest an interaction between the telephone and text-based prompts.</P>
<P>2. COMPARISON 2. TELEPHONE PROMPT versus TEXT-BASED PROMPT<BR/>The one small trial (n=75) does present data suggesting an effect favouring the text-based orientation statement prompt. Such simple interventions could easily be randomised in many different settings to supplement these data.</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 3. TEXT LETTER PROMPT versus TEXT ORIENTATION STATEMENT PROMPT<BR/>Data do suggest that a short, encouraging letter, explaining the working of the clinic, presented a day before appointment, may be most effective, but again, it is impossible to be confident as so few people have been randomised and the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Swenson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Swenson 1988</LINK> should be replicated.</P>
<P>4. COMPARISON 4. ANY PROMPT versus NO PROMPT<BR/>Combining data for all prompts gives the strongest indication of an effect of prompting on reducing non-attendance at first appointments (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). This gives a number needed to treat of 24. While this is a relatively large number the intervention is cheap and would potentially pay for itself through the reduction in costs associated with non-attendance.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-06-14 11:04:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Completeness</P>
<P>There were only four studies looking at encouraging appointment attendance that were able to be included in this review. None of these specifically looked at people with serious mental illness. They all looked at attendance at first appointment. While the findings of this review are suggestive of an effect to encourage attendance further studies that specifically identify those with serious mental illness must be performed before the evidence can be said to be complete. <BR/>
</P>
<P>2. Applicability<BR/>The reviewers know of no other systematic approach to reviewing this area and, although the findings are intriguing, more data are need to support the findings. Only one study is from the UK, the others being from the USA. Three of the studies were set in the inner city and one in a mixed urban-rural environment. The UK-based trial is large overall (n=764) but the sub-group that was specifically likely to be seriously mentally ill is quite small. It is important to ensure that findings are applicable outside of the USA. It is also possible, with the proliferation of portable telephones and access to e-mail, that the results of the earlier studies, now mostly nearly two decades old, may underestimate the effect of contact as accessibility of people should now be greater than in the 1980's. The reviewers eagerly await data to strengthen or refute the current findings.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-06-14 11:05:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Matthew Rowett">
<P>1. Limited data<BR/>The reviewers did consider at great length whether or not to stray from the protocol and include data from studies that were not specifically about the effects of prompts on the attendance of people with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. After consultation with others, it was decided to include data from the trials that could have included seriously mentally ill people. The reviewers still feel that the original question, 'what are the effects of prompting clinic attendance for those with serous mental illness?' is justified of itself, but decided that including data from trials using broader inclusion criteria, would hopefully generate hypotheses for future work. The results, although not specifically about those with severe mental illness, will be of interest to those deciding whether or not to introduce this intervention on a service wide basis, or in a general psychiatric outpatient system, where those with both severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia are cared for alongside those with less severe mental illnesses. The addition of five new studies to awaiting assessment may add further data when assessed.<BR/>
<BR/>2. Overall quality<BR/>Only one study described their method of allocation, (<LINK REF="STD-Kitcheman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kitcheman 2008</LINK>). One study did not blind raters to participant allocation, (<LINK REF="STD-Burgoyne-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Burgoyne 1983</LINK>), and two others did not mention blinding, (<LINK REF="STD-Kluger-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kluger 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swenson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Swenson 1988</LINK>). The most methodologically rigorous study, (<LINK REF="STD-Kitcheman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kitcheman 2008</LINK>), only provided a small sub-group that could be included in this review. This limits the quality of the evidence and may effect the findings by favouring the intervention.<BR/>

<P>1. For people with serious mental illness<BR/>In an age of mobile telephone text messages, twitter, 'blog', e-mail, social networking systems, letters may seem old fashioned - and may indeed be so. Nevertheless some form of contact to remind people of upcoming clinic appointments my be acceptable and effective. In modern well-organised health service, choices should be available.</P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>There is evidence that a very simple prompt to attend clinic, very close to the time of the appointment, may encourage attendance even of those who have serious mental illnesses. Data are weak, however, and clinicians could, relatively easily, undertake their own local randomised evaluation of this technique.</P>
<P>3. For managers and policy makers<BR/>Managers may wish to help avoid the waste of time and expense involved in missed appointments by helping organise an automated system for contacting people. What evidence there is suggests that a simple orientation-type letter, 24 hours before the clinic appointment, may be most effective.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-03-17 14:21:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. General<BR/>Three of the four included studies we found were performed over 20 years ago. The studies of today are usually reported in more detail, thanks to the CONSORT statement (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials;<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). This is intended to improve reporting of randomised controlled trials, enabling readers to understand the design, conduct, analysis and interpretation, and to assess the validity of results. CONSORT emphasises that this can only be achieved through complete transparency from authors.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>The simple intervention could be an automated and most cost effective means of encouraging compliance at first attendance. With so many clinic appointments missed, and the potential for subsequent deterioration of mental state (<LINK REF="REF-Killaspy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killaspy 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Killaspy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killaspy 2000</LINK>), supplementing these weak data with the results of a large, well designed, conducted and reported randomised study would be desirable. We are aware that there are difficulties randomising specifically people with serious mental illness in the out-patient setting. We are also aware that because of the focus of this review (people with serious mental illness) we have fragmented the largest study in this area (<LINK REF="STD-Kitcheman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kitcheman 2008</LINK>, n=764). We do think that more trials are indicated but think that general and broad inclusion criteria would be best but data reporting undertaken in such a way that effects for sub-groups could be analysed separately. We suggest a design in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2009-10-06 21:59:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Matthew Rowett">
<P>Both Dr Reda and Dr Makhoul are of the opinion at the time of completion of the protocol for this review that prompts do increase attendance and compliance with medication. Dr Rowett is of the opinion that any prompt is likely to increase the rate of attendance, although this increase may be small.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2010-03-15 15:18:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This version of the review has substantially changed the protocol from the original, (<LINK REF="REF-Reda-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reda 2001</LINK>). This is in keeping with improvements in methodology as well as the reformatting demanded by upgrade into RevMan 5. Even though the text has changed considerably we do not feel that this is likely to make a substantial difference to the overall results as data have been handled as they were before in the earlier version.</P>
<P>The other difference between protocol and review is use of the Number Needed To Treat (NNT) statistic. As this has been largely superseded by the data in the Summary of Findings tables we have not calculated NNT for specific results.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The participants were clients who phoned themselves to make an appointment which may lead to an artificially high attendance rate. The average waiting time was only eight days so increasing the chances of attending the appointment. The study included children referred to the service so the findings may not be applicable to the general adult population. Appointments on a Monday were excluded which will have an unknown effect on the results.</P>
