<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Acupuncture for dysphagia in acute stroke</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Better designed clinical trials are needed to prove whether acupuncture is effective for treating swallowing difficulties in patients with stroke. Patients who have swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) as a result of their stroke are less likely to survive and be free of disability than stroke patients who can swallow normally. Acupuncture is commonly used to treat this complication in traditional Chinese medicine practice. We systematically reviewed currently available evidence for the use of acupuncture in treating swallowing difficulties after acute stroke. Only one small randomised controlled trial was identified, involving 66 participants, which did not provide clear evidence of benefit from adding acupuncture to standard Western medical treatment. Considering the small sample size and methodological imperfections, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture. More research is needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Dysphagia after acute stroke is associated with poor prognosis, particularly if prolonged. Acupuncture has been widely used for this complication in China. However, its therapeutic effect is unclear.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the therapeutic effect of acupuncture for dysphagia after acute stroke compared with placebo, sham or no acupuncture intervention. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched September 2007), the Chinese Stroke Trials Register and the Trials Register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field (last searched January 2007) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2, 2007). In January 2007 we searched the following databases from the first available date; MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, CISCOM, BIOSIS Previews, ProQuest Digital Dissertations, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ACUBRIEFS, ACP Journal Club, Books@Ovid and Journals@Ovid, Chinese Biological Medicine Database, Chinese scientific periodical database of VIP INFORMATION, China periodical in China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Database, Science China, Chinese Social Science Citation Index, and the Chinese Science and Technology Document Databases. We also searched databases of ongoing trials, conference proceedings, and grey literature, handsearched three Chinese journals and contacted authors and researchers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all truly randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effect of acupuncture, irrespective of type, in patients with dysphagia within 30 day after the onset of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. All types of acupuncture interventions were eligible. The control intervention could be placebo acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or no acupuncture. The primary outcome was recovery of normal feeding. The secondary outcomes were case fatality, deterioration, late disability, length of hospital stay, quality of life, feeding tube removal, aspiration pneumonia and nutritional measures. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by a third review author. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only one trial of 66 participants was included. In the acupuncture group, 12 out of 34 participants recovered to normal feeding (35.3%). In the control group, seven out of 32 participants recovered to normal feeding (21.9%). The relative risk of recovery was 1.61 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.73 to 3.58. No statistical significance was detected.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is not enough evidence to make any conclusion about the therapeutic effect of acupuncture for dysphagia after acute stroke. High quality and large scale randomised controlled trials are needed.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-03-20 11:11:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Cerebrovascular disease was the second leading causes of death in 1990 as indicated in the Global Burden of Disease Study (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>). Dysphagia is one of the most important stroke-related problems (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003b</LINK>), particularly if prolonged. It is associated with stroke severity, dysphasia and lesions of the frontal and insular cortex on brain imaging (<LINK REF="REF-Iizuka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iizuka 2005</LINK>). Between 22% to 65% of acute stroke patients are affected, depending on the time of assessment, the diagnostic method used, and case mix (<LINK REF="REF-Daniels-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smithard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smithard 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smithard-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smithard 1998a</LINK>). Dysphagia resolves in most patients within one week to one month, and persists in only a small number of patients beyond six months (<LINK REF="REF-Smithard-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smithard 1998b</LINK>). Dysphagia suggests a poor prognosis, and increases the risk of chest infection, malnutrition, persistent disability, prolonged hospital stay, institutionalisation on discharge, and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paciaroni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paciaroni 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Early dysphagia management may reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia and assure quality care with optimal outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Odderson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odderson 1995</LINK>). Treatment techniques for dysphagia may be categorised as: direct strategies, indirect strategies, compensatory strategies (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 2000</LINK>), gastrointestinal nutrition, medication and surgery. Direct strategies involve modifying the feeding position, location of food in the mouth, food consistency and feeding environment, such as cold stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Logemann-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Logemann 1991</LINK>). Indirect strategies include stimulation of the oral and pharyngeal structures without swallowing (<LINK REF="REF-Lazarra-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazarra 1986</LINK>), such as surface electromyographic (sEMG) biofeedback (<LINK REF="REF-Crary-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crary 2004</LINK>), or transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES). Compensatory strategies make swallowing easier usually by changing the food's path and learning special skills, such as turning head, chin-down, nodding-like swallowing, exchanging swallowing, and swallowing air. Gastrointestinal nutrition is needed only when patients have difficulties in acquiring sufficient nutrition and involves feeding via a nasogastric tube (NGT) or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube (<LINK REF="REF-PEGASUS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEGASUS 1998</LINK>). Early tube feeding might reduce case fatality but at the expense of increasing the proportion of patients surviving with poor outcome (<LINK REF="REF-FOOD-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">FOOD 2005</LINK>). Early gastrostomy feeding is associated with a significant reduction in six-week mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Norton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 1996</LINK>), especially for older patients because it is relatively less invasive than surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Sami-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sami 2005</LINK>). However, more recent data are less clear and do not support a policy of early initiation of PEG feeding in dysphagic stroke patients (<LINK REF="REF-FOOD-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">FOOD 2005</LINK>). NGT was found to have a better outcome than feeding with PEG tubes (<LINK REF="REF-Teasell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teasell 2005</LINK>), while it offered only limited protection against aspiration pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Dziewas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dziewas 2004</LINK>). In addition, in the acute stroke unit, multidisciplinary practice (<LINK REF="REF-Kappelle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kappelle 2004</LINK>) involving a decision-making algorithm for dietary management appears to be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Runions-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Runions 2004</LINK>). Hence, it seems prudent to include dysphagia-specific management as part of standard protocols in stroke management (<LINK REF="REF-EHTAG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">EHTAG 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acupuncture therapy has been widely used to treat stroke and its complications, for example, dysphagia in China for at least 2000 years. Attempts to treat dysphagia caused by other reasons were also documented, which includes cerebral trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Zou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zou 2004</LINK>), motor neuron disease (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 1997a</LINK>) and digestive system disease (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2001</LINK>). Dysphagia after stroke pertains to the categories of radix lingua disease after wind stroke, yinfei, and larynx obstruction, and is characterised by local symptoms in the mouth, tongue, pharynx, and larynx in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It has been reported that many types of acupuncture, including body acupuncture, scalp acupuncture, tongue acupuncture, ear acupuncture, abdominal acupuncture, electroacupuncture, eye acupuncture, wrist-ankle acupuncture, cutaneous needle and moxibustion with warming needle, may have benefit. Whether single or integrated acupuncture is applied, reports suggest the treatment easy, safe, and economic. Improvement rates diagnosed by bedside assessment of swallowing have been reported to be as high as 80% to 100%; with end-of-study video fluorographic swallowing studies (VFSS) showing improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Nowicki-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowicki 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhong-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhong 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mechanism of acupuncture for acute dysphagia still remains unknown. It is presumed that acupuncture might reconstruct the swallowing function by stimulating the diseased muscles, nerves, tissues, or organs. Further, acupuncture could improve the vertebrobasilar blood supply, blood rheology, rheoencephalogram and blood microcirculation in pseudobulbar palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Jiang-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiang 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 1999</LINK>), and regulate the swallowing reflex by altering regional brain activity (<LINK REF="REF-Seki-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seki 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acupuncture therapy is widely used for dysphagia in acute stroke in China and many studies have been carried out. This review aimed to review systematically all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which examined the therapeutic effect of acupuncture.</P>

<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included truly randomised controlled trials; we excluded quasi-randomised trials. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included participants within 30 days of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke onset, regardless of age, sex or severity of neurological deficit. Stroke was diagnosed by computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and conformed to the World Health Organization definition (that is, a focal neurological impairment of sudden onset, and lasting more than 24 hours (or leading to death) and of presumed vascular origin) (<LINK REF="REF-Hatano-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatano 1976</LINK>). We excluded subarachnoid haemorrhage and subdural haematoma. Dysphagia was diagnosed either clinically or using videofluoroscopy. We excluded trials that recruited participants who had severe mental disorders, dementia, pulmonary or cutaneous infections, or who were in such a poor condition as to be unable to tolerate the stimulation of acupuncture. All participants had consented to the use of acupuncture.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included trials that compared any type of acupuncture therapy with placebo, sham or no intervention (neither traditional acupuncture nor contemporary acupuncture). We included both traditional acupuncture, in which the needles are inserted in classical meridian points, and contemporary acupuncture, in which the needles are inserted in non-meridian or trigger points, regardless of the source of stimulation (for example, ear acupuncture, scalp acupuncture, abdominal acupuncture, wrist-ankle needle, fire needle, moxibustion with warming needle, or electrical stimulation, etc). We excluded studies of acupuncture treatment without needling, such as point injection, acupressure, laser acupuncture, tap-pricking or cupping on pricked superficial blood vessel. Placebo acupuncture refers to a needle attached to the skin surface (not penetrating the skin but at the same acupoints) (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2005</LINK>). Sham treatment refers to: (1) needle pricking on the skin surface (needles are placed close to but not in acupuncture points) (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2005</LINK>); or (2) subliminal skin electrostimulation via electrodes attached to the skin (<LINK REF="REF-SCSSS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">SCSSS 1999</LINK>). We excluded trials comparing two or more forms of acupuncture without a control group of placebo, sham or no intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (XY, WL) independently assessed all studies. The same two review authors independently extracted eligible data from the trial reports on to a data extraction form, cross-checked the data, and entered them into the Review Manager software (RevMan 4.2). We obtained missing data from the principal investigators of the trials where possible. We resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author (HJ). All review authors were blinded to the identity of the groups that published the studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>We extracted the following information: randomisation process, allocation concealment, blinding, participant dropout and loss to follow up, intention-to-treat analysis, and explicit diagnostic and outcome criteria. Two review authors decided which trials met the inclusion criteria. Allocation concealment was coded as A - adequate, B - unclear, or C - inadequate, according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>.</P>
<P>Blinding was not a prerequisite selection criterion, but was assessed by: (1) whether the method of blinding was described, and (2) which method of blinding was used. We recorded three methods of blinding: single, double and triple blind. They were defined as any one, two or all three groups of participant, acupuncturist, and assessor being blinded, respectively, and (3) we calculated the Jadad score to assess the quality of blinding (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>We only included a study when the dropout and lost to follow-up rates were less than or equal to 10%; we regarded those whose rates were over 10% as failed trials and excluded them (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2001</LINK>). We described any trials without long-term follow up in the 'Description of studies' section.</P>
<P>We included trials with non-acupuncture co-interventions, such as Western medicine, or rehabilitation, applied to both control group and treatment group equally; otherwise we excluded confounded trials. We sought clarification from study authors if studies initially included did not have clear descriptions of the methodology used. If we were unable to contact the study authors, we added the studies to the 'Studies awaiting assessment' section. We excluded studies if the study authors refused or were unable to give detailed methodological information.</P>

<P>We expected the randomised trials to measure both event (dichotomous) data and continuous data. Continuous data were expressed as mean differences (MD) or standard mean differences (SMD). Dichotomised data were expressed as relative risks (RR). Dichotomised data were incorporated with two levels if more ranks appeared, such as the improved cases and cured cases as a new result, and the numbers of no improvement and little improvement as the other. All their variabilities were expressed as 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tests for heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We planned to assess heterogeneity using the I-squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>) statistic according to the clinical characteristics of participants and interventions, with a value greater than 50% indicating substantial heterogeneity. If no substantial statistical heterogeneity was present, we planned to synthesise the data using a fixed-effect model. Otherwise we would have used a random-effects model in the meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>If a sufficient number of randomised trials are identified in future, we plan to use the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic in the subsets of trials to describe the percentage of variability in the effect estimates that are due to heterogeneity, then use the method outlined by Deeks et al (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>) to perform the following subgroups analyses relating to: (1) acupuncture versus placebo; (2) acupuncture versus sham treatment; (3) acupuncture versus no intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>If possible, we planned to perform sensitivity analyses in order to explore the influence of the following factors on effect size:<BR/>(1) repeat the analysis excluding unpublished studies;<BR/>(2) repeat the analysis restricting studies to particular languages of publication or particular countries.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Publication bias analyses</HEADING>
<P>We plan to examine potential publication bias using a funnel plot (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>) when enough eligible randomised trials are identified.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-05-08 11:54:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We found 187 studies involving dysphagic stroke and acupuncture therapy through electronic and handsearches. Only one was included in this review. We excluded 126 studies immediately because some, if not all, of the participants were post-acute stroke patients. Of these excluded studies, 20 included stroke patients in the convalescent and sequel stages, 106 included mixed patient groups and data were not presented separately for those in the acute phase.</P>
<P>Twenty-eight did not specify the stroke phase of participants and we excluded them for the following reasons: (1) 13 studies did not have any control groups, (2) two studies compared different methods of acupuncture, (3) two studies were not randomised trials, one allocated participants in accordance with their own choice, the other enrolled treatment group participants from both clinic and hospital admissions whereas control group participants were enrolled only from clinics, which had been clarified by the investigators through telephone correspondence, (4) one study comparing point injection with acupuncture had a significant proportion of participants enrolled after 30 days of stroke onset, which we had confirmed with the investigator through telephone correspondence, (5) six studies were confounded by other interventions, for example rehabilitation exercise or point injection, (6) three studies assessed rehabilitation exercise after acupuncture therapy, and (7) one study listed evidence of all stroke phases in the results, indicating that participants were not only acute stroke patients.</P>
<P>Thirty-three potentially eligible studies of acute dysphagic stroke were identified; for more information see the 'Characteristics of included studies', the 'Characteristics of excluded studies', and the 'Characteristics of ongoing studies'. One study is awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Seki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seki 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We excluded 29 studies from the review for the following reasons: (1) no control group was used (<LINK REF="STD-Bi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lian-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lian 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wei-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wei 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1997b</LINK>), (2) two studies compared different methods of acupuncture (<LINK REF="STD-Bai-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003b</LINK>), (3) randomisation was inappropriate, which had been clarified by the investigators through telephone correspondence (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-He-2002" TYPE="STUDY">He 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003c" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2001</LINK>), (4) the effect of acupuncture was confounded by other interventions, which were traditional Chinese herbs (<LINK REF="STD-Fu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004b</LINK>), bloodletting (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>), hyperbaric oxygen (<LINK REF="STD-Zhong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhong 2005</LINK>) and rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Fu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xue-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Xue 2004</LINK>), (5) the dropout rate was more than 20% during the treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004a</LINK>), (6) duplicate publications (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2002</LINK>), (7) the assessed intervention was not acupuncture (<LINK REF="STD-Liao-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2005</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies included in the review</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial including 66 participants met the criteria for inclusion for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Han-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Han 2004</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Design</HEADING>
<P>The included study was a single centre, randomised, open label, controlled trial with a parallel design. Only assessors were blinded to the intervention, so we assessed the trial as low quality based on a Jadad score of 2 (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The included study was conducted in China. The 66 participants were between 48 hours and six days after stroke onset (mean duration of 4.3 days). Their ages ranged from 41 to 79 years old with a mean of 62.1 years old. Sixty-two per cent were male. The stroke diagnosis was based on the revised definition from the Forth Chinese Academic Conference on Cerebral vascular Diseases, which is consistent with the World Health Organization definition. The diagnoses were confirmed by skull computerised tomography (CT) scan concurrently.</P>
<P>The trial included 61 cerebral infarction patients and five cerebral haemorrhage patients. Among the infarction patients, 23 cases were brainstem infarction, 38 cases were involved in the brainstem, seven cases were combined with cerebellar infarction, 29 patients had recurring strokes. None of the participants had obvious dysgnosia. Forty-five and 21 participants had complete and partial bulbar palsy, respectively, which means both lower brainstem palsy and pseudobulbar palsy. Forty-one complete bulbar palsy patients and 16 partial bulbar patients also had hemiplegia. Among all the participants, 62 also had facial paralysis, 61 had lingual paralysis, and 11 had forced cry-laugh.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>The study compared standard Western medical treatment plus acupuncture with standard Western medical treatment only. For more information about the acupuncture technique, see 'Characteristics of included studies'. Both the acupuncture and control groups received nasogastric feeding as well.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measurement</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes were evaluated by bedside assessment immediately after three treatment sessions, and categorised into five grades according to the clinical symptoms and signs of bulbar palsy, which were (1) recovery, (2) markedly improved, (3) improved, (4) no improvement, and (5) deterioration. There was no information regarding the deglutition disorder or the other outcomes except one death from aspiration pneumonia in the control group. Telephone correspondence with the investigator confirmed that the death occurred after the three treatment sessions. Long-term follow up was not performed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The baseline characteristics were reported to be no different between the acupuncture and control groups. The randomisation method was described as follows: each participant received a sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelope in the sequence of visit and the assignment was decided by odd or even number. We rated allocation concealment as adequate (A). The trial was open label without placebo use in the control group. A Jadad score of 2 was assigned as the outcomes were assessed in a blinded fashion (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Dropouts, losses to follow up or intention to treat were not stated. Telephone correspondence revealed that there were no dropouts before the three treatment sessions were completed and participants were not followed afterwards. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-05-08 11:55:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Only one study of 66 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. We were therefore unable to perform the planned meta-analysis, sensitivity analyses and publication bias analysis. The clinical outcomes were assessed using a five-grade scale, in which recovery was consistent with our pre-determined primary outcome.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 01.01: Recovery</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-four participants were randomly allocated into the acupuncture group and 12 of them recovered to normal feeding. The remaining 32 participants were allocated into the placebo group and seven of them recovered to normal feeding. The recovery rates were 35% versus 22% respectively. Although the acupuncture group had a higher recovery rate than the control group, the difference was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05). We also dichotomized the reported data and calculated a relative risk of 1.61 for recovery in the acupuncture group relative to the control group, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.73 to 3.58, which implies the possibility of both harm and benefit of acupuncture. No definite conclusion can be made.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons 01.02: Markedly improved and Comparison 01.03: Improved</HEADING>
<P>Another two outcomes assessed by the same scale were also reported. Out of 34 acupuncture participants, 27 were reported to be markedly improved and 33 were reported to be improved. In the control group, the two numbers were 17 and 29 out of a total of 32 participants. We calculated the relative risks for these two outcomes; they were 1.49 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.16) for the markedly improved group, and 1.07 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.21) for the improved group. However, the effectiveness of acupuncture cannot be concluded since neither of these outcomes was pre-determined in our protocol, and the validity of the bedside scale for differentiating dysphagia severity is unknown.</P>
<P>The incidence of deterioration, fatality and aspiration pneumonia could not be compared as only one deterioration and one death from aspiration pneumonia occurred in the control group. Moreover, the deterioration was not defined and the time of aspiration pneumonia or death was not reported.</P>
<P>No information was provided on late disability, length of hospital stay, quality of life, feed tube removal or nutritional measures.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-08 11:55:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Acupuncture has been widely used in dysphagic stroke treatment in China and quite a few clinical studies have been carried out. However, methodologically-sound studies are still lacking. We only identified one randomised controlled trial, which showed that adding acupuncture to standard Western medical treatment was associated with an insignificant increase in full resolution of dysphagia in the short term. Considering the small sample size, the insignificant finding is possibly due to insufficient statistical power. The significantly increased markedly effective rate in the acupuncture group suggested a trend towards better outcomes. However, it is not our pre-determined outcome and has unknown clinical significance. Current evidence is very limited and no firm conclusion can be made at this time.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Internal validity</HEADING>
<P>The included trial was open label without placebo in the control group. It is difficult to tell if the observed therapeutic effect was distorted by performance bias and placebo response. While it is difficult to blind therapists in an acupuncture trial, single-blinding of the participants is possible and should be implemented. The use of sham acupuncture as placebo treatment is preferable, particularly for Chinese patients who are familiar with the general procedure of acupuncture, although the potential effect of sham acupuncture is still under debate, and the appropriate sham acupoints and techniques need to be further justified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcome measurement</HEADING>
<P>The short-term outcomes were evaluated by a bedside assessment scale of five grades, which were recovery, markedly improved, improved, no improvement, or deterioration. The grade of recovery was consistent with our pre-determined primary outcome and was found to be insignificant between the acupuncture and control groups. Although the bedside assessment has been widely used for dysphagia screening in acute stroke patients, the quality varies greatly depending on the included content. Without further validation, we can not exclude the possibility of misclassification. It is also unknown how the possible misclassification may have biased the results.</P>
<P>Videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) has been recognised as the gold standard for dysphagia diagnosis, in spite of concerns about the radiation exposure and high cost. Recently, Han and his colleagues developed a scale according to videofluoroscopic results from acute or subacute stroke patients. They found that a score of 47 and above out of 100 within 40 days after stroke, was associated with a significantly reduced risk of persistent dysphagia after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2007</LINK>). Future studies should use VFSS or another objective and quantifiable diagnostic tool to improve the accuracy of dysphagia measurements.</P>
<P>The ultimate goal of dysphagia therapy in acute stroke patients is to reduce the risk of chest infection, mortality and disability, as well as to improve quality of life. No conclusion can be drawn on any of these outcomes in this study. Future studies should have a follow-up time of at least three months, preferably six months to measure these clinically important outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Duncan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-STAIR-II-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">STAIR II 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Generalisation</HEADING>
<P>The study results may not be generalisable to general practice settings. Firstly, acupuncture involves a very broad range of diagnoses, techniques and treatment schedules. The effectiveness also varies when acupuncture is applied together with different treatment strategies. Secondly, the inclusion criteria were narrow. Patients with critical conditions, reduced consciousness, slight dysphagia symptoms or poor compliance were excluded. The eligible patients were unlikely to represent the general population, even in a Chinese population. The participants in this trial were not stratified by clinically relevant characteristics, such as age, type of stroke and degree of dysphagia. It remains unclear if acupuncture is more suitable for any particular group of patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Study reporting</HEADING>
<P>The reporting of the included study did not fully comply with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) and the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) criteria (<LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 2002</LINK>), so that several uncertainties remain. Power calculation was not stated, thus we could not estimate the chance of type II error. The baseline characteristics of the acupuncture and control groups were not reported separately. It is important to compare the key baseline characteristics of the two groups to evaluate the success of randomisation, especially for trials with a small number of participants. The type of statistical method used for comparison was not specified. The effective size and its precision were not summarised by the commonly used measurements, such as relative risk. We dichotomized the reported data and calculated the relative risk. There were no dropouts during the study period, which seems attributed to the short study period and the exclusion of poor compliant patients. However, the method of poor compliance patient identification was not stated. The included study did not specify the practitioner background, which the STRICTA criteria suggest should be reported, as the effects of acupuncture are highly influenced by the providers' training and experience.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Our exhaustive search identified only one study conducted in China. No eligible non-Chinese studies were found. It was not possible for us to perform a publication bias analysis. Hence, we could not exclude the possibility that the other studies with negative findings remain unpublished.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-03-20 11:11:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The present review included only one randomised controlled trial, which did not indicate that acupuncture would have a positive effect if added to standard Western medical treatment for acute dysphagic stroke patients. Considering the small number of participants included, flaws in methodology and reporting, as well as the possibility of publication bias, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that acupuncture has a therapeutic effect.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Acupuncture has been recognised as a safe and low-cost intervention. No clear evidence is available to support its routine use. More large-scale and methodologically sound trials of acupuncture for dysphagic stroke are needed to verify its clinical value. Future trials should overcome the limitations presented in this review. In particular, they should include enough participants to detect at least a modest effect, participants should be blinded, sham acupuncture should be used as the control treatment, video-fluorographic swallowing study (VFSS) or another objective and quantifiable tool should be used to assess the short-term outcome, and participants should be followed up for at least three months to assess the clinically important outcomes. In addition, the results should be analysed according to intention-to-treat principles and reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement and the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) criteria. </P>

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Age: 41 to 79 years, mean 62.1 years<BR/>Males = 41, females = 25<BR/>Inclusion criteria: acute stroke patients (within 30 days after stroke onset) diagnosed by clinical diagnostic criteria plus skull CT scan<BR/>Exclusion criteria: patients with critical conditions, reduced consciousness, throat diseases, poor compliance, infections at the acupoints, and minor dysphagia and dysphasia symptoms<BR/>Degrees of dysphagia were not stated<BR/>No definite limit to neurological deficit described</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Both groups received nasogastric feeding plus standard Western medical treatment. The acupuncture group also received scalp acupuncture, neck acupuncture and electroacupuncture.<BR/>Acupoints: both sides of the balance areas, both sides of the lower third of the motor areas, both sides of the third speech areas, both sides of the swallowing points and supply-blood points (based on investigators' experience and the locations were not specified), RN 23, ST 9 (both sides), GB 20 (both sides), DU 16<BR/>Procedures:<BR/>(1) Swallowing points, ST 9 and RN 23 were needled in a semi-supine or sitting position. Needles were manipulated for half minute after De Qi sensation, and quickly withdrawn.<BR/>(2) Patient changed to the appropriate position, and GB 20, DU 16 and supply-blood points were needled. The needles were manipulated for half minute after De Qi sensation and retained for 30 minutes, during which the needles were manipulated twice for 2 minutes each.<BR/>(3) Scalp needles were inserted horizontally into 1.2 cun under epicranial aponeurosis.<BR/>(4) The homolateral balance area (cathode) and motor area (anode) were electrified with a low frequency (30 times per second) sparse-dense wave for 30 minutes. The same procedure was applied to the other side at the same time. <BR/>All the neck and scalp needles were manipulated with reinforcing or reducing method according to the dialectical theory of traditional Chinese medicine.<BR/>Length of application: 30 minutes<BR/>Length of session: 7 days<BR/>Interval: 2 days between sessions<BR/>Total number of treatment sessions: 3<BR/>All 3 sessions were considered as a whole acupuncture treatment unit <BR/>Instruments: fine needle, 30 x 45 mm<BR/>No information on acupuncturist's background<BR/>The De Qi sensation: yes<BR/>
