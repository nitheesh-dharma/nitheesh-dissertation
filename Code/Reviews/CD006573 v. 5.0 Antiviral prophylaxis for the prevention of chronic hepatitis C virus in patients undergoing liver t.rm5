<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-11-28 08:25:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>The liver is an important organ of the body and has various functions including generation of energy from food, production of material necessary for congealing, processing and excretion of drugs and waste products in blood, and filtering out the harmful bacteria that enter the body through the gut. Hepatitis C virus can cause damage to the liver usually in an insidious manner (chronic hepatitis C virus infection). Sometimes, the liver damage can be so severe that the liver is not able to carry out the normal functions, which results in liver failure. Liver transplantation is effective in treating liver failure due to chronic hepatitis C infection. However, liver transplantation does not eradicate the virus and the virus can affect the donor liver graft. One of the proposed strategies to prevent the recurrence of chronic hepatitis C infection in these patients is to give drug treatment before the donor liver graft is affected by chronic hepatitis C infection. The effectiveness of these preventive treatments is not known. The review authors performed a detailed review of the medical literature to February 2013 to determine the benefits and harms of different preventive antiviral treatments for patients undergoing liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The review authors sought evidence from randomised clinical trials only. When conducted properly, such trials provide the best evidence. Two review authors independently identified the trials and obtained the information from the trials to minimise error.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>Ten trials including 441 liver transplant recipients provided data for this review. The patients were randomised to receive different treatments or no treatment in these 10 trials. We found two other trials, but data were not provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients who died or required retransplantation within 90 days or at maximal follow-up between the different treatment groups for any of the comparisons. There were no significant differences in serious complications, graft rejection, microscopic features of liver damage, or evidence of chronic hepatitis C recurrence between the different treatment groups or no treatment in any of the comparisons that reported these outcomes. None of the trials reported quality of life, liver failure, intensive therapy unit stay, or hospital stay. Life-threatening adverse events were not reported in any of the comparisons. There is currently no evidence to recommend preventive antiviral treatment to prevent recurrence of chronic HCV infection either in primary liver transplantation or retransplantation.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
<BR/>All the trials were at high risk of systematic errors (ie, there was potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trial was conducted) and random errors (there was potential to arrive at the wrong conclusions because of the play of chance). Overall, the quality of evidence was very low.</P>
<P>
<B>Future research</B>
<BR/>Further randomised clinical trials with low risk of random errors and systematic errors are necessary to assess the long-term survival benefits for various treatment options in these patients. Such trials should include patient-oriented outcomes such as mortality, graft failure, graft rejections, and quality of life.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-28 08:41:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-11-28 08:41:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>The annual incidence of liver transplantation is 14 per one million population in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-UK-Transplant" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS UK Transplant</LINK>), and 21 per one million population in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-OPTN_x002f_SRTR-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">OPTN/SRTR 2005</LINK>). Liver transplantation is performed mainly for liver failure arising acutely (called fulminant liver failure, eg, due to viruses, drug overdose), or as a result of chronic decompensated liver disease (eg, cirrhosis due to alcohol consumption, viruses) incompatible with long-term survival. It is also one of the modalities for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2006</LINK>). The model for end-stage liver disease score (MELD score) has been suggested as one of the methods of determining the severity of end-stage liver failure (<LINK REF="REF-Kamath-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamath 2001</LINK>), and is being used as a tool for allocation of livers in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-Shiffman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shiffman 2006</LINK>). Liver graft can be harvested from living donors (<LINK REF="REF-Bombuy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bombuy 2004</LINK>), or from cadavers (<LINK REF="REF-Koneru-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koneru 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cescon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cescon 2006</LINK>). Liver transplantation can be performed in adults or in children (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2006</LINK>). Worldwide, there is a demand for liver donors in surplus of supply. Split liver transplantation (using one cadaveric donor liver for two recipients, ie, an adult and a paediatric recipient) has been suggested as a way to decrease the organ shortage for liver transplant (<LINK REF="REF-Corno-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corno 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis is one of the main causes for liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Eason-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eason 2001</LINK>). Nearly half of the patients who undergo liver transplantation for HCV cirrhosis have recurrence of HCV in the graft (<LINK REF="REF-Jain-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 2002</LINK>). Immunosuppressive regimens that avoid steroid use are reported to have a lower rate of graft infection with HCV than those that include steroids as part of immunosuppressive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Eason-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eason 2001</LINK>). Azathioprine and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) are other immunosuppressive agents that can influence the severity of fibrosis following hepatitis C viral recurrence after liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Berenguer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berenguer 2003</LINK>). The recurrence of HCV is also dependent on hepatitis C subtype, with subtype Ib showing a higher recurrence rate than other subtypes (<LINK REF="REF-Sugo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugo 2003</LINK>); age of donor (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2006</LINK>); age of the recipient (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2006</LINK>); MELD score of the recipient (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2006</LINK>); and warm ischaemic time (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2006</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-28 08:26:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Antiviral agents such as ribavirin and interferon have been used as prophylactic therapy to prevent HCV infection in liver grafts (<LINK REF="STD-Belli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Belli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chalasani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chalasani 2005</LINK>).</P>

</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-11-28 08:26:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Antiviral treatments are expensive and associated with significant adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2010</LINK>). It is unclear whether they are of any benefit to the patient.

<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RR calculations do not include trials in which no events occurred in either group, whereas risk difference calculations do. We planned to report the risk difference if the conclusions using this association measure were different from RR. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for outcomes such as hospital stay and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for quality of life (where different scales might be used). For time-to-event outcomes such as long-term survival or recurrence, we calculated the HR with 95% CI.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-28 08:56:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>This review evaluates a number of various antiviral interventions for prevention of recurrence of viral hepatitis C infection in patients who had undergone liver transplantation for HCV-induced chronic infection. There was no significant difference in patient mortality, graft rejection, or retransplantation in any comparison in the few trials that reported these outcomes. Quality of life and liver decompensation were not reported in any of the trials. These are the main clinical outcomes that should determine whether antiviral therapy should be used for the treatment of recurrent liver graft infection with HCV. However, the patients were followed up only for 24 to 26 weeks after the end of treatment (ie, a total of around 17 to 18 months) as virological outcomes were the principal outcomes in these trials. Longer periods of follow-up are necessary to determine any clinical benefit. Anaemia, renal impairment, and other adverse effects such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, headache, insomnia, and myalgia required reduction in dose or cessation of therapy. Up to 90.9% of patients required reduction in dose, and up to 35.7% of patients required cessation of treatment in the various comparisons either because of adverse effects or because of patient's choice to stop treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2010</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference in the serious complications such as graft rejection or retransplantation. The trials were underpowered to assess acute cellular rejection and the period of follow-up was too short to assess chronic rejections. The use of interferon, which can stimulate immunity, has the potential to increase the incidence of rejection. This suggests the necessity of close monitoring of these patients and in any future randomised trial.</P>
<P>Considering the lack of clinical benefit and the frequent adverse effects, there is currently no evidence to recommend prophylactic antiviral treatment to prevent recurrence of HCV infection either in primary liver transplantation or retransplantation.</P>
<P>Having achieved the main objective, we decided to analyse the various factors that should be taken into account if a new trial assessing the role of prophylactic antiviral treatment to prevent recurrence of HCV infection is performed. Most of the issues have been discussed in the Cochrane review titled the 'Antiviral therapy for recurrent liver graft infection with HCV' by this group (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>). However, these issues are discussed again as there are some variations in the trial design and also to enable the reader to obtain the information from this review rather than from another review.</P>
<P>One of the important issues that should be considered before a trial assessing the role of antiviral therapy for recurrent liver graft infection with HCV is initiated, is the groups to which the patients will be randomised. Considering that there is no evidence for benefit of any of the interventions, at least one of the groups in the trials should be 'no treatment' or 'placebo'. One of the other issues in the design of the trial is the safety of the treatment. As mentioned previously, adverse effects such as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, or anaemia may require reduction in dose or cessation of therapy. Evidence from one randomised clinical trial showed that granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor is effective in normalising neutropenia induced by interferon and ribavirin therapy in patients with chronic viral hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Sharvadze-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharvadze 2007</LINK>). Evidence from three randomised clinical trials showed that epoetin alfa (recombinant erythropoietin) is effective in 83% to 100% of patients (with chronic HCV infection on interferon plus ribavirin therapy) in avoiding a reduction in ribavirin dose because of anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Dieterich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dieterich 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Afdhal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afdhal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharvadze-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharvadze 2006</LINK>). Use of granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor and erythropoietin may help in achieving higher cumulative doses of the antiviral interventions. For this reason, it may be necessary to allocate some patients to a group in which the use of these growth factors is allowed.</P>
<P>The use of sustained virological response as a surrogate outcome in patients undergoing liver transplantation has not been validated (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2010</LINK>). Cirrhosis develops in only about 6% of patients at five years after liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Yilmaz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yilmaz 2007</LINK>). Even if the antiviral treatment reduces the cirrhosis by 50%, a large sample size is necessary to identify such a difference. About 80% of patients undergoing liver transplantation for chronic HCV infection survive for five years or more (<LINK REF="REF-Forman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forman 2002</LINK>). Any difference in survival is likely to be noted only after five years. Thus, the main outcomes that need to be assessed are patient survival, graft survival, quality of life, and liver decompensation (to determine if the treatment improves the quality-adjusted life years and to perform economic evaluation). Thus, the trial should be adequately powered, should use the appropriate methodology and outcomes, and should include a long period of follow-up to determine the important outcomes.</P>
<P>The other important issue is the timing of intervention. Theoretically, the risk of reinfection of the liver graft with HCV virus begins when the new liver is implanted. Most of the trials included patients within four weeks of liver transplantation. However, some of the trials included patients within 26 weeks of liver transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Charlton-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Charlton 2007</LINK>). Inclusion of such patients might result in significantly different findings compared with trials in which the patients received the treatment during or after liver transplantation. Patients who have not had any recurrence in six months might be at a lower risk of reinfection because of 'natural selection'.</P>
<P>Trialists are likely to face several problems. One of the issues is the genotype and initial viral load, which may influence the outcomes. Randomisation with stratification for these factors may be necessary. Stratification may also have to be performed on the basis of whether the transplantation is primary transplantation or retransplantation. The second issue is the choice of the experimental drug. Considering the duration of recruitment (see below) and the long follow-up required for the main outcomes to be assessed, it is possible that a much superior treatment becomes available during the trial. Protocols should be in place for such an eventuality. The third issue is that of blinding the patients. Since the duration of treatment is 48 to 52 weeks and weekly injections are required for interferon (pegylated or non-pegylated), the blinding of the patients will be difficult, unpractical, and possibly unethical. This will result in bias in the quality of life measures. However, the main outcomes such as patient survival, graft survival, or liver decompensation are less unlikely to be affected by lack of patient blinding (<LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012a</LINK>). The healthcare provider can be blinded by requesting the patient or a third party not involved in the trial to give the subcutaneous injections. The outcome assessors can be blinded if adequate efforts are made to achieve this. Another issue is the bias arising due to missing outcomes. Because of the long duration of follow-up required for the assessment of outcomes, adequate efforts must be made to minimise the proportion of patients lost to follow-up.</P>
<P>Another important issue is sample size calculations. In one study based on 11,036 liver transplant recipients in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Scientific Registry for Liver (a database of liver transplant recipients in the USA) with a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, the actuarial five-year survival rate was 69.9% in liver transplants performed for HCV infection as compared with 76.6% in non-HCV patients (<LINK REF="REF-Forman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forman 2002</LINK>). The actuarial five-year graft survival rate was 56.8% in liver transplants performed for HCV infection versus 67.7% in non-HCV patients. In another retrospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Ghobrial-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghobrial 1999</LINK>), the five-year retransplantation rate was 76/374 (20.3%) after a median follow-up of 22.7 months. The retransplantation rate directly related to HCV recurrence was 3.4%. However, retransplantation rate may be a difficult outcome as there is no uniform agreement among experts regarding the criteria for retransplantation and it may not be a suitable objective outcome measure. If survival is chosen as the primary outcome, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma along with HCV infection may be a confounding factor (if a significant proportion of the patients have hepatocellular carcinoma). This may necessitate two different trials or one trial with a planned subgroup analysis of patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma. This is because of the significantly lower survival in patients undergoing liver transplantation for malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Forman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forman 2002</LINK>). The proportion of patients undergoing liver transplantation for malignancy who had hepatocellular carcinoma is not clear from the report by <LINK REF="REF-Forman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forman 2002</LINK>. However, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma prior to liver transplantation for hepatitis C may influence the survival necessitating two different trials or one trial with a planned subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>The longer period of follow-up in the trials will also allow the evaluation of whether sustained virological response is a valid surrogate marker of patient survival after liver transplantation for HCV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2013</LINK>). A valid surrogate marker will allow further trials to use a shorter period of follow-up. However, until such validation, it is misleading to designate a treatment an effective treatment just because it increased the proportion of patients who achieved sustained virological response without any clinical benefit.</P>
<P>Consent for organ donation by the organ donors was not reported in any of the trials. Future trials should report this information.</P>

We did not blind the trials when extracting data or assessing the risk of bias and low risk of play of chance, but assessments were done independently and in duplicate. We applied no language, publication status, or sample size restrictions. Thus, we minimised the bias due to selection of trials. In spite of an extensive search of literature, there is a possibility of publication bias. Because of the few trials included in this review with few participants and outcomes, there is a high risk of random errors.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of 90-day mortality (hepatitis C virus antibody versus placebo)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated with 10,577 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 6.3%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing 53 participants in three trials, only 0.5% of the DARIS was reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of 90-day mortality (hepatitis C virus antibody (high dose) versus hepatitis C virus antibody (low dose))</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated with 11,338 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 5.9%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing 31 participants in two trials, only 0.27% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality at maximal follow-up (interferon versus no intervention)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated with 3796 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control no intervention group with the outcome of 17.2%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 8.54%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing 105 participants in two trials, only 2.77% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of retransplantation at maximal follow-up (interferon versus no intervention)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated with 20,141 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the no intervention control group with the outcome of 3.4%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 8.54%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing 105 participants in two trials, only 0.52% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of graft rejection requiring steroids or equivalent drugs (interferon versus no intervention)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated with 1079 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the no intervention control group with the outcome of 41.2%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 8.54%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing 136 participants in three trials, only 12.60% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the futility area. Neither the trial sequential boundaries (continuous red line) nor the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>
