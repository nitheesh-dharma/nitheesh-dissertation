<P>Otitis media with effusion (OME), also known as glue ear or serous otitis media, is a condition in which there is fluid persisting in the middle ear. Many treatments have been suggested. This review summarizes the studies using antihistamines, decongestants or a combination of antihistamines and decongestants and finds no benefit for any of the short or long-term outcomes including resolution of the fluid, hearing problems or the necessity of additional referral to specialists. Further, using these medications causes significant side effects, such as gastrointestinal upset, irritability, drowsiness or dizziness, in approximately 10% of patients. Therefore antihistamines, decongestants or antihistamine/decongestant combinations are not recommended treatments for OME. Watchful waiting is the best approach with consideration of referral for evaluation by an ENT consultant if symptoms persist beyond 12 weeks.</P>

<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 4, 2006. It is one of a number of reviews prepared within the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group on management options for patients with otitis media with effusion.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Symptoms, prevalence and aetiology</HEADING>
<P>Otitis media with effusion (OME), or 'glue ear', is characterized by an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation. It is very common in children, especially between the ages of one and three years and in seasons where the prevalence of upper respiratory tract infections ('colds') is high, with an incidence of 10% to 30%. It occurs frequently even up to the age of seven, with a prevalence of 3% to 8% (<LINK REF="REF-Fiellau-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiellau 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fiellau-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiellau 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lous-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lous 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teele-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teele 1989</LINK>). Otitis media with effusion is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood. The reason why it develops is uncertain, but low-grade infection, poor Eustachian tube function and adenoidal infection or hypertrophy have all been implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Bluestone-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bluestone 1995</LINK>). Otitis media with effusion usually resolves spontaneously within a few months (<LINK REF="REF-Fiellau-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiellau 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acutely, OME may be associated with earache (otalgia), hearing loss and/or balance difficulty. Long-term complications are reported to include hearing loss and linguistic, developmental or social consequences, especially if the OME is bilateral and of long duration (<LINK REF="REF-Fiellau-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiellau 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Golz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grace-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grace 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lous-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lous 1995</LINK>). However, a report for the Agency for Health Research and Quality did not find evidence to support an effect of early-life OME on language development or cognitive verbal intelligence (<LINK REF="REF-Shekelle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shekelle 2003</LINK>). The same report did find evidence to support a link between early-life OME and increased risk of conductive hearing loss. Some children have nearly normal hearing despite the presence of fluid within the middle ear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The best technique for diagnosing OME is pneumatic otoscopy, with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 80% based on a meta-analysis of eight different methods of diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Takata-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takata 2003</LINK>). OME is may also be present when tympanometry results in a flat curve (relative gradient less than 0.1, type B), when mobility of the tympanic membrane is absent or reduced, or fluid or air bubbles are evident behind the eardrum. The presence of a significant (10 dB) air-bone gap correlates well with the presence of fluid in the middle ear. Persistence of OME in this review will be determined by pneumatic otoscopy or a combination of the aforementioned techniques.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Management options</HEADING>
<P>Many patients with OME require no specific treatment. Commonly proposed medical treatment options include the use of decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines, antibiotics and autoinflation. Surgical treatment options include grommet insertion (ventilation tubes), myringotomy (tympanocentesis, i.e. surgical incision of the eardrum, with or without aspiration of fluid from the middle ear cavity) and adenoidectomy. Grommets, autoinflation, steroids and adenoidectomy for OME have already been addressed in Cochrane Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perera-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perera 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Aardweg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Aardweg 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Decongestants alone or in combination with antihistamines were studied in a published meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Witmer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witmer 1998</LINK>) but only two randomized controlled trials were found and the analysis had significant methodological flaws. Wide international variation in clinical practice exists and the optimal treatment strategy remains controversial although a recent guideline (<LINK REF="REF-AAFP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAFP 2004</LINK>) recommended watchful waiting for three months and recommended against antihistamines and/or decongestants. Rosenfeld and Bluestone (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1999</LINK>) recommended modification of risk factors such as avoidance of tobacco smoke, use of breastfeeding and choice of small group (&lt; 5 children) daycare when possible to assist in the management and prevention of OME.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antihistamines and/or decongestants</HEADING>
<P>Antihistamines and decongestants are relatively safe and inexpensive and are commonly used separately or in combination in the management of OME. Theoretically, antihistamines may reduce the congestion of mucous membranes and decrease obstruction of tubes lined by mucous membrane, such as the Eustachian tube. An open Eustachian tube would allow the middle ear pressure to equalize to ambient air pressure. It may also allow drainage of fluid from the middle ear. If mucous membrane congestion is caused by allergy then anti-allergy medications such as antihistamines may work to reduce congestion and similarly improve Eustachian tube dysfunction. Some recent evidence suggests that viral or bacterial organisms contribute to middle ear inflammation and the release of histamines as well as other inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes (<LINK REF="STD-Chonmaitree-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chonmaitree 2003</LINK>). Decongestants are vasoconstrictors and should reduce mucous membrane swelling and enhance Eustachian tube function. However, the evidence to support the use of antihistamines or decongestants in the treatment of OME is underwhelming. This review will analyze the best evidence to date.</P>

<P>A total of 1880 patients, nearly all of whom were under the age of 18, participated in the studies.</P>
<P>Ten studies took place in ENT clinics and five in community-based clinics. Thirteen studies involving 1659 patients provided dichotomous outcomes and were included in the statistical meta-analyses. One of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Olson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 1978</LINK>) provided continuous outcomes and could not be included in the statistical meta-analyses. The author of this study was contacted but no longer had the original data for re-calculation to provide dichotomous results. Two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 1981</LINK>) did not provide sufficient individual patient data to allow inclusion of their results in the meta-analysis. All three studies gave a simple statement of their results.</P>
<P>Though five studies reported outcomes using ears as the unit of measure rather than persons, we were able to convert the data into a usable, consistent format using a design effect method (<LINK REF="REF-Perera-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perera 2006a</LINK>). All but one study was in English; the single Swedish study was translated into English and the data are included here.</P>
<P>Two pairs of studies reported on the same populations; we did not include duplicated data, but where studies reported different outcomes in different manuscripts, we pooled data as appropriate.</P>
<P>All articles used tympanometry (the closest thing to a 'gold standard' test for OME) in their methods of diagnosis except for three (<LINK REF="STD-Edstrom-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Edstrom 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haugeto-1981a" TYPE="STUDY">Haugeto 1981a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saunte-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Saunte 1978</LINK>). Edstrom used clinical examination only (dullness of the tympanic membrane and immobility on pneumatic otoscopy) and Haugeto and Saunte used clinical (pneumatic otoscopy) and audiometric assessments.</P>
<P>Six studies provided data on the primary outcome (lack of cure at or before one month) and a further seven studied our secondary outcome (lack of cure at one to three months). Two articles reported on the late outcome of lack of cure after three months and seven studies reported on other outcomes including hearing loss and school performance.</P>
<P>Six articles provided data on side effects of interventions and controls and nine studies considered complications such as surgery, recurrent OME or acute otitis media.</P>

<P>Eight papers had a quality score of three or more and eight had a score of two or less.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">OME persistence</HEADING>
<P>None of the included studies provided an assessment of symptoms other than hearing loss. We therefore chose OME persistence as our primary outcome. As OME is often asymptomatic and because most studies provided this as their primary outcome, we chose to do the same. Outcomes were measured at one month or less, at one to three months (secondary outcome) and after three months (late outcome).</P>
<P>Six of the 16 included studies (all of which had a quality score of three or more) reported dichotomous results for the primary outcome: cure or no cure at one month or less. Pooling data for any medication combination resulted in a risk ratio (RR) of 0.99 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 0.92 to 1.05 (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). These studies were statistically homogenous. In fact, the meta-analysis results for all interventions and outcomes except one were homogeneous (i.e. not heterogeneous) using a P value for heterogeneity of 0.10 (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Separating out the various interventions had little effect. For decongestant alone the RR for the primary outcome was 1.06 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.22) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) and for antihistamine/decongestant combinations the RR was 0.97 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>), both non-significant, statistically and clinically.</P>
<P>The results of studies that could not be combined in the meta-analysis are consistent with the summary findings. <LINK REF="STD-Olson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 1978</LINK> found that decongestants alone were not effective for the short-term resolution of OME; in fact, some of the analyses in this study statistically favored the placebo group! <LINK REF="STD-Khan-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 1981</LINK> found that for the antihistamine/decongestant combination the primary outcome (cure or no cure of OME at one month or less), there was no statistical difference between intervention and control. <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1977</LINK> studied the interventions of decongestant versus control and antihistamine/decongestant combination versus control and also found no difference in outcomes.</P>
<P>For the outcome of delayed persistence of OME (one to three months), pooling data for any medication combination found no statistical benefit (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). For decongestant alone the RR was 1.05 with the 95% CI from 0.85 to 1.30 (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). For the antihistamine/decongestant combination there was also no estimated benefit (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.40) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our main outcome for antihistamines alone (due to lack of other evidence) was the measure of delayed persistence of OME with RR 1.05 and 95% CI 0.8 to 1.38 or, more usefully, RD (actual risk difference) of 0.02 with 95% CI -0.11 to 0.16 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). This confidence interval is somewhat wider than the previous three examples because of a smaller sample size.</P>
<P>In summary, for our two main outcome measures, no clinical benefit was found for any of the interventions studied and there was sufficient power in the meta-analysis to have detected any clinically significant benefit.</P>
<P>Late outcome (cure or no cure after three months) was studied only for the antihistamine/decongestant combination and was found to favor control by a small but statistically non-significant amount (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.13) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). The wider confidence intervals indicate less power to show a statistically significant outcome but the trend is clearly toward harm.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Complications (recurrent OME or acute otitis media)</HEADING>
<P>Recurrent OME was evaluated as a complication by two studies for antihistamine/decongestant versus control and the outcome was found to be statistically non-significant (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.11) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.9</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute otitis media (AOM) was studied as another complication of OME in three studies; one each for antihistamine alone, decongestant alone and antihistamine/decongestant combination and for each the results were not statistically significant (antihistamine alone (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.73) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>); decongestant alone (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.31) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>) and antihistamine/decongestant combination (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.26) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.10</LINK>)). Due to the small size of the studied population for this outcome, the confidence intervals are fairly wide indicating only fair power to detect a difference between treatment and control.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Other measured outcomes were hearing loss (early: four studies and late: one study), school performance (one study) and surgery (tympanostomy: three studies).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hearing loss</HEADING>
<P>No treatment lessened hearing loss at one-month follow up (four studies) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>) and the trend was toward harm (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.27). At late follow up (one study) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.6</LINK>) the trend was again toward harm (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.56). <LINK REF="STD-Khan-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 1981</LINK> did not provide dichotomous data but also found no difference in hearing loss between groups of children treated with antihistamine/decongestant combination and placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">School performance</HEADING>
<P>For school performance (studied only for the intervention of antihistamine/decongestant) the RR was 0.81 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.86) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Surgery</HEADING>
<P>For surgery after any medication, antihistamine alone, decongestant alone or antihistamine/decongestant combination, results were not statistically significant. The risk ratio and confidence intervals for any medication were RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.41 (<LINK REF="CMP-004.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.8</LINK>). For antihistamine alone the result was RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 5.58 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). For decongestant alone the result was RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.62 (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). The antihistamine/decongestant analysis for this outcome (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.41) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>) was the only outcome to have been found to be heterogeneous (P = 0.06 for heterogeneity) therefore we shall describe the studies rather than trying to interpret an inappropriate pooling of results. This analysis looked at the two included studies that measured the outcome of surgical complications for the intervention of antihistamine/decongestant combination. One of these studies was clearly an outlier (<LINK REF="STD-Saunte-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Saunte 1978</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). It was a very small study (n = 21) with few outcomes and was the only study to show any significant benefit for several of our measured outcomes. The positive results from this study were always overwhelmed by the other studies in its comparison group. The other study in <LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK> was slightly larger and showed no hint of benefit from the intervention. In summary, this intervention (antihistamine/decongestant combination) shows no clinically significant benefit for the outcome of surgical complications but the power to detect such a benefit is only fair because of the small study sizes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Medication side effects</HEADING>
<P>Pooling the data from the six studies that evaluated medication side effects found a rate of 17% in the treated group versus 6% in the placebo group. This was both statistically significant (RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.87 to 3.88) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>) and clinically meaningful. The number needed to treat to harm was nine, based on an actual risk reduction of 11%.</P>
<P>None of the studies included in this review evaluated side effects for antihistamines so we used an alternative resource, the Lexi-Drugs program online (<LINK REF="REF-Lexi_x002d_Drugs-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexi-Drugs 2006</LINK>) (accessed 27 June 2006). We looked at the side effect profile of three commonly used antihistamines with a low side effect frequency: cetirizine, chlorpheniramine and loratadine. All three had two or more side effects with a frequency of more than 10% with many other side effects in the frequency range from 1% to 10%. We accessed an online medication monitoring service (Mediguard.org) on 29 May 2011 to determine the frequency of side effects of phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine, two of the decongestants used in some of the studies included in this review. The overall rate of side effects was 24% for the former and 6% for the latter. This is in agreement with our review which showed a general frequency of side effects of approximately 10% for antihistamine/decongestant combinations or decongestants alone. The commonest side effects found in the studies evaluated in our review were irritability, sedation and gastrointestinal upset</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sub-analyses</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Validity</HEADING>
<P>We performed sub-analyses on the basis of quality of study. Those studies with a quality score of three or more and those with a quality score of less than three had similar statistically non-significant results, except when the study by <LINK REF="STD-Saunte-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Saunte 1978</LINK> was the lone comparator. Allocation concealment also did not influence the findings as studies with adequate concealment had the same statistically non-significant results, except when the study by <LINK REF="STD-Saunte-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Saunte 1978</LINK> stood alone in the comparison. This study was small, used a different method to diagnose OME and found benefit where other studies did not (see <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> below). We did not include quality sub-analyses in the meta-analysis because they added no important information.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-07-06 16:12:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Saunte-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Saunte 1978</LINK>) is an outlier (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). This, at first glance, seems not to make sense as this study had a high quality score for methodology and had adequate allocation concealment. Reading the study, however, shows that this study was one of only three that did not include tympanometry as one of the methods of diagnosis of OME, and the number of study subjects was very small (n = 21) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The small size of this trial might lead some authors to discard it on this basis alone (<LINK REF="REF-Bandolier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandolier 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>This meta-analysis and systematic review found no benefit from any treatment combination - antihistamine, decongestant or antihistamine/decongestant combination - for any of the measured patient oriented outcomes for OME. It did find, however, an increased rate of medication side effects (number needed to treat to harm = 9). There was a paucity of included studies comparing antihistamines to controls but we did review three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bhambhani-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bhambhani 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chonmaitree-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chonmaitree 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1980</LINK>) that were excluded because the researchers randomized by acute otitis media (rather than by OME) and then followed the groups for prevention and treatment of OME. All of these studies found no benefit for antihistamines in the prevention or treatment of OME.</P>
<P>One limitation of our analysis is the relatively small number of studies found. However, we were unlikely to miss studies given our comprehensive search, and we found many more than the previous systematic review on this topic. Furthermore, the studies were so consistent in their findings that even if we missed a study, the summary results are unlikely to be overturned. </P>
<P>Another limitation of our review is that the included articles had some methodological flaws. They varied in duration and thoroughness of follow up, had poor allocation concealment, unclear randomization and blinding processes and lack of intention-to-treat analysis in most studies. In general, all of these design flaws tend to overestimate the benefit of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bandolier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandolier 2000</LINK>). Since we did not find benefit from any of the interventions, the faults of the included studies strengthen our conclusion.</P>
<P>Strengths of this review are the comprehensive search strategy, the rigorous protocol that was used, the general homogeneity of studies with regard to diagnosis, quality and interventions and the homogeneity and consistency of the outcomes. Sub-analysis by quality showed that both good quality and poor quality studies resulted in no benefit for any of the interventions. This also strengthens the conclusions of the review.</P>
<P>It is possible that these medications may provide some benefit in specific situations such as for allergic-related OME and for OME related to upper respiratory infection. This cannot be determined from our meta-analysis that lumps them together but the consistency of the lack of benefit makes this possibility unlikely.</P>

<P>We found no benefit for any of the studied interventions for any of the outcomes measured and we found harm from the side effects of the interventions, therefore we recommend that practitioners not use antihistamines, decongestants or antihistamine/decongestant combinations to treat OME in children. This recommendation is consistent with the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and American Academy of Pediatrics joint guideline on the management of OME (<LINK REF="REF-AAFP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAFP 2004</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-07-06 16:12:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review of the use of antihistamines, decongestants or antihistamine/decongestant combination does not show any significant benefit but does show harm from the interventions assessed. The results are surprisingly consistent. It appears highly unlikely that further research studies of these interventions for the treatment of OME would change the outcomes, and harm may be caused by the interventions, therefore we feel that further research on this question is not justified. It is possible, though there was no suggestion of it in any of the studied articles, that antihistamines might be useful specifically for allergic OME or decongestants might be helpful for OME related to upper respiratory infection or postacute otitis media. These are possible, though not likely fruitful, areas for future research.</P>
