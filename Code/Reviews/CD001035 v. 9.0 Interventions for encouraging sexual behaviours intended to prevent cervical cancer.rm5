<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-10 13:14:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Young women are at high risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including types of human papillomavirus (HPV) that can cause cervical cancer. High rates of STIs among young people highlight a need for effective strategies to prevent the spread of infections. Although behavioural approaches (e.g. using condoms consistently) could protect against STIs and cervical cancer, there is a lack of evidence on which strategies would be most effective in practice. This systematic literature review was conducted to identify which types of behavioural strategy have been tested and to assess their effectiveness.</P>
<P>Eight electronic bibliographic databases were searched up to the end of 2009. To be considered relevant, studies had to use a randomised controlled trial (RCTs) design; include young women up to the age of 25 years; report one or more behavioural interventions that aimed to prevent STIs or cervical cancer; and record outcomes which were either behavioural (e.g. condom use) or biological (incidence of STIs or cervical cancer).</P>
<P>Searches identified 5271 bibliographic records. Screening the records independently by two review authors identified 23 relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The trials were mostly conducted in the USA (21 trials) and in health-care (e.g. family planning) clinics (14 trials), with only four in educational settings. Trial participants had mixed socio-economic and demographic characteristics and most were sexually experienced. The interventions mostly provided information about STIs and taught safer sex skills (e.g. communication with partners), occasionally supplemented with provision of resources (e.g. free sexual health services). Interventions varied considerably in duration, contact time, provider, behavioural aims and outcomes. A variety of STIs were addressed including HIV and chlamydia, but not explicitly HPV.</P>
<P>The most common behavioural outcome (measured in 19 trials) was condom use for vaginal intercourse. Sexual partners, sexual abstinence and STIs were reported in four, two and 12 trials respectively. In terms of statistically significant effects, some interventions improved condom-related behaviour and reduced the number of sexual partners, but none affected the frequency of sexual episodes. Effects of interventions on STIs were limited. None of the interventions appeared to be harmful. The methods used in the trials were not always well described making it difficult to tell whether their results may have been biased. In conclusion, although some behavioural interventions improve condom-related behaviour, trials have been predominantly in USA healthcare settings, did not specifically address HPV and were too different to enable a most effective type of intervention to be identified.</P>

Studies should use an RCT design where possible with integral process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis where appropriate.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence of cervical cancer</HEADING>
<P>Cervical cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide, with more than 500,000 new cases diagnosed each year and an age-standardised incidence rate of 15.3 per 100,000 women. Incidence of cervical cancer varies sevenfold between the different regions of the world; it is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in Southern Africa and Central America (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2003</LINK>). Cervical cancer incidence rates have declined substantially in Western countries with screening programmes. Incidence rates tend to be highest in women aged under 40, with a peak incidence occurring in the group aged 25 to 29 years (<LINK REF="REF-CRUK-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRUK 2010</LINK>). The stage breakdown varies across the age groups, with older women being diagnosed with progressively later stage disease (<LINK REF="REF-CRUK-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRUK 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many studies have shown that the incidence of cervical cancer, as well as survival and mortality, vary with ethnic group and socio-economic status (SES). For example, studies have demonstrated higher incidence of cervical cancer in Hispanic and black women than in white women (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clegg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clegg 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2009</LINK>) and that incidence of cervical cancer is highest in women with the lowest SES (<LINK REF="REF-Clegg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clegg 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franceschi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franceschi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pukkala-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pukkala 2010</LINK>). Reasons for ethnic and socio-economic differences in the incidence of cervical cancer can be difficult to determine because definitions of ethnic groups and SES are not always consistent and because ethnicity may be confounded with SES and other variables, which may or may not be controlled for in analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Pruitt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pruitt 2009</LINK>). Possible reasons for social disparities in the incidence of cervical cancer include: increased likelihood of smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity and HPV infection in women with lower SES (see section on risk factors below) (<LINK REF="REF-Clegg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clegg 2008</LINK>); differences between ethnic groups in their likelihood of receiving cervical screening (<LINK REF="REF-Patnick-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patnick 2007</LINK>); and differences between ethnic groups in their awareness of cervical cancer risk (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Worldwide, cervical cancer causes more than 273,000 deaths each year (2.1% of all deaths; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2004</LINK>) and it accounts for 9% of female cancer deaths. The survival rate is higher in younger women as the disease tends to be diagnosed at an earlier stage. Survival rates in developed countries have improved over recent decades, as a consequence of screening and more effective treatment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aetiology in relation to risk of cervical cancer</HEADING>
<P>HPV belongs to the family of papillomaviruses. Clinical manifestations of genital HPV can include genital warts (condylomata acuminata), dysplasia and cancer of the cervix, anus, vulva, vagina and penis and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Transmission of HPV is by skin-to-skin contact, requiring access to basal cells through micro abrasions or tears in squamous or mucosal epithelium that often result from sexual activity. Although the majority of HPV transmission is by sexual contact, it can also occur by fingers or sex toys (<LINK REF="REF-Moscicki-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moscicki 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winer 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Development of the cervix has an important bearing on the development of cervical cancer. With the occurrence of puberty, columnar epithelium of the cervix gradually transforms into squamous epithelium, a process known as squamous metaplasia. In this transformation, large areas of transitional cells are formed, all of which support HPV replication and are potentially prone to virus-induced genetic alterations. Persistence of HPV infection during squamous metaplasia can lead to cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or CIN3 lesions and, eventually, development of invasive cervical cancer. Early sexual activity appears to influence squamous metaplasia, as adolescents with multiple partners have been found to exhibit greater cervical maturity than non-sexually active adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Moscicki-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moscicki 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Modern classification, based on DNA nucleotide sequence differences, has identified over 130 different types of HPV. Types 16 and 18 contain potent viral oncogenes that are associated with the development of cervical carcinoma and at least 13 other HPV types are also considered to confer high risk of cervical cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2005</LINK>). Results of a meta-analysis of published data indicated that HPV types 16, 18 and 45 are most likely to lead to infections which progress to cervical cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2003</LINK>). HPV type 16 accounts for close to 50% of the types identified in cervical cancer and together types 16 and 18 are implicated in 70% of cervical cancers worldwide. A second group of at least 11 HPV types that is rarely found in cervical cancer cases has been classified as low risk. The predominant low-risk HPV types are 6 and 11; these are the most common HPV types overall and are responsible for most cases of genital warts (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2006</LINK>). Presence of multiple high-risk HPV types does not appear to increase the risk of cervical cancer over having one high risk type. In extremely rare cases, low-risk HPV may be the only type associated with invasive cervical cancer; this might indicate that a minute fraction of the population has a special susceptibility to these types (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exposure to genital HPV among women can happen soon after sexual debut, followed by a one to eight month period during which there may be no symptoms or signs of infection. After this incubation period, a lesion (e.g. cervical cancer or genital wart) may develop and trigger a sustained immune response over three to six months, followed either by sustained clinical remission or persistent or recurrent disease (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2006</LINK>). Unlike CIN1, the development of CIN2 and CIN3 requires persistent high-risk type HPV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Moscicki-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moscicki 2005</LINK>). Overall, the incubation period from initial HPV infection to carcinoma in situ is estimated to be 7 to 12 years (<LINK REF="REF-Moscicki-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moscicki 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The causal association between HPV and cervical cancer is one of the strongest observed for any human cancer. Case-control studies, case series and prevalence surveys have unequivocally shown that HPV-DNA can be detected in 95 to 100% of adequate specimens of cervical cancer compared with 5 to 20% of cervical specimens from control subjects. However, the majority (around 90%) of HPV infections are spontaneously cleared by the immune system and do not progress to CIN 2, CIN3 or invasive cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk factors</HEADING>
<P>HPV infection is so prevalent that approximately 75 to 85% of sexually active individuals will become infected in their lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2006</LINK>) and having just one sexual partner is often sufficient for a woman to acquire infection with HPV (<LINK REF="REF-Moscicki-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moscicki 2005</LINK>). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the US reported an overall HPV prevalence of 26.8% among females aged 14 to 59 years (<LINK REF="REF-Dunne-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunne 2007</LINK>). Prevalence was 24.5% among females aged 14 to 19 years and 44.8% among women aged 20 to 24 years. There was a statistically significant trend for increasing HPV prevalence with each year of age from 14 to 24 years, followed by a gradual decline in prevalence through 59 years, confirming the predominance of HPV infection in younger women. The NHANES study also reported a prevalence of 15.6% for HPV type 16 and 6.5% for type 18 (<LINK REF="REF-Markowitz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowitz 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the high prevalence of HPV being sexually active is therefore a key determinant in the incidence of cervical cancer. Several prospective studies have demonstrated that risk of cervical cancer increases as the number of male sex partners increases (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2006</LINK>). Non-sexually transmitted HPV infections are rare among adolescent girls. Other important risk factors are the age at first sexual intercourse of the woman and also of her male partner (in both cases younger age is associated with higher risk), recent partner change and the likelihood that at least one of the male partners is an HPV carrier. Studies have shown that subsequent wives of husbands whose previous wife developed cervical cancer had an increased risk of cervical neoplasia; and wives of men with cancer of the penis had a high incidence and mortality rate of cervical cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2005</LINK>). Male circumcision reduces the risk of both HPV-DNA prevalence and cervical cancer in the female partner (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Castellsagu_x00e9_-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castellsagué 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other factors that are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer among HPV-DNA positive women include: use of oral contraceptives for five or more years; smoking; high parity (five or more full term pregnancies); and previous exposure to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), notably chlamydia trachomatis, some herpes viruses and HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2005</LINK>). The effect of exposure to these infections underlines the importance of STI prevention for reducing the risk of cervical cancer. Risk of cervical cancer may be influenced by genetic factors, but the evidence is not strong at present (<LINK REF="REF-CRUK-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRUK 2010</LINK>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevention of cervical cancer</HEADING>
<P>Prevention of cervical cancer can be classified as primary, or secondary. Primary prevention of cervical cancer involves safer sexual practices, such correct and consistent condom use to prevent HPV infection of the cervix. Primary prevention of cervical cancer can also potentially be achieved through the recently launched HPV vaccines, Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline) and Gardasil (Merck). These have been shown to be safe and effective at preventing transmission of HPV and low grade CIN (<LINK REF="REF-Dillner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dillner 2010;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-FUTURE-II-Study-Group-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">FUTURE II Study Group 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Paavonen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paavonen 2007</LINK>), though long-term follow-up over a number of years will be needed to assess all possible benefits (particularly duration of protection against HPV and effectiveness in preventing invasive cervical cancer) and adverse effects. The vaccine is most effective when given prior to first HPV acquisition, underlining the importance of vaccinating girls before they become sexually active. Ceravix is a bivalent vaccine and protects against HPV types 16 and 18, whilst Gardasil is a quadrivalent vaccine and also protects against two non-oncogenic types that cause genital warts (types 6 and 11).</P>
<P>The World Health Organisation's (WHO) position paper on HPV vaccines recommends that it should be introduced in countries where cervical cancer is a public health priority, where it is likely to be programmatically feasible and economically sustainable and where cost-effectiveness aspects have been considered (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009a</LINK>). The WHO also recommend that vaccination programmes be part of a co-ordinated strategy including education about risk behaviours for HPV infection. It should be acknowledged that the vaccines do not necessarily afford protection against the other high risk HPV types that are associated with around 30% of cervical cancer cases. This therefore underlines the importance of promoting protective behaviours as a key primary prevention strategy.</P>
<P>Secondary prevention of cervical cancer involves periodic cervical screening of eligible women to detect changes in cervical cytology, which may necessitate treatment to prevent or manage invasive cervical cancer. Cervical screening programmes are established in most developed countries and in the UK screening is offered to women between the ages of 25 and 60 years (the age range varies between different Nations within the UK), every three to five years.</P>
<P>Cervical screening is widely credited with reducing the incidence of cervical cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 2004</LINK>), with an estimated saving of 5,000 lives each year in the UK alone. Following the introduction of cervical screening in the 1960s, age-standardised mortality rates due to cervical cancer in the UK have declined from 7.1 per 100,000 females in 1979 to 2.4 per 100,000 females in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-CRUK-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRUK 2010</LINK>). In contrast, declines in mortality rates have not occurred in developing countries which lack routine cervical screening (<LINK REF="REF-Sankaranarayanan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sankaranarayanan 2009</LINK>). Data from the World Health Organisation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009b</LINK>) show that mortality rates due to cervical cancer are particularly high in China and India. It has been estimated that, worldwide, over 2.7 million years of life are lost annually among women between the ages of 25 and 64, of which 2.4 million years of life are lost in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review is focused on the primary prevention of cervical cancer, through the promotion of sexual behaviours which afford protection against acquisition of high risk HPV types associated with cervical cancer. The term behavioural interventions is used because their primary aim is to promote protective sexual behaviours which can include (and are not restricted to) any of the following: use of condoms for vaginal intercourse, abstinence from sexual activity, delaying becoming sexually active, reducing the number of sexual partners and mutual monogamy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Darbes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darbes 2002</LINK> classifies three types of behavioural interventions: (i) individually focused interventions without explicit or direct attempts to change the norms of the community or the target population as a whole (e.g. peer education, referrals, skills training); (ii) social interventions that aim to change not only individual behaviours but also social norms or peer norms (e.g. community mobilization); and (iii) policy interventions that aim to change individual behavior or peer/social norms or structures through administrative or legal decisions (e.g. condom availability in public settings). This is a relatively broad classification of behavioural interventions and allows for changes to wider, structural, determinants of health to influence health-related behaviour. Interventions which address social, demographic, economic and political influences on health are recognised as having greater potential to reduce health inequalities than those which are solely aimed at the individual (<LINK REF="REF-Marmot-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marmot 2010</LINK>). This review adopts a similar classification to that of <LINK REF="REF-Darbes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darbes 2002</LINK>. At its most basic a behavioural intervention can provide information about the transmission and prevention of STIs and the promotion of sexual health in general. However, this may also be accompanied by additional components such as skills development for safer sexual practices (e.g. effective communication with partners), counselling and provision of resources (e.g. free condoms) and services (e.g. STI testing, immunisation), or even changes in policy and legislation. Interventions may be provided in a variety of locations, including schools and colleges, health care settings (e.g. primary care, family planning clinics, sexual health clinics), in a variety of formats (e.g. group discussion sessions, mass media, computer programmes) and be of variable length (e.g. one-off initiatives, or sustained activities over weeks or months).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-03-11 13:35:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Behavioural interventions can potentially influence health-related behaviour (and, in turn, health outcomes) via effecting changes in mediators of behaviour change such as knowledge, attitudes, community/peer norms, beliefs and self-efficacy. A number of conceptual models, drawn from disciplines such as sociology, psychology and education, predict and explain mechanisms of behaviour change and have been used to guide the development of interventions. Such models include Social Learning Theory (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1971</LINK>), Social Cognitive Theory (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1990</LINK>), The Theory of Reasoned Action/Planned Behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Ajzen-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ajzen 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ajzen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ajzen 1985</LINK>), the Health Belief Model (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1984</LINK>) and the Transtheoretical Model (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>As mentioned, behavioural interventions can promote a range of protective sexual behaviours such as use of condoms for vaginal intercourse. There is evidence for the effectiveness of condoms for vaginal intercourse as a method of preventing HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Weller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weller 2002</LINK>). There is relatively less evidence available for the effectiveness of condoms to prevent other STIs (e.g. chlamydia, gonorrhoea). As HPV can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, condoms may not necessarily prevent infection of other anogenital epithelial sites not covered by the condom. A meta-analysis of observational studies found no consistent evidence of a protective effect of condom use on infection with HPV (<LINK REF="REF-Manhart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manhart 2002</LINK>). However, there was some evidence to suggest a protective effect against CIN 2 or CIN 3 and also against invasive cervical cancer. It was suggested that condoms may not necessarily prevent HPV infection, but may inhibit progression to cervical lesions. This may be due to a reduction in the total amount of virus transmitted through condom use which may lessen the likelihood of developing a clinical lesion (<LINK REF="REF-Manhart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manhart 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>More recent studies provide stronger evidence on the effectiveness of condoms to prevent HPV and cervical cancer. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) found that condom use was associated with regression of CIN lesions and the clearance of HPV in women with an abnormal cervical smear test and/or with CIN, the majority of whom were HPV positive and none of whom were regularly using condoms prior to the study (<LINK REF="REF-Hogewoning-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogewoning 2003</LINK>). It is thought that reducing the continuity of HPV transmission improves the chances of HPV clearance. <LINK REF="REF-Winer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winer 2006</LINK> studied 82 newly sexually active female university students (aged 18 to 22 years) over a median period of 40 months. The incidence of genital HPV infection was 37.8 per 100 person years at risk for women whose partners used condoms for all instances of vaginal intercourse during the eight months before testing, compared with 89.3 per 100 person years at risk in women whose partners used condoms less than five per cent of the time. The results of this study provide greater support for the use of condoms as a method of protection against HPV in newly sexually active young women, though they may not necessarily be generalisable to young women of low socio-economic status and/or those with multiple partners.</P>
<P>Aside from condom use, other protective strategies have been advocated such as reducing the number of sexual partners, mutual monogamy or abstaining from any sexual contact/delaying becoming sexually active. The latter is particularly salient given the trend for lower age of first sexual intercourse in some countries (commonly around 16 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Hawes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawes 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rotermann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotermann 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wellings-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellings 2001</LINK>). However, the promotion of abstinence is a contentious issue (<LINK REF="REF-Stammers-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stammers 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanne-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanne 2006</LINK>; Underhill 2007). Some commentators suggest that promoting anything other than abstinence to young people is incompatible with particular social, cultural and religious values. Others argue that abstinence promotion is unlikely to be acceptable to many young people and therefore an unrealistic intervention. Specifically, it denies them the chance to make choices about their own health and relationships and does not equip them with the information and safer sex skills they may need when they do become sexually active. The most pragmatic approach, therefore, might be interventions that advocate a broad range of protective strategies enabling young women to exercise choices relevant to their stage of sexual development, whether it be delaying having sex until married or in a committed relationship, monogamy, limiting the number of sexual partners, or using condoms consistently with all partners.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-01-19 15:11:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Invasive cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Transmission of HPV, the most significant risk factor for cervical cancer, remains common. High rates of STIs in young people continue to be reported in many countries, as well as sexual risk behaviour and in some countries a reduction in the age of first sexual intercourse. Effective primary prevention to promote protective sexual behaviours therefore remains crucial.</P>
<P>The first version of this review was published in 2000 (see <LINK TAG="OTHER_VERSIONS_REFERENCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other published versions of this review</LINK>). This is an active research field necessitating an update to capture all relevant recent evidence.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-12-06 14:37:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of behavioural interventions in young women (aged 25 years or less) at encouraging sexual behaviours to prevent STIs (e.g. HPV) and cervical cancer.</P>

<P>Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible (Note that in the original version of this review both RCTs and non-randomised controlled trials were eligible - see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK> and <LINK TAG="OTHER_VERSIONS_REFERENCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other published versions of this review</LINK>). We only included conference abstracts reporting RCTs if they were published within the last three years (i.e. 2007 to 2010) and if they contained sufficient detail to enable an appraisal of the methodology and results. We assumed that studies reported in conference abstracts prior to 2007 would have been fully published since then.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2011-01-19 15:23:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Females aged 25 years or less. This threshold was chosen because incidence of HPV is highest in this age group. An accompanying lower threshold (e.g. from 15 to 25 years) was not chosen because of the falling age at first sexual intercourse in some countries and the fact that cell changes in the cervix during puberty can support HPV replication, which is associated with later progression to cervical cancer (see <LINK TAG="CONDITION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of the condition</LINK>). Hence, it was important to assess the effectiveness of interventions targeted at younger females (Note that in the original version of this review the eligible age range was 13 to 64 years - see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK> and <LINK TAG="OTHER_VERSIONS_REFERENCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other published versions of this review</LINK>).</P>
<P>To be included a trial had to meet one of the following criteria:</P>
<P>(1) The trial's own eligibility criteria specified young women aged 25 years or less; or.<BR/>(2) 70% of the young women randomised were aged 25 years or less; or<BR/>(3) From the mean/median/mode age given (and standard deviation) it was likely that the 70% of young women were aged 25 years or less.</P>
<P>The intervention had to be targeted at females only. Interventions which were provided to young women along with their male partners or to young women and family members (e.g. mother and daughter dyads) were not included.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-01-19 15:23:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Behavioural interventions which provide factual information about sexual risk factors for cervical cancer (e.g. HPV) and /or about the transmission and prevention of STIs in general.  At its most basic the intervention should be described as including provision of factual information, education, instruction and /or knowledge. This can be accompanied by other activities such as motivation building, practical skill development or provision of incentives (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of the intervention</LINK>).</P>
<P>The following interventions were not included unless they reported inclusion of an educational component to encourage protective sexual behaviours: cervical cancer screening, HPV vaccination, STI testing or changes to policy or service provision.</P>
<P>Promotion of safer sexual behaviours has the potential to prevent transmission of HPV even if preventing HPV/cervical cancer was not the main focus of the trial. Therefore, trials in which the focus was on preventing HIV/AIDS, chlamydia or other STIs were eligible.</P>
<P>There was no restriction on the setting, provider or media used.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-01-19 15:23:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Relevant outcomes were classified as behavioural (i.e. sexual behaviour) or biological (i.e. incidence of STIs and/or changes in cervical cytology). To be included a trial had to report at least one behavioural and/or at least one biological outcome.</P>
<P>Relevant behavioural outcomes could include (amongst others): condom use for vaginal intercourse, sexual partner reduction, reduction in sexual intercourse episodes, delayed first intercourse and abstinence from sexual activity. Behavioural measures are a stronger indicator of the potential of interventions to prevent health problems than measures such as knowledge or attitudes, which, as is well-established, may not on their own lead to a change in behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1994</LINK>). The trials included in this review measured a variety of non-behavioural outcomes including knowledge, attitudes and intentions (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). However, it was beyond the scope of this review to extract and analyse them.</P>
<P>In terms of biological outcomes, trials reporting changes in incidence of any STI were eligible. Incidence of HPV (particularly high risk types 16 and 18) is most relevant to this review, though where this was not measured occurrence of other STIs were used as a proxy. This was a pragmatic decision given the likely predominance of chlamydia and gonorrhoea as outcome measures, though notwithstanding the greater infectiousness of HPV relative to other STIs. Changes in cervical cytology (e.g. CIN 1 to 3) and progression to cervical cancer were also relevant outcome measures. Rates of pregnancy were not included as outcome measures.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2011-03-02 13:31:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Trials included in this review were derived from two main sources: electronic database searching and hand-searching.</P>
<P>The searches for the original version of this review (published in 2000, see <LINK TAG="OTHER_VERSIONS_REFERENCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other published versions of this review</LINK>)) were performed in December 1997. Updated searches were carried out in January 1999 and December 2001, though those review updates were never fully completed and published. A further update search was performed in December 2009 to January 2010. Collectively these searches support this current version of the review.</P>

<ELECTRONIC_SEARCHES MODIFIED="2011-03-02 13:31:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The original search strategies for electronic bibliographic databases were devised by the EPPI-Centre, Institute of Education, University of London. Some of these strategies were revised in December 2009 by the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Review Group (CGCRG) Trials Search Co-ordinator (namely MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to reflect the change in the scope and inclusion criteria of the review for this update. The CINAHL, PsychINFO, ERIC and the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) strategies were revised by the review team (GKF and JS) also to take into account the change in scope and inclusion criteria, as well as to accommodate changes to the database platforms available to us at that time. These revised search strategies are located in the <LINK TAG="APPENDICES" TYPE="SECTION">Appendices</LINK>).</P>

<P>Meta-analysis was considered to be inappropriate due to the heterogeneity of interventions, trial populations and outcome measures. A narrative synthesis was conducted (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>), with the effects split into the four categories of intervention comparison described below (see 'Type of comparator' in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>). Trials with more than two randomised groups may appear in more than one category depending on the comparisons made. All behavioural outcomes are presented, as well as biological outcomes (STIs, but excluding pregnancy). As mentioned, non-behavioural and non-biological outcomes such as knowledge, attitudes, behavioural intentions are not reported as they were beyond the scope of this review update.</P>
<P>The effects are generally presented in terms of whether or not there were statistically significant differences between randomised groups at the last time point at which outcomes were assessed by the studies. Effects observed at interim and final assessment points are reported in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> (condom use), <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> (incidence of STIs), <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> (sexual partners), <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK> (casual sexual partners) and <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK> (engagement in sex).</P>
<P>All studies are included in the narrative synthesis, irrespective of their risk of bias. Where necessary, comments are made in the text to advise caution for serious methodological shortcomings, but readers are also encouraged to refer back to the <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> section and Figure 1 and Figure 2, as well as the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables for more detailed comments on bias and methodological quality (e.g. equivalence of trial groups at baseline; statistical power). In some studies not all of the randomised population were sexually active during the trial period and therefore outcomes are reported for smaller sample sizes rather than the randomised population. This is noted where relevant.</P>

<P>In addition to our 2009 to 2010 update search, we re-screened, using our revised inclusion criteria, our bibliographic reference databases containing references identified from searches performed in 1997, 1999 and 2001 (see <LINK TAG="SEARCH_METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Search methods for identification of studies</LINK> and <LINK TAG="STUDY_SELECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Selection of studies</LINK>). A total of 64 studies (described in a total of 122 full papers) were re-screened, of which 56 did not meet the revised criteria.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Design</HEADING>
<P>In 17 of the 23 trials the individual participants were randomly allocated to intervention arms. The remaining six studies were cluster designs in which groups rather than individuals were allocated to the interventions. The units of randomisation in these cluster trials were neighbourhoods (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>), urban localities (<LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009</LINK>), schools (<LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003</LINK>), family planning clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996</LINK>) or floors within a university student dormitory (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>). In cluster trials, observations on individuals within the same intervention group may be correlated, which would reduce the statistical power of the trial and the precision of estimates of effect. Correlation of observations increases the sample size required and should be taken into account when planning a trial. Only two of the six cluster trials considered intra-group correlation: <LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008</LINK> assumed an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.02 for the calculation of sample size, based on a pilot study; and <LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009</LINK> used multi-level analyses to evaluate the possibility that individuals in the same group may have been similar on characteristics that were not measured in the trial.</P>
<P>Total sample sizes were reported either as the number of individuals or the number of clusters randomised. The total number of individuals randomised ranged from 62 (<LINK REF="STD-Morrison_x002d_Beedy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison-Beedy 2005</LINK>) to 5297 (<LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994</LINK>), with an overall mean of 848 and a median of 522. One of the cluster trials (<LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003</LINK>) did not report how many clusters were randomised. In the five remaining cluster trials the number of clusters randomised ranged from 2 (<LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996</LINK>) to 12 (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sample sizes per trial arm were not reported in two of the individually randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK>) and one of the cluster randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003</LINK>). The reported number of individuals randomised per arm ranged from 19 (<LINK REF="STD-Ploem-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ploem 1997</LINK>) to 1691 (<LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994</LINK>). The reported number of clusters randomised per arm ranged from one urban locality (<LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009</LINK>) or one family planning clinic (<LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996</LINK>) to four neighbourhoods (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008</LINK>) or four student dormitory floors (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sample size calculations were reported in eight of the 23 trials. Six trials gave a sample size calculation for the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008</LINK>) whilst in two trials it was not stated which outcome(s) the sample size calculation was for (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK>). The sample size calculations were based on estimates of statistical power, apart from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008</LINK>) which based their sample size calculations on correlations of observations within trial groups.</P>
<P>Process evaluations, which are important for understanding the mechanisms of (or barriers to) action of complex interventions were conducted and reported in nine of the 23 trials.The most frequently reported aspects of process evaluation were participant exposure to interventions (reported in six trials: <LINK REF="STD-Bryan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bryan 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK>) and participant perception of the content, delivery and/or relevance of interventions (also reported in six trials: <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Settings</HEADING>
<P>The majority of the trials evaluated interventions which were delivered in health-care settings (14 of the 23 trials). The types of health care-settings varied and included family planning clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Choi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Morrison_x002d_Beedy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison-Beedy 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Roye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roye 2007</LINK>), STI clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996</LINK>), a sexual health clinic (<LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK>), a family medicine clinic (<LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK>), a primary care site (unspecified) (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>), a University health centre (<LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK>), obstetric clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009</LINK>), a hospital for women and infants (<LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008</LINK>), managed care networks (of practices, clinics and hospitals) (<LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK>), a public health clinic (<LINK REF="STD-Shain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shain 1999</LINK>) and a children&#8217;s hospital adolescent clinic and inpatient service (<LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three of the 23 trials evaluated interventions in community/city settings, comprising urban neighbourhood community venues (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008</LINK>) and urban public housing developments <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>. Precise details of the setting of the third were not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>As specified in the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section, to be included in this review a trial had to include women predominantly under the age of 25 years. In two trials the mean age was below 15 years (12.29 years in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009</LINK> and 13 years in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>).

<P>The ethnic and racial composition of the trials (of which, as reported earlier, all but two were conducted in the USA) could be summarised as diverse. In 10 of the 23 trials there was no predominant racial or ethnic category (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Choi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Morrison_x002d_Beedy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison-Beedy 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Roye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roye 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001</LINK>).These trials tended to comprise varying proportions of African-Americans, Caucasians, Hispanics, Asians and others. In a further seven trials the predominant (i.e. greater than 70%) race/ethnicity was African-American (<LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994</LINK>) and in four of these seven the eligibility criteria permitted only African-American women (<LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Socio-economic status</HEADING>
<P>Data on markers of SES were reported in numerous ways and in varying detail (see the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Across the trials the SES profile of the young women varied. Commonly reported markers of SES included level of education (e.g. whether completed high school or above), years of education and qualifications achieved. Employment and income was another commonly reported characteristic, including employment status, personal and household income, classifications of poverty status, receipt of benefits and welfare (e.g. family aid, food stamps) and medical insurance coverage. Also mentioned were general family/household details such as whether or not the young women had children (and whether they were single mothers) and whether they themselves lived with both parents or with a single parent (and whether employed/unemployed). A further marker of SES was the locality in which the young women lived and indicators of its health status, with inner-city locations sometimes considered synonymously with poor health and low income. Some of the trials were designed specifically to benefit those considered to have low SES. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009</LINK> recruited young women from areas high in low-income/single-mother&#8211;headed homes and <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005</LINK> recruited low-income inner-city women. Eight trials did not provide any detail on markers of SES (<LINK REF="STD-Bryan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bryan 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ploem-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ploem 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Roye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roye 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>), though two of these were trials of young women in Universtiy which may indicate a relatively higher SES (<LINK REF="STD-Ploem-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ploem 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>).</P>

The proportions varied from 7% (<LINK REF="STD-Bryan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bryan 1996</LINK>) to 49% (<LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK>) with the exception of the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Shain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shain 1999 </LINK>in which diagnosis with a (non-viral) STI was a trial eligibility criterion and the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996</LINK> in which diagnosis with chlamydia was necessary for entry into the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK> reported only that a 'small' proportion of women had declared a recent STI. Two of the 23 trials reported the proportion of young women who had an STI at entry to the trial (<LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005</LINK>). The remaining six of the 23 trials did not report whether or not the young women studied had ever had an STI (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>). However, in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008</LINK> neighbourhoods were selected that had the highest rates of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and teen births for 15 to 25 year old women in the campaign area and similarly <LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009</LINK> reported that the sample sites had poor indicators related to teen birth rates and STIs including HIV/AIDS.</P>
<P>The trials reported a wide range of measures of baseline sexual risk behaviour for STIs. Data for these measures were reported in numerous different ways and have not been summarised here (see the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Commonly reported measures included the number of lifetime sexual partners, the number with multiple partners over a given time period, the number with a regular partner, use of condoms with casual and regular partners, consistency of condom use, age at first intercourse and number of unprotected sex acts over a given time period. Less commonly reported measures included the number who had ever been pregnant, use of drugs and alcohol with sex, condom use skills and use of general (non-condom) forms of contraception. The data reported suggest varying levels of behavioural risk for STIs. For example, relatively low proportions of women reported consistent condom use, varying from around 25% in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK> to 41% in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK>. As is evident from the data on sexual experience and history of STIs reported above, some of the trials appeared to be specifically aimed at women they considered to be at 'high risk'. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK> excluded women if they used condoms at every episode of vaginal, oral or anal sex, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008</LINK> only included young women who were sexually active with a male partner in the past six months and at high risk for unintended pregnancy or STI. In contrast, in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>, the majority of women reported not ever being sexually active at the start of the trial and most of those who were active were judged to be using effective contraceptives. However, it should be noted that the girls in this trial were comparatively younger than many of the other trials included in this review (mean age 13 years).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of intervention</HEADING>
<P>An overview of the characteristics of the interventions (type, length, setting) can be found in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Given the diversity in the types of behavioural intervention meeting our inclusion criteria, we categorised the experimental interventions into four types, based on their key components:</P>
<P>1) Information provision plus skills development (n = 17 trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bryan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bryan 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Choi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Morrison_x002d_Beedy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison-Beedy 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Roye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roye 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Shain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shain 1999;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>). These interventions commonly provided factual information about sexual and reproductive health and the transmission and prevention of STIs and gave young women the opportunity to develop practical skills to facilitate safer sexual behaviour. The latter included general communication skills with partners (e.g. discussions about safer sex), assertiveness and negotiation skills (e.g. to engage in safer practices), unsafe sex refusal skills and correct condom use skills (e.g. to prevent condom failure). Skills were practised using techniques such discussion, role playing and cognitive rehearsal.</P>
<P>In general, skills development was facilitated within the context of sexual and reproductive health, though occasionally the context was broader. For example, young women taking part in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994</LINK>, all of whom were young mothers, were encouraged to take greater control over their lives through discussions about contraception, STIs, relationships, self-esteem, decision making, assertiveness and communication. This was complimented with the teaching of parenting skills, life skills and family management (e.g. time and money management).</P>
<P>2) Information provision, plus skills development plus other component (n = 3 trials) (<LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ploem-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ploem 1997</LINK>). These trials were similar to those summarised above in category 1, in that they provided information and facilitated skill development, but they also included additional activities/initiatives. In the main these comprised provision of resources to enable young women to put their knowledge and skills into practice. For example, <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK> gave young women vouchers to pass onto their male sexual partners to facilitate access to STI screening and treatment.</P>
<P>3) Information only (n = 2 trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK>). As the title suggests these trials provided information about sexual and reproductive health, but did not supplement this with skills development or additional resources. In both trials the information was tailored to the specific requirements of each young woman based on needs assessment. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008</LINK> provided information about methods of contraception tailored to the individual's readiness to change their condom and contraceptive behaviours (based on the Transtheoretical Model).</P>
<P>4) Information plus other component (n = 1 trial) (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008</LINK>). The only trial in this category supplemented information about condom use with the provision of coupons redeemable for male and female condoms and lubricant in a silk carrying case. The authors described this as social marketing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of comparator</HEADING>
<P>The trials were categorised according to the types of comparator against which the efficacy of the behavioural interventions was evaluated. Eleven of the 23 trials had more than two randomised arms (with the maximum number of arms in a trial being four), permitting multiple comparisons of arms. Therefore, these trials are classified in more than one category. A total of four comparisons were created:</P>
<P>Comparison 1) Behavioural intervention versus more basic version(s) of intervention/standard practice (n = 12 trials) (<LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ploem-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ploem 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Roye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roye 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Shain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shain 1999;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001</LINK>). Some of the trials in this category compared the behavioural intervention to what the authors described as being standard practice or usual care. For example, the trial involving young mothers by <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994</LINK> compared an enhanced education and parenting skills programme addressing (amongst other things) STI risks, with usual local welfare services provision for teenage mothers (described as limited social and support services available under that programme). This category also includes trials in which the behavioural intervention was compared to one which contained fewer components. An example is the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005</LINK> which compared a skills-based risk reduction intervention that provided young women with information about risks for STIs and the opportunity to practice condom use and negotiation skills with partners, with an intervention which provided information but no skill development. Also in this comparison are trials in which the behavioural intervention was tested against a similar intervention but which had less contact time.</P>
<P>Comparison 2) Behavioural intervention(s) versus general health promotion/attention control (n = 8 trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bryan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bryan 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Choi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Morrison_x002d_Beedy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison-Beedy 2005</LINK>). The trials in this category made comparisons between behavioural interventions addressing STIs and interventions matched in terms of format and structure, but lacking any coverage of sexual and reproductive health. The rationale for inclusion of this type of comparator, where stated, was to control for the general effect of participating in a health promotion intervention trial (e.g. the Hawthorne effect), in order to isolate the specific effects of the STI intervention. It mimics the amount of time and attention received by the intervention group but is thought not to have a specific effect upon the participants. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Morrison_x002d_Beedy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison-Beedy 2005</LINK> compared an HIV education and skills development intervention with a general health promotion control group, equivalent in terms of type of intervention provider and format (e.g. group exercises and therapeutic exercises), but covering topics such as anger management, caffeine use and nutrition rather than sexual health.</P>
<P>Comparison 3) Behavioural intervention versus similar intervention with a different provider/medium (n = 3 trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>). The purpose of these studies was to test the effect of different methods of delivering interventions that were similar in terms of content. As an example, <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK> evaluated an interactive video which provided young women with information about sexual health and allowed them to practice skills via cognitive rehearsal. This was compared to a book containing the same dialogue and imagery as the video. The authors hypothesised that whilst knowledge would increase irrespective of which intervention was received, there would be more favourable changes in sexual risk behaviour and rates of STIs in the former intervention, given the interactive and engaging nature of the video.</P>
<P>Comparison 4) Behavioural intervention(s) versus no-intervention (control) (n = 4 trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ploem-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ploem 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>). Trials in this category compared groups of young women who received behavioural interventions to groups of young women who either received no intervention at all or who received the intervention at a later time point (e.g. after the evaluation had completed).</P>
<P>The effects of the interventions included in this systematic review are presented according to these four types of comparators (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intervention providers</HEADING>
<P>The intervention providers were described as health educators in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Choi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Morrison_x002d_Beedy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison-Beedy 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001</LINK>) and researchers or research assistants in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bryan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bryan 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ploem-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ploem 1997</LINK>). In four trials intervention providers were not specified and the study participants appeared to have had direct access to interventions through brochures placed at community venues (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008</LINK>), brochures or videos placed in healthcare settings (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>), an interactive computer system (<LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008</LINK>) or mailed self-help materials (<LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK>). Two trials described their intervention providers as peer educators (<LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK>) or peer counsellors (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>), in both cases these were females of African-American ethnicity. In the remaining trials the interventions were provided by: a trained midwife or obstetrician (<LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009</LINK>); clinical psychology graduate students (<LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK>); degree-qualified women who had worked with inner-city adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005</LINK>); mothers of the trial participants (<LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009</LINK>); trained nurse facilitators (<LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003</LINK>); case managers (<LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994</LINK>); or clinic staff (<LINK REF="STD-Roye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roye 2007</LINK>); or other female providers (<LINK REF="STD-Shain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shain 1999;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>). In most of the trials a single type of intervention provider was employed and, where reported, interventions and comparators appeared to be delivered by the same type of provider. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK>) used both health educators and peer educators to deliver the intervention, whilst one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Shain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shain 1999</LINK>) used different providers for the intervention (an ethnically-matched female facilitator) and the comparator (a nurse practitioner). A limitation of the reporting of the intervention providers is that it was often unclear how many people were involved in the specified roles.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intervention length and intensity</HEADING>
<P>There was variation in the total length of the experimental intervention periods (which includes initial sessions and any follow-up 'booster' sessions), from a single 20 minute session, to a series of sessions spread over nine months. Seven of the 23 interventions lasted for a day or less (<LINK REF="STD-Bryan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bryan 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ploem-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ploem 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Roye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roye 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005</LINK>). For example, <LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996</LINK> evaluated a brief 10 to 20 minute STI/family planning clinic-based intervention in which women were given information about STIs and instructed in condom use and partner negotiation skills. Some of these shorter interventions were specifically designed to be brief practical interventions that could be delivered at low cost in routine practice (<LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK>). Two interventions lasted between one week and one month (<LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shain 1999</LINK>), seven interventions lasted between one and three months (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK>) and two interventions lasted between three and six months (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001</LINK>). The longest intervention lasted between six months and a year (<LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009</LINK>).

<P>There was also variation in the total intervention contact time, from one hour or less to 20 hours.

<P>The studies employed a variety of approaches to promote sexual health and prevent STIs. <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> shows the various behavioural aims of the interventions evaluated, which ranged from promoting abstinence or partner reduction, to broader risk reduction strategies encompassing a variety of behaviours. The most common aim was to promote condom use for vaginal (and in some cases oral/anal) intercourse, as featured in all 23 included trials (and in seven trials it appeared to be the sole aim: <LINK REF="STD-Bryan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bryan 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Choi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Ploem-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ploem 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>). In the majority of interventions the male condom was promoted, though some promoted male or female condoms (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008</LINK>) and in one trial the emphasis was on promoting the female condom (<LINK REF="STD-Choi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2008</LINK>). In the majority of cases the interventions taught the young women about how to obtain and use condoms (e.g. practical demonstrations using anatomical models) and a common message was the need to use them consistently. Some of the trials explored various aspects of condom promotion such as <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK> including 'desensitisation' to encourage young women to be more comfortable about handling and using condoms and to correct misconceptions. Likewise <LINK REF="STD-Ploem-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ploem 1997</LINK> emphasised the positive and pleasurable aspects of condoms to make them more acceptable and normalised (e.g. eroticisisation). Some interventions advocated the promotion of effective contraception, of which condoms were one of a number of strategies (these were primarily trials which aimed to prevent unintended pregnancy as well as STIs) (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Roye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roye 2007</LINK>). In two of these studies the emphasis was on dual methods of birth control comprising condom and hormonal contraception (<LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Roye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roye 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nine of the trials were classified as encouraging an increase in protective behaviours/decrease in risk behaviours (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). These were generally broader strategies designed to enable young women to develop skills and set goals and action plans for their own sexual health (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Roye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roye 2007</LINK>). At least two of these trials encouraged the young women to adopt risk reduction strategies that are more subject to a woman&#8217;s control, including buying and carrying condoms (<LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In seven of the 23 included trials a facet of the intervention was encouragement to abstain from sex or reduce sexual activity (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). In six of the trials one of the aims was sexual partner reduction (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). However, abstinence or partner reduction were never the sole behavioural aims. For example, in the pregnancy prevention trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>, abstinence was the prominent message, but the intervention also addressed the use of effective contraception for those who are having sex, which could include condoms.</P>
<P>As evident from <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, it was common for interventions to have more than one behavioural aim (16 out of the 23 trials). In some cases the interventions encompassed multiple behavioural aims to enable young women to minimise their chances of acquiring STIs. For example in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001</LINK>, the young women were given a list of topics and were given the opportunity of choosing the order in which they were discussed and the amount of emphasis each received. Topics included consequences of unprotected sex, risk perception, preventing pregnancy, preventing STDs, condoms, spermicide, obtaining condoms, secondary abstinence and talking about sex.</P>

<B>Condom use:</B> In 19 of the 23 trials behavioural outcomes referred to the use of condoms. Most of the trials that reported condom use outcomes appeared to refer to male condoms, although this was not always explicitly stated. Two trials specifically measured the use of female condoms (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Choi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2008</LINK>).

In four trials pregnancy was as a discrete outcome expressed as a frequency or effect size (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008</LINK>), whilst the fifth trial reported a composite measure that reflected the incidence of any STI and/or unintended pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 2005</LINK>). These trials had all specified pregnancy reduction as one of their objectives (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</LI>

Other outcomes reported were perceived control (i.e. self-efficacy) in a range of 11 condom-related behaviours (expressed as a single score) (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>) and self-efficacy to refuse sex (<LINK REF="STD-Dancy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dancy 2009</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003</LINK>) reported summary scores from constructs based on Social Cognitive Theory for assessing overall self efficacy and based on the Theory of Reasoned Action for assessing perceived behavioural control.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Behavioural Intentions: </B>Eight trials assessed intentions as an outcome measure. The most common behavioural intention measured was intention to use condoms (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bryan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bryan 1996</LINK> assessed intentions to buy, carry, practice or discuss use of condoms.

<P>
<B>Consistency</B>/<B>frequency of condom use for vaginal intercourse</B>
</P>
<P>Six comparison 1 trials reported on this outcome. Two trials reported a statistically significant difference between the behavioural intervention and its more basic version/standard practice. At 12 month follow-up in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK>, a greater percentage of young women receiving the STI/HIV risk reduction intervention reported consistent condom use than in the enhanced usual care comparison group. This was the case for both the previous 14 day period (Risk ratio (RR) 1.70, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.95, P = 0.01) and the previous 60 day period (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.09, P = 0.007). In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996</LINK>, at six month follow-up the frequency of condom use for STD protection and frequency of condom use for vaginal intercourse was higher for young women receiving the condom use education and practical skills development session compared to the those who received the condom use education session<I> </I>(Odds ratio (OR) 13.2, 95% CI 4.2 to 41.8, P &lt; 0.001 and OR 11.8, 95% CI 3.3 to 41.9, P &lt; 0.001, respectively).</P>
<P>Two trials reported no statistically significant difference between the behavioural intervention and comparator in the percentage reporting consistent condom use: at 24 month follow-up in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008</LINK> (period unspecified, adjusted RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.79)); and at six month follow-up in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK> (for the previous three month period, adjusted OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.73, P = 0.21).</P>
<P>In two trials statistical significance for comparisons of interventions was not reported so inferences could not be made. <LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001</LINK> reported consistency (every time) and frequency (in the past six months) of condom use at the 12 month follow-up assessment. The percentage of women reporting consistent (every time) condom use with both main and other partners was higher for the safer sex education intervention<I> </I>than the standard care/STD education comparator<I>. </I>Likewise, frequency scores were also marginally higher for the safer sex education intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Ploem-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ploem 1997</LINK> reported very small numbers of consistent condom users (less than 5).</P>
<P>
<B>Condom use during last sexual intercourse</B>
</P>
<P>Five comparison 1 trials reported on this outcome. Only one of these trials reported a statistically significant difference.</P>
<P>At 12 month follow-up in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK>, a greater percentage of young women receiving the STI/HIV risk reduction intervention reported using condoms during last sexual intercourse than those in the enhanced usual care comparison group (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.68, P = 0.01).</P>
<P>The remaining four trials either reported no statistically significant differences between interventions or did not report statistical significance.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996</LINK> reported two measures: the probability of having used condoms at last coitus and the effect of the intervention on condom use at last coitus (no further information given). For the former it is described that there is 'no effect' and the latter is described as being not statistically significant (no P value given or point estimate reported).</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994</LINK> gave the percentage of teenage mothers reporting contraception use at follow-up. Of the various contraception methods, use of condoms was reported by 23% of the young women. However, data were only given for the sample as a whole rather than the randomised intervention groups and for a sub-sample of those who completed the trial.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Roye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roye 2007</LINK> reported the percentage who used condoms during last vaginal intercourse with a main partner at both three and 12 month follow-up. The trial compared a video and counselling intervention with counselling only, with video only and with usual care. No quantitative results were given (except for age and ethnicity sub-groups). It was stated that there were no statistically significant differences for any group comparisons (no statistical significance was reported) with the exception of the video and counselling group compared to the usual care group at the three months follow-up. The video and counselling group were two and a half times as likely as to have used a condom during last intercourse with their main partner (stated significant at the 0.06 level based on logistic regression).</P>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001</LINK> at 12 months follow-up, a greater percentage of young women receiving the safer sex education intervention reported using condoms during the last sexual encounter than those in the comparison group, although statistical significance was not reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Protected</B>/<B>unprotected sex acts</B>
</P>
<P>Six comparison 1 trials reported this outcome. The results of most of these appear to favour the behavioural interventions.</P>
<P>At 12 month follow-up in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK>, the proportion of condom protected sex acts was greater for young women receiving the STI/HIV risk reduction intervention reported than the enhanced usual care comparison group for the previous 14 days (adjusted mean difference (MD) = 12.79, 95% CI 3.06 to 22.52), P = 0.001) and the previous 60 days (adjusted MD =10.78, 95% CI 3.61 to 17.95, P = 0.002).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009</LINK> reported the mean number of unprotected sex acts in the past 30 days measured at 17, 49 and 75 weeks after baseline. Comparisons were made between women randomised to varying levels of prenatal care: group prenatal care with an integrated HIV component (group 1), group prenatal care (group 2) and individual prenatal care (group 3). In the main the mean number of unprotected acts was lowest for the young women in the group prenatal care with an integrated HIV component arm, though the difference between arms was only statistically significant at the 75 week time point (P &lt; 0.05 for group 1 versus groups 2 and 3). Young women who did not have any sexual partners were coded as having zero partners, though the number of these young women was not reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ploem-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ploem 1997</LINK> reported changes in the proportion of intercourse occasions protected by a condom at the one month follow-up assessment in the subset of 36 (of the 112 randomised) coitally active young women taking part in their trial. The women were classified in terms of those who increased protected occasions, those who decreased and those with no change. A greater proportion of women increased their occasions in the information, condom eroticisation/normalisation and communication skills combination intervention compared to the information only intervention (P = 0.05). Conversley, the proportion of 'no changers' was higher in the information only intervention group (P = 0.05). The proportion of young women who decreased condom protected occasions was similar between the two groups and not reported to be statistically significant (P value not given).</P>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK> the mean percentage of intercourse episodes in which condoms were used (by a sub-set of 842 sexually active participants from the 1210 randomised) with any male partner in past three months was given for the six month follow-up. The percentage of episodes was statistically significantly higher in the self-help intervention group than the usual care group (adjusted MD = 5.2%, 95% CI 0.4 to 10.4, P = 0.05).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Shain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shain 1999</LINK> measured the percentage of unprotected sexual acts from trial entry through to follow-up at 12 months, categorising responses into "fewer than five acts" or "five or more". The percentage reporting fewer than five acts was statistically significantly higher for the young women receiving the behavioural-cognitive intervention compared to those receiving the nurse practitioner-led counselling (P = 0.03). Similarly, the percentage reporting five or more unprotected acts was significantly lower for the behavioural-cognitive intervention (P = 0.03).</P>
<P>Only one trial did not report statistically significant differences. <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK> reported the mean number of vaginal sex acts with and without a condom at two month follow-up (for the previous two months). The mean number of acts with a condom was lower for the 'Intervention-Motivation-Behavioural' skills group compared to the information-only group<I>. </I>Furthermore, the mean number of acts without a condom was<I> </I>higher for the Intervention-Motivation-Behavioural skills group. However, these differences were reported not to be statistically significant based on log odds (no further detail given). Although not explicitly stated, these data may have excluded the sub-group of up to 20% who became sexually abstinent between baseline and two month follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>Other condom use measures</B>
</P>
<P>Six comparison 1 trials reported other measures of condom use. In general there were statistically significant differences between trial groups favouring the behavioural intervention over the more basic version(s) of intervention/standard practice.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005</LINK> reported the mean number of days of sex without a condom in past three months at the 12 month follow-up assessment. Those receiving the skills-based HIV/STD risk reduction intervention had a statistically significant lower mean than those receiving the information-based HIV/STD risk reduction comparator intervention (P = 0.03).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009</LINK> measured the mean percentage self-estimated condom use in past six months at 75 weeks after baseline (NB. it is not clear what was meant by mean percentage condom use). The percentage was highest for the group prenatal care with an integrated HIV component (group 1), followed by the individual prenatal care (group 3) and the group prenatal care (group 2) (P = 0.04). The trial also provided the percentage of young women who reported that condom use was for STI protection (rather than pregnancy prevention) at 75 weeks after baseline. This was statistically significantly higher in group 1 compared to groups 2 and 3 which had been combined (P = 0.028). Data for condom use were only presented for those participants who were sexually active in the previous six months, though the number of such participants was not reported. The size of this sub-group relative to the total number randomised is therefore unclear.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Orr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Orr 1996</LINK> reported the odds of having used condoms for vaginal intercourse and the odds of having used condoms for protection against STIs at six months follow-up, for the brief clinic-based condom use education and practical skills development session group compared to the brief clinic-based condom use education session group. For both outcomes there was a statistically significant effect favouring the education and practical skills development group (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.8, P = 0.005 and OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.2, P = 0.02 respectively).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Peipert-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peipert 2008</LINK> presented the percentage of young women at the 24 month follow-up who reported use of dual methods for contraception (which could include any of the following: (1) hormonal contraception plus a barrier method; (2) male condoms plus female condoms; (3) condoms plus spermicide; or (4) intrauterine device or sterilization plus a barrier method). The percentage of young women reporting dual use was highest amongst those receiving the individual-tailored dual contraception computer intervention than the enhanced standard care computer comparator intervention and this became statistically significant in an analysis adjusted for baseline covariates (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.66).</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK> gave the percentage of sexually active young women who reported condom use in the past three months at the six month assessment and also for the combined three and six month follow-up assessments (repeated measures analysis). The results were given for condom use with any partner, a primary partner and a non-primary partner. In general the percentages were statistically significantly higher for young women receiving the self-help intervention than the percentages for those who received the usual care comparator. The exception was the outcome of condom use with a non-primary partner where percentages were similar, with no statistically significant difference. The percentage of sexually active women varied according to the assessment time-point and the type of partner.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Shain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shain 1999</LINK> reported results for a composite outcome that reflects unsafe sexual behaviour. Unsafe sex was defined as never using condoms with at least one partner in the past three months or both five or more unprotected sex acts in the past three months and incorrect or problematic condom use. The percentages of participants that practised unsafe sex during 12 months from baseline to follow up according to this definition was lower in the behavioural-cognitive intervention group compared to the nurse practitioner-led counselling group (P &lt; 0.001).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sexual partners</HEADING>
<P>Four comparison 1 trials reported data on young women's sexual partnerships (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>) following behavioural intervention.</P>
<P>In only one of these trials was a statistically significant effect reported. <LINK REF="STD-Shain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shain 1999</LINK> reported two composite partner outcomes, reflecting whether participants had multiple partners and rapid partner turnover. The outcome for multiple partners was expressed as the proportion of young women who were not mutually monogamous. A mutually monogamous participant was defined as having the same, steady, faithful partner (or no sex partner) during the past six months. The percentage of young women who were not mutually monogamous during the period from baseline to 12 months follow-up was significantly lower in the behavioural-cognitive intervention group than the nurse practitioner group (P = 0.008). The outcome for partner turnover defined participants as having rapid partner turnover if they had had a new sex partner, within three months of another sex partner, during the previous six months. The percentage of young women who reported rapid partner turnover during the period from baseline to 12 months follow-up was lower for the behavioural-cognitive intervention intervention group compared to the nurse practitioner group, though the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK> reported the mean number of sex partners at the two month follow-up assessment. There was a reduction in the number of partners from baseline, with a similar mean number of partners at follow-up in the Intervention-Motivation-Behavioural skills group (IMB) and the information-only comparator group (INFO)<I> </I>(no statistical test was reported for this comparison). This trial also reported the percentage of young women with a decrease in the number of sexual partners from baseline to two month follow-up. The percentage was highest in the Intervention-Motivation-Behavioural skills group (IMB), though this was not statistically significant (P = 0.33). Although not explicitly stated, these data may have excluded the sub-group of up to 20% randomised participants who became sexually abstinent between baseline and two month follow-up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005</LINK> reported the mean number of sexual partners in the past three months at the 12 month follow-up assessment. For both of the active intervention groups there was a reduction in the number of partners from baseline. The lowest number of partners at follow-up was reported by the skills-based HIV/STD risk reduction intervention compared to the information-based HIV/STD risk reduction intervention, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.17). The trial also presented the mean percentage of young women reporting multiple partners in the past three months at the 12 month follow-up assessment. In common with the mean number of sexual partners reported above, there was a reduction in the percentage reporting multiple (two or more) partners from baseline in the active comparator groups. Again, at follow-up the lowest percentage was reported for the skills-based HIV/STD risk reduction intervention though this was not statistically significant (P = 0.20).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001</LINK> reported the percentage of participants who were with a main partner at the time of a follow-up assessment and also the percentage who had been with another partner in the previous six months.

Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK> reported the percentage of young women with condom use during last vaginal sex at the 12 month follow-up assessment.

<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003</LINK> condom use during last sex episode increased from baseline in both the HIV prevention programme and its comparator, the healthy living parenting programme.

The percentage of protected acts was higher amongst those who received the female condom skills training intervention compared to those who received the general health promotion comparator intervention, though the difference was only statistically significant for the 'protected by any condom' outcome (P = 0.028). <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK> reported the mean number of unprotected vaginal sex episodes in the past 30 days or six months, both at the 12 month follow-up assessment. The mean number of episodes was statistically significantly lower for the HIV prevention intervention group relative to the general health promotion comparator group for both the preceding 30 days (adjusted MD -1.06, 95% CI -1.86 to 0.44, P = 0.002) and the preceding six months (Adjusted MD -5.51, 95% CI -11.18 to -0.34, P = 0.02).</P>
<P>No statistically significant effects were reported by the other two trials. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003</LINK>, the mean number of unprotected sex episodes in the past three months at the 12 months follow-up assessment was slightly higher for the HIV prevention programme relative to the healthy living parenting comparator programme. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.634). Those abstinent over the past three months were assigned a zero score, though the number of abstainers was not reported.</P>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Morrison_x002d_Beedy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison-Beedy 2005</LINK> the frequency of vaginal sex with a condom in the past three months measured at the three month follow-up assessment increased from baseline in both the HIV risk reduction group and the health promotion comparator group. The increase was greater for the comparison group, although the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.50). The frequency of vaginal sex without condom in the past three months measured at the three month follow-up assessment decreased from baseline in both the HIV risk reduction group and the health promotion comparator group, with the lowest frequency reported in the HIV risk reduction group. Again, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.38).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-19 17:03:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The results of this systematic review of the effectiveness of behavioural interventions are mixed. Statistically significant effects for behavioural outcomes were common, though not universal, varying according to different types of outcome. There were few statistically significant effects for biological (STI) outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Behavioural outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Condom use was the most widely reported behavioural outcome measure and was assessed in a variety of ways. Many of the trials reported statistically significant differences favouring the behavioural intervention, notably on measures such as decreasing the number of episodes of unprotected sex/increasing the number of episodes of protected sex (nine out of 12 trials that measured this) and on a variety of outcomes classified as &#8216;other&#8217; measures of condom use (e.g. the proportion using condoms over a given period; the mean number of days of sex without a condom, etc) (nine out of 11 trials).</P>
<P>Comparatively fewer significant effects were reported for consistent condom use/increasing the frequency of use (three out of 11 trials) or reported use of condoms during most recent intercourse (three out of nine trials). It could be suggested that consistent condom use, particularly with multiple casual partners, is an important goal in terms of reducing the likelihood of STI transmission. However, it may not be a realistic strategy for young women in established relationships where, for intimacy, couples may prefer to use other methods of contraception. This was noted by <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK> in which 53% of participants were in committed relationships at the start of the trial and were not using condoms. The authors commented that initiating condom use in an established relationship can be interpreted as questioning commitment and interpersonal trust and speculated that this may explain the lack of statistically significant differences between groups in their trial. This underlines the need for evaluators to choose outcome measures that are appropriate to the relationship status of their particular sample.</P>
<P>Young women who received the behavioural intervention reported fewer sexual partners at follow-up (four out of 10 trials), though statistically significant differences were more common in trials comparing behavioural intervention(s) to a general health promotion/attention control groups (comparison 2) (although more trials in this comparison than other comparisons reported this outcome). Even fewer trials reported changes in sexual activity, such as how many young women engaged in sex or reduced their number of sexual episodes or became sexually abstinent. In all of these trials the differences between groups favoured the behavioural intervention (i.e. more young women reduced their sexual activity), though differences were statistically significant in only one out of the eight trials that measured this (see <LINK TAG="AGREEMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Biological outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Fewer trials reported occurrence of STIs as an outcome measure and where this was assessed the effects of the interventions were less favourable than they were for behavioural outcomes. Where individual STIs were reported the only statistically significant effects were for chlamydia (three out of five trials), with none for gonorrhoea or trichomoniasis. None of the trials explicitly reported measuring HPV as a single outcome measure, which would have given a stronger indication of the potential of behavioural interventions to prevent cervical cancer. Ten trials trials reported composite outcomes in which the proportion of young women testing positive for one or more STIs were reported. These trials ranged from those with one or more specified STIs were reported (e.g. chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis), to those in which a positive diagnosis of any STI was recorded. Only three of these trials reported a statistically significant difference between trial groups.</P>
<P>A possible explanation for the lack of effects is that the trials were not adequately powered, in terms of sample size, to detect a statistically significant effect on STI outcomes. As mentioned above (<LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>), only eight of the 23 trials included in this review reported a sample size calculation and in only six of these was the sample size calculation performed for the primary outcome. Only two of these trials featured STIs as their primary outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Boyer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK>). The majority of trials measuring STI outcomes in this review therefore did so as a secondary measure with no reported sample size calculation. It is likely that these trials were not adequately powered to detect significant effects, particularly as incidence of some STIs may be relatively low. Trials of rare events generally require larger sample sizes in order to be able to show statistically significant effects. This phenomenon was noted by one of the trials included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>) which commented that in the analysis of the nine STIs measured, only one had sufficient statistical power to detect a difference (self-reported chlamydia, which is, in general, one of the most common STIs). All other STIs had less than 20% power and therefore they did not report results for them as individual measures, instead combining them as a composite outcome (see below). They also commented that clinically confirmed chlamydia, which was not statistically significant, was underpowered (only 12% power at alpha = 0.05).</P>
<P>Only one trial explicitly included genital warts within a composite STI outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>) and it reported a statistically significant effect for the behavioural intervention (interactive video) relative to its comparators (content-matched control group and topic-matched control group) at the six month follow-up assessment. However, genital warts were only one of nine STIs included within the composite measure, so out of those reporting an STI it is not possible to delineate how many were HPV/genital wart infections. Furthermore, this trial was judged unclear on four out of five risk of bias domains, casting further uncertainty over its results (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparators</HEADING>
<P>The differences between trial groups generally favoured the behavioural interventions relative to their comparators. However, there were a handful of occasions when the differences favoured the comparators, such as <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK> where the mean number of vaginal sex acts with a condom was lower for the 'Intervention-Motivation-Behavioural' skills group compared to the 'Information-Only' comparator group. Similarly in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003</LINK> the mean number of unprotected sex episodes in the past three months at the 12 months follow-up assessment was slightly higher for the HIV prevention programme relative to the healthy living parenting comparator programme. In <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK> gonorrhoea incidence was slightly higher amongst young women receiving the HIV prevention intervention relative to the general health promotion group. However, in all of these cases the differences were not statistically significant. Therefore, it is unlikely that behavioural interventions are associated with undesirable effects.</P>
<P>Due to the diversity of comparators used by the trials included in this review we classified trials into four separate groups based on the type of comparison being made. Many of the trials hypothesised that providing a more enhanced intervention that supplemented information provision on STIs with an element of skills development for safer sex and (in a handful of trials) other activities (e.g. provision of free condoms) would result in more favourable changes in behavioural, biological and other outcomes than standard service provision (comparison 1 trials). The general trend was for the behavioural interventions to be more effective than their more basic/standard practice comparators (notwithstanding the variability discussed above in statistically significant effects across different outcomes). This suggests that the addition of skills development activities to the provision of information enables young women to put their knowledge and skills into practice, thus facilitating behaviours that reduce their likelihood of acquiring STIs (though note we did not extract results for knowledge and skills outcomes in this review).</P>
<P>The results also suggest that, in general, providing a behavioural intervention that supplemented information provision on STIs with an element of skills development for safer sex resulted in more favourable changes in outcomes compared to provision of general health promotion that does not specifically cover sexual health issues (comparison 2 trials) (as above, with caveats about variability in statistically significant effects according to different outcome measures). The results of comparing skills and information behavioural interventions with similar interventions delivered by a different provider/medium (comparison 3 trials) or with no-intervention control groups (comparison 4 trials) showed fewer significant differences, though there were fewer such trials making these comparisons and statistical comparisons were not always reported.</P>
<P>It could be expected that the effects of behavioural interventions compared to general health promotion (comparison 2 trials) and to a no-intervention control (comparison 4 trials) would be more pronounced than comparisons between behavioural interventions and their more basic/standard practice comparators (comparison 1 trials). The reason for this is that in the latter category of trials the comparison group are likely to benefit somewhat from the standard information provision on STIs, whereas in the former categories the comparison groups will have not received any STI relevant content and therefore the difference in outcomes between trials groups potentially could be wider. A handful of trials in our review included multiple trial groups permitting such comparisons to be made.</P>
<P>For example, <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK> compared an &#8216;Information-Motivation-Behavioural skills (IMB)&#8217; with motivational enhancement intervention to a<B> </B>more basic version which provided only information and also to a waiting list control group. The proportion of young women with a decrease in sexual partners from baseline to the two month follow-up was highest in the IMB group, followed by the information only group and then the control group (though only the comparison between IMB and the control group was statistically significant). <B> </B>Likewise, the mean number of sexual partners at the follow-up was lowest in the IMB group, followed by the information only group and then the waiting list control group<B> </B>(though no statistical comparisons were reported).<B> </B>
</P>
<P>A similar pattern was evident in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005</LINK>, in which a safer sex skills and information behavioural intervention was compared against an STI information only intervention and to a group receiving a general health promotion information and skills development intervention. The mean number of sexual partners at the 12 month follow-up was lowest in the safer sex skills and information intervention, followed by the information group and then the general health promotion group (only the comparison between the safer sex skills and information intervention and the general health promotion group was statistically significant). The same pattern was observed at the 12 month follow-up assessment for the percentage of young women reporting multiple sexual partners, the mean number of days of sex without a condom in the past three months and the percentage testing positive for chlamydia, gonorrhoea and/or trichomoniasis<B> </B>(i.e. lowest in the<B> </B>safer sex skills and information intervention and highest in the general health promotion group).</P>
<P>The results of these two trials therefore suggest that the more comprehensive the behavioural intervention, in terms of supplementing information provision with motivation and skills building specific to STIs and sexual health, the greater the benefit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Duration of effects</HEADING>
<P>The length of follow-up for outcome assessment employed in the trials varied from up to one month post-intervention to around two years. The most common length of follow-up was 6 to 12 months. The length of follow-up could be considered to be relatively short considering that behaviour change requires adequate time to become routine. On the other hand some behaviour change may not necessarily be sustained over time, with rates of condom use and other risk reduction behaviours returning to their baseline levels. This is not uncommon in evaluations of health promotion interventions where, in the absence of booster sessions, changes in health-related behaviour are not always maintained. Longer follow-up assessments would provide a stronger indication about the potential of behavioural interventions to encourage lasting safer sexual behaviours as young women progress into adulthood and to reduce the likelihood of morbidity and mortality associated with cervical cancer in later years.</P>
<P>Many of the trials included in this review<I> </I>measured outcomes at one or more interim time points, facilitating analysis of the duration of effects over time (interim and final results are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> to <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). In the majority of these trials the final follow-up assessment was 12 months, providing some consistency to this analysis. A mixed pattern is evident, with some trials showing an increase in the adoption of safer sexual behaviours/a decrease in STIs between end of the -intervention and final outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Shain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shain 1999</LINK>) and other trials showing an attenuation of effects between an initial post-intervention improvement and the final outcome measurement (<LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003</LINK>). In some trials there was improvement over time in some outcomes, but deterioration over time for others (<LINK REF="STD-Choi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001</LINK>). It is not clear why there was such variability in the duration of effects. Differences between the trials in the characteristics of the young women (e.g. age, sexual experience, relationship status) and the characteristics of the intervention (e.g. duration, contact time, content) are possible explanations. <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005</LINK> offer an explanation for the delayed effects observed in their trial, suggesting that some people have difficulty introducing safer-sex practices into existing relationships. <LINK REF="STD-Shrier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shrier 2001</LINK> provided booster sessions at one, three and six months following the initial intervention session, in accordance with the theoretical concepts of the Transtheoretical Model, in which individuals move through a number of stages of behaviour change over time. The occurrence of these booster sessions may have facilitated the favourable changes observed in some of the behavioural outcomes over time.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Generalisaibility and replicability</HEADING>
<P>When generalising the results of this systematic review to other settings it is important to consider the heterogeneous characteristics of the behavioural interventions and populations studied.  </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention characteristics</HEADING>
<P>The behavioural interventions most commonly provided factual information about sexual and reproductive health (including STIs) plus the development of assertiveness and negotiation skills (e.g. to engage in safer practices), unsafe sex refusal skills and correct condom use skills, via discussion, role playing and cognitive rehearsal.  A handful of trials supplemented this with provision of resources, such as vouchers redeemable for sexual health screening and treatment services. Behavioural interventions relying only on information provision were in a minority.</P>
<P>There was variability in the duration and intensity (in terms of contact time) of the interventions. Some were brief one-session interventions lasting less than a day, whilst others were spread out over weeks or months (though none longer than a year). Some interventions were intended to be brief so as to be practical to deliver in routine practice, such as the information and skills motivation intervention evaluated by <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK> which was provided in a university health and behaviour centre. The results of the trials included in this review may not be generalisable to longer-term sexual health projects and services.</P>
<P>In terms of setting, the majority of the interventions were delivered in health care clinics, notably sexual health/STI and family planning clinics. There were fewer trials in community settings or in schools and colleges. Studies of behavioural interventions to prevent STIs and prevent pregnancy in mixed sex schools appear to be more common (<LINK REF="REF-Owen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2010;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 2010</LINK>), possibly reflecting the predominance of such schools compared to single sex schools.</P>
<P>It is important to acknowledge that this review is restricted to interventions which are solely aimed at young women and it may not necessarily encompass the full range of interventions that young women may be exposed to. For example, the review does not include trials of mixed sex groups (e.g. school/college or community settings, as above) or interventions including young women and their male partners or young women and family members (e.g. their mothers). It should therefore be acknowledged that there is a wider evidence base for the effectiveness of preventing STIs/cervical cancer in young women. There do not appear to have been any published systematic reviews of such interventions, therefore this may be an appropriate area for future evidence synthesis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Topic focus</HEADING>
<P>Although the focus of this systematic review is the prevention of HPV and cervical cancer, the included trials were primarily concerned with prevention of HIV and other STIs and also, in some cases, pregnancy prevention. Few trials made explicit reference to HPV or to the long-term consequences of STIs such as cervical cancer or even pelvic inflammatory disease. The interventions in this review encourage safer sexual behaviours such as condom use and partner reduction, which can lower the risk of acquiring STIs and therefore potentially afford some protection against cervical cancer. However, there appears to be a gap in the evidence base for RCTs of behavioural interventions integrating messages about STIs and their longer-term sequale, particularly cervical cancer. Options for cervical cancer prevention include the HPV vaccine for teenage girls and screening programmes for women in their twenties upwards. Nonetheless, primary behavioural interventions for cervical cancer, addressing HPV and other risk factors such as co-infection with chlamydia/herpes simplex virus, smoking and alcohol are warranted (<LINK REF="REF-Moscicki-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moscicki 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Age</HEADING>
<P>Although the focus of this systematic review was young women up to the age of 25 years it cannot be assumed that females in this age group are homogenous in terms of their sexual maturity, sexual experience, relationship status and sexual health needs. Some interventions were specifically designed to meet the needs of younger teenagers, whilst others were geared towards women in their mid to late teens or early twenties. For example, in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>, the community-based intervention aimed to delay onset of sexual activity (though it did encourage condom use for those who were already sexually active) to prevent pregnancy and STIs amongst a population (age range 12 to 16 years, mean age of 13 years) most of whom were sexually inactive. In contrast, in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK>, the intervention was designed for sexually active non-monogamous women aged between 18 and 24 years (mean age 21) who had attended health care clinics and who were considered to be at risk for STI infection. The intervention, which focused primarily on the promotion of condoms, was tailored to the women's individual needs taking into account the number and types of sexual partner (primary or non-primary), ethnicity, use of alcohol, STI history and oral contraceptive use. The effects of the behavioural interventions included in this systematic review may not, therefore, be generalisable to all age groups under 25 years.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pregnancy and motherhood</HEADING>
<P>Three of the trials included in this systematic review specifically included young women who were pregnant and/or teenage mothers (<LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994</LINK>). The rationale for these interventions was that pregnancy is a potentially effective time for STI education given that these young women are likely to have put themselves at risk for STIs and will be receiving increased contact with health services. It is also a time of change for young women in which they may re-evaluate their sexual and reproductive health. All three of the trials provided education and skills development for the prevention of STIs, though in slightly differing contexts. The intervention evaluated by <LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009</LINK> integrated HIV/STI information and safer sex skills development within an antenatal care programme, delivered by a midwife/obstetrician in obstetric clinics. The aim was to encourage young women (mean age around 20 years) to reduce sexual risk behaviour during and following pregnancy to prevent STIs and repeat pregnancies. Most of the young women were African-American and it was implied that they were on low incomes. <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 2003</LINK> included pregnant females as well as young mothers in their trial, who were predominantly Latina, from poor backgrounds and attending schools running pregnant minors or young parents' programmes. The emphasis was on encouraging the young women to take more responsibility for their sexual health within the context of motherhood. The focus of the community-based trial of teenage mothers (mean age around 18 years) by <LINK REF="STD-Maynard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Maynard 1994</LINK> was broader, covering the prevention of repeat pregnancies, education for prevention of STIs, plus parenting and general life skills. The young women were predominantly African-American or Hispanic and mostly reliant on welfare services. It is important, therefore, to acknowledge that the effects of these trials are not generalisable to young women who are not pregnant/who don't have children. They may be most relevant to pregnant teenagers/teenage mothers from ethnic minorities, living in the US and with low socio-economic status.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Country</HEADING>
<P>The overwhelming majority of trials included in this systematic review were conducted in the US, limiting the applicability of the evidence to other countries. This is not surprising given the strong tradition of experimental evaluation in health and the social sciences in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Oakley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oakley 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oakley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oakley 2000</LINK>) and the fact that other systematic reviews of sexual health promotion or health promotion in general have also noted a strong preponderance of US studies (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kavanagh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavanagh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rees-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 2010</LINK>). The effects of the interventions in this systematic review may not necessarily be generalisable to other countries, either in the developed or developing world. The effects may not even necessarily be generalisable to all locations/populations within the US. For example, some studies evaluated interventions that were culturally specific to African-Americans or Latinas residing in inner-city locations, classified as being socially and economically disadvantaged. Replications of these interventions in other locations should include pilot research to assess socio-cultural and socio-economic applicability (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Exemplar trials</HEADING>
<P>As reported earlier (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>) there were three trials included in this review that were considered to be at least risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kershaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kershaw 2009</LINK>). Greater confidence can be placed in their results as they are less likely to be biased due to confounding factors. The trials by <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK> in particular demonstrated a number of favourable effects for behavioural outcomes and certain biological outcomes (chlamydia) up to 12 months. They can be considered exemplar trials that policy makers and practitioners may chose to adapt and replicate in their own localities. The key features common to both trials, which should be taken into account in any replications, included: being implemented in the United States, targeting sexually active young African-American women (between approximately 14 and 21 years old) of low socio-economic status, who reported sexual risk behaviour and were attending sexual health clinics/family medicine clinic in urban areas. African American women health educators delivered the interventions in both trials (and assisted by peer educators in <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK>). The interventions comprised consecutive weekly small group sessions (e.g. eight to 12 participants) lasting four hours (on four occasions in <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK> and in two in <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK> trial young women also received four 15 minute follow-up phone calls spread over a nine month period.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cultural relevance</HEADING>
<P>The interventions were designed to be culturally relevant to African-American young women. The interventions also emphasised ethnic pride and addressed hygenic practices commonly performed by this group such as vaginal douching (which is associated with increased risk for STIs, PID and cervical cancer) (<LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK>). Both interventions provided information about the transmission and prevention of STIs and facilitated sexual communication and negotiation skills development through interactive methods such as role plays. <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK> also attempted to address structural factors (e.g. lack of access to health services) by providing the women with $20 vouchers to give to their male partners to redeem at sexual health clinics. This component may not necessarily be relevant to all health systems, particularly those which are free at the point of care (e.g. The UK National Health Service). However, facilitating the greater uptake of sexual health services is a relevant goal for most health care systems, particularly given the greater emphasis given to testing for undiagnosed STIs in recent times.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Behavioural aims</HEADING>
<P>In terms of behavioural aims <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK> promoted a variety of risk reduction messages including the importance of effective communication with partners to ensure safer sexual behaviours in general, plus the importance of consistent condom use (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The intervention also encouraged reduction of sexual partners, abstinence from sex and prevention of pregnancy. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK> focused mainly on the effective use of condoms and persuasive communication from young women to their male partners to take more responsibility for condom use. Uptake of STI screening and treatment services was also a distinctive feature. There did not appear to be any encouragement for sexual abstinence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Temporal relevance</HEADING>
<P>The intervention evaluated by <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK> was carried out in the mid to late 1990s, whilst the intervention by <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK> is more recent (conducted between 2002 and 2004). However, both interventions, particularly <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK>, may not necessarily be reflective of current practice given the time that has elapsed since they were evaluated. Neither of the trials provided an indication of the costs of mounting the interventions, other than nominal incentives provided (e.g. $20 vouchers to give to their male partners to redeem at clinics for sexual health services <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK>) or reimbursements ($25 for travel and child care to attend intervention sessions and complete assessments <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In summary, the results of the exemplar trials by <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2009</LINK> are mainly applicable to young African-American women engaging in STI risk behaviour, who were attending sexual health clinics. The interventions featured information on STIs, skills development for effective partner communication and negotiation of consistent condom use, delivered by African-American peer and other educators in a small group format over a two to four week period, with follow-up phone calls over a nine month period. The interventions were designed to be culturally and gender relevant.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-01-19 17:18:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>A total of 23 studies were included in this systematic review and all were RCTs. The quality of the evidence appears to be variable and for some outcomes there is inconsistency in the results given. As discussed, sample size calculations were reported in only a minority of the trials, meaning that trials may not have been adequately powered to show a statistically significant effect. In many cases the risk of bias of the included trials could only be judged to be unclear due to ambiguities and omissions in the reporting of the methodological details in the trial publications (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>). For example, it was common for trials not to report the level of attrition for each randomised trial group and the reasons for such losses. Procedures for handling missing data such as intention to treat analyses were not always reported or reported ambiguously, preventing us from judging whether they were adequate. It is unfortunate that significant limitations in the reporting of methodological details remain, despite initiative such as the CONSORT (consolidated standards of reporting trials) statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of specific risk of bias domains, the method of random sequence generation was judged to be adequate in only just under half of the trials. In the remaining trials the method was either not reported at all or not fully reported. Moreover, the vast majority of trials failed to give any information on whether and how the random allocation process was concealed from personnel involved in the conduct of the trial. Given the potential for selection bias arising from inadequate randomisation and allocation concealment this should be recognised as a major uncertainty in this evidence base (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent meta-epidemiological study found that average bias is stronger in trials with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment that measure subjective outcomes than those that measure objective outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). In such trials the effect sizes tend to be exaggerated. The study also found that average bias is stronger in trials with inadequate or unclear blinding that measure subjective outcomes compared to those with objective outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). This remained the case when allocation concealment was judged to be adequate. As discussed earlier (see <LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>) it is usually not feasible to blind participants or intervention providers in health promotion evaluations to which study group they have been allocated. However, it is more feasible to conceal study group assignment to some outcome assessors. Only just over a quarter of the trials in our review reported that outcome assessors (e.g. interviewers or other data collectors) were unaware of the identity of the intervention groups. The preponderance of self-reported (subjective) outcome measures used in the trials included in this review, plus the lack of reporting of outcome assessor blinding and the fact that in a large number of trials it was unclear whether allocation to trial groups had been concealed, adds further uncertainty to the effects observed. A conservative assumption is that the effects on behavioural and biological outcomes may have been over-estimated.</P>
<P>Some of the trials in this review attempted to minimise biases associated with self-reported outcomes. Disclosure of sensitive personal information such as sexual behaviour may be subject to social desirability bias, whereby individuals may tend to over-report behaviours they perceive to be socially acceptable (e.g. that they have had fewer numbers of sexual partners). Methods used by studies to address such bias included using coded rather than named data records (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jaworski-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jaworski 2001</LINK>), a computer administered self interview (suggested to increase privacy, recall and limit social desirability bias) (<LINK REF="STD-Roye-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roye 2007</LINK>); and use of a published social-desirability scoring system extensively used with adolescents, in which the scores were unrelated to self-reported sexual behavior in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2005</LINK>). The potential for recall bias was also addressed by <LINK REF="STD-DiClemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiClemente 2004</LINK> who asked participants to report their behaviours over relatively brief time intervals, giving them calendars specifying the reporting intervals.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-01-19 15:23:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The strenghts of this review include: a comprehensive search of bibliographic electronic bibliographic databases; screening of titles and abstracts independently by more than one person to ensure the application of inclusion criteria was reliable; and systematic and detailed trial data extraction to enable the generalisability and replicability of the included interventions to be judged. In terms of study design we restricted inclusion to RCTs as these are generally accepted as providing evidence of effectiveness that is subject to the least risk of bias.</P>
<P>This review is subject to certain limitations however. First, we only included studies published in the English language, raising the possibility of publication bias. However, all of the non-English language references screened on title and abstract (all of the abstracts were in English) did not meet the review's criteria.</P>
<P>A second limitation is that this review did not report non-behavioural or biological outcomes such as changes in knowledge, self-efficacy, attitudes and intentions. These are considered as mediators of health-related behaviour and were reported by many of the included trials. Although changes in health-related behaviour and biological outcomes (such as infection rates) are generally considered to be more indicative of the potential of an intervention to benefit health, positive changes in mediating outcomes are nonetheless meaningful to many stakeholders, including health promotion practitioners.</P>
<P>Finally, we decided it would not be appropriate to conduct a meta-analysis of the included trials, due to wide variability in the types of intervention and outcome measure. Whilst a meta-analysis has advantages in terms of providing a pooled quantitative effect estimate and greater precision to detect a statistically significant effect, it may not be meaningful in reviews such as this where heterogeneity is present. Consequently the synthesis is soley narrative, with effects generally presented for each trial in terms of whether or not there were statistically significant differences between randomised groups. However, it can be misleading to summarise effects in terms of how many trials reported statistically significant differences. As discussed, some trials may not be sufficiently powered to detect a statistically significant effect and some do not report significance tests at all. In such trials the statistical significance of the results are uncertain and where this was the case we have advised caution to the reader in the results section of this review.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-03-11 13:35:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>To our knowledge there are no other similar published systematic reviews assessing the effectiveness of behavioural interventions targeted specifically at young women to prevent HPV/cervical cancer. However, we did identify a systematic review from our literature searches assessing the effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions in adolescent girls (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison_x002d_Beedy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison-Beedy 2004</LINK>). That systematic review was restricted to RCT study designs, females aged 19 years and under and sexual behaviour/biological outcomes. Six RCTs were included, of which four were also included in our systematic review. The authors concluded that most studies have been effective in terms of encouraging sexual risk reduction behaviours, to varying degrees. Clinically relevant components of effective interventions included the combination of information provision, behavioural skills training and motivation enhancement for behaviour change. The use of theory to guide intervention development was also noted to be crucial.</P>
<P>As discussed above (see <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>), systematic reviews of similar behavioural interventions in mixed sex groups of young people have been published. All of these reviews have been conducted within the context of preventing HIV/STIs and pregnancy, rather than cervical cancer. The results of these reviews varied but generally show that the interventions can encourage safer sexual behaviours amongst young people.</P>
<P>Our own recent HTA systematic review of school-based education plus skills development behavioural interventions had mixed findings (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 2010</LINK>). Fifteen RCTs were included, the majority of which were conducted in the USA and of these 12 were judged to be methodologically sound enough to support conclusions and recommendations. Statistically significant effects were common for outcomes such as increased knowledge and increased self-efficacy, but were scarce for sexual behavioural outcomes. With the exception of one study of an all male population, all of the trials included in that review comprised males and females. Some trials reported outcomes separately by gender which, for the purposes of the current systematic review, provides an indication of the impact of the interventions on young women. For example, the RIPPLE trial of peer-led sex education conducted in English schools (<LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 2004</LINK>) found no statistically significant difference between the peer-led intervention and control group females in the estimated cumulative proportion reporting unprotected first heterosexual intercourse by age 16 (the same was reported for young males). There were also no statistically significant differences between young women receiving the intervention and those receiving the control in the proportion using a condom at first sex or at last sex at the 18 month follow-up. However, young women in the peer-led group were statistically significantly less likely to report having had sex by age 16 years than were those in the control group (no difference was noted for young males). The RCT of school-based sex education conducted in Scotland (the SHARE trial) (<LINK REF="REF-Wight-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wight 2002</LINK>) reported no statistically significant differences between intervention and control on any behavioural outcomes, for young women or young men. These results of these two trials, whilst illustrative, are not necessarily comparable to the results of the trials in this systematic review as the interventions were designed for mixed sex groups and therefore may differ in content and approach to interventions designed exclusively for young women.</P>
<P>A Cochrane review of &#8216;abstinence-plus&#8217; interventions (i.e. promotion of abstinence from sexual activity, but also of condom use and other safer sex practices) included 39 randomised or quasi-randomised trials (Underhill 2008).The mean age of the participants varied between 11 to 19 years and the studies were based in the USA, Canada or the Bahamas. In common with our current systematic review, a meta-analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneous nature of the interventions and lack of appropriate data. Of the 39 trials, 24 reported a significantly protective intervention effect on any sexual risk behaviour or biological outcomes. The number of trials reporting statistically significant results in favour of the intervention varied according to different behavioural outcomes: self-reported frequency of unprotected vaginal sex (6 out of 12 trials); incidence and frequency of all sex (5 out of 21 trials); number of partners (4 out of 13 trials); condom use (14 out of 26 trials); and sexual initiation (4 out of 19 trials). Statistically significant effects on knowledge in favour of the intervention were reported in many studies. It was concluded that many abstinence-plus programmes reduce short and long-term HIV risk behaviour.</P>
<P>The same authors also conducted a systematic review of 'abstinence-only' interventions in high income countries and came to less optimistic conclusions (Underhill 2007). Of the 13 randomised or quasi-randomised trials included, there was no consistent effect on unprotected vaginal intercourse, frequency of vaginal sex, number of partners, sexual initiation or condom use. In our current systematic review there were few trials which aimed to promote abstinence/reduce numbers of partners and in all of these studies this was never the sole aim (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). In some of these studies only a low proportion of young women were sexually active at the start of the study, whilst in others all of them were. Our results and those of Underhill 2007, call into question the efficacy of such an approach. In our review whilst there were some statistically significant effects in terms of reducing the number of sexual partners, there were no statistically significant effects for abstinence outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-01-19 15:23:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The results of this systematic review show that behavioural interventions which aim to promote sexual behaviours protective of STI transmission can encourage condom use for sexual intercourse. However, significant intervention effects were not universal and varied according to different types of behavioural outcome. There was less impact in terms of encouraging consistent condom use, increasing the frequency of use or use of condoms at most recent intercourse. There was some evidence that behavioural interventions can encourage reductions in the number of sexual partners though this outcome was measured by fewer trials and effects were not consistent across trials. Participation in sexual activity, such as how many young women reduced their number of sexual episodes or were sexually abstinent were measured in only a minority of trials and effects were either not statistically significant or statistical comparisons were not reported. There were few statistically significant effects for biological (STI) outcomes, though only around half of the included trials measured such outcomes. HPV was not included in measures of STI and none of the interventions explicitly focused on the long term of sequelae of STI infection, including cervical cancer.</P>
<P>Behavioural interventions addressing STIs, particularly HPV, should be provided (and evaluated - see <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>), where feasible, as one of the key strategies for the prevention of cervical cancer. The exemplar evaluations in our systematic review that were subject to the least risk of bias demonstrated favourable effects for behavioural outcomes and chlamydia up to 12 months. These interventions were designed to be socially and culturally relevant (to African-American young women of low socio-economic status, who reported sexual risk behaviour) and provided information about the transmission and prevention of STIs, as well as facilitating sexual communication and negotiation skills development. They promoted a variety of risk reduction messages including the importance of effective communication with partners to ensure safer sexual behaviours in general, plus the importance of consistent condom use.</P>
<P>Practitioners considering replicating these exemplar interventions should consider applicability to their localities and adapt them as necessary to ensure social, demographic and cultural relevance. Any adaptations should be subjected to monitoring and evaluation to assess relevance and impact.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-19 15:23:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Future evaluations of behavioural interventions to prevent STIs should not just focus on the short term implications of infection, but also the longer-term sequelae. A greater focus on HPV and its link to cervical cancer should be given and the impact of this evaluated particularly in terms of raising awareness of cervical cancer amongst young women. Such interventions could also be mounted in conjunction with HPV vaccination programmes to assess the impact of a two-pronged approach to cervical cancer prevention: vaccination plus encouragement for safer sexual behaviour as and when girls become sexually active (this is particularly important given that the vaccine only protects against around 70% of the oncogenic HPV sub-types). Many of the interventions included in this systematic review were relatively brief in terms of duration, with fewer examples of longer-term initiatives (e.g. beyond six months). It would be useful to assess the impact of longer interventions sustained beyond a year with booster sessions, to help young women to continue to protect themselves as they mature and become sexually active. There was an absence of school-based studies in this review, however the HPV vaccination programme which, in the UK, takes place in secondary schools may offer an opportunity for behavioural interventions to be delivered to girls. Furthermore, given the predominance of US studies in this systematic review evaluations conducted in other countries would be particularly useful.</P>
<P>Outcome measures should be chosen that are appropriate to the age, development and relationship status of young women. For example, condom use may not always be the most appropriate measure of protection against STIs for all young women. Biological outcomes (including HPV) and longer term health outcomes should be measured. Follow-up assessment should be of sufficient length to allow for protective behaviours to be adopted and become routine as girls develop into young women. Follow-up should also ideally be long enough to assess impact on progression to CIN and cervical cancer.</P>
<P>Evaluations should use a multi-centre RCT design where possible and include process evaluation to assess factors such as the implementation of the intervention (to facilitate replication if successful) and the acceptability and appropriateness of the intervention to young women. Studies should include an integrated cost-effectiveness analysis (or at the very least a cost analysis) to provide decision makers with an estimate of the likely cost of mounting effective interventions and benefits such as improved health-related quality of life as a result of avoiding infection.</P>
<P>All evaluation publications should conform to CONSORT guidelines on reporting, to ensure methods and results are transparent to all. This will enable future evidence syntheses to fully assess risk of bias and methodological quality, thus facilitating evidence-based recommendations for policy and practice. Where possible, studies should be designed and reported to allow the differential impact to be assessed according to age, race/ethnicity and socio-economic status. This is particularly important given the policy focus on reducing health inequalities in many countries.</P>
<P>In terms of evidence synthesis there appears to be a knowledge gap for interventions that young women may receive with their male partners or family members. These interventions were beyond the scope of this review but primary studies of this kind were identified in our literature search.</P>

<P>This systematic review was originally published under the title 'Interventions for encouraging sexual lifestyles and behaviours intended to prevent cervical cancer' (see <LINK TAG="OTHER_VERSIONS_REFERENCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other published versions of this review</LINK>).</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria of this update have been changed, as follows.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Restriction to RCTs</HEADING>
<P>The first published edition of this review permitted inclusion of both random and non-random controlled trials, however, for this update it was decided to restrict inclusion to RCTs. This was because a number of RCTs potentially within the scope of the review were available and given the general agreement that they provide the lowest risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Kleijnen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleijnen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1998</LINK>) it was felt that inclusion of non-randomised evidence would only increase the uncertainty regarding study effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Restriction to young women up to the age of 25 years</HEADING>
<P>In the original version of this review the eligible age range was 13 - 64 years. In this update the eligible age was 25 years and under. This threshold was chosen because incidence of HPV is highest in this age group. An accompanying lower threshold (e.g. from 15 to 25 years) was not chosen given the falling age at first sexual intercourse in some countries and the fact that cell changes in the cervix during puberty can support HPV replication, which is associated with later progression to cervical cancer.</P>

Second follow-up conducted on average at 14 months after baseline assessment (median = 12.8 months, range = 6.2 to 31.7 months)</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS: Not stated whether ITT or intervention received. From the results presented it appears that not all of the randomised participants were analysed at post-intervention.</P>
<P>ATTRITION RATE: At second follow-up 686 (64.5%) (intervention group) and 695 (63.4) (control group) completed the trial.</P>
<P>UNIT OF DATA ANALYSIS: Clusters (platoons) randomised, but individuals analysed.</P>
<P>SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION: Assumed within-group cluster correlation was 0.01 based on 25 individuals per cluster to give sample size of 568 per group. Sample size was further increased to 1,000 participants per study group.</P>
<P>EQUIVALENT STUDY GROUPS AT BASELINE: Authors state that there were statistically significant differences between study groups on 4 variables (P = 0.006 to 0.043). Intervention group more likely to be married, to ever had a casual sexual partner, to have used condoms &lt;100% time and to have prior history of N.gonorrhoeae.</P>

<P>LENGTH OF FOLLOW-UP: 6 weeks and 6 months after intervention (all outcomes).</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS: Unclear. Not explicitly stated but sample sizes for outcome assessments (given in Table 3) suggest analysis was based on intervention received (i.e. excluding attrition).</P>
<P>ATTRITION RATE:</P>
<P>Attrition at 6-week and 6-month follow up interviews:</P>
<P>Group 1: Condom promotion group; 6 weeks: 21%; 6 months 27%.</P>

<P>UNIT OF DATA ANALYSIS: Individuals</P>
<P>SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION: No information provided</P>
<P>EQUIVALENT STUDY GROUPS AT BASELINE: The groups were similar in terms of age, ethnicity, % having had intercourse, age at first intercourse, number of sexual partners, % who used condoms all the time and % who used other birth control all the time. The groups thus appear to be equivalent. Authors stated that no differences were found between conditions at pretest. Note however that no socio-economic information was reported.</P>
<P>PROCESS EVALUATION: A process evaluator monitored each experimental programme presentation and noted on a checklist which of 37 (unspecified) points of the programme was mentioned. The authors stated that the condom use intervention was implemented with high accuracy, with each of the 37 critical points delivered in all presentations. In every session all women participated in the condom use practical exercises. No other details of process evaluation were provided.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2011-01-19 14:52:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>DESIGN: Cluster RCT</P>
<P>LENGTH OF FOLLOW-UP: Post-campaign surveys (April-July 2005) were initiated immediately following the campaign period (September 2004 - March 2005).</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS: Primary analysis (using permutation tests) was not stated explicitly as intention to treat but included all randomised units (neighbourhoods). There was evidence of contamination across neighbourhoods (see participants section below) whereas the primary analysis kept the neighbourhoods to their allotted intervention groups. The analysis thus appears to be equivalent to an intention to treat analysis. A secondary, post-hoc, analysis based on logistic regression was carried out to investigate the effect on outcomes of actual exposure to the intervention (data not extracted as not reported by study group).</P>
<P>ATTRITION RATE: Attrition was not reported because pre-campaign and post-campaign outcomes were based on different groups of participants (cross-sectional samples nested within study groups at pre-intervention and post-intervention). Also, this was a cluster RCT and none of the clusters (neighbourhoods) were omitted. Of 16,478 and 12,183 women who appeared eligible at baseline and post-campaign respectively, 3407 and 3003 provided pre-campaign and post-campaign data.</P>
<P>UNIT OF DATA ANALYSIS: Neighbourhoods were the units randomised and also the units analysed statistically (permutation tests conducted on 12 neighbourhoods stratified by 4 regions and two study arms = 144 possible arrangements of groups to conditions).</P>
<P>SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION: Intraclass correlation coefficient assumed to be 0.02 from a pilot study in Denver. For adequate (unspecified) power it was assumed that data from 12 neighbourhoods with 300 women per neighbourhood would be required. It ws also assumed that inclusion of 250 women per neighbourhood would not substantially reduce power (actual sample sizes ranged 229 to 301 per neighbourhood).</P>
<P>EQUIVALENT STUDY GROUPS AT BASELINE: Not reported in the results, but stated that following the baseline survey neighbourhoods were stratified within regions to ensure adequate comparability between campaign and comparison neighbourhoods.</P>
<P>PROCESS EVALUATION: Exposure of participants to the social marketing campaign was assessed and analysed (data not extracted).</P>

<P>DESIGN: Cluster RCT</P>
<P>LENGTH OF FOLLOW-UP: immediate post-intervention (T2) and 6 months post-intervention (T3) (Baseline was T1)</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS: Mentions following the ITI principle for those who declined to answer the question 'ever had sex' at any of the three timepoints (n = 36). These were treated, conservatively, as having had sex. No mention is made regarding ITI for other outcomes.</P>
<P>ATTRITION RATE: Group 1: 23.6%, Group 2: 23.6%, Group 3: 23.3%. It is not possible to work out the n/N for each group as it is not clear how many participants there were in the three study groups prior to attrition. The overall attrition rate was n = 130/553 (23.5%).</P>
<P>UNIT OF DATA ANALYSIS: Not clear whether cluster or individuals, but probably the former. Authors report multilevel analysis which takes into account intra-group clustering effects (the 'group' being each group of around 20 participants within each of the three trial groups). Note that hypothesis 1 was not supported at T2 (i.e. no differences between Groups 1 and 2). Therefore groups 1 and 2 were collapsed into one trial group (a single risk reduction group, irrespective of whether provided by mothers or health educators) and compared with Group 3 in order to answer hypothesis 2.</P>
<P>SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION: Not comment is made on sample size for clusters. Each intervention group contained only one site, therefore is is likely that the study is not adequately powered show a statistically significant difference in outcomes. At each intervention site a convenience sample of participants was taken.</P>
<P>EQUIVALENT STUDY GROUPS AT BASELINE: Intervention sites described as being similar in terms of poor health indicators related to teen birth rates and STIs. Authors mention that groups only differed on sexual activity in the last 6 months (5% Group 1; 4% Group 2 and 12% Group 3) at baseline, based on analyses of variance. Baseline characteristics are presented for the sample as a whole, rather than individual groups, therefore it is not possible to make an independent assessment of comparability. Given the fact that there was only one cluster per randomised study group selection bias maybe likely. Note that participants who refused to answer the question 'ever had sex' were over-represented in Group 3 at baseline and it is stated that non-response interacted with intervention condition to predict some outcomes (though the authors appear to have dealt with this using response group dummy variables).</P>

<P>DATA ANALYSIS: Stated that an intention to treat (ITT) protocol was used in which participants were analysed in their originally assigned trial conditions irrespective of the number of sessions attended. However, this definition of ITT does not explicitly include attrition and no explanation was provided as to how missing data were included in the analysis for outcomes reported at 6 months and 12 months follow up (analyses over the whole 12-month follow up period could account for missing data as they were based on more flexible general estimating equations).</P>

<P>UNIT OF DATA ANALYSIS: Individuals, as randomised.</P>
<P>SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION: Based on previous research which identified approximately 25% consistent condom use, the authors projected a clinically meaningful effect size of a 50% increase in consistent condom use in Group 1. Estimating 20% attrition over the 12-month follow up period and setting the type I error rate at 0.05 for a 2-tailed test with power=0.80 required enrolling 250 participants per study group to detect the specified effect size. For STI incidence, the authors stated that sample size and statistical power were limited for each assessment interval, so STI incidence was determined only for the entire 12 month follow up period.</P>

<P>DESIGN: Multi-centre RCT but data were pooled across centres (no indication of inter-centre variability provided)</P>
<P>LENGTH OF FOLLOW-UP: 1 month (knowledge outcomes only); 3 months (knowledge, self-reported behavioural and STI outcomes); and 6 months (knowledge, self-reported behavioural and STI outcomes and self-administered introital swab for clinical screening for chlamydia acquisition)</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS: Stated that all participants who provided data at the 6-month visit were retained in analysis, whether or not they had missed interim ("booster") sessions. It appears that losses to follow up were not accounted for in the analysis.</P>
<P>ATTRITION RATE: Reported only for the overall population, not by study group. Stated that there was a 14% attrition rate between baseline and the final visit (6 months). Of those that participated in the final visit, 12.4% had missed one interim visit (1 month or 3 months) and 3.9% had missed both interim visits.</P>
<P>UNIT OF DATA ANALYSIS: Individuals.</P>
<P>SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION: Not reported, but stated that this study was designed as a preliminary evaluation with a moderate sample size to determine whether the video intervention warranted further study with a larger sample. It was reported where statistical tests were under-powered (for 8 of 9 self-reported STIs, tests of difference between groups had &lt;20% power and hence were not reported; only a test for self-reported chlamydia had power (not stated) that was considered adequate). For a test of clinically-determined chlamydia power was 12% for alpha=0.05 (results presented with a narrative caveat).</P>
<P>EQUIVALENT STUDY GROUPS AT BASELINE: Stated narratively only that there were no significant differences between the intervention groups in demographic characteristics (age, race, type of school, plans to finish school or age at first intercourse). Also stated that there were no baseline differences between conditions on any of the outcome measures except abstinence, where those in the video condition were more likely to be abstinent than controls, &#967;<SUP>2</SUP>=5.76; P &lt; 0.05.</P>

<B>GROUP 1: Interactive video intervention (n: not reported)</B>
</P>
<P>YEAR STARTED: Not reported (wording in Acknowledgements section suggests work was done prior to 2000).</P>
<P>PROVIDER(S): Not reported. The interventions were of a self-study type, with content delivered by video or brochures and were designed for "stand alone" use in (unspecified) healthcare settings.</P>
<P>SETTING(S): Primary care sites (unspecified).</P>
<P>TYPE: Information/education on STIs, STI sexual risk reduction and reproductive health, delivered by an interactive video developed for the intervention. Provided in four sections: "sexual situations", "risk-reduction", "sexual health" "STDs". Also practical skills development: "Users perform cognitive rehearsal imagining what they would say or do, then practice it in their heads" (cognitive rehearsal).</P>
<P>DURATION: Not precisely reported. Video duration was 1 hour, with still material on STIs also provided. However, viewers did not typically watch the entire intervention (the interactive nature of the video allowed guiding viewers to the portions they selected). The interventiion was administered at baseline, with booster sessions at 1, 3 and 6 months. At baseline participants spent 30 min restricted to the first 2 intervention sections. At each follow up (=booster session; 1, 3 and 6 months), participants spent "at least 15 mins with access to all sections to their intervention".</P>
<P>THEORETICAL BASIS: Theoretically grounded in behavioural decision research. Based on the "mental models" approach, which identifies context-specific aspects of behaviour that are most relevant to the decisions of the target population in relation to the intervention. The intervention also included some cognitive rehearsal (Bandura) by encouraging participants to stop and think before continuing with the video.</P>

<P>SETTING(S): Not explicitly stated but appears to be a university health and behaviour centre.</P>
<P>TYPE: Small-group intervention with approximately 8 participants per group in which sexual risk reduction was normative and supported and the threat of STIs and promotion of behaviour change was personalised. Comprised information/education about STI transmission, consequences, prevention and treatment. Also included practical skills development, based on sexual communication role playing, with a focus on assertiveness skills. Facilitators followed detailed manuals to protect against facilitator drift and contamination of intervention components.</P>
<P>DURATION: One session lasting 150 minutes conducted 1 week after the baseline survey. The session was divided into six consecutive segments, of duration 10, 30, 20, 45, 15 and 30 minutes, for each of which a detailed description is provided (information not extracted).</P>
<P>THEORETICAL BASIS: Based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioural skills model (IMB) strengthened with a motivational enhancement approach to personalise the threat of STIs and promote behaviour change.</P>
<P>STIs COVERED: STIs in general.</P>
<P>

<P>DATA ANALYSIS: Based on intention to treat, using a random-effects regression approach that allows missing data to be included in the analysis. However, it was not explained how the missing data were analysed. Stated that analyses were not statistically different on primary outcomes by study site (all P &gt; 0.05) and all analyses were therefore combined across the two study sites.

<B>GROUP 1: Group prenatal care with an integrated HIV component (Centering Pregnancy Plus) (</B>n = <B>318)</B>
</P>
<P>YEAR STARTED: September 2001 to December 2004</P>
<P>PROVIDER(S): A trained practitioner (e.g. midwife or obstetrician) (unclear whether one or more).</P>
<P>SETTINGS: Two widely separated (Georgia &amp; Connecticut, USA) public obstetrics clinics in university-affiliated hospitals.</P>
<P>TYPE: 10 structured group sessions, each with 8 to 12 women (on average 8), providing antenatal support during pregnancy. In each of sessions 4, 5 and 7 some content was devoted to practical skills development (HIV prevention skills): Session 4 included participants viewing testimonials of adolescents with HIV to reinforce risk perception; group discussion of the pros and cons of condom use; and goal setting for appropriate sexual behaviour. Session 5 developed partner communication skills through role play and modelling. Session 7 reinforced these skills and revisited behaviour goals.</P>
<P>DURATION: 10 sessions, each of 120 minutes (total intervention time 20 hours across the pregnancy; session spacing not reported). The time devoted to HIV prevention skills was 40 minutes in each of sessions 4, 5 and 7 (total HIV-related time 2 hours). The intervention was delivered during weeks 16 to 40 of gestation.</P>
<P>THEORETICAL BASIS: The HIV prevention components were based on Social Cognitive Theory and the Ecological Model, adapted from previous interventions.</P>
<P>STIs COVERED: HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhoea (focus appears to be on HIV but chlamydia and gonorrhoea were reported as biological outcomes).</P>

<P>DESIGN: Two-centre RCT</P>
<P>LENGTH OF FOLLOW-UP: 24 months (also 6, 12 and 18 months but data not reported).</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS: Stated that all comparisons among the primary outcomes were made according to the intention to treat principle (no definition of intention to treat was provided). Different methods for analysing missing data were evaluated for applicability, but not whether any were actually used.</P>
<P>ATTRITION RATE: Completed 24 month follow up: Group 1=166/272 (61%); Group 2=180/270 (67%).</P>
<P>UNIT OF DATA ANALYSIS: Individuals (as randomised).</P>
<P>SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION: Based on 3 assumptions: that the baseline event rate for either an unintended pregnancy or an incident STI was at least 30% over 12 months in the high-risk sample; the intervention would reduce these to 15% or less; and the attrition rate would be 25% over 2 years. Approximately 250 participants would need to be enrolled in each arm to detect a 2-fold change in dual method use from approximately 15% to 30% (intervention RR=2.0) or a 50% difference in incidence of an STI or unintended pregnancy (intervention RR=0.5), with 90% power and type I error rate 2.5%.</P>
<P>The authors stated that despite using an <I>a priori</I> sample size calculation and recruiting more than 500 participants, the statistical power to address some outcomes was limited. Approximately 28 to 31% of participants reported male condom use before intervention, which increased to more than 40% after intervention in both groups. According to the authors, this increase in condom use in Group 2 limited the power to assess differences.</P>
<P>EQUIVALENT STUDY GROUPS AT BASELINE: Stated that, overall, randomisation achieved similar characteristics in the two study groups, but there were some slight imbalances: Participants in Group 2 were more likely to have had less than a high school education (29% versus 21%; P = 0.03), a history of STI (51% versus 43%; P = 0.07) and were more likely to have had 2 or more sexual partners in the past month (20% versus 11%; P = 0.02).</P>

States that 82 eligible adolescent were not included in the study as no research assistant was available to approach them for study participation at the time of treatment and this might have introduced a bias.</P>

<P>DESIGN: Cluster RCT (single centre).</P>
<P>LENGTH OF FOLLOW-UP: Up to 3 months, Time 1 (immediately post intervention) and Time 2 (2 months) later for Group 1 (intervention) and Time 3 only for Group 2 (control).</P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS: Analysis is at a different level to randomisation and is based on intervention received.</P>
<P>ATTRITION RATE: Overall 56% based on number randomised (42% group 1; 74% group 2). Full compliers had more previous condom use (Time 0 - baseline) than those who dropped out (52.38 versus 11.11%, P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>UNIT OF DATA ANALYSIS: randomised by floors, but analysis by individuals.</P>
<P>SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION: none reported.</P>
<P>EQUIVALENT STUDY GROUPS AT BASELINE: Baseline questionnaire completed by 80.9% of Group 1 and 72.8% of Group 2. Baseline data only reported for participants completing follow-up at 2 months (34% Group 1; 54% Group 2). No difference in age, age at menarche, dating status, percent experienced sexual intercourse ever, age at first sexual intercourse, number of sexual partners ever, percent ever used condoms and percent condom use in last month. Group 2 had more sexual partners in the last year (1.36 versus 1.00, P &lt; 0.01). The rate of condom use in the two months prior to baseline was higher in Group 2 (control) (61.29) than Group 1 (intervention) (49.75) but stated not statistically significant.</P>

<P>SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS: not reported (university students)</P>
<P>ETHINCITY/RACE: not reported.</P>

<P>SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIOUR: Only just under a third in the intervention group and around half of the control group were sexually active. STI history not reported.</P>
<P>OTHER: the number of floors used for randomisation could be insufficient in number to ensure even distribution of socio-demographic and outcome related characteristics (and unknown mediating factors) of participants, however, participants were randomised to floors upon entry to the University. This may have ensured balanced distribution.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>No information given on randomisation sequence used. Three geographically distinct but environmentally and demographically similar sites were randomised to one of the three interventions. However, it is likely that the study is underpowered with only one cluster per trial group. Furthermore the authors combined Groups 1 and 2 into one group to compare against Group 3 which compromises randomisation.</P>

<P>Incomplete outcome data were not assessed in the analysis. However, the author noted that 8 females who dropped out of the comparison group had very low scores (not clear which scores) on the pre-test and 8-week post test and this may have possibly affected the overall 3-month findings for the comparison group. The author also observed that although 11 females dropped out of the study by 3 months, the average age and college grade remained the same. Note also that there was missing data on effective use of contraceptives due to under-reporting. A potential barrier to evaluation was that many sexually active participants did not answer the question on contraceptive use, leading to a small number of participants who reported using protection.</P>

<SUP>a</SUP> Denominator for both groups is 1,298 (which is less than the 1381 who completed the study). It is not clear what the denominator is for each of the randomised study groups.</P>
<P>
<SUP>b</SUP> Limited to young women who had had intercourse at least once during the follow-up period (n = 83 of 198 randomised).</P>
<P>
<SUP>c</SUP> Paper states that only young women who heard of female condoms were asked to answer questions related to female condoms. At follow-up 1,912 (64%) of the total study sample (3,003) had heard of the female condom. Furthermore, questions on condom use appear to be limited to those who had ever had sex (2,005 of the total 3,003 follow-up sample). The sub-group of young women in each study group who therefore answered questions on condom use is therefore unclear.</P>
<P>
<SUP>d</SUP> Participants who were sexually abstinent were omitted from this analysis (up to 20%).</P>
<P>
<SUP>e</SUP> Abstinent participants and those who never used condoms in the past three months were omitted from this analysis.</P>
<P>f Estimated from a graph using a computer graphics measurement programme (Engauge); not reported whether this is a mean value.</P>
<P>
<SUP>g</SUP> Restricted to those who were sexually active at the start of the study (25% in the intervention group; 40% in the comparator group).</P>
<P>
<SUP>h </SUP>Reported as mean (SD) without explanation and as log odds. Appears to refer to the mean (SD) number of acts, according to information in a related publication.</P>
<P>
<SUP>i </SUP>not explicitly stated, but it appears that these data exclude the sub-group of up to 20% who became sexually abstinent from baseline to follow-up.</P>

<P>
<SUP>k </SUP>Data presented for sexually active participants in the past six months (though number of such participants not reported).</P>
