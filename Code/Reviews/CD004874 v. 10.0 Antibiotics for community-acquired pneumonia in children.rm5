<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-04-29 01:17:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children under five years of age. Most cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in low-income countries are caused by bacteria. This systematic review identified 29 randomised controlled trials from many different countries enrolling 14,188 children and comparing antibiotics for treatment of CAP in children. Most were single studies only.</P>
<P>We found that for outpatient treatment of pneumonia, amoxycillin is an alternative treatment to co-trimoxazole. Oral amoxycillin in children with severe pneumonia without hypoxia (i.e. a decreased level of oxygen), and who are feeding well, may be effective. For very severe pneumonia, a combination of penicillin or ampicillin and gentamycin is more effective than chloramphenicol alone. Reports of adverse events were not available in many studies. Wherever information on adverse events was available, it did not differ between two drugs compared except that gastrointestinal side effects were more commonly reported with erythromycin compared to azithromycin.</P>
<P>Limitations of this review are that only five studies met all the quality assessment criteria and for most comparisons of the efficacy of antibiotics only one or two studies were available.</P>

<P>We included 29 trials, which enrolled 14,188 children, comparing multiple antibiotics. None compared antibiotics with placebo.</P>
<P>Assessment of quality of study revealed that 5 out of 29 studies were double-blind and allocation concealment was adequate. Another 12 studies were unblinded but had adequate allocation concealment, classifying them as good quality studies. There was more than one study comparing co-trimoxazole with amoxycillin, oral amoxycillin with injectable penicillin/ampicillin and chloramphenicol with ampicillin/penicillin and studies were of good quality, suggesting the evidence for these comparisons was of high quality compared to other comparisons.</P>
<P>In ambulatory settings, for treatment of World Health Organization (WHO) defined non-severe CAP, amoxycillin compared with co-trimoxazole had similar failure rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.51) and cure rates (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.89). Three studies involved 3952 children.</P>
<P>In children with severe pneumonia without hypoxaemia, oral antibiotics (amoxycillin/co-trimoxazole) compared with injectable penicillin had similar failure rates (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.24), hospitalisation rates (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.34) and relapse rates (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.82). Six studies involved 4331 children below 18 years of age.</P>
<P>In very severe CAP, death rates were higher in children receiving chloramphenicol compared to those receiving penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamicin (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.07). One study involved 1116 children.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-29 01:17:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For treatment of patients with CAP in ambulatory settings, amoxycillin is an alternative to co-trimoxazole. With limited data on other antibiotics, co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefpodoxime may be alternative second-line drugs. Children with severe pneumonia without hypoxaemia can be treated with oral amoxycillin in an ambulatory setting. For children hospitalised with severe and very severe CAP, penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin is superior to chloramphenicol. The other alternative drugs for such patients are co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefuroxime. Until more studies are available, these can be used as second-line therapies.</P>
<P>There is a need for more studies with radiographically confirmed pneumonia in larger patient populations and similar methodologies to compare newer antibiotics. Recommendations in this review are applicable to countries with high case fatalities due to pneumonia in children without underlying morbidities and where point of care tests for identification of aetiological agents for pneumonia are not available.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-29 01:23:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pneumonia is the leading single cause of mortality in children aged less than five years, with an estimated incidence of 0.29 and 0.05 episodes per child-year in low-income and high-income countries, respectively. It is estimated that a total of around 156 million new episodes occur each year and most of these occur in India (43 million), China (21 million), Pakistan (10 million) and Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nigeria (six million each) (<LINK REF="REF-Rudan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudan 2008</LINK>). In 2010, out of 7.6 million deaths in children below five years of age, 1.4 million (18.3%) deaths were due to pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2012</LINK>). Reducing mortality due to pneumonia may help in reducing childhood and under five-year old mortality rates (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2012</LINK>). The commonest bacterial pathogens isolated in children under five years with pneumonia are <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae </I>(<I>S. pneumoniae</I>)<I> </I>(30% to 50%) and <I>Haemophilus influenzae </I>(<I>H. influenzae</I>)<I> </I>(10% to 30%) (<LINK REF="REF-Falade-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falade 2011</LINK>), and 50% of deaths due to pneumonia in this age group are attributed to these two organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Shann-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shann 1995</LINK>). To reduce the infant and under five-year child mortality rate, it is important to reduce mortality due to pneumonia by appropriate intervention in the form of antibiotics. Selection of first-line antibiotics for empirical treatment of pneumonia is crucial for office practice as well as public health.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-04-29 01:17:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pneumonia is defined as an infection of the lung parenchyma (alveoli) by microbial agents. It is difficult to identify the causative organism in most cases of pneumonia. The methods used for identification of the aetiologic agents include blood culture, lung puncture, nasopharyngeal aspiration and immune assays of blood and urine tests. Lung puncture is an invasive procedure associated with significant morbidity and hence cannot be performed routinely in most cases. The yield from blood cultures is too low (5% to 15% for bacterial pathogens) to be relied upon (<LINK REF="REF-MacCracken-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacCracken 2000</LINK>). There are few studies that document the aetiology of pneumonia in children below five years of age from low-income countries. Most studies carried out blood cultures for bacterial aetiology of pneumonia. Some studies carried out nasopharyngeal aspirates and identification of virus and atypical organisms. A review of 14 studies involving 1096 lung aspirates taken from hospitalised children prior to administration of antibiotics reported bacterial pathogens in 62% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Berman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 1990</LINK>). In 27% of patients, the common bacterial pathogens identified were <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae </I>(<I>S. pneumoniae</I>) and <I>Haemophilus influenzae </I>(<I>H. influenzae</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Berman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 1990</LINK>). Studies using nasopharyngeal aspirates for identification of viral agents suggest that about 40% of pneumonia in children below five years of age is caused by viral agents, with the commonest viral pathogen being respiratory syncytial virus (<LINK REF="REF-Maitreyi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maitreyi 2000</LINK>). In infants under three months of age, common pathogens include <I>S. pneumoniae</I>,<I> H. influenzae</I>, gram-negative bacilli and <I>Staphylococcus</I> (<LINK REF="REF-WHOYISG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHOYISG 1999</LINK>). The causative organisms are different in high-income countries and include more viral and atypical organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Gendrel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gendrel 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ishiwada-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishiwada 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Numazaki-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Numazaki 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wubbel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wubbel 1999</LINK>). Therefore, treatment regimens may be different in high-income and low-income countries. The reference standard for diagnosis of pneumonia is X-ray film of the chest. However, it does not have the necessary sensitivity and specificity to identify aetiological agents (i e. bacterial or viral). Obtaining an X-ray film in all suspected pneumonia cases may not be cost-effective as it does not affect the outcome. Therefore, diagnosis of pneumonia is based on clinical criteria. Treatment of pneumonia includes administration of antibiotics, either in hospital or in an ambulatory setting. Administration of antibiotics for all clinically diagnosed pneumonia may lead to antibiotic prescription even for those cases caused by viral infection. Since clinical or radiological findings cannot differentiate viral or bacterial pneumonia and due to the absence of point of care tests for routine use, empirical treatment with antibiotics in countries with high case fatalities due to pneumonia is recommended by the World health Organization (WHO).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-04-02 14:11:11 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Administration of appropriate antibiotics at an early stage of pneumonia improves the outcome of the illness, particularly when the causative agent is bacterial. The WHO has provided guidelines for early diagnosis and assessment of the severity of pneumonia on the basis of clinical features (<LINK REF="REF-WHOYISG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHOYISG 1999</LINK>) and suggests administration of co-trimoxazole as a first-line drug. The commonly used antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) include co-trimoxazole, amoxycillin, oral cephalosporins and macrolide drugs. Despite evidence of rising bacterial resistance to co-trimoxazole (<LINK REF="REF-IBIS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">IBIS 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Timothy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timothy 1993</LINK>), studies conducted in the same time period showed good clinical efficacy of oral co-trimoxazole for non-severe pneumonia (<LINK REF="STD-Awasthi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Awasthi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rasmussen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rasmussen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Straus-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Straus 1998</LINK>). However, one study reported a doubling of clinical failure rates with co-trimoxazole treatment when compared to treatment with amoxycillin in severe and radiologically confirmed pneumonia (<LINK REF="STD-Straus-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Straus 1998</LINK>). A meta-analysis of all the trials on pneumonia based on the case-management approach proposed by the WHO (identification of pneumonia on clinical symptoms/signs and administration of empirical antimicrobial agents) has found a reduction in overall mortality as well as pneumonia-related mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Sazawal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sazawal 2003</LINK>). Various antibiotics have been used for varying severities of pneumonia. Antibiotics are administered in hospital or in ambulatory settings.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-04-02 14:11:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children below five years of age. It is not easy to identify aetiological agents in children with pneumonia. To meet the public health goal of reducing child mortality due to pneumonia, empirical antibiotic administration is relied upon in most instances. This is necessary in view of the inability of most commonly available laboratory tests to identify causative pathogens.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-04-29 01:17:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Empirical antibiotic administration is the mainstay of treatment of pneumonia in children. Administration of the most appropriate antibiotic as the first-line treatment may improve the outcome of pneumonia. Many antibiotics are prescribed to treat pneumonia. Therefore, it is important to know which works best for pneumonia in children. The last review of all available randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on antibiotics used for pneumonia in children was published in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Kabra-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabra 2010</LINK>). Since then, five new trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ambroggio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ambroggio 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bari 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nogeova-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nogeova 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soofi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Soofi 2012</LINK>) have been published. Additional information on the epidemiology of pneumonia in children has been published. Therefore, we have updated this review and included new data and also carried out a meta-analysis on the treatment of severe pneumonia with oral antibiotics.</P>

<P>To search CENTRAL and MEDLINE we combined the following search strategy with the validated search strategy for identifying child studies developed by Boluyt (<LINK REF="REF-Boluyt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boluyt 2008</LINK>). We used the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy to identify randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision); Ovid format (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>). We adapted the search strategy to search EMBASE (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>), CINAHL (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>), Web of Science (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>) and LILACS (<LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>).</P>

We retrieved the complete texts of these studies electronically or by contacting the trial authors. Two review authors (SKK, RL) independently reviewed the results for inclusion.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2013-04-29 01:17:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A person who was not involved in the review gave all relevant studies a serial number to mask the authors' names and institutions, the location of the study, reference lists and any other potential identifiers. Two review authors (SKK, RL) independently reviewed the results for inclusion in the analysis. We resolved differences about study quality through discussion. We recorded data on a pre-structured data extraction form. We assessed publication bias using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We included data from cluster-RCTs after adjustment for the design effect. We calculated the design effect by 1+(M-1) ICC; where M is the average cluster size and ICC is the intracluster correlation coefficient (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Before combining the studies for each of the outcome variables, we carried out an assessment of heterogeneity using Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>) software. We performed a sensitivity analysis to check the importance of each study in order to see the effect of inclusion and exclusion criteria. We computed both the effect size and summary measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>. We used a random-effects model to combine the study results for all the outcome variables.</P>
<P>We collected data on the primary outcome (cure rate/failure rate) and secondary outcomes (relapse rate, rate of hospitalisation and complications, need for change in antibiotics, need for additional interventions and mortality). When available, we also recorded additional data on potential confounders such as prior antibiotic therapy and nutritional status.</P>
<P>We did multiple analyses, firstly on studies comparing the same antibiotics. We also attempted to perform indirect comparisons of various drugs when studies with direct comparisons were not available. For example, we compared antibiotics A and C when a comparison of antibiotics A and B was available and likewise a separate comparison between antibiotics B and C. We only did this type of comparison if the inclusion and exclusion criteria of these studies, the dose and duration of the common intervention (antibiotic B), baseline characteristics and the outcomes assessed were similar (<LINK REF="REF-Bucher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>The aim of this review was to establish the most effective antibiotics for first-line empirical treatment community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) of different severity. A limited number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most of the antibiotic comparisons were available in single studies only.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-29 01:17:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies comparing treatment of pneumonia in an ambulatory setting suggest that the failure rate with co-trimoxazole was comparable to amoxycillin; co-amoxyclavulanic acid was better than amoxycillin. Resolution of radiographically confirmed pneumonia was better with clarithromycin as compared to erythromycin and side effects were fewer with azithromycin as compared to co-amoxyclavulanic acid. For children with severe pneumonia, treatment with oral antibiotics was similar to treatment with injectable ampicillin or penicillin. Death rates were higher in children getting chloramphenicol as compared to those getting penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin.</P>
<P>For severe/very severe pneumonia, penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin was associated with lower re-admission rates as compared to chloramphenicol.</P>
<P>For very severe pneumonia, failure rates were significantly higher in those receiving chloramphenicol as compared to ampicillin and gentamycin.</P>
<P>The rest of the comparisons for treatment in ambulatory settings involved azithromycin with erythromycin, clarithromycin, clarithromycin with erythromycin, amoxycillin with procaine penicillin, co-trimoxazole with single-dose procaine penicillin followed by oral ampicillin and cefpodoxime with co-amoxyclavulanic acid and there were no statistically significant differences in these comparisons.</P>
<P>Comparisons for severe and very severe pneumonia involved chloramphenicol plus ampicillin with penicillin, amoxycillin with cefuroxime, amoxycillin with clarithromycin, penicillin and gentamycin with co-amoxyclavulanic acid, levofloxacin with ceftriaxone or co-amoxyclavulanic acid, cefuroxime with clarithromycin and chloramphenicol with co-trimoxazole and were comparable. Co-amoxyclavulanic acid was better than oxacillin/ceftriaxone and cefuroxime was better than ceftibuten.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-05-01 11:05:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment of pneumonia depends on the age of the child, the severity of illness, the likely aetiological agents and their resistance pattern. The aetiological agents vary with age and possibly geographic location. Most of the studies included in this review were from underdeveloped countries with age groups below five years, and identification of aetiological agents was limited to a few studies. The burden of pneumonia is significant in infants from developing countries. Attempts to isolate aetiological agents may not be cost-effective and therefore empirical treatment of pneumonia is justified. The results of this review may therefore be more applicable to the management of pneumonia in developing countries. However, data comparing two different antibiotics may also be useful in guiding antibiotic therapy in industrialised countries.</P>
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treatment of non-severe pneumonia with co-trimoxazole as a first-line empirical antimicrobial treatment in countries with an infant mortality rate higher than 40 per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>). Concerns about increasing resistance of common pathogens (<I>S. pneumoniae</I> and <I>H. influenzae</I>) to co-trimoxazole have been raised (<LINK REF="REF-Krishnan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnan 2011</LINK>) and amoxycillin has been suggested as an alternative. This review suggests that amoxycillin and co-trimoxazole are associated with similar failure rates. Reports of in vitro resistance of common organisms of pneumonia to cotrimoxazole and relatively more sensitivity to amoxycillin have not resulted in more failure rates in the co-trimoxazole group. All clinical trials included in this review included children with pneumonia diagnosed by the WHO clinical definition of pneumonia. None had chest X-rays. It can be concluded that there are insufficient data to show superiority of amoxycillin to co-trimoxazole. It should be noted that amoxycillin is more expensive than co-trimoxazole for five days of treatment for a child weighing between 5 kg and 10 kg (in India US USD 0.6 versus USD 0.3). Two recent studies (<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MASCOT-Group-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MASCOT Group 2002</LINK>) reported similar cure rates with amoxycillin given for three or five days. The cost of amoxycillin would be reduced to some extent if the treatment duration of amoxycillin was lowered to three days. Most studies comparing co-trimoxazole and amoxycillin used clinical case definition of pneumonia (rapid respiration). Respiratory symptoms and rapid respiratory rates in children may be due to bacterial pneumonia, viral infection associated wheeze, asthma etc. In a study from Pakistan chest radiographs were normal in 82% of children diagnosed with non-severe pneumonia using the WHO case definition (<LINK REF="REF-Hazir-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazir 2006</LINK>). The majority of such children, except those with bacterial pneumonia, may not require antimicrobial agents and are likely to recover over three to seven days with supportive care. Giving them co-trimoxazole or amoxycillin or any other antibiotics may not alter their outcome. Another study from Pakistan observed that children with non-severe pneumonia treated with amoxycillin or placebo had similar failure rates, suggesting that the specificity of the WHO criteria for diagnosis of true bacterial pneumonia is low. Therefore, it is important to have well-designed clinical trials in children with true pneumonia (radiologically confirmed/direct or indirect evidence of bacterial pneumonia).</P>
<P>Alternative antibiotics for CAP include macrolides, co-amoxyclavulanic acid, oral cephalosporins (cefpodoxime, ceftibuten, cefuroxime), procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin. Comparisons of various macrolides shows similar efficacy, with the exception of more radiological clearance with clarithromycin without any clinical implications. Macrolides may acquire resistance very quickly if used indiscriminately (<LINK REF="REF-Inoue-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inoue 2006</LINK>). Therefore macrolides should not be used as a first line drug in pneumonia. Amoxycillin was comparable with macrolides (azithromycin and clarithromycin), procaine penicillin and cefuroxime. Amoxycillin may therefore be preferable over these drugs. Co-amoxyclavulanic acid has been shown to give better results than amoxycillin and oxacillin plus ceftriaxone combination. The results are based on single studies for each drug. In children with severe and very severe pneumonia, co-amoxyclavulanic acid may be used as an alternative to penicillin. Cefpodoxime was comparable to co-amoxyclavulanic acid in a single study and may be an alternative where co-amoxyclavulanic acid cannot be administered. Injectable penicillins (procaine penicillin or benzathine penicillin) are associated with injection-site problems and therefore have a limited role in non-severe pneumonia.</P>
<P>The WHO recommends admission to hospital and treatment with penicillin for severe pneumonia and chloramphenicol for very severe pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). In this review it clearly emerged that children with severe pneumonia without hypoxia, who are feeding well, can be treated with oral amoxycillin. The mortality rates were higher in children receiving injectable antibiotics. Quality assessment of these trials comparing oral with injectable medications reveals adequate allocation concealment but all were unblinded. There is no explanation for the increased death rates in those who received injectable antibiotics, as they were treated with either ampicillin/penicillin or amoxycillin. After excluding one study that reported seven deaths in children receiving injections (<LINK REF="STD-Addo_x002d_Yobo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Addo-Yobo 2004</LINK>), the difference in death rate becomes non-significant. In view of the similar antimicrobial spectrum of all these drugs (ampicillin/amoxycillin/cotrimoxazole/penicillin) and the possible benefit of better bioavailability with parenteral administration of antibiotics, a better outcome could be expected with use of injectable antibiotics for the treatment of children with severe pneumonia. More recently two cluster-RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Bari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bari 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soofi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Soofi 2012</LINK>) in children with WHO-defined severe pneumonia without hypoxaemia compared oral amoxycillin with standard care (referral to healthcare services with injectable antibiotics). Results of these studies reveal that the outcome of patients with oral amoxycillin is the same or better than with standard treatment. Many patients on standard treatment did not take injectable medications or follow the instructions. Based on the results of these studies and the observations in the present review, it may be concluded that children with severe pneumonia without hypoxia may be treated with oral amoxycillin. There is a need to re-define severe pneumonia with or without hypoxia to identify children who may be treated with oral amoxycillin.</P>
<P>In children with severe or very severe pneumonia, it was evident that chloramphenicol was inferior to the combination of penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin. Therefore, there is a need to change the WHO guidelines. Alternative antibiotics for hospitalised children with severe and very severe pneumonia include ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefuroxime. However, comparisons were based on single studies and these drugs are relatively more expensive. Another study showed that co-amoxyclavulanic acid is better than an oxacillin-ceftriaxone combination suggesting that co-amoxyclavulanic acid may be an alternative to penicillin/ampicillin.</P>
<P>Cure and failure rates of CAP depend not only on the choice of antibiotics but also on the aetiology of the pneumonia, the age of the patient, the sensitivity pattern of the bacterial pathogen, the severity of disease and any antibiotic usage in the recent past. While information on resistance patterns was not included in the studies evaluated in the review, this is likely to be of major importance in the future, in terms of both clinical practice and research.</P>
<P>In the management of CAP, isolation of bacterial pathogens in order to make a decision about the choice of antibiotics is not feasible in most circumstances. Even if bacterial pathogens are isolated, the child will need to be treated with empirical antibiotics until the result of the culture is available. In this review identification of bacterial pathogens was attempted in 14 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Asghar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Asghar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bansal-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Block-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Block 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bradley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bradley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Camargos-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Camargos 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duke 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kogan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kogan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulholland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mulholland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nogeova-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nogeova 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roord-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Roord 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Straus-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Straus 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wubbel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wubbel 1999</LINK>). Bacterial pathogens could be isolated in only 12% of the study participants. <I>S. pneumoniae</I> and <I>H. influenzae</I> constituted 65% of all the bacterial isolates. Therefore, empirical antibiotic therapy for CAP should be effective against these two pathogens.</P>
<P>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) could be isolated in 20% of patients, suggesting that a sizeable proportion of patients may have a viral aetiology of CAP. These patients may not need antibiotics. A child with viral pneumonia can be identified from rapid diagnostic tests such as nasopharyngeal aspirates (<LINK REF="REF-Maitreyi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maitreyi 2000</LINK>) and can avoid administration of antibiotics. However, the possibility of mixed infection (bacterial agents with viruses) has been observed in 10% to 40% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Kabra-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabra 2003</LINK>). At present, it is policy to treat all children with pneumonia with antibiotics due to a lack of point of care tests that can reliably rule out bacterial pneumonia.</P>
<P>Another important issue is the aetiological role of atypical organisms (<I>Chlamydia</I> and <I>Mycoplasma spp</I>.) in CAP (<LINK REF="REF-Chaudhary-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaudhary 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Normann-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Normann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pandey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandey 2005</LINK>). Six studies included in this review identified atypical organisms (<LINK REF="STD-Block-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Block 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bradley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bradley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kogan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kogan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nogeova-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nogeova 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wubbel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wubbel 1999</LINK>). Out of 1734 children tested for<I> M. pneumoniae</I>, 385 (22%) tested positive. The positivity for <I>Mycoplasma</I> in children under five years age was 21% (141/659). Tests for <I>Chlamydia spp</I>. were positive in 158 out of the 1534 children (10%). In children under five years of age, positive tests for <I>Chlamydia spp</I>. occurred in 45 out of 658 (7%). The most effective antibiotics against atypical organisms are tetracycline and macrolides. In this review, the studies that attempted to identify atypical organisms showed equal cure rates between erythromycin and azithromycin. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Harris-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wubbel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wubbel 1999</LINK>) comparing azithromycin with co-amoxyclavulanic acid in children under five years of age also showed equal cure and failure rates. In these studies the incidence of atypical organisms in children under five years of age was 15% and 11% for <I>Mycoplasma spp</I>. and <I>Chlamydia</I>, respectively. The cure rates in children receiving co-amoxyclavulanic acid were comparable to those receiving azithromycin. From this observation it can be inferred that either the diagnostic tests used for atypical organisms in these studies may not indicate invasive infections, or that the study was not adequately powered to detect small differences. A recent retrospective cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-Ambroggio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ambroggio 2012</LINK>) compared the effectiveness of beta-lactam monotherapy and beta-lactam and macrolide combination therapy on the outcomes of children hospitalised with CAP. The results of this study suggest that mean hospital stay was 20% less in school-going children who received macrolide in addition to beta-lactamase therapy. The study did not observe a difference in re-admission rates or a difference in length of stay in children below six years of age. More studies are required to recommend the addition of macrolides to beta-lactamase antibiotics.</P>
<P>Exposure to antibiotics in the recent past may adversely affect the outcome of bacterial pneumonia as the chances of infection with a resistant organism increases (<LINK REF="REF-Chenoweth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chenoweth 2000</LINK>). In this review, information on past antibiotic use was available in eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Addo_x002d_Yobo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Addo-Yobo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asghar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Asghar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bradley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bradley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duke 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazir-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hazir 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Straus-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Straus 1998</LINK>). The distribution of patients who had received antibiotics in the recent past was similar in the two treatment groups in all the studies. However, subgroup analysis was not available in these studies. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hazir-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hazir 2008</LINK>) antibiotic use in the last week was associated with increased failure rates on univariate analysis. In a study comparing co-trimoxazole and amoxycillin the number of patients who had received antibiotics in the recent past was higher in the amoxycillin group (34% compared with 25.6% in the co-trimoxazole group) (<LINK REF="STD-Straus-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Straus 1998</LINK>). In this study separate data regarding failure rates in those received antibiotics and those did not receive antibiotics are not available. However, failure rates in children with severe pneumonia who received cotrimoxazole was 56/203 (27.5%), is higher than those who received amoxycillin (18/99) (18%). Failure rates in those with non severe pneumonia in the same study were 12.8% and 12.5% in those receiving co-trimoxazole or amoxycillin respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Straus-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Straus 1998</LINK>). These results suggest that children suffering from severe pneumonia who have received antibiotics in the recent past may benefit from treatment with amoxycillin. However, these results are based on a single study and care should be taken when drawing any definite conclusions.</P>
<P>Malnutrition may affect the treatment outcome of pneumonia. There was only one study in malnourished children (<LINK REF="STD-Mulholland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mulholland 1995</LINK>) which compared co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol. The study did not show any significant difference in cure rates, failure rates or need for change in antibiotics.</P>
<P>The aetiology of pneumonia depends on the age of the patient. In this review, the majority of enrolled participants were below five years of age and separate data according to age were not available for primary and secondary outcomes in the studies that also enrolled older children. We tried to see the effect on outcomes after removing studies that included children older than five years for severe pneumonia and observed that the age of participants did not change the outcome. Therefore, we feel that the recommendation may be applicable to all age groups. However, more studies are required for children older than five years of age.</P>
<P>There are limitations in reviewing antibiotic usage in CAP. Comparisons are often performed among groups of children for whom identification of aetiological agents is lacking. This means that if the distribution of viral cases is not uniform, the conclusions regarding the efficacy of antibiotics can be debatable. Several individual factors, such as malnutrition, can deeply modify the evolution of CAP and the response to antibiotic therapy. In the present review, only one study addressed this problem; it is highly probable that this issue can influence the correct evaluation of the data. No data regarding antibiotic resistance were reported in the majority of the studies. It is well known that in some cases the level of resistance to commonly used antibiotics can have a great influence on the response to therapy. The role of atypical bacteria in the determination of CAP in children living in low-income countries is not established, probably because the methods for identifying these pathogens are too complicated or too expensive, or both. These data are needed to more accurately define the best antibiotic therapy. The results may be more applicable for developing countries as most studies were done in these countries.</P>

<P>Five out of 29 studies were double-blind and allocation concealment was adequate. Another 12 studies were unblinded but had adequate allocation concealment, classifying them as good-quality studies. Data were fully detailed in 20 studies, selective reporting of data was unclear in 12 studies and 13 studies were funded by WHO or universities. There was more than one study comparing co-trimoxazole with amoxycillin, oral amoxycillin with injectable penicillin/ampicillin and chloramphenicol with ampicillin/penicillin and studies were of good quality, suggesting the evidence for these comparisons is of high quality compared to other comparisons.</P>

<P>The important changes in this updated review in comparison to the previous version (<LINK REF="REF-Kabra-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabra 2010</LINK>) include the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Outcomes of children with radiographically confirmed or clinically diagnosed pneumonia are not different.</LI>
<LI>WHO-defined severe pneumonia without hypoxaemia can be managed with oral antibiotics in an ambulatory setting. There is a need to divide WHO-defined severe pneumonia into those with hypoxia and those without hypoxia to identify children who can be treated with oral antibiotics in an ambulatory setting.</LI>
<LI>For very severe pneumonia, co-amoxyclavulanic acid may be an alternative to ceftriaxone or penicillin/ampicillin, gentamycin combination.</LI>
</OL>
<P>A review comparing oral and intravenous antibiotics in pneumonia suggested no difference in cure and failure rates in children getting oral or intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Reyes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Reyes 2006</LINK>). In the present review we also found that oral and intravenous antibiotics (amoxycillin versus penicillin/ampicillin and co-trimoxazole versus procaine penicillin) for pneumonia are equally effective.</P>
<P>A recent retrospective cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-Ambroggio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ambroggio 2012</LINK>) suggests that the addition of macrolide to beta-lactam antibiotics in children above six years of age may improve outcomes in the form of reduced hospital stay. In the present review, we did not find any study that compared beta-lactam antibiotics with and without macrolide for treatment of CAP. Studies comparing macrolides with other antibiotics (amoxycillin, co-amoxyclavulanic acid) gave similar failure rates suggesting no advantage of macrolides. We conclude that there is a need for RCTs to document the advantages of the addition of macrolide antibiotics to conventional beta-lactam antibiotics.</P>

<P>In children presenting with community-acquired pneumonia without underlying illness, and where point of care tests for identification of aetiological agents for pneumonia are not available, empirical antibiotics may be used as follows. For the treatment of WHO-defined non-severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children below five years of age amoxycillin is an alternative to co-trimoxazole. There are no apparent differences between azithromycin and erythromycin, azithromycin and co-amoxyclavulanic acid, or cefpodoxime and co-amoxyclavulanic acid. There are limited data on other antibiotics: co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefpodoxime may be alternative second-line drugs.</P>
<P>Severe pneumonia in children below five years of age, without hypoxia and accepting oral feeds, can be managed with oral amoxycillin on an ambulatory basis.</P>
<P>For children below five years of age, hospitalised with severe and very severe CAP, penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin is superior to chloramphenicol. Other alternatives may be co-amoxyclavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin and cefuroxime. Until more studies are available these can be used as second-line therapies.</P>
<P>More studies are required to assess the role of the addition of macrolide antibiotics to beta-lactam antibiotics in children above five years of age.</P>
<P>More randomised controlled trials are required for a review of these antibiotics in order to make more accurate recommendations for their prescription.</P>
<P>There is need for surveillance studies to document antibiotic resistance in different geographic regions for developing empiric antibiotic treatment for pneumonia.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-04-29 01:17:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need to compare various antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia of varying severity. Studies should include radiographically confirmed pneumonia in place of clinically diagnosed pneumonia. Studies should try to identify the aetiological agents and their susceptibilities to various antibiotics and the risk factors that lead to failure of treatment. The results of such studies will help in the formation of guidelines to identify children at risk of failure who can be managed with second-line antimicrobials early.</P>
