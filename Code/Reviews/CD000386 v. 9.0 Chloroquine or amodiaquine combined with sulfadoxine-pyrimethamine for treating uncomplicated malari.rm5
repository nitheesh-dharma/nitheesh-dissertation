<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The original version summarized the evidence from five trials conducted between 1980 and 1995 that compared chloroquine (CQ) or amodiaquine (AQ) in combination with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to CQ, AQ, or SP alone (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 1997</LINK>). The author added two more trials (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 2001</LINK>) in a subsequent review update. Several more trials have since been published giving the author reason to update the review again. However, it was necessary this time to change some aspects of the review to ensure its relevance to current malaria control efforts in the light of increasing drug resistance.<BR/>
<BR/>CQ or AQ alone are no longer comparators in the review; the focus of the review question now is whether CQ or AQ plus SP combination therapy is better than SP alone.<BR/>
<BR/>The World Health Organization standardized protocol for monitoring drug efficacy has been modified over time (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RBM-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2003</LINK>) and this is reflected in the outcome measures reported in clinical trials. To summarize the findings from trials conducted at different times we chose the primary outcome measures of total failure and clinical failure (<LINK REF="REF-RBM-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2003</LINK>), which could be estimated from trials that used different classification systems for treatment response. Follow up to day 28 is preferred because of the longer elimination half life of SP and the risk of underestimating treatment failure at shorter assessment times (<LINK REF="REF-Stepniewska-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepniewska 2004</LINK>). Time to fever clearance and time to parasite clearance are no longer included as outcome measures. Reliable synthesis of these data is problematic without individual patient data with which to perform intention-to-treat time to event analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>Quasi-randomized controlled trials are no longer eligible for inclusion in line with current Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group guidance.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Using amodiaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine together to treat uncomplicated malaria instead of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone may reduce treatment failure; adding chloroquine to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine may not be beneficial</P>
<P>Chloroquine, amodiaquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are relatively inexpensive drugs to treat malaria. Treatment failure is a problem when these drugs are used alone because malaria parasites have become resistant to them. Based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, a combination of amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine may reduce treatment failure in some locations. It appears less likely that chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine will have a treatment benefit over sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Chloroquine (CQ), amodiaquine (AQ), and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) are inexpensive drugs, but treatment failure is a problem. Combination therapy may reduce treatment failure. CQ or AQ plus SP are affordable options of combination treatment, but there is debate about their effectiveness.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the combination of CQ or AQ plus SP compared with SP alone for first-line treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (April 2005), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1974 to April 2005), LILACS (1982 to April 2005), Science Citation Index (1981 to April 2005), African Index Medicus (1993 to 1998), and reference lists. We also contacted researchers at relevant organizations and a pharmaceutical company.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials in adults or children with uncomplicated <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> malaria were eligible for inclusion. The main outcomes of interest were total and clinical failure at day 28 follow up and serious adverse events.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-22 10:07:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two people independently applied the inclusion criteria. One author extracted data and another checked them independently. We used risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twelve trials (2107 participants) met the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of five AQ trials (461 participants) showed a statistically significant reduction in total failure at day 28 with the combination therapy (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.91), and meta-analysis of three trials (384 participants) showed a significant reduction in clinical failure at day 28 (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.49). The statistical significance in the total failure analysis was sensitive to losses to follow up. Data from two CQ trials showed no advantage for total failure with combination therapy at day 28. There was no evidence from the included trials of serious adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-14 16:30:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence base is not strong enough to support firm conclusions. The available evidence suggests that AQ plus SP can achieve less treatment failure than SP, but this might depend on existing levels of parasite resistance to the individual drugs.</P>
<P>Addendum, 2008: The World Health Organization (in 2006) recommended that monotherapy should not be used for treating malaria. Therefore the authors do not intend to update this review.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-10 15:34:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-10 15:34:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chloroquine (CQ) is a cheap and well-tolerated 4-aminoquinoline drug. It is still widely used to treat uncomplicated malaria even in areas where <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> malaria parasites show significant levels of resistance to it. Amodiaquine (AQ) is similar to CQ but is more potent. It is used less widely and resistance to it is less common, although there is some cross-resistance with CQ. The antifolate drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is also inexpensive, effective against parasites resistant to CQ and AQ, and the single-dose standard treatment is rarely associated with severe adverse reactions (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sturchler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturchler 1993</LINK>). SP has customarily been used to replace failing CQ or AQ as first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria because it is available and affordable. However, the selective pressure exerted when SP is used alone, and the relatively long time that SP remains in the body, is thought to have contributed to the emergence of malaria parasites resistant to SP (<LINK REF="REF-Watkins-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkins 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Combination therapy has been advocated for some years for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, to improve clinical effectiveness and slow down the emergence of drug resistance to individual drugs (<LINK REF="REF-White-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999</LINK>). International health agencies recently declared that artemisinin combination therapy must urgently be made widely available, but many countries, particularly in Africa, cannot afford to purchase artemisinin drugs. Although malaria parasite resistance has reduced the effectiveness of the 4-aminoquinolines and SP, for some countries these drugs are currently the only affordable option for combination therapy.</P>
<P>Some countries faced with increasing treatment failure rates have already implemented a change in first-line treatment policy from CQ or AQ alone to CQ or AQ plus SP, whilst others have opted to replace CQ or AQ alone with SP ( <LINK REF="REF-RBM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RBM 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wongsrichanalai-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wongsrichanalai 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EANMAT-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EANMAT 2003</LINK>). The combination of CQ or AQ plus SP may still be able to slow down the progress of resistance in areas where resistance to either drug component has not yet reached a high level (<LINK REF="REF-Watkins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkins 2005</LINK>). Also, since CQ and AQ have antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties that SP does not have, combination therapy may relieve clinical symptoms faster than SP alone. However, opinion on the effectiveness of this strategy varies.</P>

<P>Five trials made this comparison, one conducted in Papua New Guinea in 1980 (<LINK REF="STD-Darlow-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 1982</LINK>), one in The Gambia in 1995 (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 1998</LINK>), one in Laos in 2001 (<LINK REF="STD-Schw_x00f6_bel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schwöbel 2003</LINK>), and two in Uganda between 2001 and 2002 (<LINK REF="STD-Gasasira-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gasasira 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ndyomugyenyi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ndyomugyenyi 2004</LINK>). A total of 942 participants were enrolled of which 770 completed follow up.</P>
<P>One of the older trials listed the use of antimalarials in the previous seven days as an exclusion criterion (<LINK REF="STD-Darlow-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 1982</LINK>). Baseline data reported in two of the recent trials suggested that antimalarial and any drug use in the previous week (<LINK REF="STD-Schw_x00f6_bel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schwöbel 2003</LINK>) or antimalarial use in the previous two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Gasasira-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gasasira 2003</LINK>) was similar between groups. One trial specified self-medication during the trial in the exclusion criteria, but the baseline data showed that CQ use within the two weeks prior to the trial was twice as common in the CQ plus SP group as the SP group (<LINK REF="STD-Ndyomugyenyi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ndyomugyenyi 2004</LINK>). The remaining included trial did not mention previous the use of antimalarials (<LINK REF="STD-Bojang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bojang 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>All 12 trials were described as randomized, but only five used adequate methods to generate the sequence.

Only one trial described adequate sequence generation and concealment, together with blinding of the outcome assessors; however treatment outcome for the first episode of uncomplicated malaria was not the primary objective of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Dorsey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dorsey 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In seven trials at least 80% of randomized participants were evaluated for the primary outcome, although in one of these there was a moderate imbalance in attrition between the CQ plus SP and the SP alone groups (<LINK REF="STD-Gasasira-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gasasira 2003</LINK>), and in another the number of participants originally assigned to each treatment group was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Darlow-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 1982</LINK>). One trial provided no information to assess attrition (<LINK REF="STD-Dinis-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dinis 1990</LINK>). Attrition over all the trials was about 18%; the proportion cannot be determined precisely because of incomplete and inconsistent reporting.</P>

<P>Details on how we derived estimates of total failure and clinical failure from the data in each trial report are in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>, respectively. We did not include one trial, <LINK REF="STD-Darlow-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Darlow 1982</LINK>, in the meta-analysis because the number of participants originally assigned to each treatment was unclear; this was the only trial that reported treatment switching of some participants, from CQ plus SP to SP alone, after randomization.</P>
<P>The main meta-analyses use a fixed-effect model and data reported for participants who were evaluable at follow up. Too few trials reported adequate allocation concealment or blinding to explore possible associations between those measures of the risk of bias in the trials and the estimate of treatment effect. Some trials had substantial losses to follow up, the impact of which we explored using sensitivity analyses of best-case and worst-case scenarios. In best-case scenarios, we assumed that all participants lost to follow up had a successful outcome. This did not substantially change any of the meta-analysis results. Reinstating participants lost to follow up as failures (worst-case scenario) caused a shift in all point estimates away from favouring combination therapy. This moved the pooled point estimates closer to the line of no effect. This changed the meta-analysis findings for total and clinical failure at day 28 in the AQ trials analysis, and at day 14 in the CQ trials analysis. All the meta-analysis results are described below.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-10 15:34:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review includes outcome data for 1739 participants from 12 randomized controlled trials conducted in disparate malaria endemic areas. The trials span the last two decades, although each was conducted at a time when there was known to be some degree of malaria parasite resistance to CQ or AQ, or both, and in some cases to SP. The most recent data are largely from trials conducted in Africa, particularly Uganda. The findings suggest a beneficial effect of AQ plus SP combination therapy at day 28 compared with SP alone, possibly due to a better clinical cure rate. The evidence available from randomized controlled trials suggests that CQ plus SP combination therapy may not have a treatment benefit over SP alone.</P>
<P>Synthesizing the data from these trials is problematic for several reasons in addition to the dissimilarities of location and time. A major obstacle to synthesizing data from different trials is the change over time in the standard protocol for the assessment of antimalarial drug efficacy and consequently the outcomes measured in clinical trials. Our approach was to use the data that were reported to calculate a common measure of treatment effect that could be pooled across trials, and users could readily comprehend. This was not straightforward and in some cases we had to settle for best estimates, which might have caused some of the inconsistency between trial results in our analyses.</P>
<P>Most of the trials are small and few trials could be pooled for the primary outcomes because almost half of them stopped follow up at day 14, which limits the possibility of increasing statistical power through meta-analysis. Stopping follow up at day 14 in the assessment of drug efficacy against <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria is likely to underestimate the treatment failure rate (<LINK REF="REF-Stepniewska-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepniewska 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Variation in the risk of bias in the trials poses an important threat to the reliability of the findings from meta-analyses because of bias. The methodological quality of most randomized controlled trials in this area is open to question because insufficient information is reported to assess it. Despite longstanding empirical evidence of an association between inadequate allocation concealment and overestimation of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunz 2002</LINK>), this aspect of the design of randomized controlled trials is hardly ever clearly reported. Several potentially eligible trials reported as randomized turned out not to be when further information was obtained, so this could also be true of trials included in this review for which further information is not available.</P>
<P>In some of our analyses, notably total failure at day 28 in the comparison of AQ plus SP with SP alone, the number of participants lost to follow up has the potential to change observed differences in treatment effect from statistically significant to non-significant. This introduces uncertainty in the findings from individual trials and consequently from meta-analyses that include those trials.</P>
<P>The trials included in this review do not show evidence of serious adverse events with AQ plus SP or CQ plus SP drug combinations as used in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria (bearing in mind that half of the trials reported excluding participants at higher risk of sensitivity reactions to trial drugs). In this area, as is true of reports of randomized controlled trials generally, adverse event reporting is inadequate (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loke 2001</LINK>). The trials in this review did not include pregnant women and so do not provide evidence about the safety of these drugs in pregnancy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-07-22 10:33:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence base does not support firm conclusions about AQ plus SP or CQ plus SP combination therapy compared with SP alone. The main reasons are the small number of randomized controlled trials that followed participants for 28 days and uncertainty in relation to the risk of bias in the trials.</P>
<P>The available evidence suggests that AQ plus SP can achieve less treatment failure than SP, a benefit that might depend on the local existing level of parasite resistance to the individual drugs. The available randomized comparisons show no evidence of a significant reduction in treatment failure with CQ plus SP compared with SP alone.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-10 15:34:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Artemisinin combination therapy is currently recommended by the World Health Organization, but supply is not assured. Chloroquine resistance has reached such high levels in most settings that it is currently not a treatment option. If AQ plus SP is considered to be an option by policy makers, trials will help inform their decisions, although there is likely to be debate as to whether such trials should compare AQ plus SP with artemisinin combination therapies rather than with SP alone.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there needs to be more consistency and clarity in the reporting of outcome measures of effectiveness in trials of treatment for uncomplicated malaria. This is important to enable synthesis of the many disparate trials that malaria research generates. The effectiveness outcomes reported must be meaningful to users who need to make decisions about changing clinical practice or policy. Clinical trial design should always include systematic monitoring of adverse effects.</P>
<P>To help decision makers assess the evidence, trial reports should adhere to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Addendum, 2008: As monotherapy is no longer recommended by the World Health Organization for malaria treatment (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>), the authors do not intend to update this review.</P>

It duplicates the data in the 2002 paper, which is a report of the trial that included AQ plus SP and CQ plus SP. There was no SP-only comparator group in that trial</P>
