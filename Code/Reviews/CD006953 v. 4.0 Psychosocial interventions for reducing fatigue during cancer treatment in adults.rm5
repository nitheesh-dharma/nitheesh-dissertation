<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-06 12:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Martine M Goedendorp">
<P>Fatigue is a common symptom in cancer patients receiving active treatment. There are a limited number of reviews evaluating interventions for fatigue <I>during</I> active treatment, and they are restricted to patients with advanced cancer, or to patients during radiotherapy. To date there is no systematic review on psychosocial interventions for fatigue during cancer treatment.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-05-14 15:03:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Martine M Goedendorp">
<P>To evaluate if psychosocial interventions are effective in reducing fatigue in cancer patients receiving active treatment for cancer, and which types of psychosocial interventions are the most effective.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-04 10:33:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>In September 2008 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, and checked the reference lists.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-04 10:34:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included which evaluated psychosocial interventions in adult cancer patients during treatment, with fatigue as an outcome measure.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-23 14:46:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laila Tyrrell">
<P>Three review authors independently extracted data from the selected studies, and assessed the methodological quality using several quality rating scales and additional criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 10:35:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 3324 participants, and seven studies reported significant effects of the psychosocial intervention on fatigue. In three studies the effect was maintained at follow-up. The quality of the studies was generally moderate. Effect sizes varied between 0.17 to 1.07.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of interventions specific for fatigue was significantly higher (80%) compared to interventions not specific for fatigue (14%). In five studies the interventions were specifically focused on fatigue, with four being effective. The five interventions were brief, consisting of three individual sessions, provided by (oncology) nurses. In general, during these interventions participants were educated about fatigue, were taught in self-care or coping techniques, and learned activity management.</P>
<P>Of the remaining 22 studies only three were effective in reducing fatigue, and these interventions had a more general approach. These interventions were aimed at psychological distress, mood and physical symptoms, and varied strongly in duration and content.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-28 10:50:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>There is limited evidence that psychosocial interventions during cancer treatment are effective in reducing fatigue. At present, psychosocial interventions specifically for fatigue are a promising type of intervention. However, there is no solid evidence for the effectiveness of interventions not specific for fatigue. Most aspects of the included studies were heterogeneous, and therefore it could not be established which other types of interventions, or elements were essential in reducing fatigue.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 10:52:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Martine M Goedendorp">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-04 10:55:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>In recent years the treatment of cancer has changed, as more people are treated and an increasing number survive the disease. The primary focus of treatment for cancer is survival, but alongside this the management of symptoms and quality of life of patients are also becoming important. Fatigue is one of the symptoms most commonly reported by cancer patients and is gaining more recognition by oncologists. In addition to this scientific knowledge about fatigue in cancer patients is growing. Fatigue can be described in terms of perceived energy, mental capacity and psychological status (<LINK REF="REF-Cella-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cella 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Portenoy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Portenoy 1999</LINK>) and is therefore a multidimensional concept. Fatigue is sometimes seen as a continuum, ranging from tiredness to exhaustion (<LINK REF="REF-Ahlberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahlberg 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a term that is frequently used. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) defines CRF as a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion, related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning (<LINK REF="REF-NCCN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCN 2008</LINK>). Cancer patients can experience fatigue at different stages, for example, during cancer treatment or shortly after finishing treatment. Disease-free cancer patients can also experience fatigue. The prevalence of fatigue during cancer treatment ranges from 25% to 99% depending on the sample and on the type of instrument used to measure fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Servaes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Servaes 2002</LINK>). After successful cancer treatment, fatigue can still be a problem in up to 38% of cancer survivors and can persist for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Servaes-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Servaes 2002a</LINK>). It is important to note that the term CRF does not make a distinction between fatigue during cancer treatment, and fatigue after finishing treatment, but covers the whole period.</P>
<P>Efforts to manage fatigue should first focus on identifying and treating the comorbidities that may cause it, for example, anaemia or hypothyroidism. However, often no specific cause for fatigue can be identified in patients during cancer treatment, other than the cancer or the treatment itself. In these situations the management of fatigue usually involves multiple strategies. The strategies are often divided into pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Minton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minton 2008</LINK> reviewed drug therapy for the management of CRF and concluded that erythropoietin and darbopoetin, drugs that improve anaemia, are effective in managing CRF in patients who are anaemic as a result of chemotherapy. However, currently concerns are raised about the safety of these drugs as a series of recent, randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials reported adverse effects including enhanced tumour progression and increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khuri-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khuri 2007</LINK>). Methylphenidate was also effective, but more research is needed to confirm this. No data currently supports the use of paroxetine or progestational steroids for treatment of CRF (<LINK REF="REF-Minton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minton 2008</LINK>). This review included studies that recruited participants at any point of the cancer treatment spectrum. A Cochrane review is also in progress evaluating drugs for the treatment of fatigue in palliative care (<LINK REF="REF-Radbruch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radbruch 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are an increasing number of studies with exercise as a non-pharmacological intervention for cancer patients. Current literature suggests that exercise is likely to be beneficial, but the latest reviews draw conflicting conclusions about the role of exercise on managing fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2008</LINK>). Some reviews concluded that exercise had a positive effect on fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Conn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conn 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNeely-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeely 2006</LINK>) while others found no effect of exercise on fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knols-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knols 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevinson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevinson 2004</LINK>). In addition a Cochrane review investigating exercise for fatigue in cancer patients is also now published (<LINK REF="REF-Cramp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cramp 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>All reviews mentioned above were based on studies that included cancer patients during active treatment and disease-free survivors. In the review of <LINK REF="REF-Ahlberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahlberg 2003</LINK> a distinction was made between studies evaluating exercise during cancer treatment and after treatment, and concluded that in all studies the exercise groups had lower levels of fatigue. Contrary to this, the Cochrane review of <LINK REF="REF-Markes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markes 2006</LINK> concluded that exercise had no effect on fatigue in breast cancer patients during adjuvant therapy.</P>
<P>In recent years more studies have evaluated psychosocial interventions for the management of fatigue. The aim of a psychosocial intervention is to influence or change cognitions, emotions, behaviour, the social environment or a combination of these, with the ultimate goal to decrease fatigue.</P>
<P>Some reviews have included psychosocial interventions as a subgroup for managing fatigue in cancer patients and these interventions have been regarded as some of the more promising treatments, but further research was recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mock-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mock 2004</LINK>). A recent meta-analysis is less positive and concluded that there is limited support for the clinical use for psychological interventions for CRF (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 2007</LINK>). However, these reviews were based on studies that included patients during the whole spectrum of cancer treatment, as well as disease-free survivors.</P>
<P>There are only a limited number of reviews that evaluated interventions for fatigue in patients who received active treatment. These reviews were restricted to certain patient groups, for example to patients with advanced cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2002</LINK>), metastatic breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2004</LINK>), or to patients during radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jereczek_x002d_Fossa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jereczek-Fossa 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>To date, no systematic review has been published evaluating the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for fatigue during cancer treatment, which was the goal of this review. In this review we identified studies that tested the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in randomised controlled trials (RCT). First we described which psychosocial interventions were effective in reducing fatigue, and how strong the effects were by using effect sizes. Secondly, the quality of the studies was evaluated. Finally, the more promising psychosocial interventions for reducing fatigue during cancer treatment are discussed.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-06-19 10:16:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>The primary objective was to evaluate if psychosocial interventions are effective in reducing fatigue in cancer patients receiving active treatment for cancer.</P>
<P>The secondary objective was to consider which specific types of psychosocial interventions during cancer treatment are the most effective in reducing fatigue.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-04 11:00:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2008-11-04 10:58:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Only RCTs were included in this review. In addition, studies with small sample sizes (less than ten participants) were excluded, as this causes a lack of power to demonstrate the effect of an intervention. This means that when no significant effect of an intervention is found, this doesn't necessarily mean that the intervention is not effective at all. Finding no effect of the intervention can be explained by the small sample size of the studies. Thus the results of these studies can be misinterpreted easily.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 10:58:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Adult (those aged 16 years and above) cancer patients of either sex, receiving active treatment for cancer, with curative or palliative intention. This review focused only on patients receiving active cancer treatment and not on patients who finished cancer treatment. Although some cancer survivors, specifically breast cancer survivors, continue to receive hormone therapy for several years, in this review this group of survivors was considered as a group who finished the active period of receiving cancer treatment.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 11:00:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>A broad range of interventions were considered, such as psychotherapy, psycho-education and also interventions containing elements such as; education, cognitive restructuring and changing coping strategies. Interventions focusing on behavioural changes were included, for example; behavioural therapy, self-help or self-care. In addition other intervention types such as; support groups, relaxation, energy conservation, or stress management, and interventions combining psychosocial elements with physical activity were included. Both individual and group-focused interventions were included.</P>
<P>The psychosocial intervention needed to fulfil the following conditions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the interventions involved a systematic treatment consisting of a process between the patient and the person giving the intervention;</LI>
<LI>the interventions consisted of at least two contacts between the patient and the care provider who gave the intervention;</LI>
<LI>during the intervention a care provider gave the patient some kind of personal feedback concerning the changes they were trying to achieve, for example, in the first session a care provider could advise a patient to change their coping behaviour aiming to reduce fatigue, whilst discussing the progress of the patient and giving feedback on their behaviour in later sessions.</LI>
</UL>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-07-15 09:44:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laila Tyrrell">
<P>In the included studies, fatigue was at least one of the outcome measures. Studies were included when fatigue was measured with a questionnaire specifically designed to evaluate fatigue, or other instruments used by authors to evaluate fatigue. For example, fatigue was measured as part of a quality of life instrument, with a visual analogue scale (VAS), or as part of a symptom list and scored as &#8216;present&#8217; or &#8216;absent&#8217;.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of trials</HEADING>
<P>One review author (MMG) screened titles and abstracts and eliminated those clearly not relevant to this review. When the title and abstract did not provide all the information concerning the criteria, full paper copies were retrieved and screened. Authors of studies were contacted when additional information was required to assess if the studies met the criteria for inclusion. Three review authors (MMG, MG and GB) screened the remaining studies for their eligibility and discussed in accordance with the above defined criteria, if the studies were included or excluded. Disagreement about the selection of a trial was resolved by consensus. The review authors were already familiar with some of the studies, and therefore the relevant studies were not blinded for assessment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>Three review authors (MMG, MG and GB) independently assessed the methodological quality of the selected studies. The RCTs were evaluated using a Quality Rating Scale. This scale contained all the criteria of the Oxford Quality Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>), the Delphi list (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>) and additional criteria listed by <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>. The following aspects of the selected studies were scored to evaluate the methodological quality:</P>
<UL>
<LI>random assignment;</LI>
<LI>losses to follow-up;</LI>
<LI>blind analysis;</LI>
<LI>intention-to-treat analysis;</LI>
<LI>participants adherence;</LI>
<LI>adverse effects of the intervention;</LI>
<LI>eligibility criteria;</LI>
<LI>follow-up measurements;</LI>
<LI>power calculation;</LI>
<LI>possible differences between the treatment group and the control group, and in the timing of the assessments;</LI>
<LI>concealed allocation;</LI>
<LI>contamination.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Concealment of allocation was evaluated using the criteria defined in The Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). When nothing was described about concealment of allocation in the studies, concealed allocation was evaluated as &#8216;unclear&#8217;. To investigate the effectiveness of an intervention it is important to minimize contamination. Contamination means that patients in the control group get informed about the intervention and its content, and subsequently use this information. When this happens the effect of the intervention itself is harder to demonstrate. To minimize contamination it is advisable to avoid contact between patients in the control condition, and care providers giving the intervention, or other staff informed about the intervention. </P>
<P>Additional aspects were scored to evaluate the quality of the intervention:</P>
<UL>
<LI>how many care providers gave the intervention;</LI>
<LI>if care providers were trained;</LI>
<LI>if care providers were supervised;</LI>
<LI>if an intervention protocol was used;</LI>
<LI>if an integrity check was described.</LI>

<P>In most quality rating scales blinding is evaluated on several levels, such as blinding of patients and care providers. These scales are often used to test the quality of placebo-controlled medication studies. However, the nature of RCTs testing psychosocial interventions is different. In these trials it is nearly impossible to blind the patients to the intervention they were assigned to. In addition it is also impossible to blind the care providers to the intervention they are giving to the patients. Thus, blinding of patients and care providers were not scored in the Quality Rating Scale.</P>
<P>The three review authors met to discuss all items of the Quality Rating Scale of the studies, and to reach a final quality score by consensus. The total score of the Quality Rating Scale varied between one and 25 and was divided into three categories. When the total score was between one and nine, the quality was rated as poor, when between ten and 17 as moderate, and when between 18 and 25 as good.</P>

<P>A narrative overview of the included RCTs was provided in this review. We assessed which interventions during cancer treatment were effective in reducing fatigue, and described explanations for the effectiveness where possible. To determine the magnitude of the effect, effect sizes were calculated of the studies that were effective in reducing fatigue. The size of the effect is calculated in a standardized way, and therefore the effect sizes across the various studies can be compared. The effect sizes were calculated by using the means and standard deviations of two groups (experimental group and control group) of the post-intervention or follow-up measurement, in the following way:</P>
<P>Effect size = <I>M</I>
<SUB>1</SUB> - <I>M</I>
<SUB>2</SUB>/&#963;<SUB>pooled</SUB>
</P>
<P>where &#963;<SUB>pooled</SUB> = &#8730;[(&#963; <SUB>1</SUB>²+ &#963; <SUB>2</SUB>²)/2]</P>
<P>As the characteristics of the included studies, the instruments, and the interventions were very diverse, we concluded that a meta-analysis or a subgroup analysis was not sensible or appropriate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>The search of the electronic databases retrieved 2210 publications. After eliminating the duplicates 1753 publications were identified for further consideration. After screening the titles and electronic available abstracts 1668 publications were excluded. Reasons for excluding publications were the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>studies were no intervention studies, for example studies were reviews, or comments;</LI>
<LI>studies evaluated no psychosocial interventions, for example medical treatments, exercise, or massage;</LI>
<LI>studies were no RCTs, for example studies did not have a control group, or participants were not randomised;</LI>
<LI>studies did not focus on cancer patients or only a part of the sample were cancer patients;</LI>
<LI>studies evaluated interventions in cancer patients after finishing cancer treatment;</LI>
<LI>fatigue was not assessed as an outcome measure.</LI>
</UL>
<P>After this initial screening, the full-text articles were retrieved of the remaining 85 potential studies. From these full-text articles 56 studies were excluded leaving 29 studies to review. These 56 studies were excluded for the following reasons; 15 studies were excluded because the interventions were given to participants after finishing cancer treatment. One study was excluded because most participants did not receive cancer treatment during the intervention. Five studies did not describe if participants received cancer treatment during the intervention. One study focused on participants receiving colorectal surgery and did not only include cancer patients, but also patients with other types of diseases. Six studies were not RCTs. Two studies had less than ten participants in each condition. In four studies fatigue was not measured and three studies did not describe separate results on fatigue. Nineteen studies identified did not include psychosocial interventions. In two studies the intervention was mainly focused on changing exercise behaviour. In three studies nutritional behaviour was the focus of the intervention and one focused on medication. In 13 studies the interventions were not psychosocial interventions according to our definition described in 'Types of intervention'. The interventions did not consist of a systematic process between the patient and the person giving the intervention.

<P>In most studies the intervention was administered by nurses (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Wit-1997" TYPE="STUDY">de Wit 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faithfull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faithfull 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawzy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Given-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Given 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Godino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Godino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rawl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rawl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>). In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2008</LINK> an experienced instructor gave medical qigong. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Moadel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moadel 2007</LINK> the yoga instructor was also an oncologist. In the remaining studies the intervention was administered by social workers (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaston_x002d_Johansson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gaston-Johansson 2000</LINK>), (psycho)therapists (<LINK REF="STD-Edelman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>), psychologists (<LINK REF="STD-Savard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Savard 2006</LINK>), or graduate students (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Decker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Decker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2000</LINK>).

In seven studies there was one care provider giving the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moadel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moadel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rawl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rawl 2002</LINK>). In three studies it was unclear how many care providers gave the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Faithfull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faithfull 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawzy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaston_x002d_Johansson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gaston-Johansson 2000</LINK>), but it may have been only one. In all other studies more than one care provider gave the intervention.</P>
<P>In ten studies the intervention was given in groups (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Classen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moadel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moadel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>), in the remaining studies the intervention was given individually. The individual sessions were mostly face-to-face, but seven were exceptions. In the studies of Sandgren (<LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2003</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK> the participants received only telephone sessions. Three studies combined face-to-face contact and telephone calls in the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-de-Wit-1997" TYPE="STUDY">de Wit 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Given-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Given 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>). In one study participants received individual writing instructions, for several occasions (<LINK REF="STD-de-Moor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Moor 2002</LINK>). The instructions stimulated participants to write about their thoughts, feelings and consequences on their lives. We decided to include this study as change of cognitions and behaviour were the focus of the intervention.</P>
<P>In 14 studies additional information materials were given to the participants (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Classen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Wit-1997" TYPE="STUDY">de Wit 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Decker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Decker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faithfull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faithfull 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaston_x002d_Johansson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gaston-Johansson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Godino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Godino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moadel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moadel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Duration</HEADING>
<P>The number of sessions was described in 22 studies, but there was a lot of variation. Among these studies the number of sessions varied from two to 12, with a median of six sessions. In two studies the number of sessions was not fixed for participants (<LINK REF="STD-Moadel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moadel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2008</LINK>). In the remaining three studies the intervention consisted of weekly 90 minute sessions, for the duration of at least one year, but the actual number of sessions was not given. The number of sessions could be estimated to be around 50 (<LINK REF="STD-Classen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four studies failed to describe the duration of each session (<LINK REF="STD-Edelman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaston_x002d_Johansson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gaston-Johansson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Godino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Godino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK>). Among the remaining 23 studies the duration of the sessions varied from ten minutes to three hours. The most common duration was 30 minutes for individual sessions and 90 minutes for group sessions.</P>
<P>The duration of the full intervention was described in 20 studies or could be estimated. The total duration of the interventions varied from two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>) to 20 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Edelman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Given-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Given 2002</LINK>), with three exceptions having a duration of at least one year (<LINK REF="STD-Classen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>). From six studies the actual length of the intervention was not clear, but depended on the cancer treatment participants had received. For example the sessions took place on specific points in patients&#8217; treatment regimes (<LINK REF="STD-Faithfull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faithfull 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaston_x002d_Johansson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gaston-Johansson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Godino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Godino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK>), took place during patients&#8217; clinic visits (<LINK REF="STD-Fawzy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzy 1995</LINK>), or depended on the duration of the hospital admission (<LINK REF="STD-de-Wit-1997" TYPE="STUDY">de Wit 1997</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Content</HEADING>
<P>In only five studies the intervention was specifically focused on fatigue (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Godino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Godino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>). All the other interventions focused on other aspects. Eight interventions aimed to influence depression (<LINK REF="STD-Savard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Savard 2006</LINK>), depression and anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 2007</LINK>), or mood states in general (<LINK REF="STD-Classen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Moor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Moor 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Decker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Decker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>). Some interventions focused on symptoms, such as pain (<LINK REF="STD-de-Wit-1997" TYPE="STUDY">de Wit 1997</LINK>), or on symptoms and side-effects in general (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faithfull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faithfull 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaston_x002d_Johansson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gaston-Johansson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Given-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Given 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rawl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rawl 2002</LINK>). Interventions also focused on distress (<LINK REF="STD-Classen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Moor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Moor 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawzy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2003</LINK>) and quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faithfull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faithfull 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moadel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moadel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The elements of the intervention varied among the studies. Some interventions were based on one or two elements, while others used multiple techniques. Four studies focused on the expression of emotions (<LINK REF="STD-de-Moor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Moor 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2003</LINK>), on providing social support (<LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>), or a combination of these two (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>). Yoga was evaluated in two studies, with elements such as meditation, and physical stretching. Yoga also falls within complementary medicine, but as general discussion and relaxation were also parts of the intervention, it was decided to include these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Moadel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moadel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2008</LINK>). All other studies used a combination of several elements in the intervention. Teaching, giving patients information and education on cancer and treatment is often used as one of the elements. In two studies exercise was actually performed (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2006</LINK>), but activities were more often one of the topics, for example activity management, or energy conservation. Relaxation or guided imagery were sometimes used as techniques to manage stress. Problem solving or teaching patients coping strategies were also elements of several interventions. In four studies cognitive (behavioural) therapy was the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Savard 2006</LINK>), or psychotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Control group</HEADING>
<P>In 18 studies participants in the control group did not receive the intervention, but received standard care and standard information (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berglund-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Wit-1997" TYPE="STUDY">de Wit 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Decker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Decker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawzy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaston_x002d_Johansson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gaston-Johansson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Given-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Given 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Godino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Godino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rawl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rawl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2003</LINK>). In the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Savard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Savard 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moadel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moadel 2007</LINK> participants in the control group were assigned to a waiting list. One study did not specify the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>). In six studies the control condition involved more than standard care. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Classen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2001</LINK> participants were provided with self-directed education materials. In four studies participants in the control group received an intervention with the same number and duration of sessions, but received different information. In the first study the control condition comprised supportive discussion alone (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1989</LINK>). In the second study participants in the control group received information on nutrition (<LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>). In the third study the control condition was a 'neutral writing' condition (<LINK REF="STD-de-Moor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Moor 2002</LINK>). In the fourth study participants received general information on living with cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>). In one study participants in the control group had more moments of contact than in the intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Faithfull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faithfull 2001</LINK>). Participants in the control group received routine ten minute weekly appointments for patients with bladder cancer, or ten minute two-weekly appointments for patients with prostate cancer, led by physicians.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Studies were only included when they were RCTs. Thus, all the studies had a baseline assessment and a post-intervention assessment. However, the total number of assessments varied between two and six assessments, with a median of three. Studies with more than two measurements, also assessed participants during the intervention, or had a follow-up measurement. Twelve studies had one or more follow-up measurements (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Moor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Moor 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Wit-1997" TYPE="STUDY">de Wit 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawzy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>), and ten studies assessed participants once or more during the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Classen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaston_x002d_Johansson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gaston-Johansson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Given-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Given 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Godino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Godino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rawl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rawl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>The timing of the measurements varied a lot across the studies. In most studies participants were assessed immediately or within a few days after the intervention was completed. In two studies the time between the end of the intervention and the assessment of participants was longer; one month (<LINK REF="STD-Rawl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rawl 2002</LINK>) and six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Fawzy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzy 1995</LINK>) after the intervention. The actual time between the end of the intervention and the assessment was not obvious in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faithfull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faithfull 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>). In two of these studies the actual time between the end of the intervention and the follow-up assessment was also unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faithfull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faithfull 2001</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK> the post- and follow-up assessment depended on the treatment regimes, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Five studies had a short period between the post-intervention assessment and the follow-up, of four weeks or less (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Moor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Moor 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Wit-1997" TYPE="STUDY">de Wit 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>).

<P>Most studies used one instrument to measure fatigue, but six studies used two to four instruments (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faithfull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faithfull 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> &#8216;Outcomes&#8217;). Five instruments were used in multiple trials. The most frequently used instrument was the POMS sub-scale fatigue/inertia, and was used in 12 studies to measure fatigue (<LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Classen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Moor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Moor 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Decker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Decker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edelman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edelman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fawzy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>).

All other instruments were only used in a single study.</P>
<P>A minority of the studies, only five, used specific questionnaires designed to measure fatigue, such as the MFI, SCFS, GFS, FSI, PFS. The most frequently used instruments were used to measure mood states, or quality of life. Fatigue in these instruments was measured with a sub-scale, or with only one item.</P>

A majority of the studies scored one or two on the Oxford Quality Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) within the range of one to five.

On the Delphi List (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>) seven studies scored above three (<LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaston_x002d_Johansson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gaston-Johansson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>) and none of these were published before the year 2000. Looking at the scores on internal validity as suggested by <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>, only one study had a good evaluation with a score of five (<LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>). All other studies scored lower than five.</P>
<P>The majority of the studies had a moderate methodological quality, varying between ten and 17. In three studies the quality was graded a nine, being regarded as poor (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faithfull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faithfull 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>). The methodological quality of the study of <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK> was rated as 18, being good.</P>
<P>One of the items of the Quality Rating Scale was concealment of allocation and the evaluation is described in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. Eight studies suggested that concealed allocation was used (<LINK REF="STD-Godino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Godino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Savard 2006</LINK>) and in five studies the allocation was concealed adequately (<LINK REF="STD-Faithfull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faithfull 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rawl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rawl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>), with one study changing the procedure during recruitment. In the remaining studies it was not described which procedure was used to conceal allocation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK> was the only study in which an intention-to-treat analysis was used. Two other studies described that intention-to-treat analysis was used, however, this remained unclear from the described analysis and results (<LINK REF="STD-Berglund-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berglund 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>). In most studies the analysis was performed with participants who completed all assessments.</P>
<P>Three studies explicitly described that actions were taken to prevent contamination. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Sandgren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandgren 2003</LINK> nurses gave both interventions, but the authors attempted to avoid contamination by informing the nurses about the risks of contamination. In two other studies it was explicitly mentioned that the persons administering the intervention were different from the persons in contact with participants in the control condition (<LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>). In the study that evaluated medical qigong, patients in the control group were asked to refrain from joining an outside qigong class (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>An important aspect when evaluating the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions is the adherence of patients, however, in only 12 studies this was described. In eight studies the attendance of participants joining the sessions was described (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Classen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Moor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Moor 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Wit-1997" TYPE="STUDY">de Wit 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moadel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moadel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>) and in four studies adherence was assessed in other ways. Two studies measured if participants used the behaviours learned during the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>). Two studies asked participants if they read the provided brochures (<LINK REF="STD-de-Wit-1997" TYPE="STUDY">de Wit 1997</LINK>), or practiced at home (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 11:56:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Seven of the included studies reported a significant effect of the interventions on fatigue at a 0.05 level. The seven studies and their results are briefly described in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>: Effective studies. The effect sizes varied between 0.17 (<LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>) and 1.07 (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>). The smallest effect size was found in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>, but this could be due to the use of intention-to-treat analysis not applied in other studies. In two studies it was not possible to obtain all relevant data to calculate effect sizes (<LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the seven studies which found a significant effect of the interventions on fatigue, three found significant time-by-group interaction effects at follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>) on at least one instrument that measured fatigue. In the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK> the follow-up period was short, up to one month. The follow-up period in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK> was longer, lasting four months. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK> participants were measured additionally at nine months after recruitment. Of these seven studies two studies found a significant effect immediately post-intervention, but these results were not maintained at follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>). In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK> significant results were found post-intervention, but no follow-up assessment was described. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK> found a significant effect on fatigue comparing the post-intervention scores with a t-test without controlling for baseline differences. No follow-up measurement was carried out. The use of a t-test was justified in this study as baseline fatigue scores of the control and the intervention group were not significantly different. These seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>) are further referred to as the 'effective' studies.</P>
<P>The remaining 20 included studies were regarded as not effective. In 17 studies no significant effects of the intervention on fatigue were found, although in four of these 17 studies the authors concluded that the results were in the expected direction (<LINK REF="STD-Given-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Given 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2008</LINK>) or significant on a 0.1 level (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1989</LINK>). Three of the 20 studies found a significant effect of the intervention when measured with a t-test, immediately post-intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Decker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Decker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaston_x002d_Johansson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gaston-Johansson 2000</LINK>) or at follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Fawzy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzy 1995</LINK>). In the first study, <LINK REF="STD-Gaston_x002d_Johansson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gaston-Johansson 2000</LINK> reported that the difference between the intervention group and control group disappeared after controlling for demographic variables and fatigue at baseline. In the second study of <LINK REF="STD-Decker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Decker 1992</LINK> a statistically significant difference in the pre- versus post-test scores was found, where control patients became more fatigued. However, no significant results on treatment by repeated measures interaction were found on fatigue. In addition, when looking at the results fatigue scores were higher in the experimental group compared to the control group, at baseline and post-intervention. In the third study, <LINK REF="STD-Fawzy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fawzy 1995</LINK> found significant results on fatigue on the within-group analysis and the between-group analysis, but reported no significant result of the analysis of covariance on fatigue. Thus, using a t-test to evaluate the intervention was not justified in the last three studies and therefore we concluded that in 20 studies the intervention was not effective for fatigue.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparing effective and non-effective interventions for fatigue</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the seven effective studies did not differ from the non-effective studies (P = 0.231). The mean quality score of the effective studies was 14.0 (s.d. 3.6) compared to 12.2 (s.d. 2.0) of the non-effective studies. No difference was found in the mean number of participants (P = 0.598). The mean number of participants of the effective studies was 138 (s.d. 115) compared to 118 (s.d. 78) of the non-effective studies.</P>
<P>The psychosocial interventions could be distinguished into interventions specific for fatigue and interventions not specific for fatigue. The effectiveness of interventions specific for fatigue was significantly higher at 80% (four out of five) compared to interventions not specific for fatigue at 14% (three out of 22) (P &lt; 0.01). Two studies were specific interventions for pain (<LINK REF="STD-de-Wit-1997" TYPE="STUDY">de Wit 1997</LINK>), and depression (<LINK REF="STD-Savard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Savard 2006</LINK>), but were not effective for fatigue. The other interventions not specific for fatigue had a more general approach and focused on distress, mood states, quality of life, or symptoms or side effects in general. Of these 20 studies, three studies were effective in reducing fatigue (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>The five specific interventions for fatigue were short interventions, consisting of three individual sessions with a duration varying between ten and 60 minutes. These interventions were to a large extent based on the same elements. In all interventions participants were; 1) educated about fatigue; 2) taught in self-care or coping techniques; 3) taught activity management, learning to balance between activities and rest. In addition to these elements <LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK> emphasised emotional support. In these five studies (oncology) nurses administered the interventions and were trained. All studies included participants with various malignancies and stages of cancer. In the study described by <LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>, the first author was also the nurse administering the intervention. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Godino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Godino 2006</LINK> was the only intervention specific for fatigue, that was not effective. The most obvious difference between this study and the effective studies is the smaller number of participants. <LINK REF="STD-Godino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Godino 2006</LINK> randomised 40 participants, while the sample size of the effective studies was between 60 and nearly 400 participants.</P>
<P>The three effective studies not specific for fatigue were longer interventions compared to the interventions specific for fatigue. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK> consisted of nine weekly sessions of 90 minutes. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK> consisted of ten weekly 30 minute sessions. The intervention in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK> lasted at least a year, in which participants met weekly for 90 minutes. The duration of these three interventions fall within the range of all other interventions that were not specific for fatigue, varying between four weeks and a year. The content of these three interventions varied among each other. The intervention groups in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK> was primarily supportive and aimed to benefit patients psychologically. The intervention of <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK> was individual unstructured supportive psychotherapy designed to reduce patients emotional distress and physical symptoms, regarding treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK> studied the effects of two group interventions on psychological distress and physical symptoms. The first was a cognitive behaviour group intervention and the second consisted of relaxation and guided imagery. Only the relaxation and guided imagery intervention appeared to be effective on fatigue. In the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK> the first authors were also the only care provider giving the intervention. The effectiveness of the three studies probably couldn't be explained by a larger sample size or by a better quality. The quality scores of the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK> ranged between nine and 13, while the quality score of the non-effective studies not specific for fatigue ranged from nine to 17. Thus the quality scores were within the range of the effective studies not specific for fatigue, and even a bit lower. The number of participants of the three effective studies ranged between 86 and 114, and was within the range of 30 to 313 of the non-effective studies not specific for fatigue.</P>

<P>The aim of this review was to provide an overview of psychosocial interventions for fatigue during cancer treatment, and to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions. In our search 27 psychosocial interventions were found, in which the effect on fatigue was tested in a RCT. The sample size of the 27 included studies varied between 30 and 396, with a total of 3324 participants. The quality was generally evaluated as moderate.</P>
<P>In general, there is limited evidence that psychosocial interventions during treatment are effective in reducing fatigue in cancer patients. In only seven studies were the psychosocial interventions effective in reducing fatigue. In only three studies was the effect of the intervention on fatigue maintained during the follow-up period (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>). The quality and the mean number of participants of the effective studies did not differ from the non-effective studies. The effect sizes of the effective studies were generally medium (<LINK REF="REF-Field-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 2005</LINK>). In the studies with a large effect size, the intervention was provided by only one care provider, also being the first author (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall the 27 studies were very heterogeneous on most aspects of the studies, on patient and treatment characteristics, types of interventions, and outcome measures. This made it difficult to establish if certain types of intervention or elements could be essential for reducing fatigue. Attempts were made to draw additional conclusions about certain types of interventions or subgroups of patients. For example a lot of studies were carried out with only breast cancer patients, but these studies were also too heterogeneous to draw additional conclusions about interventions for this specific group. Psychosocial interventions for patients with prostate cancer or other common types of cancer, are less often tested in RCTs, as also previously established (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 2007</LINK>). However, it was possible to distinguish interventions that were specifically designed to treat fatigue during cancer treatment, and interventions not specific for fatigue. </P>
<P>This review showed that the effectiveness of interventions specific for fatigue was significantly higher than interventions not specific for fatigue. To conclude, at present psychosocial interventions specifically for fatigue is the more promising type of intervention for reducing fatigue during cancer treatment. However, there is currently no solid evidence for the effectiveness of interventions not specific for fatigue.</P>
<P>Of the five interventions specific for fatigue, four were effective in reducing fatigue during cancer treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>). In two studies the effects were maintained in the follow-up period that lasted up to a month (<LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barsevick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsevick 2004</LINK>). One study was not effective (<LINK REF="STD-Godino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Godino 2006</LINK>), but the small sample size might be an explanation why no significant result was found.</P>
<P>It seems promising that four out of five interventions specifically designed for fatigue were effective, but the stability of the evidence is questionable for three reasons. First, in two studies there was only an immediate effect on fatigue after the intervention, but the effect disappeared at follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Yates-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2005</LINK>), or no follow-up assessment was performed (<LINK REF="STD-Ream-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ream 2006</LINK>). Second, when more than one instrument was used to assess fatigue, the effects were not visible on all instruments. Third, in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Armes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Armes 2007</LINK> the intervention was provided by only one care giver, also being the first author.</P>
<P>Looking at the characteristics of the five studies that evaluated interventions specifically designed to treat fatigue, revealed two obvious features. Firstly, these studies included patients with various malignancies and stages of cancer. Secondly, these interventions were brief, consisting of three sessions lasting up to 60 minutes each, and containing to a large extent the same elements. In all interventions participants were; 1) educated about fatigue; 2) taught in self-care or coping techniques; 3) taught about activity management, learning to balance between activities and rest. Based on this limited number of five studies it could not be established which format or elements of an intervention were essential for reducing fatigue. For example, it could not be established if sessions should be based on face-to-face contact, or if telephone sessions might be an alternative.</P>
<P>Three out of 22 psychosocial interventions not specially designed to manage fatigue were effective in reducing fatigue during cancer treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>). In one study the effect on fatigue was maintained during the four month follow-up period. These three interventions had a more general approach aimed at psychological distress, mood and physical symptoms. There is no obvious reason why these three interventions were effective, while 19 other studies were not. No explanation could be found in the sample size, the quality of the studies or characteristics of the interventions.</P>
<P>There are several reasons that support the conclusion that interventions with a general approach are rarely effective. First, in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Forester-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Forester 1985</LINK> the first author was also the care provider administering the intervention. Second, in only one study the effect was maintained at follow-up. In addition, one of these three studies was an early study of <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK> and was replicated in later studies (<LINK REF="STD-Classen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Classen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 2001</LINK>). However, the effect on fatigue demonstrated by <LINK REF="STD-Spiegel-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Spiegel 1981</LINK>, was not confirmed in the later two studies.</P>
<P>Interventions that did not focus on fatigue, for example interventions that aimed to reduce depression or pain, showed that fatigue did not decrease with depression or pain, and therefore we can conclude that these interventions are not effective for reducing fatigue.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitation of the studies</HEADING>
<P>During the evaluation of the included studies several shortcomings were noticed. In most studies it was difficult to get a clear picture of the complete cancer treatment participants received, such as types of treatments and total duration. As a result it also remained unclear when during cancer treatment the assessments and the sessions took place. Often it was uncertain if participants continued with cancer treatment after the intervention.</P>
<P>The evaluation of the quality of the included studies revealed additional limitations. In the majority of the studies it was not described if a procedure was used to conceal allocation, not even in the most recent publications. In addition, only one study applied an intention-to-treat analysis. Recommendations for improving the quality of RCTs are provided in the CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several methodological elements of the psychosocial intervention studies could be improved. For example, avoiding the risk of contamination, and testing the adherence of participants. Training the care providers, supervising them, and applying an integrity check would help improve an intervention study.</P>
<P>In some studies the intervention was provided by only one care provider also being the author, but there might be a conflict of interest in performing the intervention at the one hand, and publishing the results at the other. The care provider might work hard to get positive outcomes, resulting in a large effect size. Despite the good intentions of realising a good intervention, with only one practising care provider it could be difficult to transfer the intervention to others, and to replicate the study. Thus it is recommended that the intervention should be given to participants by more than one person.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitation of the review</HEADING>
<P>A limitation of this review is that RCTs were excluded when it was unclear if cancer patients were receiving treatment at the time of the intervention. To clarify this issue we contacted the experts and researchers who performed the studies. In addition the possibility remains that trials with negative results might not have been published at all, and therefore are missed during our search. Although we are unaware that relevant studies were missed, the possibility that a relevant study exists cannot be ruled out.</P>

<P>When cancer patients experience fatigue during cancer treatment there are several options to treat fatigue. In clinical practice an intervention with a general approach is usually chosen when intervening for fatigue, although at present there is no solid evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions not specific for fatigue. This review showed that interventions with a general approach were rarely effective in reducing fatigue, and these interventions focused on psychological distress, mood and physical symptoms. When other types of psychosocial intervention are offered to cancer patients, for example with the aim of reducing depression or pain, it is not likely that symptoms of fatigue automatically decrease with depression or pain.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of psychosocial interventions specifically designed to treat fatigue was significantly higher than interventions not specific for fatigue, and is currently the more promising type of intervention for reducing fatigue during cancer treatment. The interventions specific for fatigue contained, to a large extent, the same elements. In all interventions patients were: 1) educated about fatigue; 2) taught in self-care or coping techniques; 3) taught activity management, learning to balance between activities and rest. However, currently with only a limited number of studies it could not be established which format or elements are essential to reduce fatigue during cancer treatment.</P>
<P>It is important to note that psychosocial interventions during active cancer treatment were the focus of this review. Our results are therefore not applicable to cancer patients who have completed their cancer treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-04 12:04:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>This review showed that there is limited support for psychosocial interventions for fatigue during cancer treatment. At present the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions specifically designed to treat fatigue is high, but there is no solid evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions not specific for fatigue.</P>
<P>As the RCTs were very heterogeneous in nature, and the number of psychosocial interventions specific for fatigue were limited, there are still some questions that need to be answered. First, it is important to know why some psychosocial interventions work, and therefore interventions should preferably be based on a theory or model. To find essential components that are necessary to reduce fatigue it is advisable to assess if factors that are expected to reduce fatigue also change during the intervention. In addition, the optimal duration of the intervention needs to be established, and the best method to provide the intervention. For example, it is unclear if telephone or face-to-face sessions are equally effective. Also there are no RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness of group interventions specific for fatigue.</P>
<P>As the included studies were very heterogeneous it was not possible to identify high risk groups. Thus, the question remains whether patients with specific malignancies, or patients receiving specific types of treatments are at risk of becoming more fatigued, although some studies point in that direction (<LINK REF="REF-Jereczek_x002d_Fossa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jereczek-Fossa 2002</LINK>). Some studies found that the prevalence of fatigue depended on the diagnosis. For example, patients with prostate carcinoma reported the least severe fatigue during radiotherapy and patients with lung, alimentary, and head and neck carcinoma reported the most severe fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Hickok-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickok 2005a</LINK>). Levels of fatigue also depended on diagnosis in patients receiving chemotherapy. In a group of cancer patients receiving cytotoxic treatment, lung and breast cancer patients experienced the highest degree of fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Hartvig-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartvig 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are also indications that the prevalence of fatigue depends on the type of treatment cancer patients receive. For example, breast cancer patients who had a mastectomy operation were more fatigued than women who underwent a lumpectomy. Receiving radiotherapy supplementary to chemotherapy led to an increase in fatigue in women with breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jong 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition the course of fatigue appears to depend on the type of treatment cancer patients receive. For example, the course of fatigue in patients receiving chemotherapy seems to be different from the course of fatigue in patients receiving radiotherapy. After the start of chemotherapy the prevalence of fatigue increases, remaining stable during chemotherapy treatment (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jong 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 1999</LINK>). During radiotherapy the occurrence of fatigue increases with the number of weeks patients are treated with radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Hickok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickok 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hickok-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickok 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>If high risk groups can be identified it is important to know if these groups need adapted psychosocial interventions. In current guidelines for CRF, interventions for patients on active treatment are distinguished from interventions for patients at the end of life (<LINK REF="REF-NCCN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCN 2008</LINK>) although, the effectiveness of interventions specific for fatigue in this sample still needs to be demonstrated.</P>

<P>RCT. Originally starting with minimization on basis of age, sex, site, and stage of cancer, and HADS scores. After 10 patients were allocated, simple random permuted block randomization was implemented. Sixty participants were randomized, 30 to both groups, the final sample size was 55. Of the experimental group (EG) 28 completed baseline questionnaires (T0 = cycle 3 of CT), 21 participants completed T1 assessment (end of cytotoxic treatment), 22 participants completed T2 assessment (4 weeks after the end of cytotoxic treatment), and 17 participants completed T3 assessment (9 months after recruitment). Of the control group (CG) 27 participants completed T0, 16 completed T1, 22 completed T2, 19 completed T3. Non response rate varied across assessment from 16 to 5.

<P>Participants in the treatment group, the size ranging from 3 to 15, met weekly for 90-minute sessions. The intended duration of treatment was 1 year. The therapy sessions were facilitated by 2 therapists. Therapists included a psychiatrist, psychologists, and social workers. The supportive-expressive therapy model involved the creation of a supportive environment in which participants were encouraged to confront their problems, strengthen their relationships, and find enhanced meaning in their lives. Psycho education was provided in a similar fashion, with group members sharing knowledge they gathered about the illness and related issues. The intervention was unstructured, neither coping strategies nor psycho education was taught in a didactic manner. Each session ended with a self-hypnosis exercise to help participants manage stress and deal with pain. Participants were encouraged to use this exercise at home. All participants (also from the control group) were offered self-directed education materials. They were given a list of materials to select from and to take home on loan.

<P>Both interventions occupied 6 weekly, 2-hour sessions with groups from 7 to 10 participants and a single leader. The psycho educational intervention included in addition to supportive discussions, education in coping skills. The training comprised two sessions of relaxation, two sessions on the use of positive mental imagery and one session each centred around goal-setting and on general lifestyle management. Where coping techniques were taught, they were practised first in the group after which participants were asked to continue the practice at home with the aid of a workbook and two audiotapes. These groups were conducted by the first author, at that time a graduate student in clinical psychology. The control intervention consisted of supportive discussion, ventilation of feelings, general problem solving and information sharing. The leader was the second author, a senior nurse.</P>

<P>Three nurses gave the Pain Education Program (PEP). The PEP consists of three components:<BR/>1) Enhancing patients' knowledge about pain and pain treatment. A patient was instructed about a specific pain topic only when that topic was assessed as applicable to the patient, and only when the patient's knowledge about pain and pain treatment was assessed as insufficient. This tailored information was provided on a one-to-one setting lasting between 30 and 60 minutes. The verbal instruction was accompanied by a pain brochure consisted of two parts: (A) a section with general information aimed at all cancer pain patients, and (B) a loose-leaf part given to patients when applicable, including supplementary sheets with information about different cancer pain treatments.<BR/>2) Participants were instructed on how to register their Present Pain Intensity twice daily in a pain diary for a period of 2 months. In addition, participants were instructed to document changes on type of pain and use of (non-)pharmacological pain treatment.<BR/>3) Stimulating patients' help-seeking behavior. Participants were instructed on how to use simple non-pharmacological pain management techniques, such as cold, heat, relaxation, and massage, at home when pain relief was insufficient. They were encouraged to contact health care providers if necessary. Besides the instruction provided in the hospital, participants were called at home at 3 and 7 days post-discharge by the same nurse to determine whether the instruction was fully understood, and to offer the opportunity to ask questions.

Women were encouraged to interact with each other and to support each other outside of the group sessions. Participants were given the opportunity and support to speak about the effects of the illness, its treatment, and changes in their self-image, roles, and relationships with family members, friends, coworkers, health care providers, and others. The women also discussed the life-altering nature of the illness and strategies for coping and communicating. They were asked to attend the group sessions for at least one year. A monthly 90-minute session was provided for family and friends. Women in the control arm did not participate in a support group.

<P>RCT: Baseline assessments were completed at the first treatment visit (week1) (53 of the intervention group (IG) and 57 of the control group (CG)). The first follow-up assessment (t2) was conducted at the third course of chemotherapy (CT) (week 7-9) (50 of IG and 54 of CG). The second follow-up (t3) was conducted at the fourth course of CT or for participants receiving radiotherapy (RT) assessment was conducted on the first day of RT (week10-13) (50 of IG and 50 of CG). The third follow-up (t4) was conducted at the fifth course of CT or for participants receiving radiotherapy (RT) assessment was conducted on the first day of RT. Participants receiving RT at t3, assessment was conducted two weeks after RT (week 13-21) (49 of IG and 48 of CG).</P>

<P>The psycho educational intervention, given by an oncology nurse (2), aimed to improve patients knowledge and skills in performing self-care behaviours to minimize fatigue, based on Green's PRECEDE model of health behaviours. Effective strategies to reduce fatigue included promoting: sleep and rest, a balance between activity and exercise, conserving energy, and restorative activities. The first session, a face to face contact of 20 minutes, focused on the participants specific needs and to target influencing these factors. The second and third session, a telephone call of 10 minutes, were aimed to review the patients' fatigue management plan, and reinforcement. The intervention was given at the start of the second cycle of chemotherapy with one week between each session. In addition patients received a booklet with specific information. Participants in the control group received general cancer education sessions equivalent in number and timing and also given by the same oncology nurses. The education focused on talking about general issues associated with living with cancer. Participants also received a booklet with general information.</P>
