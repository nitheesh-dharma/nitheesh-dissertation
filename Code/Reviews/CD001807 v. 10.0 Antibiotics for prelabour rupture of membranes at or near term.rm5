<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-10-27 06:46:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Sometimes the protective bag of fluid around an unborn baby (the membranes) break when the baby is due without the onset of labour (regular uterine contractions). This is called PROM or prelabour rupture of the membranes. When this happens there is a risk of infection entering the womb (uterus) and affecting the mother and her baby. Newborn infections are rare but have the potential to cause serious harm requiring neonatal intensive care. Giving a pregnant woman antibiotics when she has PROM may reduce the risk of infections for the woman and her baby. Most women spontaneously start labour within 24 hours, so delaying induction of labour and waiting for spontaneous onset of labour (expectant management) may be a possibility. Another treatment for term PROM is to induce labour with oxytocin or prostaglandins. Women are often given antibiotics to prevent infection, but there are concerns about possible side-effects of antibiotics, and that overuse of antibiotics can cause resistance to antibiotics so that they become less effective.</P>
<P>
<B>Our review questions</B>
</P>
<P>Do antibiotics given to women with PROM when they are at or near term (more than 36 weeks' gestation) but not in labour reduce the risk of infection for the baby and the mother? Are there adverse effects from the antibiotics?</P>
<P>
<B>What the studies showed</B>
</P>
<P>This review included four randomised controlled studies involving 2639 pregnant women at 36 weeks' gestation or more. The evidence showed that routine antibiotics for term PROM did not reduce the risk of infection for pregnant women or their babies when compared to the control group which received a placebo or no antibiotics. There was not enough strong evidence about other outcomes including death, allergic reactions for the woman or complications for the baby, which rarely occurred in the included studies. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was judged to be low to very low.</P>
<P>
<B>Overall</B>
</P>
<P>The conclusions from this review are limited by the low number of women who developed an infection across the studies overall. There is not enough information in this review to assess the possible side-effects from the use of antibiotics for women or their infants, particularly for any possible long-term harms. Because we do not know enough about side-effects and because we did not find strong evidence of benefit from antibiotics, they should not be routinely used for pregnant women with ruptured membranes prior to labour at term, unless a woman shows signs of infection.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-22 10:57:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Prelabour rupture of the membranes (PROM) at or near term (defined in this review as 36 weeks' gestation or beyond) increases the risk of infection for the woman and her baby. The routine use of antibiotics for women at the time of term PROM may reduce this risk. However, due to increasing problems with bacterial resistance and the risk of maternal anaphylaxis with antibiotic use, it is important to assess the evidence addressing risks and benefits in order to ensure judicious use of antibiotics. This review was undertaken to assess the balance of risks and benefits to the mother and infant of antibiotic prophylaxis for PROM at or near term.</P>

<P>This update includes an additional two studies involving 1801 women, giving a total of four included studies of 2639 women. Whereas the previous version of this review showed a statistically significant reduction in endometritis with the use of antibiotics, no such effect was shown in this update (average risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 2.31). No differences were shown on the primary outcome measures of probable early-onset neonatal sepsis (average RR 0.69, 95%; CI 0.21 to 2.33); definite early-onset neonatal sepsis (average RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.08 to 4.26); maternal infectious morbidity (chorioamnionitis and/or endometritis) (average RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.15); stillbirth (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.61 to 14.82); and perinatal mortality (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.60 to 6.55), though the number of cases in the control group for these outcomes was low. There were no cases of neonatal mortality or serious maternal outcome in the studies assessed. Caesarean section was increased with the use of antibiotics (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.61) as was duration of maternal stay in hospital (mean difference (MD) 0.06 days, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11), largely owing to one study of 1640 women where repeat caesarean section, increased baseline hypertension and pre-eclampsia were evident in the antibiotic group, despite random allocation and allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses by timing of induction (early induction versus late induction) showed no difference in either probable or definite early-onset neonatal sepsis in the early induction group (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.70 and RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.44, respectively) or the late induction group (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.13 and RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.34, respectively), although there were trends toward reduced probable and definite early-onset neonatal sepsis in the late induction group. A test for subgroup differences confirmed a differential effect of the intervention on probable early-onset neonatal sepsis between the subgroups (Chi² = 4.50, df = 1 (P = 0.03), I² = 77.8%). No difference in maternal infectious morbidity (chorioamnionitis and/or endometritis) was found in either subgroup, though again there was a trend towards reduced maternal infectious morbidly in the late induction group (average RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.47). No differences were shown in stillbirth or perinatal mortality. The quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes using GRADE was judged to be low to very low.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-22 10:57:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This updated review demonstrates no convincing evidence of benefit for mothers or neonates from the routine use of antibiotics for PROM at or near term. We are unable to adequately assess the risk of short- and long-term harms from the use of antibiotics due to the unavailability of data. Given the unmeasured potential adverse effects of antibiotic use, the potential for the development of resistant organisms, and the low risk of maternal infection in the control group, the routine use of antibiotics for PROM at or near term in the absence of confirmed maternal infection should be avoided.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-09 01:08:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-09-07 07:53:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) is defined as rupture of membranes prior to the onset of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Duff-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duff 1998</LINK>). Approximately 8% of pregnant women at term experience PROM (<LINK REF="REF-Cammu-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cammu 1990</LINK>), but the decision as to how term PROM should be managed clinically remains controversial, and there is wide variation in practice with no clear consensus on what constitutes optimal treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Marowitz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marowitz 2007</LINK>). Although for the majority of women labour will start spontaneously within 24 hours following term PROM, up to 4% of women will not experience spontaneous onset of labour within seven days. While, traditionally, 'term' is defined as gestations of 37 to 41 weeks inclusive, for the purposes of this review infants born at 36 weeks' gestation have been included in the definition of term PROM, as many neonatal outcomes at these gestations are similar to those of gestations greater than 36 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neerhoff-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neerhoff 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-08 05:15:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Induction of labour is one strategy intended to reduce infectious morbidity associated with term PROM. There is some evidence that planned management (usually by induction) reduces the risk of infectious maternal morbidity and the number of infants requiring admission to neonatal intensive care (<LINK REF="REF-Dare-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dare 2006</LINK>). On the basis of this evidence, clinicians may offer prompt induction with oxytocin or prostaglandins for term PROM (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 2006</LINK>). Others utilise a policy of delayed induction of labour or expectant management (awaiting spontaneous onset of labour), although there remains much discussion regarding the optimum latent period for expectant management (<LINK REF="REF-Ezra-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezra 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ingemarsson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingemarsson 1996</LINK>). It is in situations where the latency period from membrane rupture to birth is prolonged that prelabour antibiotics may be beneficial. However, due to increasing problems with bacterial resistance (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1999</LINK>) and the rare but potentially life-threatening risk of maternal anaphylaxis with antibiotic use (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heim-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heim 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jao-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jao 2006</LINK>), it is essential to ensure that antibiotics are used judiciously and when indicated.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-10-09 01:08:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The reasons for term PROM are not clearly understood. However, subclinical ascending infection is thought to be influential and has been detected in up to one-third of women with term PROM (<LINK REF="REF-Romero-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero 1992</LINK>). There is also evidence of changes that happen within and between the cells of the fetal membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reti-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reti 2007</LINK>). Despite the antibacterial properties of amniotic fluid, there is an increased risk of infection for the woman and her infant following term PROM (<LINK REF="REF-Newton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton 1993</LINK>). Neonatal infections in the term population are rare occurrences (2% to 4%), but have the potential for causing mortality or serious morbidity (including the need for neonatal intensive care and mechanical ventilation). Prophylactic antibiotics can be effective against many (but not all) potential pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2011</LINK>). Therefore, the routine use of antibiotics for women at the time of term PROM may reduce the risk of infection for the woman and her baby.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-09-07 09:45:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review aims to address the balance of risks and benefits to the mother and infant of antibiotic prophylaxis for prelabour rupture of the membranes at or near term. The review will also explore the differential effects of antibiotics and induction of labour.</P>
<P>Although Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the most common cause of serious neonatal infection in the first seven days of life, this review does not address the role of intrapartum antibiotic GBS prophylaxis as this is a separate clinical question from prelabour antibiotic usage. The role of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS is addressed in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2014</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>

<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. blinding, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken, or no blinding or incomplete blinding, but outcome unlikely to be influenced);</LI>

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the study authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P>We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>

<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the body of evidence - The GRADE approach</HEADING>
<P>For this update we also evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>). The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for specific outcomes. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias. In this review we used the GRADE approach to assess the seven primary outcomes, as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>probable early-onset neonatal sepsis;</LI>
<LI>definite early-onset neonatal sepsis;</LI>
<LI>maternal infectious morbidity (chorioamnionitis and/or endometritis);</LI>
<LI>stillbirth;</LI>
<LI>perinatal mortality;</LI>
<LI>neonatal mortality;</LI>
<LI>serious maternal outcome (defined as death, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, anaphylaxis, admission to intensive care unit).</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' table</HEADING>
<P>We used <A HREF="http://tech.cochrane.org/revman/other-resources/gradepro">GRADE Profiler</A> (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2008</LINK>) to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a 'Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality according to the GRADE approach is presented in the 'Summary of findings' table for each of the above outcomes. Due to high heterogeneity in the analysis of the first three primary outcomes (probable early-onset neonatal sepsis; definite early-onset neonatal sepsis; maternal infectious morbidity), a 'Summary of findings' table was produced presenting the results for these three outcomes subgrouped by timing of induction of labour (early induction versus late induction).</P>

<P>For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We did not identify any cluster-randomised trials for inclusion in this review, but we may include trials of this type in future updates.</P>
<P>If cluster-randomised trials are included in future reviews, we plan to include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. Their sample sizes will be adjusted using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely. We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation units.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>We excluded cross-over designs as these are unlikely to be a valid study design for Pregnancy and Childbirth reviews.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multiple pregnancies</HEADING>
<P>We did not identify any eligible studies that included multiple pregnancies in this review update, but we may include studies of this type in future updates.</P>
<P>When multiple pregnancies are included in studies, wherever possible, analyses should be adjusted for clustering to take into account the non-independence of babies from the same pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2004</LINK>). Treating babies from multiple pregnancies as if they are independent, when they are more likely to have similar outcomes than babies from different pregnancies, will overestimate the sample size and give confidence intervals that are too narrow. Each woman can be considered a cluster in multiple pregnancy, with the number of individuals in the cluster being equal to the number of fetuses in her pregnancy. Analysis using cluster-trial methods allows calculation of risk ratio and adjustment of confidence intervals. Usually this will mean that the confidence intervals become wider. Although this may make little difference to the conclusion of a trial, it avoids misleading results in those trials where the difference may be substantial.</P>
<P>If multiple pregnancies are included in future updates of this review, we will adjust for clustering in the analyses wherever possible, and to use the inverse variance method for adjusted analyses, as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and in <LINK REF="REF-Yelland-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yelland 2011</LINK>.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2014-09-12 14:58:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For included studies, levels of attrition were noted. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect will be explored by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-10-22 11:00:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I² was greater than 30% and either the Tau² was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (above 30%), we planned to explore it by pre-specified subgroup analysis.

<P>In future updates, if there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-10-22 11:00:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where studies were examining the same intervention, and the studies' populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between studies, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across studies was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between studies. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine studies. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-10-07 08:05:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>If we identified substantial heterogeneity among primary outcomes, we investigated it using subgroup analyses. We considered whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, we used random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>The following subgroup analyses were planned for the primary outcomes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>nulliparae;</LI>
<LI>early induction of labour (less than 12 hours from rupture of membranes);</LI>
<LI>late induction of labour (at 12 hours or greater from rupture of membranes).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We assessed subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We reported the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi² statistic and P value, and the interaction test I² value.</P>

<P>We did not conduct sensitivity analyses in this update due to the low number of included studies. In future updates we plan to carry out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of risk of bias assessed by random sequence generation, concealment of allocation, and blinding of participants and personnel, with poor-quality studies (including those assessed as high or unknown risk of bias) being excluded from the analyses in order to assess whether this made any difference to the overall result.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-27 06:32:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review included four studies of 2639 women comparing antibiotics for women with term prelabour rupture of membranes with placebo or no antibiotics. The previous version of this review included two studies of 838 women. Whereas the previous version of this review showed a statistically significant reduction in endometritis, no such effect was shown in this update after an additional two studies of 1801 women. No differences were shown on the primary outcome measures of early-onset neonatal sepsis (probable and definite), maternal infectious morbidity (chorioamnionitis and/or endometritis), stillbirth, perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality, and serious maternal outcome, though the number of cases in the control group for these outcomes was low.</P>
<P>Caesarean section was increased with the use of antibiotics, as was duration of maternal stay in hospital. These results appear largely driven by the <LINK REF="STD-Nabhan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Nabhan 2014</LINK> study, in which 165 women in the antibiotic group underwent caesarean section (20%), compared to 122 women in the placebo group (approximately 15%). Repeat caesarean section was significantly more common in the antibiotic group compared to the placebo group in this study. The larger incidence of caesarean section in the antibiotic group may also be partially accounted for by the increased hypertension and pre-eclampsia in the antibiotic group in this study.</P>
<P>Due to heterogeneity we did not combine the data from two studies measuring postpartum antibiotic usage and postpartum pyrexia. A small study of 105 women (<LINK REF="STD-Ovalle-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ovalle 1998</LINK>) reported an increase in postpartum antibiotic usage and a reduction in postpartum pyrexia, whereas a larger study of 1640 women (<LINK REF="STD-Nabhan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Nabhan 2014</LINK>) reported no differences on either outcome. The increased use of postpartum antibiotic usage in <LINK REF="STD-Ovalle-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ovalle 1998</LINK> appears to be explained by the study protocol for antibiotic provision, and the reduction in postpartum pyrexia in <LINK REF="STD-Ovalle-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ovalle 1998</LINK> is likely owing to the observed reduction in maternal infectious morbidity in this study.</P>
<P>No difference in any measures of maternal morbidity or neonatal morbidity were shown, although one small study showed a reduction in neonatal nursery stay. No data on cost effectiveness were available.</P>
<P>With the additional data available in this update we were able to introduce a second comparison of antibiotics versus placebo or no antibiotics subgrouped by timing of induction, whereby we compared early induction (defined as induction less than 12 hours from rupture of membranes) with late induction (defined as induction at 12 hours or greater from rupture of membranes). Three studies involving 2478 women were included in this subgroup analysis. No difference in either probable or definite early-onset neonatal sepsis was shown in either subgroup, although there were trends toward reduced probable and definite early-onset neonatal sepsis in the late induction group. Similarly, no difference in maternal infectious morbidity (chorioamnionitis and/or endometritis) was found in either subgroup analysis, though there was a trend towards reduced maternal infectious morbidly in the late induction group. A test for subgroup differences confirmed a differential effect of the intervention on probable early-onset neonatal sepsis between the early and late induction groups. Given these data, it appears that it is the difference in the timing of induction and the period of latency between membrane rupture and birth that is likely to have the greatest impact on infectious morbidity, with the least effect of antibiotic treatment seen in the <LINK REF="STD-Nabhan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Nabhan 2014</LINK> study where the period between admission and birth was shortest, and greater effect of antibiotic treatment seen in the remaining studies in these analyses where the period of latency was longer.</P>
<P>No differences were shown in stillbirth or perinatal mortality, and there were no cases of serious maternal outcome or neonatal mortality.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-10-08 01:35:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The four studies included in this review showed some heterogeneity. The main source of clinical heterogeneity was in the timing of induction of labour, which we have attempted to address via subgroup analyses. Nonetheless, the conclusions from this review are limited by rare event rates across the primary outcomes. This review is underpowered to detect differences in stillbirth, perinatal mortality, and neonatal mortality and it is unlikely that future studies will be able to rectify this problem due to the sheer numbers of women and neonates that would be required to complete such clinical trials. A further limitation to the applicability of the evidence in this review is regarding the use or method of routine screening for Group B Streptococcus, which was included in only one (<LINK REF="STD-Passos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Passos 2012</LINK>) of the included studies. The review also provides little information on possible short- and long-term adverse effects from the use of antibiotics including allergic reaction and anaphylaxis for women (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2011</LINK>), and the development of resistant organisms among neonates such as gram-negative organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002</LINK>). Due to unavailability of data, we are unable to assess not only the direct economic impact of routine use of antibiotics for PROM at term, but also the economic impact of treating the antibiotic-resistant infections that may result. Due to the low number of included studies, we were also not able to investigate the likelihood of reporting biases such as publication bias.</P>

Allocation to groups was not concealed in two of the four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cararach-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cararach 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ovalle-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ovalle 1998</LINK>), and in a third study (<LINK REF="STD-Passos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Passos 2012</LINK>) both performance and detection bias was judged to be high risk. The largest and most recent study (<LINK REF="STD-Nabhan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Nabhan 2014</LINK>) was of particularly high quality, showing low risk of bias on all domains assessed. Using the GRADE approach, quality of evidence for each of the primary outcomes yielding a point estimate (probable early-onset neonatal sepsis; definite early-onset neonatal sepsis; maternal infectious morbidity; stillbirth; and perinatal mortality) was judged to be low to very low. We downgraded evidence for each of these outcomes due to risk of bias and imprecision of results (<I>see </I>

<P>We are aware that the review process itself is subject to bias, and we took steps to minimise bias. At least two review authors carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently; however, a different review team may not have made identical decisions.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-10-22 11:03:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In their retrospective cohort study of 3841 women at a single-site in the United States, <LINK REF="REF-Tran-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 2007</LINK> and colleagues examined the relationship between duration of membrane rupture and maternal infection, finding that the risk chorioamnionitis and endometritis was increased at 12 hours and 16 hours respectively post membrane rupture. The study included women with singleton pregnancy and cephalic presentation, with PROM diagnosed at 37 weeks' gestation or later. Women with multiple pregnancies and obstetric complications were excluded and definitions for chorioamnionitis and endometritis were similar to those in this review. The study also found that the risk of postpartum haemorrhage was increased with durations of membrane rupture, but we were unable to investigate this in the current review due to unavailability of data. The Cochrane Review on <I>Planned early birth versus expectant management (waiting) for prelabour rupture of membranes at term (37 weeks or more) </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Dare-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dare 2006</LINK>) showed that planned management (usually by induction of labour) reduced chorioamnionitis and endometritis and, similar to this review, no difference in neonatal infection was shown. It is important to note that the NICE guideline on intrapartum care states that induction of labour is appropriate approximately 24 hours after rupture of membranes (<A HREF="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg55">NICE guideline 55</A>). As in this update, the guideline also states that maternal and neonatal antibiotics should not be administered in the absence of signs of maternal infection.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-22 11:03:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-10-22 11:03:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review demonstrates no convincing maternal or neonatal benefits of the routine use of antibiotics for prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) at or near term in the absence of confirmed clinical infection. It is likely that the modest benefit for maternal endometritis seen in the previous version of this review can be largely accounted for by the late use of induction of labour in both included studies, where the duration of membrane rupture was more prolonged (related to either a policy of expectant management or a delay in induction greater than 24 hours). The low rate of maternal infection in the control population of this updated review (less than 5%) further reinforces that administration of antibiotics to women with PROM should be restricted to those who develop clinical indications for antibiotic treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-10-22 11:03:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Antibiotics may not offer any benefit under a clinical policy of immediate or early induction of labour, where the duration of membrane rupture is minimised. For women being managed expectantly or with a policy of delayed induction, there may be a role for antibiotics, but further well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed. These trials should utilise blinding of the intervention and need to be adequately sized to address clinically important maternal and neonatal outcomes. All future trials should consider including a cost analysis to determine the economic impact of routine antibiotics for PROM at term.</P>

<P>For this update outcome measures were divided into primary and secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes were selected by the authorship team as those most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications. Respiratory distress syndrome was added as a secondary outcome. Methods for assessing risk of bias were updated as per Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). These changes include evaluating the domain of blinding separately for <I>participants and personnel</I> (performance bias) and for <I>outcome assessment </I>(detection bias). The quality of the evidence was re-assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to key outcomes.</P>
