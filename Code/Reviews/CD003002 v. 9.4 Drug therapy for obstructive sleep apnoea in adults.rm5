Am I right in saying that new data does not confirm the original Mirtazapine results. If so it would be helpful to highlight in the conclusions and in What's new? This may deserve a conclusions changed flag? This adds important weight to the caution needed in response to single small studies too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have changed the Odds ratio for Protriptyline to Peto method in view of the zero cells and amended the abstract result (also added it to the results section).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not sure about so many single study results in the abstract, with an emphasis on statistically significant results. Shouldn't the primary outcomes for all treatments be presented first? Perhaps we can discuss this? Also the order of reporting in the abstract is not the same as in the results section. I am not sure that presenting significant results first and insignificant second in the abstract is a good idea? Also the abstract does not reflect the considerable problems with side effects. The discussion points out that few trials assessed daytime sleepiness and this could be reported in the abstract too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a good compromise would be to list the single treatment studies in the abstract without results (since this is very tenuous evidence) and just report the longer study results????? Would a table of trial duration also help the reader perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if Prasad 2009 and Prasad 2010 may well be the same study? If so this needs revision of number of new studies, participants etc?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please include the treatment used when reporting the side-effects in the final paragraph of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;========================================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;15 Feb 2006&lt;br&gt;Revised version is fine and can be submitted.&lt;br&gt;Thanks. CJC&lt;br&gt;=========================================================================&lt;br&gt;Peer Review Comments Jan 2006&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I think the paper is really excellent. There are only a few concerns:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Reviever conclusions:&lt;br&gt;The evidence basis for the recommendation of a combination therapy is very&lt;br&gt;small. Therefore, the recommendation seems to be highly speculative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical context: Definition:&lt;br&gt;From my point of view the inclusion of studies based only on desaturation is&lt;br&gt;insufficient. It does not allow for a discrimination between obstructive or&lt;br&gt;central sleep apnea or hypoventilation syndromes. I absolutely agree with&lt;br&gt;the aim of the review to evaluate the effect of drugs in OSAS. As&lt;br&gt;obstructive or central disturbances react differently to pharmacological&lt;br&gt;interventions a clear discrimination is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selection of appr. outcome measures: Throughout the review the relative&lt;br&gt;reduction of the respiratory disturbances is pointed out. But, to me it does&lt;br&gt;not seem to be so important if the AHI decreased by 20 or 40% but if it can&lt;br&gt;be reduced to (e.g.) &amp;lt;10/h or 5/h together with clinical improvement.&lt;br&gt;Therefore, I would suggest to take this parameter (or the number of&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8220;resonders&amp;#8221;) into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: The &amp;#8220;Discussion&amp;#8221; should avoid to repeat the results which have&lt;br&gt;been described in the &amp;#8220;Results&amp;#8221;. The problem of the discrimination between&lt;br&gt;central and obstructive SAS should be discussed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC editing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. I have cut out the comment on multiple drugs in the conclusion (&amp;quot;and possibly combining therapies with different actions &amp;quot;) as I agree with the peer reviewer that this does not flow from the data in the review.&lt;br&gt;2. I think the comment about excluding central sleep apnoea is important for drug treatments and would be grateful if you could make clear which studies only used desaturation to include patients (if there were any) in the description of included studies and mention this in the discussion as well.&lt;br&gt;Look forward to hearing from you,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;=========================================================================================&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 23 Nov 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution - could be revised to read more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new - good, I have clarified that mirtazapine is based on a single trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives - unchanged&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References - checked by Liz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies - Information well laid out .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels - Please check direction of benefit in Min SaO2 outcomes, some favour the active treatment to the left and some to the right. Since higher SaO2 is better I think active treatment should be better to the right of the line? Comp 6#2 and 8#4 may need relabelling. Also a few labels still say favours treatment and favours control so may have not be correct in direction. Please tidy these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis - &amp;quot;Most have not been found to be effective.&amp;quot;,(changed in red). There is not enough data to SHOW ineffectiveness!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract - Abbreviations need to be preceeded by full text on first use (changed in red).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods - fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results - fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion -fine. Could Liz be acknowledged please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Is co-treatment with CPAP an issue in Jokic 1998 or had the patients come off CPAP for this study as CPAP is one of your inclusion criteria?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked -done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action - Toby please attend to the above. This is really like a new review as most of the included data is new. Good piece of work. In view of the amount of new data can we try to find a peer reviewer for this update?&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;================================================================================================&lt;br&gt;Checklist for Technical Editing by CJC 20/11/2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors and contributions: - Please add the contributions of each author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: - Look fine. Some titles are in the original title box instead of English title, so could be tidied up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: - Bare details well presented. Summary Jadad score is more meaningful if components are provided in the first column about how randomisation, blinding, withdrawals were handled. (EG how does a double blind study only get a score of 1? Issa)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: - Our convention now is to leave good outcomes as positive signs and reverse the labels on the Metaview graphs this needs doing throughout. [But see comment below on Metaview analysis of cross-over trials] THIS IS NOW FINE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text of the review: - There is a problem with the sections for Types of studies, participants and interventions. This should be in the future tense and describes the type and design that studies need to be for inclusion. This reads more like a description of results as it stands at present. THIS IS NOW FINE.&lt;br&gt;As all the studies were cross-over in design and RevMan does not handle these properly some explanation of the way the cross-over results were incorporated into the review is needed (eg was first arm data used for RevMan?). Were within patient t-test scores available in the papers; if so these should at least be presented as an alternative analysis in the text (since there are very few studies that can be pooled in the review). For example the text suggests that the Hedner study presents a between treatment comparison that may be useful if it has a Standard Error as this can be used for Inverse Variance pooling outside RevMan (or in the new version this will be possible in RevMan). Perhaps I could sit down with Toby and look through the papers before proceeding further.&lt;br&gt;CROSS OVERS REMAIN A PROBLEM BUT WOULD NOT ALTER THE POINT ESTIMATES AND THE ORIGINAL DATA MAY NOT ALLOW MUCH MORE TO BE DONE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;18_1_2 Further editing by CJC.&lt;br&gt;I have checked this again (including spell checker) and amended the text which matches metaview. This is now ready for Paul.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-04-30 13:45:17 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="DRUG-SLP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.3 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.4">

<P>17 new studies were identified which met the inclusion criteria.These studies introduced new drug treatments in to the review and as such could not be combined with any previous data. The assessment of a single study on mirtazepine has yielded some significant differences on one of the outcomes considered (AHI).

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is caused by collapse of the upper airway. The mainstay of medical treatment is continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), delivered through a mask during sleep, aiming to keep the airway opened. Drug therapy has been proposed for individuals with mild OSA and those intolerant of CPAP.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We wanted to look at the evidence from randomised controlled trials which compared drug therapy with placebo for sleep apnoea.</P>
<P>
<B>What we did</B>
<BR/>We searched and reviewed all randomised placebo controlled trials of drugs to treat OSA in adult patients. Most of the trials had methodological flaws or were for only one or two nights, which is hardly long enough to find out whether the treatments are effective or acceptable to the people taking them.</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<BR/>Of 25 drugs tested, 10 had some impact on the severity of OSA (as measured by the apnoea hypopnoea index or AHI) and four altered symptoms of sleepiness, although in most people changes were only modest.</P>
<P>Eszopiclone, acetazolamide, naltrexone, physiostigmine and nasal lubricant (phosphocholinamine) were trialled for one to two nights only and the long-term effects are therefore unknown. A topical nasal steroid was well tolerated and reduced the severity of sleep apnoea and improved subjective daytime alertness in a specific subgroup of people with both OSA and rhinitis. Acetazolamide reduced the number of respiratory events per hour of sleep but did not reduce daytime sleepiness and was poorly tolerated long term. Paroxetine had only a small effect on the severity of OSA and while it was tolerated there was no useful effect on daytime symptoms. In contrast, participants reported a symptomatic benefit from protriptyline but there was no improvement in OSA, suggesting a different mechanism for their improved sense of well-being. The antidepressant mirtazapine improved the severity of sleep apnoea in older trials, however two more recent, larger trials failed to demonstrated the same results; moreover, participants experienced side effects of sleepiness and weight gain. Donepezil, well established in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, improved oxygen saturation and the severity of OSA in patients with and without dementia. In people with no dementia it was shown to reduce sleepiness but the study was small and neither the AHI nor ESS were normalised. Further trials are needed to confirm these results. Eszopliclone reduced the severity of OSA in selected patients nonetheless larger scale trials are needed to verify the results.</P>
<P>
<B>Bottom line</B>
<BR/>Some of the drugs may be helpful, however their tolerability needs to be considered in long-term trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The treatment of choice for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) applied via a mask during sleep. However, this is not tolerated by all individuals and its role in mild OSA is not proven. Drug therapy has been proposed as an alternative to CPAP in some patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea and could be of value in patients intolerant of CPAP. A number of mechanisms have been proposed by which drugs could reduce the severity of OSA. These include an increase in tone in the upper airway dilator muscles, an increase in ventilatory drive, a reduction in the proportion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an increase in cholinergic tone during sleep, an increase in arousal threshold, a reduction in airway resistance and a reduction in surface tension in the upper airway.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the efficacy of drug therapies in the specific treatment of sleep apnoea.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-02-06 10:15:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Searches were current as of July 2012.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Randomised, placebo controlled trials involving adult patients with confirmed OSA. We excluded trials if continuous positive airways pressure, mandibular devices or oxygen therapy were used. We excluded studies investigating treatment of associated conditions such as excessive sleepiness, hypertension, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and obesity.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty trials of 25 drugs, involving 516 participants, contributed data to the review. Drugs had several different proposed modes of action and the results were grouped accordingly in the review. Each of the studies stated that the participants had OSA but diagnostic criteria were not always explicit and it was possible that some patients with central apnoeas may have been recruited.</P>
<P>Acetazolamide, eszopiclone, naltrexone, nasal lubricant (phosphocholinamine) and physiostigmine were administered for one to two nights only. Donepezil in patients with and without Alzheimer's disease, fluticasone in patients with allergic rhinitis, combinations of ondansetrone and fluoxetine and paroxetine were trials of one to three months duration, however most of the studies were small and had methodological limitations. The overall quality of the available evidence was low.</P>
<P>The primary outcomes for the systematic review were the apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) and the level of sleepiness associated with OSA, estimated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). AHI was reported in 25 studies and of these 10 showed statistically significant reductions in AHI.</P>
<P>Fluticasone in patients with allergic rhinitis was well tolerated and reduced the severity of sleep apnoea compared with placebo (AHI 23.3 versus 30.3; P &lt; 0.05) and improved subjective daytime alertness. Excessive sleepiness was reported to be altered in four studies, however the only clinically and statistically significant change in ESS of -2.9 (SD 2.9; P = 0.04) along with a small but statistically significant reduction in AHI of -9.4 (SD 17.2; P = 0.03) was seen in patients without Alzheimer's disease receiving donepezil for one month. In 23 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease donepezil led to a significant reduction in AHI (donepezil 20 (SD 15) to 9.9 (SD 11.5) versus placebo 23.2 (SD 26.4) to 22.9 (SD 28.8); P = 0.035) after three months of treatment but no reduction in sleepiness was reported. High dose combined treatment with ondansetron 24 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg showed a 40.5% decrease in AHI from the baseline at treatment day 28. Paroxetine was shown to reduce AHI compared to placebo (-6.10 events/hour; 95% CI -11.00 to -1.20) but failed to improve daytime symptoms.</P>
<P>Promising results from the preliminary mirtazapine study failed to be reproduced in the two more recent multicentre trials and, moreover, the use of mirtazapine was associated with significant weight gain and sleepiness. Few data were presented on the long-term tolerability of any of the compounds used.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of drug therapy in the treatment of OSA. Small studies have reported positive effects of certain agents on short-term outcomes. Certain agents have been shown to reduce the AHI in largely unselected populations with OSA by between 24% and 45%. For donepezil and fluticasone, studies of longer duration with a larger population and better matching of groups are required to establish whether the change in AHI and impact on daytime symptoms are reproducible. Individual patients had more complete responses to particular drugs. It is possible that better matching of drugs to patients according to the dominant mechanism of their OSA will lead to better results and this also needs further study.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is partial or complete upper airway occlusion during sleep. This leads to increased respiratory muscle effort against an obstructed upper airway in an attempt to maintain air flow, which may lead to arousal from sleep, sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness. Furthermore, OSA is associated with neuropsychological impairment, metabolic and cardiovascular co-morbidities and increased mortality. The first effective treatment for OSA was tracheostomy and this was widely used before less invasive alternatives became available (<LINK REF="REF-He-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 1988</LINK>). In 1981 continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) delivered via a nasal mask was shown to be an effective treatment that patients could tolerate at home (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1981</LINK>). CPAP has become the treatment of choice for patients with moderate to severe OSA and has been shown to have many important health benefits including improvement in ventilatory function (<LINK REF="REF-Berthon_x002d_Jones-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berthon-Jones 1987</LINK>); significant reduction in daytime somnolence (<LINK REF="REF-Engleman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engleman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2006</LINK>); improved quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Stradling-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stradling 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2003</LINK>); and reduced blood pressure, cardiovascular events and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Doherty-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doherty 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barbe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbe 2010</LINK>). Unfortunately its use is limited by incomplete compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Pepin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2008</LINK>), and among those who do tolerate CPAP a majority would prefer alternative treatment such as an oral appliance (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1998</LINK>).

<P>Alternative treatments for OSA remain of interest including conservative measures such as alcohol avoidance, weight reduction, improved sleep scheduling and altering sleep position (<LINK REF="REF-Shneerson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shneerson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lam-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 2007</LINK>).

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The drugs that have been most commonly prescribed in an attempt to treat OSA include progestogens, acetazolamide, theophyllines and antidepressants (<LINK REF="STD-Brownell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Brownell 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Espinoza-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Espinoza 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stepanski-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stepanski 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulloy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mulloy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraiczi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kraiczi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hein 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2010</LINK>). Progestogens were considered in the management of OSA because it is less common in women than in men, is more common in women after the menopause than before, and because progestogens have been shown to increase ventilatory drive (<LINK REF="STD-Cistulli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cistulli 1994</LINK>). Acetazolamide also increases respiratory drive and has been proposed as a treatment for OSA. Theophyllines are primarily used as bronchodilators but may also increase ventilatory drive. Antidepressants including tricyclic drugs reduce the proportion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and in patients with OSA predominantly in REM sleep might be expected to reduce the number of apnoeas. Clonidine has a similar action and these drugs have therefore been proposed as a treatment for mild to moderate OSA (<LINK REF="REF-Hudgel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudgel 1995</LINK>). More recently greater emphasis has been placed on the role of upper airway tone, independent of respiratory drive. A greater understanding of the role of serotonergic receptors has led to trials of drugs to increase (for example SSRIs) or decrease serotonergic tone (ondansetron). The observation of a decline in the number of cholinergic neurons in patients with degenerative brain disease associated with OSA prompted trial of physostigmine and donepezil, which increase cholinergic tone (<LINK REF="REF-Gilman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilman 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moraes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moraes 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sukys_x002d_Claudino-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sukys-Claudino 2012</LINK>). Attempts have been made to reduce the frequency of OSAs by changing the characteristics of the upper airway using topical therapy to increase its cross-sectional area or reduce the surface tension acting on the walls (<LINK REF="STD-Jokic-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jokic 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clarenbach-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Clarenbach 2008</LINK>). Finally, a more recent study by <LINK REF="STD-Eckert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Eckert 2011</LINK> assessed manipulation of the arousal threshold (the ease with which a patient wakes up to respiratory stimuli during the respiratory event) by the non-benzodiazepine sedative eszopiclone. They hypothesised that an increase in arousal threshold (more difficult to wake up) with eszopiclone would allow appropriate time for the accumulation of physiological stimuli to enable upper airway muscle recruitment to abort an apnoea.</P>

Using AHI as an indicator of the OSA severity, the participants were generally moderate-severe where this was reported. Baseline AHI ranged from 13.8 (<LINK REF="STD-Hein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hein 2000</LINK>) to 98.0 (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2010</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 30 studies assessing the effects of 25 drugs in the treatment of sleep apnoea. The majority of these studies involved only a small number of participants and for many the design has been poorly reported. For most of the drugs there have been only single trials, indeed we were only able to pool data in the case of five drugs and only for select outcomes. Ten of the drugs trialled were shown to reduce the AHI compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferber-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ferber 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jokic-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jokic 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraiczi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kraiczi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Carley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moraes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moraes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eckert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Eckert 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sukys_x002d_Claudino-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sukys-Claudino 2012</LINK>). The majority of the trials were only for a single night and symptomatic benefit could not therefore be demonstrated. Four longer studies reported a subjective decrease in daytime somnolence or an increase in alertness but this was not corroborated by objective tests of sleep propensity in any of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brownell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Brownell 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stepanski-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stepanski 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sukys_x002d_Claudino-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sukys-Claudino 2012</LINK>), and reduction in AHI was not always an indicator of improved sleep quality. <LINK REF="STD-Ferber-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ferber 1993</LINK> demonstrated a significantly lower AHI with naltrexone but also significantly lower total sleep. The goal of OSA treatment must be to reduce daytime sleepiness (somnolence) but few trials reported this patient important outcome.</P>
<P>Among the drugs administered systemically, paroxetine (<LINK REF="STD-Kraiczi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kraiczi 1999</LINK>), physostigmine<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Hedner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hedner 2003</LINK>) and donepezil (<LINK REF="STD-Moraes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moraes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sukys_x002d_Claudino-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sukys-Claudino 2012</LINK>) reduced the AHI to an extent. Paroxetine had no impact on daytime symptoms. Its effect was limited to reducing the AHI during non-REM sleep, and the overall fall in AHI was small at just 17%. Physostigmine reduced the AHI by 24% compared to placebo but the effect was more marked in REM where the reduction was 44%. In addition, the reduction in AHI was inversely related to BMI. It is not known whether physostigmine would be as effective if given orally, how well it might be tolerated, and whether it can reduce daytime sleepiness. Donepezil in patients with and without dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Moraes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moraes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sukys_x002d_Claudino-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sukys-Claudino 2012</LINK>) showed a modest but statistically significant decrease in AHI and improvement in nocturnal SaO<SUB>2</SUB>. <LINK REF="STD-Moraes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moraes 2008</LINK> reports a significant reduction in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) AHI and an increase in REM sleep duration. The improvement in AHI may be due to the improved co-ordination between the diaphragm and the upper airway muscles, caused by increased hypoglossal to phrenic interval and genioglossal activity. <LINK REF="STD-Sukys_x002d_Claudino-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sukys-Claudino 2012</LINK> reported a decrease in AHI at the expense of reduced sleep efficiency and further trials are needed. <LINK REF="STD-Carley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Carley 2007</LINK> reported reduction in AHI by around 45% for a 15 mg dose of mirtazapine compared to placebo. Two more recent multicentre trials (<LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2008</LINK>) failed to reproduce these results and moreover use of mirtazapine was associated with significant weight gain and sleepiness. Compared to <LINK REF="STD-Carley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Carley 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2008</LINK> recruited fewer women and obese patients, which may have altered the drug's effect on OSA. Another striking feature in this later trial was an increase in AHI in patients taking 15 mg and 30 mg of mirtazapine, which may suggest a dose specific effect of mirtazapine on OSA, however worsening of OSA was not replicated in either arm of 15 mg of mirtazapine in the second trial. Protriptyline remains the most frequently studied drug and was not shown to improve any measure of respiratory disturbance during sleep (<LINK REF="STD-Brownell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Brownell 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stepanski-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stepanski 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1988</LINK>). However, in two out of three studies participants reported a decrease in daytime somnolence. Since sleep parameters were not improved it may be that this was the result of the non-specific alerting effect of the drug rather than a direct effect on OSA.</P>
<P>Acetazolamide was shown to reduce the number of respiratory events during sleep but this did not improve sleep quality or reduce the subjective impression of sleepiness in the day (<LINK REF="STD-Whyte-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Whyte 1988</LINK>). Theophylline and aminophylline are related compounds and similar results were seen in the trials using these two drugs. Aminophylline decreased the number of hypopnoeas but also reduced the quality of sleep (<LINK REF="STD-Espinoza-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Espinoza 1987</LINK>). Theophylline was shown to reduce the number of arterial oxygen desaturations but reduced the total sleep time by more than an hour (<LINK REF="STD-Mulloy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mulloy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hein 2000</LINK>). Clonidine improved overnight oxygenation but it is not clear that this would have any clinical relevance (<LINK REF="STD-Issa-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Issa 1992</LINK>). No statistically significant differences were found between the outcomes for the other drugs studied and placebo.</P>
<P>Use of eszopiclone (<LINK REF="STD-Eckert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Eckert 2011</LINK>) resulted in a significant increase in arousal threshold and decrease in AHI by 23% (P &lt; 0.005). The study is too small (N = 17) and was only of one-night duration, and therefore larger scale clinical trials are needed to evaluate these results further.</P>
<P>From the results available, topical intranasal fluticasone propionate has been shown to reduce apnoea for patients with mild OSA and co-existing rhinitis, although more information is needed regarding the impact on excessive daytime sleepiness and long-term benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2004</LINK>). If a suitable compound can be developed for long-term use further investigation of nasal lubricants is justified. At present there is insufficient evidence to recommend any systemic drug therapy for OSA. Nevertheless the available results do suggest that further research is warranted. It may be, for example, that patients with OSA almost exclusively in NREM sleep might get more benefit from paroxetine than an otherwise unselected population (<LINK REF="STD-Kraiczi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kraiczi 1999</LINK>). Donepezil was well tolerated orally and reduced AHI and ESS, but again the study was small. Combination therapies may also be of value to control OSA in both REM and NREM sleep.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some drugs have been used extensively in clinical practice, however two trials on the most commonly used drug, theophylline (<LINK REF="STD-Peter-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Peter 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Martino-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Di Martino 1999</LINK>), were excluded from this review as neither were randomised, placebo controlled studies. Medroxyprogesterone and clonidine have also been proposed as possible treatments for OSA but there are few reports of their use. More recent work, in particular with animal models of OSA, has recognised the importance of the tone in the upper airway musculature and the role of serotonergic neurons in its control. Other areas of interest, which have more recently been investigated, are the effects of various vasoactive compounds on OSA, the role of topical therapy, use of oral anticholinergic drugs and manipulation of arousal threshold.</P>
<P>From our review some of the new approaches justify further work, but it is possible that those most likely to respond to drug therapy are restricted to selected subgroups of people with OSA. The response may vary according to the relationship between sleep position, sleep stage and severity of sleep disruption (<LINK REF="STD-Jokic-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jokic 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have not reviewed the effects of medication used to reduce daytime sleepiness in OSA. Modafanil is one such agent that has been trialled in addition to CPAP primarily (<LINK REF="STD-Kingshott-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kingshott 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dinges-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dinges 2003</LINK>).

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was much heterogeneity in the types of drugs used in the trials in this review and many of the trials were on just a few patients, with short trial duration and with indiscernible methodological quality.</P>
<P>Although the inclusion criteria in some studies may have allowed the recruitment of some patients with central sleep apnoea, due to the use of the oxygen desaturation index rather than the apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI), the reported number of AHI events in the studies justified the inclusion of these studies in this review. However should new data become available, sensitivity analyses involving the removal of these studies will be performed to see whether a slight variation in the entry criteria accounts for any differential response.</P>

<P>There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend any systemic pharmacological treatment for OSA. From the data available it seems likely that unlike CPAP, which is usually effective irrespective of the cause of OSA, drug therapy will need to be targeted according to features such as presence or absence of obesity and the predominance of OSA in a particular sleep stage. Ultimately, a combination of strategies targeting different pathophysiological pathways may be required.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-04-12 11:35:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence from a small trial on topical fluticasone in patients with co-existent rhinitis and OSA, and trials on four drugs that reduced AHI, paroxetine, physostigmine, acetazolamide and eszopiclone, may justify further work. Donepezil is the most promising proposition at present.</P>
<P>Future trials of drug therapy for OSA should be of adequate size and duration, and should have valid, patient centred outcomes. Many of the studies used multiple outcome variables and it would be valuable to reach a consensus on mandatory outcome variables to measure and report for future studies. In addition to overnight monitoring to confirm a direct effect on the frequency of respiratory events, they should report changes in daytime sleepiness, measured subjectively (ESS) and ideally also objectively. Diagnostic criteria should be explicitly reported, and if any participants are recruited with suspected central apnoea this should also be reported, ideally with separate data for people with each diagnosis. Furthermore, the long-term tolerability of any drug used should be investigated.</P>

<P>Editor's note: The reader needs to be aware of the following information. On June 27, 2006, Cypress Bioscience Inc. announced &#8220;that the results of recently completed Phase IIa trials do not support continuing a development program evaluating combinations of mirtazapine with another approved drug as potential pharmaceutical treatments for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Cypress and Organon, the human healthcare business unit of Akzo Nobel, had each independently conducted Phase IIa trials that served as the basis for today&#8217;s announcement. A previous independently conducted small preliminary investigator sponsored pilot trial found that mirtazapine was able to reduce the number of abnormal respiratory events over the course of the night by roughly fifty percent. However, those data were not replicated in the recently completed phase IIa trials.&#8221;</P>

<P>"Secondly, concomitant hypnotic use is likely to represent a source of bias. Three subjects took selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (two fluoxetine, one escitalopram), which are known to influence airway tone, and have been reported to produce statistically significant (albeit modest) improvements in the AHI in OSA patients. Conversely, other hypnotic treatments (such as desloratadine, hydroxyzine, alprazolam, oxazepam and tramadol) exacerbate sleepiness. Anecdotally, venlafaxine has been shown to produce pulmonary obstruction and exacerbate respiratory symptoms in asthma patients, which may be of relevance in this setting. However, these treatments remained unchanged during the study."</P>
