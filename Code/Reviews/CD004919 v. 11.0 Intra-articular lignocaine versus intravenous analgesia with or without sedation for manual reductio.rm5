<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-11 06:38:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Joint dislocation refers to displacement of the bones which form a joint away from their anatomical position. The shoulder is the most commonly dislocated joint managed in the emergency department (ED). When the dislocation occurs towards the front of the body, this is known as an anterior shoulder dislocation. It is called an acute anterior shoulder dislocation if the dislocation occurred with the previous 48 hours. Manually manipulating the displaced bones back to their normal position (manual reduction) is very painful. To allow for manual reduction, pain relief can be achieved either by injecting a local anaesthetic drug (for example, lignocaine) into the dislocated shoulder joint (intra-articular lignocaine injection); or by injecting a pain killer with or without a sedative directly into the bloodstream through a vein (intravenous analgesia). The review authors searched the medical literature and identified five studies comparing these two methods. The studies included 211 patients with acute anterior shoulder dislocation; 113 patients underwent intra-articular lignocaine injection and 98 underwent intravenous analgesia with sedation. The review found that there may be no difference in the immediate success of manual reduction of the dislocated shoulder between patients receiving intra-articular lignocaine injection and those who received intravenous analgesia and sedation. However, intra-articular lignocaine injection may be associated with fewer side effects and a shorter stay in the emergency department before discharge from hospital. Compared with intravenous analgesia and sedation, intra-articular lignocaine may also be cheaper. However, the relatively small number of studies included in the review and the relatively small number of patients in each study means that the results of the review preclude definitive conclusions regarding the superiority of either method..</P>

There were significantly fewer adverse effects associated with IAL compared with IVAS (RR 0.16; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.43). The mean time spent in the emergency department was significantly less with IAL compared with IVAS (MD 109.46 minutes; 95% CI 84.60 to 134.32). One trial reported significantly less time for reduction with IVAS (105 seconds; 95% CI 84.0 to 126.1) compared with IAL (284.6 seconds; 95% CI 185.3 to 383.9).

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-03-03 18:40:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Dislocation of a joint refers to a clinical condition in which the joint surfaces are completely displaced and are no longer in contact (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-Apley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham Apley 1988</LINK>). Dislocations require prompt correction (reduction) to limit pain and suffering, and to minimize damage to the joint and its surrounding structures. The shoulder joint is the most commonly dislocated joint that is managed in the emergency department (ED), with an overall reported risk in the general population of 1.7% (<LINK REF="REF-Hovelius-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hovelius 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kothari-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kothari 1992</LINK>). The majority of people with shoulder dislocation presenting to the ED (up to 96% in some series) have dislocations that occur in an anterior (towards the front) direction (<LINK REF="REF-McNamara-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNamara 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norlin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norlin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In most EDs, acute (sudden and severe) anterior shoulder dislocations (AASD) are commonly reduced manually with intravenous sedation (benzodiazepines) with or without analgesia (opiates). Intravenous analgesia with or without sedation (IVAS) facilitates manual reduction in AASD but is associated with potentially serious adverse effects. Significant central nervous system and respiratory depression may occur with IVAS, requiring close patient monitoring and medical management (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>). Nausea, vomiting and lethargy may occur, requiring prolonged ED observation (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). Antidotal treatment for reversal of benzodiazepine sedation or opiate analgesia is sometimes required to aid symptom relief and patient recovery after IVAS (<LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). Meanwhile, IVAS should be used judiciously in certain subsets of patients, such as elderly patients with poor cardiorespiratory reserve, pregnant women and some patients with multiple trauma (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recently, intra-articular lignocaine (IAL) has been advocated as a means of providing analgesia during manual reduction of AASD. IAL may permit avoidance of sedative agents while achieving, in some cases, acceptable degrees of analgesia. A secondary benefit of IAL in selected patients is that intravenous access may not be required, allowing for performance of the procedure among those patients who lack easily obtainable intravenous access. Another secondary benefit is that monitoring, including monitoring of oxygen saturation and electrocardiography, may not be required during or after reduction employing IAL in selected patients. This may translate into a significantly shorter ED stay with IAL compared to IVAS (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, IAL may associated with a lower complication rate compared to IVAS (<LINK REF="REF-Lippitt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippitt 1991</LINK>). IVAS-associated central nervous system depression and cardiorespiratory decompensation have not been reported with IAL. IAL may also cost less than IVAS (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite these advantages, aspects of IAL may be inferior to IVAS. Psychological agitation among patients receiving IAL may interfere with joint reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). Another potential drawback of IAL is that assessment of the effectiveness of the technique is limited by the difficulty in determining the correct intra-articular placement of lignocaine, which is not as easily confirmed as when administering medications intravenously (<LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). However, to date this complication has not been reported with this technique (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>). Further drawbacks of IAL include the lack of substantial muscle relaxation, the inability to titrate depth of sedation and use of anxiolytic agents, and a potential for septic arthritis. Lastly, the effectiveness of IAL injection may be provider and patient dependent. For example, obese patients represent a challenge for proper intra-articular drug placement.</P>
<P>In terms of success of reduction of AASD, there is conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of IAL compared to IVAS. There is evidence that IAL is as good as or better than IVAS for reduction of AASD (<LINK REF="REF-Lippitt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippitt 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>). In contrast, a trend towards higher successful reduction rates with IVAS than with IAL has been reported (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>). We conducted a quantitative systematic review to help cohere these conflicting results.</P>

<P>We used a revised data extraction form to incorporate the new additions on quality assessment in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). We extracted relevant data regarding inclusion criteria (study design, participants, interventions and outcomes), risk of bias (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias) and results. In cases where insufficient data were reported (for example, completeness of outcome data) we contacted the study authors for further information.

<P>We assessed risk of bias in terms of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors), incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). In addition, we sought evidence that the groups were balanced at baseline and that intention-to-treat analyses were undertaken. The risk of bias in eligible trials was assessed by two review authors (AW and AM). We resolved any disagreement by discussion.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical methods</HEADING>
<P>We performed meta-analyses using RevMan software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-5.0" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 5.0</LINK>). Immediate successful shoulder reduction rate, as defined by the study authors, was used as the primary outcome measure.</P>
<P>For dichotomous (or binary) data we described the results as a relative measure, relative risk (RR). For continuous data, we used the mean difference (MD) whenever outcomes were measured in a standard way across studies.</P>
<P>We explored heterogeneity amongst included studies both qualitatively by comparing the characteristics of included studies and quantitatively using the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Where appropriate, we combined the results from the included studies for each outcome to give an overall estimate of treatment effect. We used a fixed-effect model meta-analysis except where statistical heterogeneity was identified, in which case we used a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>We minimized publication bias by comprehensive literature searching (<LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 2001</LINK>). In addition, we planned to use a graphical display (funnel plot) of the size of the treatment effect against the precision of the trial (1/standard error) to investigate publication bias.</P>
<P>No simple solution exists for the problem of missing data. We handled this problem by contacting the investigators, whenever possible, to ensure that no data were missing for the studies.

<P>Finally, we planned to perform sensitivity analyses to test how sensitive the results were to reasonable changes in the assumptions that were made and in the protocol for combining the data (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1998</LINK>). We planned to perform sensitivity analyses regarding randomized versus quasi-randomized and eventually good quality studies versus poor quality studies. We defined a good quality study as one which has all of the following domains: adequate allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment and data analysis performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. We defined a poor quality study as one which lacked one or more of these key domains.</P>

<P>Of the 1041 publications obtained from the electronic databases searched, nine potentially relevant trials were selected. Four trials were ultimately excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Paudel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paudel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pradhan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pradhan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suder-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Suder 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suder-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Suder 1995b</LINK>). Two of these trials were excluded because the participants were not randomized (<LINK REF="STD-Paudel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paudel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pradhan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pradhan 2006</LINK>). One trial was excluded because the type of shoulder dislocation experienced by the participants was unclear and it was not possible to obtain this information from the trialists (<LINK REF="STD-Suder-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Suder 1995a</LINK>). One trial was excluded because the definition of the outcome measures was unclear and it was not possible to obtain clarification from the trialists (<LINK REF="STD-Suder-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Suder 1995b</LINK>). See the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> for further information and <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Five studies met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). All the included studies reported the primary outcome measure of this review, the immediate success rate of the procedure (successful reduction of the dislocated shoulder). Three of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>) defined immediate success of the procedure based on post-reduction radiographs. Two of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>) did not explicitly state if successful reduction of the dislocated shoulder was defined clinically or radiologically.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK> compared IAL with intravenous morphine sulphate and diazepam. The setting was an urban, level-1 trauma centre. Eligible patients were adults presenting to the ED with radiographically confirmed AASD. Forty-nine patients were randomized by an unblocked simple sample randomization technique.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK> compared IAL with intravenous morphine sulphate and midazolam. The setting was a university medical centre. Eligible patients were patients presenting to the ED with AASD. Thirty consecutive patients were randomized by pulling out a page from the protocol book at random. This page indicated into which of the two study groups the patient was to be placed. One of two reduction techniques were used for the participants: traction-countertraction or scapular rotation. If the reduction was unsuccessful after using one of these techniques, the physician could change to any technique they desired.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK> compared IAL with intravenous fentanyl and midazolam. Two hospitals participated in the study: a private hospital and an urban level-1 trauma hospital. Inclusion criteria were: age 18 to 70 years and an AASD. Thirty patients were randomized by a quasi-random method using the hospital number. The reduction technique used for all participants was the modified Stimson technique.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK> compared IAL with intravenous meperidine and diazepam. Eligible patients were aged between 18 and 80 years and presenting to the ED with acute anterior shoulder dislocation. Forty-eight patients were randomized using a computerised random number generator. Reduction was performed in all the patients by a single person using the traction-countertraction method.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK> compared IAL with intravenous meperidine and diazepam. Eligible patients were adults presenting to the ED with shoulder pain and radiographically confirmed anterior shoulder dislocation. Twenty-nine patients were randomized by the physician pulling a pre-numbered envelope containing the intervention to which the patient was randomized. One of two reduction techniques was used for participants according to the discretion of the physician performing the reduction: the external rotation method or the traction-countertraction method.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<P>With regard to the primary outcome of this review, all the included studies reported the immediate success rate for both IAL and IVAS (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). There was no significant difference in the immediate success rate of the procedure (successful reduction of the dislocated shoulder) with IAL compared with IVAS (relative risk (RR) 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.10) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Pain during the procedure was reported for both interventions by three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>). All three studies used a 10-point verbal numeric rating scale (VNRS). There was no significant difference in pain during the procedure with IAL compared with IVAS (mean difference (MD) 0.18; 95% CI -1.41 to 1.77) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials reported post-reduction pain relief for IAL and IVAS (<LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). The results of both trials could not be pooled because of a difference in the timing used to define post-reduction pain relief. <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK> reported no statistically significant difference (P = 0.199) in the change in pain score before reduction to after reduction in the IAL group (49.8; 95% CI 39.3 to 60.3) compared with the IVAS group (58.4; 95% CI 49.8 to 66.9). <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK> reported no statistically significant difference (P = 0.33) in the mean change in post-reduction pain relief (pain score from after anaesthesia but prior to reduction to time of discharge) between IAL (-3.65 ± 2.67; 95% CI -4.81 to -2.47; n = 20) and IVAS (-2.79 ± 2.89; 95% CI -4.00 to -1.59; n = 21).</P>
<P>Two trials reported the time required for reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK> reported no significant difference between the two interventions with regard to time for reduction (10.1 minutes in the IAL group and 12.1 minutes in the IVAS group; P = 0.71, t-test). <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK> reported a statistically significant (P = 0.001) decrease in the time required for reduction with IVAS (105 seconds; 95% CI 84.0 to 126.1) compared with IAL (284.6 seconds; 95% CI 185.3 to 383.9). The results of the two trials could not be pooled because they were reported differently.</P>
<P>Three trials reported ease of reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). The results could not be pooled because the three trials reported ease of reduction in different ways. <LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK> reported no significant difference between the two interventions with regard to mean ease of reduction scores measured subjectively by the clinician using a 10-point visual analogue scale (4.45 ± 2.46 in the IAL group and 3.32 ± 2.36 in the IVAS group; P = 0.12, Fisher's exact test). <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK> reported that 10 of 15 reductions were rated as 'easy' and 0 of 15 as 'very tough' in the IAL group, whereas 7 out of 15 were rated as 'easy' and 2 of 15 as 'very tough' in the IVAS group. <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK> reported that physicians perceived that insufficient muscle relaxation interfered with the procedure in 21% of patients with IAL and 4% of patients in the IVAS group (RR 4.93; 95% CI 0.64 to 38.0; P = 0.11).</P>
<P>Two trials reported patient satisfaction during the procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). The results could not be pooled because the two trials reported this outcome measure in different ways. <LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK> reported that of those patients in the IAL group who had undergone previous reductions with IVAS sedation, 5 of 10 preferred being "put to sleep" for the procedure. With regard to IAL, an equal number of patients with recurrent dislocation appreciated effective analgesia without any central nervous system (CNS) sedation along with prompt discharge without an observation period. <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK> reported that patients perceived inadequate analgesia 24% of the time with IAL and 4% of the time with IVAS (RR 5.76; 95% CI 0.8 to 44.4; P = 0.1). Pain interfered with the reduction 7% of the time with the IAL method and 5% of the time with IVAS; this difference was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials reported the number of reduction attempts as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). There was no significant difference between IAL and IVAS in the number of one reduction attempts (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.33) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>), two reduction attempts (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.30 to 3.84) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>) and three reduction attempts (RR 2.65; 95% CI 0.16 to 44.78) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials compared the costs of the interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>). The results could not be pooled because the two trials reported this outcome measure in different ways. <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK> reported that the hospital charges for patients receiving IAL ranged from USD 117 to USD 133 per visit. Hospital charges for patients in the IVAS group ranged from USD 159.55 to USD 310 per visit depending on the need for extended monitoring and reversal agents. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK> reported the cost per patient of IVAS for closed manual reduction of AASD as USD 97.64 compared with USD 0.52 for IAL.</P>
<P>One trial reported on fractures complicating closed manual reduction. <LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK> reported two additional radiographic abnormalities, Hill-Sachs and nondisplaced greater tuberosity, in the IAL group that may have occurred during reduction; however, overlapping bone on the post-reduction radiograph may have obscured detection of a pre-reduction abnormality. <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK> reported no fractures in the study participants.</P>
<P>Adverse effects were reported by all the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). There were significantly fewer adverse effects associated with IAL compared with IVAS (RR 0.16; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.43) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials reported the average time spent in the ED (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>). The mean time spent in the ED was significantly less with IAL compared with IVAS (MD 109.46 minutes; 95% CI 84.60 to 134.32) (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>) for the two trials which reported the results as means and standard deviations (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK> also reported a shorter stay in the ED with IAL (140.6 minutes; 95% CI 104.2 to 177.1) compared with IVAS (216.5 minutes; 95% CI 164.0 to 269.0). The results of this trial could not be pooled with the other two trials because it did not report standard deviations and individual patient data could not be obtained from the trialists.</P>
<P>Two trials reported reduction failure as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>). One trial reported no reduction failures in either the IAL group or the IVAS group (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>). One trial reported one reduction failure in the IAL group and no reduction failure in the IVAS group (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial reported recovery time (<LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). The trial defined recovery time as the difference between the time of reduction and the time of discharge. To take into account the 15 minutes required before reduction was performed for the IAL method, the trialists added 15 minutes to the recovery time to derive an adjusted recovery time (<LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). The recovery time was significantly shorter with IAL compared with IVAS (<LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). The recovery time, reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD), was 103 ± 63 minutes for the IAL group compared with 154 ± 76 minutes for the IVAS group (P = 0.025) (<LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in the adjusted recovery times between the two groups, with a mean ± SD of 118 ± 63 minutes for the IAL group and 154 ± 76 minutes for the IVAS group (P = 0.085) (<LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>We were unable to pool the results for subgroup analyses because, of the four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>) which reported patients with a history of previous shoulder dislocations, only one study reported whether the previous dislocations were of the affected shoulder (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>). In addition, none of the studies which reported a history of previous shoulder dislocations reported standard deviations of the results. One study <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>) did not report the number of patients with previous shoulder dislocations as an outcome measure and was thus excluded from the subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK> reported that 40% of patients in the IVAS group (n = 20) and 34% in the IAL group (n = 29) had previous shoulder dislocations, but it did not report whether the previous dislocations were of the affected shoulder. Nevertheless, the study reported no statistically significant difference in the rates of successful reduction between the two groups (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK> reported two patients with one previous dislocation each and one patient with 10 previous dislocations, in the IAL group (n = 15); none of these previous dislocations could be confirmed. They reported two patients with one previous dislocation each, one patient with three previous dislocations and one patient with four previous dislocations in the IVAS group (n = 15). All the patients in both groups underwent successful reduction (100% successful reduction in each group; RR and 95% CI not estimable).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK> reported that four patients in the IAL group (n = 16) and five in the IVAS group (n = 14) had had previous dislocation of the affected shoulder. All patients reported having had one or two prior dislocations except for one patient in the IVAS group, who reported 30 previous dislocations. No patients reported that they had had previous surgery on the dislocated shoulder.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-02-26 00:23:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review summarizes the current evidence derived from RCTs comparing IAL with IVAS for the closed manual reduction of AASD. The results of this review indicate that the immediate success rate and pain experienced by patients who were treated with IAL was not significantly different from those treated with IVAS.</P>
<P>The absence of any significant difference between the interventions with regard to the pain experienced may be due to the use of fixed, rather than weight-based, drug doses in the IVAS arm of the included studies. This raises the possibility that therapeutic systemic levels of the administered intravenous analgesics were not achieved in some patients in the IVAS arm of the included studies.</P>
<P>No significant difference was found in post-reduction pain relief between the two interventions. This outcome measure was reported by two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). Owing to the small number of participants in the trials, the effect measure may be imprecise. The lack of any difference between the two interventions for this outcome measure may also be due to the use of fixed drug doses.</P>
<P>Two trials which met the inclusion criteria for this review reported no significant difference between the two interventions with regard to time required for reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>). It was not possible to pool the results of these two trials because the time for reduction to occur was measured in different ways in the respective studies, and it was not possible to obtain the individual patient data from the trialists. The estimates yielded by these trials may be imprecise due to the small sample sizes.</P>
<P>Regarding recovery time, no firm conclusions can be drawn from the findings of this review. One trial reported a statistically significant shorter mean recovery time with IAL compared with IVAS, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two interventions in relation to the time from analgesia delivery to discharge, the adjusted recovery time (<LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). Another included trial reported that the IAL group spent a shorter mean time in the emergency department (ED) compared with the IVAS group (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>). This study reported that the IAL group left the ED at a mean ± SD of 75 ± 48 minutes after the shoulder was reduced, whereas the IVAS group left in a mean time of 185 ± 26 minutes (P = 0.42, t-test) (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no increased risk of fractures complicating reduction in patients treated with either IAL or IVAS (<LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>). A significant reduction in other adverse effects and in recovery time was observed with IAL compared with IVAS.</P>
<P>The lower risk of other adverse effects observed with IAL compared to IVAS in this review may possibly be because IVAS is associated with central nervous system and respiratory depression (<LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>). Nausea, vomiting and lethargy may also occur, requiring prolonged ED observation (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>). Antidotal treatment for reversal of benzodiazepine sedation or opiate analgesia is sometimes required to aid patient recovery (<LINK REF="STD-Orlinsky-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orlinsky 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is important to note, however, that the differences we observed in adverse effects associated with IAL and IVAS (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) were largely driven by one study (<LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>). This study reported the highest number of adverse events (drowsiness in three participants) in the IAL group (<LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>). The trialists reported that the drowsiness was because, before being enrolled in the study, the three participants in the IAL group had ingested an analgesic (tramadol, which can cause drowsiness) for symptom relief without informing the investigators (<LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>To further investigate the effect of the <LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK> study in driving the adverse effects reported in this review, we analysed the summary results of this outcome measure with and without the study (<LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>). With this study (<LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>) included in the analysis, IAL was associated with significantly fewer adverse effects compared with IVAS (RR 0.16; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.43) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). In contrast, without the study (<LINK REF="STD-Moharari-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moharari 2008</LINK>) there was no significant difference between the two interventions in relation to adverse effects (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.15). It is, therefore, not possible to reach any firm conclusion about any differences between the two interventions in relation to adverse effects based on the findings of this review.</P>
<P>Analysis of ED reduction failure was based on one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kosnik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kosnik 1999</LINK>). The estimate yielded by this trial may be imprecise owing to the small sample size. Therefore, no firm conclusions regarding ED reduction failure can be drawn from the findings.</P>
<P>Trials reporting the outcome measures ease of reduction, patient satisfaction during the procedure and cost of the intervention could not be pooled because the outcomes were measured in different ways in the respective trials. Quantitative meta-analysis was also deemed inappropriate in relation to failed ED manual reduction, or referral to orthopaedics for reduction, because one of the two trials reporting this outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1995</LINK>) reported no events in either comparator group.</P>
<P>Despite subgroup analyses, there was no identifiable relationship between a history of previous shoulder dislocations and the rate of successful reduction of the dislocated shoulder. However, subgroup comparisons should be interpreted with caution in this review because the number of participants in each study was small. We were unable to pool the data for subgroup comparisons because the studies did not report standard deviations and only one study specified whether the history of previous shoulder dislocations involved the shoulder of interest.</P>
<P>Although quasi-randomized trials are associated with a greater risk of selection bias, the inclusion of one quasi-randomized trial (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>) in this review did not significantly alter the findings.</P>

<P>In the management of acute anterior shoulder dislocation, there may be no significant difference between IAL and IVAS with regard to immediate success rate of closed manual reduction. However, IAL may be associated with fewer adverse effects, a shorter ED stay and may be cheaper when compared with IVAS. These effect measures may be imprecise because of the small number of eligible studies and the limited methodological quality of the included studies in this review (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-02-11 11:46:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Like all systematic reviews, the conclusions of this review are limited by the quality of existing studies. Specifically, the findings of this review are limited by the relatively small number of eligible studies, the small sample sizes in the included studies, the use of empirical drug dosing in the IVAS arm of the included studies and the lack of evidence demonstrating accurate intra-articular lignocaine injection in any of the included studies. Furthermore, with regard to drug dosing, the IVAS groups were heterogenous for two reasons. First, neither the sedative agent used nor the concurrent use of opiates was controlled across the studies. Second, differences in study design and differences between patients may have dictated different levels of sedation employed. Because the nature of the interventions were such that double-blinding was not feasible (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), foreknowledge of the intervention may have led to biased results. Larger randomized controlled trials are, therefore, required to assess the effect of IAL compared with IVAS regarding the primary outcome measure of this review, the immediate success rate of closed manual reduction of AASD. In addition, further studies should employ weight-based drug doses and objectively confirm intra-articular lignocaine injection. It is a major limitation of existing RCTs that they do not report long-term follow up of participants for joint infection (septic arthritis) complicating IAL. Future clinical trials should address the risk of septic arthritis as an important outcome measure.</P>
