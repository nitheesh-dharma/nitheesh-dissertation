<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-03-10 11:40:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background:</B>
</P>
<P>Incentives, usually as cash or as vouchers, are widely used to encourage smokers to try to quit, and to reward them if they succeed. Such schemes can be run in workplaces, in clinics, and sometimes as community programmes. For this third update of our review we now include studies in pregnant women. Another change is that we have separated out trials which use incentives from those which use competitions; we will now cover the competition trials in a separate update.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B>
<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Mixed-population trials:</I> We found 21 trials, covering more than 8400 people, which looked at different incentive schemes to help smokers to try and quit. Our most recent search was in December 2014, although we also include two trials published after this date. Ten of the studies were set in clinics or health centres, one in villages in Thailand served by community health workers, two in research centres, and the rest in worksites. All but six of the trials were run in the USA. All the trials followed up their participants for at least six months, and checked whether or not the quitters had succeeded by testing their breath or bodily fluids. The incentives included lottery tickets, prize draws, cash payments, vouchers for goods and groceries, and in six trials the return of money deposited by those taking part.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Pregnancy trials:</I> We found nine trials, eight based in the USA and one in the UK, covering almost 1600 women trying to quit smoking while pregnant. Rewards were vouchers for goods or groceries, and were sometimes increased in value depending on how long the woman had managed to stay quit.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Key results:</B>
<BR/>
<I>Mixed-population trials</I>: Six months or more after the beginning of the trial, people receiving incentives were more likely to have quit than those in the control groups. Only three trials reported prolonged success beyond the close of the programme. One USA trial, paying quitters up to USD 750, found that nearly three times as many people stopped smoking in the experimental group compared to the controls. Another USA trial paying out up to USD 800 per quitter found that nearly twice as many people receiving payments stopped smoking compared to the control group. This trial also compared paying out rewards to returning the participant's own money to them if they managed to quit. Although more people in this trial took part in the rewards programmes than in the deposit programmes, the proportion of quitters in each group favoured the deposit-refund programme. The third trial was based in Thailand and rewarded quitters by returning their own money to them with bonuses. Although medium-term quit rates were encouraging, the deposit-return programmes generally struggled to match the rewards programmes for numbers willing to take part.</P>
<P>
<I>Pregnancy trials:</I> Eight of the nine trials with usable data showed that women in the incentive groups were more likely to quit than those in the control groups, both at the end of the pregnancy and at the longest follow-up (up to 24 weeks after the birth). Four of the trials confirmed that payments made to reward a successful quit attempt ('contingent' payments), compared to fixed payments for attending the antenatal appointment ('non-contingent'), produced higher quit rates. The largest trial, based in the UK, used the NHS stop-smoking service to deliver support in quitting, and achieved a quit rate in the incentives group almost four times as high as in the control group. One trial which weighted the payments to meet the challenge of greater withdrawal symptoms in the first two weeks of quitting found that this made little difference to the women's chances of success.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence:</B>
<BR/>We rated the overall quality of the older mixed-population studies as low, but with later trials (2000 onwards) more likely to be well conducted and fully reported. Removing the early trials from the calculations made very little difference to the results at six-month follow-up, but did increase the advantage for incentives at 12 month-follow-up. The pregnancy trials were all published within the last 15 years, and were generally of moderate quality.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-10 10:58:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Material or financial incentives are widely used in an attempt to precipitate or reinforce behaviour change, including smoking cessation. They operate in workplaces, in clinics and hospitals, and to a lesser extent within community programmes. In this third update of our review we now include trials conducted in pregnant women, to reflect the increasing activity and resources now targeting this high-risk group of smokers. </P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-08-19 15:36:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine whether incentives and contingency management programmes lead to higher long-term quit rates. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-10 10:52:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, with additional searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. The most recent searches were in December 2014, although we also include two trials published in 2015.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-01-14 09:23:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered randomised controlled trials, allocating individuals, workplaces, groups within workplaces, or communities to experimental or control conditions. We also considered controlled studies with baseline and post-intervention measures. We include studies in a mixed-population setting (e.g. community-, work-, institution-based), and also, for this update, trials in pregnant smokers.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-03-10 10:52:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One author (KC) extracted data and a second (JH-B) checked them. We contacted study authors for additional data where necessary. The main outcome measure in the mixed-population studies was abstinence from smoking at longest follow-up, and at least six months from the start of the intervention. In the trials of pregnant smokers abstinence was measured at the longest follow-up, and at least to the end of the pregnancy. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-10 13:21:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-one mixed-population studies met our inclusion criteria, covering more than 8400 participants. Ten studies were set in clinics or health centres, one in Thai villages served by community health workers, two in academic institutions, and the rest in worksites. All but six of the trials were run in the USA. The incentives included lottery tickets or prize draws, cash payments, vouchers for goods and groceries, and in six trials the recovery of money deposited by those taking part. The odds ratio (OR) for quitting with incentives at longest follow-up (six months or more) compared with controls was 1.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.69; 17 trials, [20 comparisons], 7715 participants). Only three studies demonstrated significantly higher quit rates for the incentives group than for the control group at or beyond the six-month assessment: One five-arm USA trial compared rewards- and deposit-based interventions at individual and group level, with incentives available up to USD 800 per quitter, and demonstrated a quit rate in the rewards groups of 8.1% at 12 months, compared with 4.7% in the deposits groups. A direct comparison between the rewards-based and the deposit-based groups found a benefit for the rewards arms, with an OR at 12 months of 1.76 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.53; 2070 participants). Although more people in this trial accepted the rewards programmes than the deposit programmes, the proportion of quitters in each group favoured the deposit-refund programme. Another USA study rewarded both participation and quitting up to USD 750, and achieved sustained quit rates of 9.4% in the incentives group compared with 3.6% for the controls. A deposit-refund trial in Thailand also achieved significantly higher quit rates in the intervention group (44.2%) compared with the control group (18.8%), but uptake was relatively low, at 10.5%. In the remaining trials, there was no clear evidence that participants who committed their own money to the programme did better than those who did not, or that contingent rewards enhanced success rates over fixed payment schedules. We rated the overall quality of the older studies as low, but with later trials (post-2000) more likely to meet current standards of methodology and reporting.</P>
<P>Eight of nine trials with usable data in pregnant smokers (seven conducted in the USA and one in the UK) delivered an adjusted OR at longest follow-up (up to 24 weeks post-partum) of 3.60 (95% CI 2.39 to 5.43; 1295 participants, moderate-quality studies) in favour of incentives. Three of the trials demonstrated a clear benefit for contingent rewards; one delivered monthly vouchers to confirmed quitters and to their designated 'significant other supporter', achieving a quit rate in the intervention group of 21.4% at two months post-partum, compared with 5.9% among the controls. Another trial offered a scaled programme of rewards for the percentage of smoking reduction achieved over the course of the 12-week intervention, and achieved an intervention quit rate of 31% at six weeks post-partum, compared with no quitters in the control group. The largest (UK-based) trial provided intervention quitters with up to GBP 400-worth of vouchers, and achieved a quit rate of 15.4% at longest follow-up, compared to the control quit rate of 4%. Four trials confirmed that payments made to reward a successful quit attempt (i.e. contingent), compared to fixed payments for attending the antenatal appointment (non-contingent), resulted in higher quit rates. Front-loading of rewards to counteract early withdrawal symptoms made little difference to quit rates.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-10 11:09:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Incentives appear to boost cessation rates while they are in place. The two trials recruiting from work sites that achieved sustained success rates beyond the reward schedule concentrated their resources into substantial cash payments for abstinence. Such an approach may only be feasible where independently-funded smoking cessation programmes are already available, and within a relatively affluent and educated population. Deposit-refund trials can suffer from relatively low rates of uptake, but those who do sign up and contribute their own money may achieve higher quit rates than reward-only participants. Incentive schemes conducted among pregnant smokers improved the cessation rates, both at the end-of-pregnancy and post-partum assessments. Current and future research might continue to explore the scale, loading and longevity of possible cash or voucher reward schedules, within a variety of smoking populations.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-15 08:34:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-15 08:34:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a growing enthusiasm for incentive-based programmes to change unhealthy behaviours, including smoking, weight loss, alcohol consumption and levels of physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Many developing countries, particularly in Latin America, operate conditional cash transfer programmes of monetary rewards for behaviour change or compliance, often targeting improvements in child and maternal health (<LINK REF="REF-Lagarde-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lagarde 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paes_x002d_Sousa-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paes-Sousa 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell_x002d_Jackson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell-Jackson 2011</LINK>). In the UK incentive schemes often focus on encouraging pregnant smokers to quit, with programmes such as 'Give It Up For Baby' (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Radley-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Radley 2013</LINK>) and 'quit4u' (<LINK REF="STD-Ormston-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ormston 2014</LINK>), conducted in Tayside (Scotland) and awarding grocery vouchers for verified abstinence. A series of studies in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heil-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Heil 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2014</LINK>) and a major randomised trial in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK>) also attest to the tobacco control community's interest in the feasibility of rewarding pregnant smokers for achieved abstinence.</P>
<P>The workplace is also a common setting for the use of incentives. This is briefly addressed in a companion review (<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2014</LINK>), but we explore it more fully here. Most of the relevant studies have been conducted in the USA, in part because of the structure of the healthcare system there, which obliges employers to cover health insurance costs for their workforce. In other countries, where the state or private insurance companies are the main healthcare provider, there may be less tangible incentive for employers to take direct responsibility for the health of their workers. There are a number of advantages to offering smoking cessation support in the workplace, including the accessibility of the target population, the availability of occupational health support and the potential for peer pressure and peer support. Because of the existing salary and bonus structure, it is also relatively easy to set up a rewards system to supplement the programme, if that is the chosen mechanism. Seventy-one per cent of large US companies (employing more than 200 workers) offer smoking cessation programmes, and 36% offer financial incentives for wellness programmes, but generally for participation in and completion of a programme rather than for a verified change in health behaviour. From January 2014, section 1201 of the Affordable Care Act (2010) has increased the maximum allowable reward to as high as 50% of the total health insurance premium for smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Cawley-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cawley 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>A 2012 survey by the RAND Corporation of USA wellness plans found that, among those using incentives in companies with more than 50 employees, 84% frame them as rewards only, 11% frame them as both rewards and penalties, and 2% frame them as penalties only (3% unknown) (<LINK REF="REF-Cawley-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cawley 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattke-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattke 2013</LINK>). We consider the implications of this approach in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> section below.</P>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-28 11:58:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Incentives and rewards (terms used interchangeably in studies contributing to this review) routinely feature in many smoking cessation programmes, in support of the quitting process. They can be used to encourage recruitment into the programme, to reward compliance with the process, and to reward cessation achieved at predefined stages. A variety of rewards have been used for these purposes, including cash payments, vouchers exchangeable for goods (excluding alcohol and cigarettes), salary bonuses, promotional items such as T-shirts, pens and bags, holidays, and luxury goods such as cars or boats.</P>
<P>Rewards can be given for attendance at the programme and at follow-up appointments, irrespective of subsequent smoking status (i.e. guaranteed or non-contingent), or can be paid and scaled relative to the participant's success within the programme (i.e. contingent) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>).

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-05-15 08:34:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Over the ten-year lifetime of this review, the debate about incentive-based smoking cessation programmes has shifted from their feasibility (i.e. can they work?) to the relative success or limitations of the mechanisms deployed (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Promberger-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Promberger 2012</LINK>), the merits of rewards ('carrots') versus penalties ('sticks') (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynagh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynagh 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volpp-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpp 2014</LINK>), the extent to which achieved changes can be maintained (<LINK REF="REF-Jochelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jochelson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strickland-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strickland 2014</LINK>) , and the possibilities of unintended consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Marteau-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marteau 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 2014</LINK>). Although many of the older included studies may not address these issues, our review contributes to a growing evidence base which defines the rationale for incentive-based programmes and identifies areas for further investigation. We have also revised the inclusion criteria to cover interventions in pregnant smokers, since this population is increasingly the focus of incentive-based smoking cessation programmes worldwide.</P>
<P>This updated review is a modified version of our previous review <I>Competitions and incentives for smoking cessation (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2011</LINK>). As the emphasis in public health has shifted in recent years away from cessation competitions, and towards contingent and non-contingent incentive programmes, we have now split the review into two. This updated version is restricted to financial and goods-based incentives, while the forthcoming companion update, <I>Competitions for smoking cessation,</I> will cover competition-based cessation programmes, both institutional and community-based, including 'Quit and win' contests. Although previous versions of this review excluded interventions targeting pregnant women, we now include them in this update; another Cochrane review, <I>Psychosocial interventions for supporting women to stop smoking in pregnancy</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 2013</LINK>) covers some of the same trials, but addresses different outcomes, concentrating on antepartum abstinence and the wellbeing of the baby rather than on the prolonged smoking status of the mother.</P>

<P>The primary outcome for this review is cessation rates, including point prevalence and sustained abstinence. For trials in the mixed populations abstinence had to be assessed at a minimum of six months from the start of the intervention, whether or not they were biochemically validated (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2003</LINK>). The gold standard is biochemically-verified sustained abstinence for at least six months. We exclude from this review trials which do not report cessation rates.<BR/>For trials in pregnant women, we extracted smoking cessation outcomes at the closest follow-up to end of pregnancy, and also at longest follow-up postpartum if reported. We did not require the minimum six-month follow-up period.</P>

<P>We have combined eligible studies using a generic inverse variance model, to produce adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using a fixed-effect model. Adjustment is for cluster randomisation where appropriate. Raw data (event counts and denominators) for the key meta-analyses are displayed in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>.

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-01-14 09:50:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several mixed-population studies were cluster-randomised, i.e. allocated by group, community, or workplace. We have used the intraclass correlation coefficient reported by <LINK REF="REF-Martinson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinson 1999</LINK> (ICC for percentage quit smoking in Worksite) to obtain an adjusted estimate of the effect size for the studies that were cluster-randomised.

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-01-14 09:50:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We contacted investigators or study sponsors in order to verify key study characteristics and to obtain missing numerical outcome data where possible (e.g. when a study is reported as abstract only).

</P>
<P>We have generally treated participants who dropped out or who were lost to follow-up after randomisation as being continuing smokers. We note the proportion of participants for whom the outcome was imputed in this way, and whether there was either high or differential loss to follow-up between the groups. The assumption that 'missing = smoking' will give conservative absolute quit rates, and will make little difference to the risk ratio unless drop-out rates differ substantially between groups. Where possible, we conducted an intention-to-treat analysis, including all smokers randomised.</P>

<BR/>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1993</LINK>) of the 21 did not deploy any kind of cessation support programme.</P>
<P>Three of the earlier studies used aversive smoking as part of a multi-component programme (<LINK REF="STD-Paxton-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Paxton 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paxton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Paxton 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paxton-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Paxton 1983</LINK>).

<P>The 13 remaining studies all used some form of multi-component support programme.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions in pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>For this update, we also include, as a separate group, nine trials (1783 women) conducted in pregnant smokers. As part of this grouping, we also identified nine excluded studies, five ongoing studies from trial registries, and two protocols for forthcoming trials. One ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK>; CPIT study) published its results as we were completing the update, and after the date of the last search, but we have included the findings in this review.</P>
<P>
<I>Outcomes</I>
<BR/>All the included studies reported abstinence at the end of pregnancy, with six of the nine tracking participants into the post-partum stage. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2002</LINK>) referred simply to 'abstinence', without further definition of the type or duration. In all cases, rewards were available only for biochemically-verified abstinence. Two trials rewarded smoking reduction as well as complete abstinence, with <LINK REF="STD-Tuten-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tuten 2012</LINK> setting percentage reduction targets to be met for rewards, while <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2014</LINK> allocated higher-value vouchers for breath samples below 4 ppm rather than 6 ppm in the early stages of the trial. Because our concern here is for the mothers' long-term cessation, our primary outcome of interest for this group is abstinence at the longest available assessment point, but we also report abstinence rates at or around the end of pregnancy for all the trials. See tabulated results in <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<I>Settings</I>
<BR/>Eight studies were conducted in the USA, mostly in public or private antenatal clinics, obstetric practices, and Women, Infants, and Children programme sites. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tuten-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tuten 2012</LINK>) in methadone-maintained pregnant women was conducted in the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy in Baltimore. The largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK>; the Cessation in Pregnancy Incentives Trial), with 612 participants, was UK-based, in an NHS health board area (Greater Glasgow and Clyde) with three major maternity hospitals. This study was mediated through routine use of the UK Stop-smoking Service.</P>
<P>
<I>Incentives</I>
<BR/>In all cases the rewards were vouchers for goods or services, rather than cash payments. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2002</LINK>) delivered monthly rewards contingent upon proven abstinence. Four trials evaluated the allocation of incremental rewards, with the voucher reset to baseline value in the case of relapse or missed visits, but restored to previous levels if abstinence was re-established (<LINK REF="STD-Heil-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Heil 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuten-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tuten 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ondersma-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ondersma 2012</LINK>, using a computer-based intervention, shifted the onus of testing to the participants, who could present themselves as often as they wished for verification of abstinence, and could win up to five USD 50 gift cards over the course of the programme. <LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK> awarded vouchers up to a value of GBP 350 for achieving staged cessation targets, and a further GBP 50 for engaging with the programme and setting a quit date. <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000a</LINK> also rewarded a social supporter, in tandem with the participant smoker. Non-contingent rewards, roughly equivalent to the value available to the intervention group, were given to control participants in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heil-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Heil 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2014</LINK>), while <LINK REF="STD-Tuten-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tuten 2012</LINK> incorporated a group on a schedule of non-contingent rewards generated from an earlier pilot study. <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000a</LINK> gave a USD 5 voucher to all participants for each of three attendances during the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK> gave all participants a GBP 25 shopping voucher for supplying primary outcome information (34 to 38 weeks gestation) and a biological sample if appropriate.</P>
<P>
<I>Cessation methods</I>
<BR/>All the trials offered a programme of practical cessation support, in addition to the routine care delivered by the host clinics. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ondersma-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ondersma 2012</LINK>) used the 5As approach (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arange), while five trials offered self-help materials. <LINK REF="STD-Tuten-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tuten 2012</LINK> also included a brief motivational interviewing feedback session for all participants. The UK trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK>) referred all participants to the UK Stop-smoking Service, which routinely conducted a one-hour cessation session, four weekly phone calls, and free NRT if the woman requested it.</P>

</P>
<P>All the included studies used some form of biochemical validation procedure.

Eleven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Alessi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alessi 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Paul-1994" TYPE="STUDY">De Paul 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drummond-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Drummond 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ledgerwood-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ledgerwood 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rand-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rand 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Secades_x002d_Villa-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Secades-Villa 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shoptaw-_x0028_A_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shoptaw (A) 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tevyaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tevyaw 2009</LINK>) included verification by testing breath samples for carbon monoxide (CO) levels, often to supplement the cotinine testing.<BR/>
<BR/>In order to test the robustness of the cessation interventions, we have included in our review only those studies which followed up participants for at least six months from the beginning of the intervention. One of the trials, however, (<LINK REF="STD-Rand-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rand 1989</LINK>) delivered their final cessation rewards six months into the programme, which was also the end of the designated follow-up period, thereby confounding the intervention rewards with testing at the longest follow-up. A sensitivity analysis removing this trial made no difference to the six-month result.</P>
<P>We constructed an exploratory funnel plot for the main meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>, abstinence at longest follow-up), but did not detect indications of publication bias, i.e. that studies with negative findings might be under-represented.</P>
<P>
<B>Appropriateness of analysis</B>
<BR/>Three trials which used a cluster-randomised design made due allowance for this in their analyses, either by testing for intraclass correlation (<LINK REF="STD-De-Paul-1994" TYPE="STUDY">De Paul 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1993</LINK>), or by including worksite as a random effect (<LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-De-Paul-1994" TYPE="STUDY">De Paul 1994</LINK> randomised by company, but analysed by individual participant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1995</LINK> collapsed the three-way groupings for the six-month follow-up results, since differences between groups were by then negligible, and <LINK REF="STD-Windsor-_x0028_A_x0029_-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Windsor (A) 1988</LINK> collapsed the incentive/non-incentive groupings for analyses after the six-week assessment, as contradictory differences had emerged between the two pairs of groups. Our own analysis of <LINK REF="STD-Windsor-_x0028_A_x0029_-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Windsor (A) 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Windsor-_x0028_B_x0029_-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Windsor (B) 1988</LINK> compares the effect of the smoking cessation components with and without the incentives. <LINK REF="STD-Drummond-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Drummond 2014</LINK> detected no effect of spirometry on cessation, and no interaction between the lung age groups and the contingency management groups, and therefore collapsed the four-way structure into a dichotomous CM versus no-CM comparison. <LINK REF="STD-Gin_x00e9_-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Giné 2010</LINK> recruited in three waves, across two different towns on the Philippine island of Mindanao, and revised the allocation procedure for the third wave, but analysed all participants as randomised individuals; they also collapsed the original stratification between participants who went to the bank to make their deposits and those who were visited by bank officials to make their payments.</P>

We judged <LINK REF="STD-Ondersma-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ondersma 2012</LINK> to be at low risk of bias for sequence generation, as this was conducted by computer for the cessation intervention and by a random number generator (<A HREF="http://www.randomization.com">www.randomization.com</A>) for the contingency management component. We also rated <LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK> at low risk for selection bias; they deployed a block method (block size of four) conducted by the Glasgow Clinical Trials Unit for this purpose.

<P>All the trials reported abstinence at or near the end of pregnancy, except for <LINK REF="STD-Ondersma-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ondersma 2012</LINK>, who reported abstinence at the end of the 10-week programme (before delivery). Seven of the trials used point prevalence abstinence as their main measure, with <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2002</LINK> simply citing 'abstinence', without further elaboration. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heil-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Heil 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ondersma-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ondersma 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK>) also reported measures of continuous abstinence. Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heil-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Heil 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK>) assessed smoking status post-partum; <LINK REF="STD-Tuten-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tuten 2012</LINK> reported the mean number of cigarettes per day at six weeks post-partum, but not verified abstinence. We have in every case preferred the strictest definition of abstinence at the longest follow-up. All the trials except for <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000a</LINK> validated claims of cessation using a combination of carbon monoxide monitoring and urinary or salivary cotinine. <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000a</LINK> tested salivary thiocyanate in self-reported quitters, as well as salivary cotinine.</P>

<P>Details of the results for the 21 mixed-population included studies in this review are tabulated in the Analyses section (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), and are displayed graphically where data were available in <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.</P>
<P>We have conducted a meta-analysis of 17 of the included studies (20 comparisons), grouping by longest follow-up and by evaluation points (six to 24 months; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The primary result at longest follow-up (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.69; 7715 participants; I² = 33%) is presented in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. The six-month result also demonstrated an unequivocal benefit for the incentives groups, with an adjusted OR of 1.72 (95% CI 1.43 to 2.08; 6945 participants; I² = 51%).The forest plots indicate that only the <LINK REF="STD-Halpern-_x0028_A_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern (A) 2015</LINK> (rewards versus usual care), <LINK REF="STD-Volpp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Volpp 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-White-2013" TYPE="STUDY">White 2013</LINK> trials demonstrated a significant advantage for incentives at all evaluation points. Although <LINK REF="STD-White-2013" TYPE="STUDY">White 2013</LINK> reports a significant advantage at 14 months (longest follow-up) for the deposit contract group over the controls (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.23; 200 participants; analysis not shown), we have not included this finding in the 12-month meta-analysis, as abstinence at this stage was by self report only, and not biochemically or witness verified. We combined the two reward-based arms of the <LINK REF="STD-Halpern-_x0028_A_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern (A) 2015</LINK> trial and the two deposit-refund-based arms, and compared each combined grouping against the usual care control condition. The rewards-based interventions delivered significantly more instances of sustained abstinence at both the six- and 12-month assessment points. For <LINK REF="STD-Volpp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Volpp 2009</LINK>, in which assessments began at three or six months after enrolment, abstinence at nine or 12 months is included in the six-month forest plot, and abstinence at 15 or 18 months in the 12-month forest plot. We have excluded <LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2002</LINK> from the formal analyses, since no extractable data were available on programme participants at follow-up; <LINK REF="STD-Paxton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Paxton 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Paxton-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Paxton 1983</LINK> were excluded because all the participants (experimental and control) received incentives. <LINK REF="STD-Shoptaw-_x0028_A_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shoptaw (A) 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Windsor-_x0028_A_x0029_-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Windsor (A) 1988</LINK> are each presented with two separate comparisons, since each study evaluated incentives with two different interventions in a factorial design.<BR/>
<BR/>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-De-Paul-1994" TYPE="STUDY">De Paul 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rand-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rand 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Windsor-_x0028_A_x0029_-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Windsor (A) 1988</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Windsor-_x0028_B_x0029_-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Windsor (B) 1988</LINK>) paid out their final reward to coincide with the six-month follow-up, which may have compromised that finding. A sensitivity analysis excluding these studies made little difference to the result (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.19).</P>
<P>We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of guaranteed rewards (vouchers or cash for abstinence) versus the chance of winning a reward (lotteries, prize draws), on the assumption that the level of certainty of receiving a reward might modify the success of the intervention. To this end, we identified five trials which used a lottery or a prize draw as all or part of their incentive programme (<LINK REF="STD-Alessi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alessi 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ledgerwood-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ledgerwood 2014</LINK>). Two of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2002</LINK>) provided no usable data for meta-analysis, and could not contribute to the assessment. Removing all three trials from the main meta-analysis (abstinence at longest follow-up) and removing <LINK REF="STD-Alessi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alessi 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ledgerwood-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ledgerwood 2014</LINK> from the six-month meta-analysis made little difference to the effect estimates or to the CIs, and marginally increased the I² values (longest follow-up: OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.76, I² = 42%; six-month follow-up: OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.02, I² = 54%). Removing <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1993</LINK> from the 12-month meta-analysis moved the result to borderline significance (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.65, I² = 57%, P = 0.05).<BR/>
<BR/>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Halpern-_x0028_A_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern (A) 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volpp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Volpp 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2013" TYPE="STUDY">White 2013</LINK>) detected a significant effect of rewards or incentives on smoking abstinence at their longest follow-up, and not confounded by rewards paid out for abstinence at that time point. In <LINK REF="STD-Volpp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Volpp 2009</LINK> at 15 or 18 months, quit rates for the incentivised and control groups were 9.4% versus 3.6% respectively (P = 0.001). A secondary endpoint in this trial was the completion of a smoking cessation programme, for which the intervention participants received a USD 100 payment. While all participants received information about local smoking cessation services, 15.4% of the intervention group enrolled in a cessation programme, compared to 5.4% of the controls (P &lt; 0.001); 10.8% of the incentivised group completed the programme compared to 2.5% of the controls (P &lt; 0.001). <LINK REF="STD-White-2013" TYPE="STUDY">White 2013</LINK> also demonstrated a significant benefit for incentives, but in this case the endpoint was six months, and with fewer participants than the Volpp trial (201 versus 878). The six-month quit rate for the incentivised group was 44.3%, compared with 18.8% in the controls. Participants across the trial were paired into 'teams', with each pair earning a substantial bonus of THB 1200 (&#8776; USD 40, about 16% of median monthly household income) at the three-month assessment if both members of the team were quit. By this measure, the intervention teams did significantly better, with 26.2% of individuals earning the team bonus, compared with 3.6% of the controls (P &lt; 0.001); randomly-assigned teams performed no differently from self-selected pairings for this outcome.</P>
<P>The largest trial among the included studies is <LINK REF="STD-Halpern-_x0028_A_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern (A) 2015</LINK>, a five-arm RCT covering 2538 participants drawn from employees of a national pharmacy chain and their families and friends. The interventions were predominantly internet-based, and participants were supported by local smoking cessation resources, self-help booklets and, for those eligible for company health benefits, free access to behavioural support and NRT if they wished. The trial tested individual and group-based interventions, with the financial incentives either funded entirely from study resources ('rewards') or by participants paying in USD 150 of their own money and the study topping up the balance ('deposits'). All participants stood to gain around USD 800 for sustained abstinence to six months. All four incentivised arms did significantly better than the usual-care control group at the study's six-month primary endpoint of validated sustained abstinence, but only the reward-based arms maintained this advantage to the 12-month follow-up point. As there were no significant differences between the individual- and group-based arms at any time point, we have combined the four arms into two groups (rewards versus deposits) for our analyses. The rewards groups achieved a sustained quit rate of 8.1% at 12 months, compared with 4.7% in the deposits groups. This is the only included study to have conducted head-to-head comparisons between a rewards-based and a deposit-refund-based approach, delivering an OR at 12 months in favour of the rewards arms of 1.76 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.53; analysis not shown). We further consider these findings and implications in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> section below.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Costs</HEADING>
<P>We consider only the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Halpern-_x0028_A_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern (A) 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volpp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Volpp 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2013" TYPE="STUDY">White 2013</LINK>) that demonstrated long-term benefits beyond the end of the programme. Among all participants in <LINK REF="STD-Halpern-_x0028_A_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern (A) 2015</LINK> achieving sustained abstinence at six months, the average cost per quitter ranged from USD 800 to USD 890. The trialists compared this outlay, even without any deposit contribution from the participant, to the estimated USD 5186 additional cost to employers of hiring a smoker rather than a non-smoker (<LINK REF="REF-Berman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 2014</LINK>), and rated the intervention highly cost-effective. <LINK REF="STD-Volpp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Volpp 2009</LINK> offered no comment on potential cost benefits of incentives programmes, other than to report an estimate of savings per quitter to an employer (USD 3400 per year, <LINK REF="REF-MMWR-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 2002</LINK>). Subsequent decisions, however, on the implementation of the programme in the host company are discussed below in the <LINK TAG="SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Summary of main results</LINK> section of the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-White-2013" TYPE="STUDY">White 2013</LINK> reported that the intervention, if rolled out to the smoking population in the study area, could translate to a decrease in smoking rates of 2% to 5%, and offered an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. The authors estimate that the cost per quitter from the intervention was USD 281 (95% CI USD 187 to USD 562), compared with quitting with nicotine gum (USD 1780, 95% CI USD 1414 to USD 2401) or with varenicline (USD 2073, 95% CI USD 1357 to USD 4388) in Thailand. The authors note that the intervention complies with the World Health Organization's ranking of "very cost-effective" in Thailand, i.e. less than gross domestic product (USD 8600, purchasing power parity-adjusted in 2011; <LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 2012</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 2007</LINK>, reporting an intervention in 180 people with schizophrenia or other serious mental illness, briefly considered whether smoking cessation may have worsened the participants' psychiatric symptoms, but found no evidence for this at end of intervention or at 36-week follow-up, using the Brief Symptom Inventory; however, the authors caution against placing too much weight on this finding, because of low power within the study to detect such differences. <LINK REF="STD-Alessi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Alessi 2014</LINK> reported one participant being hospitalised for alcohol-related heart, liver and lung problems, considered by the trialists not to be associated with the intervention programme.

<P>Details of the results at longest follow-up (up to 24 weeks post-partum) for eight of the nine included studies in pregnant women in this review are tabulated in the Analyses section (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), and are displayed graphically where data were available in <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The trials demonstrated a benefit for the incentives groups over the controls, with an adjusted OR of 3.60 (95% CI 2.39 to 5.43; 8 trials, 1295 women; I² = 0%). Abstinence confirmed at or near the end of pregnancy yielded an OR of 3.79 (95% CI 2.74 to 5.25; 8 trials, 1297 women; I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>), with six of the eight trials indicating a clear benefit for the incentivised arms.</P>
<P>At longest follow-up, three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuten-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tuten 2012</LINK>) demonstrated a clear benefit for contingent rewards over usual antenatal care. <LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2000a</LINK> linked each participant to a 'significant other supporter', preferably a female non-smoker designated by the participant herself, who received reward vouchers in parallel with the participant's own success rate. The incentives group achieved a quit rate of 21.4% at two months post-partum, compared with the control quit rate of 5.9% (P = 0.0024). <LINK REF="STD-Tuten-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tuten 2012</LINK> conducted a scaled programme of rewards for the percentage of smoking reduction achieved over the course of the 12-week intervention. We have used abstinence rates rather than smoking reduction rates for our analyses. This trial also included a non-contingent reward arm, wherein the woman presenting for assessment received vouchers according to a predetermined schedule based on an earlier pilot study, and not according to her smoking status at that visit. This group did no better than the women in the control arm (no quitters in either group), while the contingent rewards group achieved a quit rate of 31% (P = 0.0204). Although the remaining five trials all reported an advantage for the incentives group over the controls, the findings in each case were compatible with no overall benefit.</P>
<P>The largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK>; CPIT study) with 612 women, demonstrated a high success rate for the incentivised group compared to the controls. The intervention delivered Love2shop vouchers (widely exchangeable, but not for tobacco or alcohol) to successful quitters at four weeks (GBP 50), and at 12 weeks for those already quit at four (GBP 100). All participants were invited to report their smoking status at 34 to 38 weeks gestation, and those in the intervention group proving to have quit at that stage received a GBP 200 voucher. This trial also rewarded participants for engagement in the process, i.e. giving women in the intervention group a GBP 50 voucher for attending the initial smoking cessation visit and setting a quit date, and rewarding all participants who provided information and a biological sample (if appropriate) at the primary endpoint (34 to 38 weeks) with a GBP 25 shopping voucher. The authors report that the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (based on the offer of an incentive programme rather than participation in one) is 7.2.</P>
<P>One trial could not be included in the meta-analysis: the MISS Project (<LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2002</LINK>) reported interim results only, i.e. for 298 women from a projected total of 600. We were unable to obtain further information on final numbers, or on quit rates achieved at any point.</P>
<P>We have not conducted a sensitivity analysis of the certainty of attainment of the rewards (see above for mixed-population studies), as all of the included studies used guaranteed rewards for abstinence rather than lotteries or prize draws.</P>
<P>The pregnancy trials tested particular issues about how the incentives might work for pregnant smokers:<BR/>
<BR/>1. <I>Did the size of the reward make a difference?</I>
<BR/>The MISS Project (<LINK REF="STD-Donatelle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Donatelle 2002</LINK>) was designed to address this question, setting up identical reward schedules for the two experimental groups, but with one group receiving USD 25 per month for validated abstinence and the other USD 75 per month. This is an interim study report, and we have been unable so far to obtain any data on the findings of this trial.<BR/>
</P>
<P>2. <I>Did contingent rewards (usually increasing with prolonged abstinence) work differently from a schedule of non-contingent fixed payments?</I>
<BR/>Four trials addressed this question (<LINK REF="STD-Heil-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Heil 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuten-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tuten 2012</LINK>); all four favoured conditional payments, with an OR of 6.26 (95% CI 2.35 to 16.68; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>; 278 participants; I² = 19%); a key condition of this finding is that the scaled payments were given only as a reward for validated abstinence, while the fixed payments were guaranteed provided that the participant attended and gave a biological sample, irrespective of her smoking status. None of the included trials compared an incremental with a fixed schedule, but with both payable only for validated abstinence, i.e. testing the role of variable rewards rather than contingency.</P>
<P>3. <I>Did 'front-loading' of the reward schedule, to counteract the greater likelihood to relapse in the early stages of quitting, work better than the standard incremental schedule?</I>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2014</LINK> addressed this question, by allocating to the Revised Voucher Group an additional loading of USD 296.25 early in the trial; the participant had to achieve a breath sample of carbon monoxide under 4 parts per million daily in the first week (i.e. USD 18.75 on day 1 rising to USD 33.75 by day 5), plus testing cotinine-negative on the second Monday, and thereafter twice a week up to week six. The second test each week increased by USD 15.50 if it was negative following a negative first sample that week. The odds in favour of the revised (front-loaded) schedule versus the standard schedule were 1.17 (95% CI 0.35 to 3.84; 79 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>), indicating that the revised schedule made little difference to the chances of quitting.</P>
<P>4. <I>Did participant-initiated verification of abstinence work better than a researcher-controlled process?</I>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ondersma-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ondersma 2012</LINK> differed significantly from the other included trials in pregnancy, by requiring minimal personnel or financial resources; the 5As-based cessation intervention was computer-delivered, and the contingency management component was initiated by the participant and moderated through a website. Participants could request a confirmatory urine test at their normal prenatal visit, rather than making multiple ad hoc visits for monitoring and testing, and could take as many computerised tests as they wished, although they were only eligible for five reward vouchers over the course of the programme. Collapsing the two CM arms and comparing them with the two cessation arms combined gave an OR of 1.70 (95% CI 0.60 to 4.82; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>), indicating no clear benefit to either group.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Heil-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Heil 2008</LINK>, while confirming that they had not conducted a cost-benefit analysis, reported that the average cost of the incentives per participant was USD 334. The remaining included studies in pregnancy did not report on cost effectiveness. However, in their review of financial incentive programmes in pregnant women (covering five of the eight pregnancy trials included in our review), <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2012</LINK> cited a report from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) which had evaluated the interventions covered by a previous version of the <LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 2013</LINK> Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2009</LINK>), and had concluded that financial incentive interventions produced the highest net cost benefit, at GBP 2261 (USD 3482) after accounting for the cost of the intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK> reports that the short-term incremental cost per quitter was GBP 1127, and the longer-term cost for each quality-adjusted life year gained was GBP 482. The latter is well below the NHS lower threshold of GBP 20,000, designated by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>) as an indicator of cost effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Tappin-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tappin 2015b</LINK>).</P>

<P>It is notable that the two studies delivering the most robust and unequivocal evidence for the benefits of incentives for smoking cessation are the largest of the included studies, with 2538 and 878 participants respectively, delivering the most substantial rewards, and are conducted and reported to high methodological standards. However, since both trials enrolled employees of large American companies, who were predominantly white and enjoyed relatively high levels of education and income, their success may not be readily generalisable to other populations of smokers, with different regional, socio-economic and ethnic mixes.</P>
<P>Three mixed-population included studies in this review offer evidence that incentives can improve long-term smoking cessation, whether conducted in the community, in healthcare settings or in the workplace. <LINK REF="STD-Halpern-_x0028_A_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern (A) 2015</LINK>, the largest of the included studies, offers strong evidence that substantial financial rewards (USD 800 for sustained abstinence at six months) deliver significantly higher quit rates than usual care. This was demonstrated both for study-funded rewards and for incentives funded partly by the participants themselves, although the deposit-based groups' quit rate no longer reached statistical significance at 12 months (longest follow-up).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Volpp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Volpp 2009</LINK> speculates that their study population was large enough to detect an effect, and that their rewards were substantial enough (a total of USD 750 available for completion of a smoking cessation programme and sustained abstinence at 9 or 12 months) to consolidate the target behaviour change. Six months after the final payment, the incentivised group maintained a higher quit rate than the control group. While the findings of this trial and of <LINK REF="STD-Halpern-_x0028_A_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern (A) 2015</LINK> are encouraging, such a paradigm may only work in communities or situations where independent and well-resourced smoking cessation services already operate. It is also noteworthy that, despite the results of this large and influential study, the company in which it was conducted have declined to implement the findings. Negative feedback from focus groups within the workforce, combined with a reluctance by the finance department to take on the costs of running such a programme, meant that in 2010 the USD 750 incentive model was replaced by an annual USD 620 surcharge imposed on continuing smokers. This penalty could be waived for one year, provided that the smoker completed a free-of-charge cessation course. Biochemical verification was also abandoned, being perceived as intrusive and too complicated to administer. The authors point out that the switch from 'carrot' to 'stick' was not an evidence-based policy shift, and highlights the disjunction between data-driven decisions and those based on culture and belief (<LINK REF="REF-Volpp-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpp 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-White-2013" TYPE="STUDY">White 2013</LINK> used community-based health workers to support smokers attempting to quit in a region of Thai villages, using a deposit-refund intervention. The six-month success rates were impressive, at 44.3% for the intervention group compared with 18.8% among the controls; however, the unusually high quit rate for the control group suggests that this trial-naïve population may have represented 'low-hanging fruit' (easy quitters), and that these findings are not readily generalisable to areas with longstanding and established tobacco control programmes.</P>
<P>The deposit-refund trials merit particular attention, in the light of the real-world constraints that have emerged from the <LINK REF="STD-Volpp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Volpp 2009</LINK> study. If implementation of an incentives programme is compromised by the costs incurred, then the model of participants depositing and forfeiting their own money is likely to be more attractive to employers and institutions seeking affordable behaviour change interventions. However, low uptake rates compared with reward-based interventions may limit the appeal and efficacy of such programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Volpp-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpp 2014</LINK>); <LINK REF="STD-White-2013" TYPE="STUDY">White 2013</LINK> reports a participation rate of 10.5% among eligible smokers, while <LINK REF="STD-Gin_x00e9_-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Giné 2010</LINK> reports a rate of 10.6%. The three Paxton trials are of limited relevance here, as they were conducted under the auspices of the UK National Health Service, on condition that participants motivated to quit but unable or unwilling to pay the required deposit must still be allowed to participate in the cessation programme. Uptake in this case was therefore not a marker of acceptability.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Halpern-_x0028_A_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern (A) 2015</LINK> is the only trial in this review to have directly compared interventions funded entirely from trial resources to those funded partly by the participants themselves (USD 150). As discussed above, uptake rates proved to be a barrier, with 90% of those offered rewards accepting the intervention compared to only 13.7% of those required to put up a deposit, obliging the trialists to develop an adaptive model of randomisation in order to populate the deposit-based arms. On an intention-to-treat basis, the rewards arms consistently delivered significantly more quitters than the deposit arms at all time points; however, in instrumental variable analysis which accounts for different rates of uptake (equivalent to a per protocol analysis), among participants prepared to accept either intervention the deposit arms outperformed the rewards arms, with six-month quit rates of 53.4% and 17.1% respectively, and 12-month quit rates of 18.5% and 8.8% respectively. This would suggest that although it may be more difficult to recruit smokers into deposit-based programmes, once they are in they are strongly committed to the process and can achieve high quit rates.</P>
<P>Many of the early studies were underpowered and of variable quality. A sensitivity analysis removing those studies conducted before 2000 made little difference to the findings at longest follow-up (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.07), but shifted the 12-month result to one of marginal statistical significance (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.99). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Rand-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rand 1989</LINK>) confounded the final delivery of cessation rewards with the final follow-up assessment. Similarly, although <LINK REF="STD-De-Paul-1994" TYPE="STUDY">De Paul 1994</LINK> reported significantly higher cessation rates for the incentives group at the six-month assessment, this evaluation coincided with the final phase of the rewards programmes. At later follow-up points in this study all such differences had disappeared. Encouraging early quit rates at 30 days (<LINK REF="STD-Volpp-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Volpp 2006</LINK>) and at 21 days (<LINK REF="STD-Tevyaw-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tevyaw 2009</LINK>) dwindled to non-significant differences by the six-month follow-ups. Although <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 2007</LINK> achieved significantly different CO-validated quit rates, the cotinine-validated quit rates did not achieve clinically significant differences, suggesting that while some participants could achieve temporary abstinence for their clinic visit, the more rigorous urinary cotinine test did not indicate abstinence sustained beyond a few hours.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1993</LINK> reported one-year cessation rates for HIP participants more than double those of non-registrants (22.1% versus 9.4%, P &lt; 0.005), but this difference had become non-significant at the two-year follow up; and again, the one-year evaluation was very close to the final lottery draw for HIP participants and may well have been influenced by that proximity. <LINK REF="STD-Shoptaw-_x0028_A_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shoptaw (A) 2002</LINK> reported the same long-term pattern of relapse, with significant benefit to the contingency management groups in the first three months rapidly vanishing over the nine-month post-programme follow-up period. One recent study (<LINK REF="STD-White-2013" TYPE="STUDY">White 2013</LINK>) reported impressive cessation rates for their deposit-refund programme at six months, which appeared to be sustained to a 14-month follow-up, but the latter finding must be considered as unreliable, since it was based on self report, without biochemical or witness validation. <LINK REF="STD-Halpern-_x0028_A_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern (A) 2015</LINK> noted a halving of the validated quit rates between six and 12 months, although self-reported 12-month rates remained comparable with the six-month levels. The overall picture that emerges from these trials is that incentives work while they are in place, but that the typical relapse pattern is likely to re-establish itself once they are removed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pregnancy studies</HEADING>
<P>The eight trials in 1295 women contributing to the meta-analyses confirmed the efficacy of incentives at longest follow-up, and at or around the end of pregnancy.</P>
<P>Our results are slightly at variance with those reported in the Pregnancy and Childbirth review (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 2013</LINK>), as their primary outcome was abstinence around the end of pregnancy, while ours is at longest follow-up, i.e. post-partum where available. We also dropped prespecified withdrawals (termination, foetal demise) from the denominator, and we include four trials which do not appear in the <LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 2013</LINK> meta-analysis. Their main result (abstinence around the end of pregnancy) covers 426 women, giving a risk ratio of 3.09 (95% CI 1.34 to 7.15); this converts (for direct comparison) to an odds ratio (OR) of 4.13 (95% CI 1.50 to 11.40), using a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 2013</LINK> comparison 11, Analysis 1.4). Our own analysis of the same (secondary) outcome delivers an OR (fixed-effect) of 3.79 (95% CI 2.74 to 5.25) in 1295 women (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Conducted as a random-effects model, this OR becomes 3.61 (95% CI 2.60 to 5.02), i.e. still a clear finding in favour of incentives, but with three times the number of participants and a narrower confidence interval.</P>
<P>
<B>Incentives</B>
<BR/>The use of tangible rewards will always be a trade-off between maximising participation and attracting smokers who are motivated more by the rewards than by the wish to stop smoking. The type and scale of the incentive has therefore been considered a critical element in the design of a cessation programme, although from the perspective of this review, which is primarily concerned with sustained or permanent cessation, the type and scale of the incentives may be less significant than the negative effects of removing them altogether. The incentives varied considerably across the studies, including cash prizes, vouchers for goods and services, prize draws, and combinations of cash and lottery tickets. Both <LINK REF="STD-Volpp-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Volpp 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Halpern-_x0028_A_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern (A) 2015</LINK>, which between them represent more than 40% of the study population for this review, provided substantial cash payments both for compliance and for prolonged abstinence, and demonstrated a sustained beneficial effect beyond the expiry of the payment schedule. <LINK REF="STD-White-2013" TYPE="STUDY">White 2013</LINK>, which returned the participants' own money to them provided that they were quit within three months, also demonstrated lasting benefits, but suffered from relatively low levels of uptake. All participants in this trial stood to benefit from substantial bonus payments if they could collaborate with their team partner to achieve joint cessation, but the control teams failed in this compared to the intervention teams, suggesting that social support was not of itself sufficient to boost cessation rates.</P>
<P>
<B>Deception</B>
<BR/>Seven studies tested for smoking status at baseline, with cotinine or exhaled carbon monoxide (CO). Five were clinic-based, with three (<LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shoptaw-_x0028_A_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shoptaw (A) 2002</LINK>) treating disease-specific populations of smokers; in all five studies, biochemically-verified proof of smoking was a requirement for enrolment into the trial. One worksite-based study (<LINK REF="STD-Windsor-_x0028_A_x0029_-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Windsor (A) 1988</LINK>) also screened all participants for salivary thiocyanate as a condition of entry. <LINK REF="STD-Halpern-_x0028_A_x0029_-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern (A) 2015</LINK> was the only study to monitor eligibility by testing after entry, in a 5% sample of enrolled participants who were paid USD 100 for supplying a cotinine assay. Of those asked to submit a baseline sample, nine (6%) returned a negative assay and 21 (14%) did not return a sample, suggesting that up to 20% of participants could have been non-smokers. The rates were comparable across all arms of the trial, and sensitivity analyses adjusting for this possible level of deception made no difference to effect estimates.</P>
<P>All the included studies in this review used some form of biochemical verification to confirm the smoking status of those claiming abstinence. While this procedure is now the recommended gold standard for good trial design (<LINK REF="REF-Benowitz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benowitz 2002</LINK>), it is particularly important that quitters in an incentives-based trial are shown to be truly abstinent at the evaluation points. Eligibility for cessation rewards depended in all the included studies upon biochemical confirmation of the claim of abstinence. <LINK REF="STD-Volpp-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Volpp 2006</LINK> addressed the likelihood of participants modifying their smoking behaviour in anticipation of being contacted for follow-up assessment and cotinine testing, and concluded that this was unlikely, since although participants knew that they would be biologically tested, they were unaware of how long nicotine metabolites would be detectable or the exact date on which they would be checked.</P>
<P>Two of the studies in this review reported a good correspondence between claims of abstinence and their biochemical verification, with <LINK REF="STD-Windsor-_x0028_A_x0029_-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Windsor (A) 1988</LINK> noting 100% agreement for more than 600 saliva thiocyanate samples, and <LINK REF="STD-De-Paul-1994" TYPE="STUDY">De Paul 1994</LINK> a 95% agreement. The Paxton studies took random urine samples to deter false reporting, and also occasionally cross-checked smoking status with family members or friends. They reported that levels of deception were 'very low', and attributed this to having warned participants in advance about the random biochemical checks.</P>
<P>Three studies which targeted high-risk smoking groups went to some trouble to control for possible levels of deception. <LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1995</LINK>, dealing with moderately-ill COPD patients who had been co-opted into the programme, anticipated a measure of deception, and calculated an expected ratio of CO divided by cigarettes smoked. This confirmed a greater disparity between cigarettes smoked and numbers reported among the non-verified self-report group and the control group than among the intervention group, who were rewarded only for verified abstinence. <LINK REF="STD-Shoptaw-_x0028_A_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shoptaw (A) 2002</LINK>, dealing with methadone-maintained drug abusers with high levels of smoking, reported similar findings between self-reported abstinence and its biochemical verification, but cautioned that it was possible that participants had found ways of subverting the breath-testing schedule. Against this possibility, however, was the fact that subjects had averaged only 44% of the available prize vouchers for abstinence, suggesting that any subversion had not been particularly successful. <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 2007</LINK>, dealing with smokers with schizophrenia or other serious mental disorders, found considerable disparities between quit claims validated by CO breath samples (confirming abstinence for a few hours) and those validated by urinary cotinine (a few days of abstinence). This need not indicate deception, but suggests that the achieved abstinence for which the rewards were being claimed was not robust or sustained (<LINK REF="REF-SRNT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SRNT 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two studies which found a striking disparity between self-reported abstinence and biochemical verification of the claims were both large, worksite-based, cluster-randomised trials, which followed their participants for 24 months. <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2002</LINK> reported a 33.6% mismatch between self report and confirmation at 24 months, and <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1993</LINK> a 27% mismatch at the12-month evaluation. Both trials had 'sprung' the biochemical validation requirement on the quitters at follow-up. The clear discrepancies suggest that people responding indirectly (not face-to-face) to a question about their smoking, and not expecting to have their answer checked, may be significantly more likely to say what they think the questioner wants to hear.</P>
<P>Recent work on incentives for pregnant smokers trying to quit has directed attention to the risks of deception or 'gaming', particularly the likelihood of delaying a quit attempt to coincide with a rewards programme, and the likelihood of misrepresenting smoking status, either to gain admission to an incentive programme or to receive unmerited rewards for abstinence (<LINK REF="STD-Marteau-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Ierfino-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ierfino 2015</LINK>, in a cohort of 239 pregnant smokers, found no evidence of gaming to enter the programme, but detected a 4% level of deception to win vouchers for abstinence.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK> used residual routine blood samples (i.e. taken for non-study-related purposes) collected from the final 200 women enrolling in their study, to cross-check the smoking status of self-reporting quitters and of women with whom contact had been lost. Of 46 women in the incentive group who could not be reached for the 34/38-week assessment, residual blood tests for 10 of them confirmed in all cases that the women were currently smoking; similarly, blood tests for three 'lost' control participants confirmed current smoking. Although 30 women in the incentive group who could not be contacted at the primary endpoint reported that they were abstinent, residual samples for two of them indicated that both were smoking. Residual bloods were also available for 18 of the 69 intervention women who self-reported abstinence at 34/38 weeks, and had this confirmed by saliva or urinary cotinine; 78% of these samples (14/18) confirmed their non-smoking status. Similarly, five residual samples for the 26 control participants with confirmed abstinence at 34/38 weeks corroborated 80% (4/5) of the results. While this suggests some overestimation of the true quit rates, the level of deception appeared to be similar across both groups, and confirmed the veracity of 80% of the self-reported quitters.</P>

<P>We have followed standard Cochrane methods to identify and evaluate the studies contributing to this review, and are confident that we have not missed any significant trials.

<P>
<I>Mixed-population studies</I>: We rated the overall quality of the evidence in this group of trials as low (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), suggesting that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change the estimate. This is largely attributable to the methods and assumptions of the older studies, and their data presentation, compared with prevailing standards in trial methodology. Eight of the trials delivered imprecise results, as percentages or graphs without a clear statement of denominators or event counts. Eleven of the 21 studies were deemed to have conducted adequate random sequence generation, with seven of them also applying adequate concealment of allocation; all but one of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Windsor-_x0028_A_x0029_-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Windsor (A) 1988</LINK>) were conducted in 2002 or later.</P>
<P>
<I>Pregnancy studies</I>: The included trials covering pregnant smokers are rated as being of moderate quality (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), suggesting that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change the estimate. All the trials were conducted within the last 15 years, and have benefited from advances in trial methodology and reporting expectations. However, only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ondersma-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ondersma 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK>) were deemed to have reported adequate randomisation procedures, while another (<LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2004</LINK>) was rated at high risk of bias for failing to implement a consistent method of sequence generation. <LINK REF="STD-Ondersma-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ondersma 2012</LINK> is a notable inclusion within this group, as the trialists sought to implement a pragmatic and highly automated approach to delivering an incentive-based intervention, not requiring multiple ad hoc visits or tests, and placing the onus upon the participant to verify and report abstinence and to initiate claims for rewards. The <LINK REF="STD-Tappin-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tappin 2015</LINK> trial may also be viewed as a benchmark study, for the scale of recruitment (612 women) and the robustness of its findings. Furthermore, the trialists' use of residual blood samples to complement the ad hoc cotinine samples lends some support to the Russell Standard recommendation (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>) to assume that participants lost to follow-up should be counted as continuing smokers.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-14 12:41:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A number of systematic reviews addressing incentives for smoking cessation have been published in recent years. Two reviews address smoking among other public health interventions based on incentives: <LINK REF="REF-Diepeveen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diepeveen 2013</LINK> considered the public acceptability of smoking cessation interventions (in 110 studies out of 200 covering various interventions), and reported strong support for bans and restrictions on workplace smoking, in indoor public places, restaurants and shopping centres, and for focusing on children and young people. <LINK REF="REF-Giles-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2014</LINK> evaluated 16 studies of incentivised health behaviour change, 10 of which focused on smoking cessation, five on vaccination programmes and one on physical activity. Using most of the same studies as in our review, they demonstrated a clear benefit for smoking cessation up to six months follow-up (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.77 to 3.46), but a less clearcut advantage at later follow-up (more than six months) (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.14) with high heterogeneity (I² = 76%). Two further reviews were confined to smoking cessation only: <LINK REF="REF-Leeks-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leeks 2010</LINK> demonstrated a 4.4% benefit at a median of 12 months follow-up for worksite-based cessation programmes which included incentives or competitions, but could not isolate the relative efficacy of the incentive component from other aspects of the programmes. <LINK REF="REF-Sigmon-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sigmon 2012b</LINK> explored incentive programmes within particular high-risk population subgroups, including substance abusers, adolescents and young adults, and people diagnosed with pulmonary disease, and also flagged up the use of shaping procedures for hard-to-treat smokers, the promise of developing technologies for delivery of the intervention, and varying the scale of the incentive.<BR/>
<LINK REF="REF-Kane-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2004</LINK> may now be of limited interest, as it includes only trials conducted up to 2002 and has largely been superseded. It covered smoking (11 out of 47 included studies) as well as screening, immunisation, and STD/HIV prevention programmes, and interventions for exercise, weight loss, cardiovascular health and breastfeeding.<BR/>
<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2012</LINK> summarised a series of six trials of incentives in pregnant smokers, conducted by two US-based research groups and particularly addressing birth outcomes. Their review is compatible with our own findings, and states that such interventions "hold promise" as a mechanism for increasing cessation rates in this population of smokers.<BR/>

<P>For this 2015 update, we have separated out the competitions trials from the incentives trials, and now present the findings as two separate updates. This one is for incentives and contingency management interventions only. We took this decision because competition-based programmes are now a rarely-used intervention, while incentives and contingency management programmes are increasingly being developed and deployed, so that the research agenda continues to grow and change in this area.<BR/>For this 2015 update, we have pooled the meta-analysis findings, rather than displaying them as descriptive forest plots only.<BR/>For this 2015 update, we now include interventions in pregnant women, whom we had excluded in earlier versions of the review.<BR/>For this 2015 update, we have dropped the secondary outcome of recruitment, as this is now fully covered in a recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Belisario-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belisario 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>1. <I>Usual contingent voucher (39 women)</I>: First 5-day week validated by CO, thereafter by urine cotinine. Vouchers based exclusively on valid biotesting, not self report. Vouchers began at USD 6.25 and rose by USD 1.25 per time to a max of USD 45. Missed or positive results meant schedule was reset, but 2 passes reset the schedule to former point.</P>
<P>
<I>2. Revised contingent voucher (40 women)</I>: Same pattern as above, but with potentially USD 296.25 available early in weeks 1 - 6 by maintaining a &#8804; 4 ppm breath CO in week 1 (i.e. USD 18.75 day 1 to USD 33.75 day 5 (going up by USD 3.75 per day)), testing cotinine-negative on 2nd Monday for an additional USD 87.50 and thereafter testing negative twice per week to week 6. The 2nd test each week increased by USD 15.50 if it was negative and the first had also been negative. This was meant to reinforce early continuous abstinence.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<I>Non-contingent voucher [Control Group] (39 women)</I>

<SUP>3</SUP>Three early trials may have confounded their findings by assessing smoking status at the same time as they delivered six-month rewards for abstinence. In one case (<LINK REF="STD-Rand-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rand 1989</LINK>) this was also the end of the trial.</P>

However, I disagree with their numbers for Ondesma 2012. They have given Intervention as 4/29 and Control as 4/26. If they are consistently using ITT (which we haven't for these trials), I think the intervention ratio should be 4/30, based on cotinine-verified abstinence in the combined treatment group; see Table 3, line 1. I can also see a case for combining the two incentives groups E2 and E3 (i.e. incentives with and without 5As support), to give our intervention numbers as 7/48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denominators:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the P&amp;amp;C review considered it &amp;quot;reasonable' to remove women who withdrew for miscarriage, foetal demise, developed serious medical conditions, moved out of the area, or changed to another provider of care&amp;quot;, they seem to have used ITT even when they had enough info to exclude such withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2015-01-28 13:48:02 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" ROWS_PER_STUDY="2" SORT_BY="STUDY" STUDIES="9" SUBGROUPS="NO">

<TD>
<P>Cessation</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Also called 'quitting'<BR/>The goal of treatment to help people achieve abstinence from smoking or other tobacco use, also used to describe the process of changing the behaviour<BR/>
</P>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>Lapse/slip</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Terms sometimes used for a return to tobacco use after a period of abstinence. A lapse or slip might be defined as a puff or two on a cigarette. This may proceed to relapse, or abstinence may be regained. Some definitions of continuous, sustained or prolonged abstinence require complete abstinence, but some allow for a limited number or duration of slips. People who lapse are very likely to relapse, but some treatments may have their effect by helping people recover from a lapse.</P>
