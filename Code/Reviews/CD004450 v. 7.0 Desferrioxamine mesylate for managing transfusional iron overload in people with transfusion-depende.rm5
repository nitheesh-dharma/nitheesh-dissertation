<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-01 15:13:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Haemoglobin carries oxygen in the blood. In thalassaemia, a genetic disease, sometimes the body cannot produce enough haemoglobin. This can be managed by receiving regular blood transfusions, but may lead to excess iron in the body which must be removed to prevent organ damage.</P>
<P>Iron is removed by iron chelation therapy using a substance called an iron chelator. This works by sticking to excess iron molecules in the body. When patients go to the toilet, this excess iron leaves the body.</P>
<P>Three iron chelators are commonly used. One (desferrioxamine) is injected and two (deferiprone and deferasirox) are taken orally. Deferasirox is licensed for use in children. Desferrioxamine is inconvenient and expensive; motivating researchers to find safe, effective oral iron chelators.</P>
<P>We found 22 randomised controlled trials comparing iron chelators. These do not provide enough information about death or organ damage. However, they showed all three chelators performed similarly well in removing excess iron. Several trials found combining desferrioxamine and deferiprone removed more excess iron than using just one iron chelator.</P>
<P>Trials showing side effects must be considered carefully. Side effects with desferrioxamine included pain or skin reactions at the injection site and joint pain. Side effects with deferiprone included joint pain, nausea, stomach upsets and low white blood cell count. Side effects with deferasirox included skin rashes, increases in liver enzymes and reduced kidney function. Low white blood cell count and reduced kidney function are important side effects and in patients receiving deferiprone or deferasirox these should be monitored regularly. Patients were three times more likely to experience a side effect when deferiprone and desferrioxamine were combined, compared with desferrioxamine alone. Three studies showed that patients using deferiprone were two and a half times more likely to have joint pain compared with using desferrioxamine alone.</P>
<P>We have found no evidence for changing current treatment recommendations, which state that deferiprone or deferasirox should be used to remove excess iron when desferrioxamine cannot be used or is inadequate. The Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America have approved deferiprone only as "last resort treatment of iron overload in thalassemia".</P>
<P>Larger randomised control trials of iron chelation therapy are needed, using standardised agreed measures of iron levels and organ damage to allow comparison of such valuable treatments.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-22 10:12:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thalassaemia major is a genetic disease characterised by a reduced ability to produce haemoglobin. Management of the resulting anaemia is through red blood cell transfusions.</P>
<P>Repeated transfusions result in an excessive accumulation of iron in the body (iron overload), removal of which is achieved through iron chelation therapy. Desferrioxamine mesylate (desferrioxamine) is one of the most widely used iron chelators. Substantial data have shown the beneficial effects of desferrioxamine, although adherence to desferrioxamine therapy is a challenge. Alternative oral iron chelators, deferiprone and deferasirox, are now commonly used. Important questions exist about whether desferrioxamine, as monotherapy or in combination with an oral iron chelator, is the best treatment for iron chelation therapy.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-08-22 10:13:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effectiveness (dose and method of administration) of desferrioxamine in people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia.</P>
<P>To summarise data from trials on the clinical efficacy and safety of desferrioxamine for thalassaemia and to compare these with deferiprone and deferasirox.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-31 11:41:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library), </I>LILACS and other international medical databases, plus ongoing trials registers and the Transfusion Evidence Library (www.transfusionevidencelibrary.com). All searches were updated to 5 March 2013.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing desferrioxamine with placebo, with another iron chelator, or comparing two schedules or doses of desferrioxamine, in people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-31 10:25:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six authors working independently were involved in trial quality assessment and data extraction. For one trial, investigators supplied additional data upon request.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-01 14:46:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 22 trials involving 2187 participants (range 11 to 586 people) were included. These trials included eight comparisons between desferrioxamine alone and deferiprone alone; five comparisons between desferrioxamine combined with deferiprone and deferiprone alone; eight comparisons between desferrioxamine alone and desferrioxamine combined with deferiprone; two comparisons of desferrioxamine with deferasirox; and two comparisons of different routes of desferrioxamine administration (bolus versus continuous infusion). Overall, few trials measured the same or long-term outcomes. Seven trials reported cardiac function or liver fibrosis as measures of end organ damage; none of these included a comparison with deferasirox.</P>
<P>Five trials reported a total of seven deaths; three in patients who received desferrioxamine alone, two in patients who received desferrioxamine and deferiprone. A further death occurred in a patient who received deferiprone in another who received deferasirox alone. One trial reported five further deaths in patients who withdrew from randomised treatment (deferiprone with or without desferrioxamine) and switched to desferrioxamine alone.</P>
<P>One trial planned five years of follow up but was stopped early due to the beneficial effects of a reduction in serum ferritin levels in those receiving combined desferrioxamine and deferiprone treatment compared with deferiprone alone. The results of this and three other trials suggest an advantage of combined therapy with desferrioxamine and deferiprone over monotherapy to reduce iron stores as measured by serum ferritin. There is, however, no evidence for the improved efficacy of combined desferrioxamine and deferiprone therapy against monotherapy from direct or indirect measures of liver iron.</P>
<P>Earlier trials measuring the cardiac iron load indirectly by measurement of the magnetic resonance imaging T2* signal had suggested deferiprone may reduce cardiac iron more quickly than desferrioxamine. However, meta-analysis of two trials showed a significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction in patients who received desferrioxamine alone compared with those who received combination therapy using desferrioxamine with deferiprone.</P>
<P>Adverse events were recorded by 18 trials. These occurred with all treatments, but were significantly less likely with desferrioxamine than deferiprone in one trial, relative risk 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.84) and significantly less likely with desferrioxamine alone than desferrioxamine combined with deferiprone in two other trials, relative risk 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.84). In particular, four studies reported permanent treatment withdrawal due to adverse events from deferiprone; only one of these reported permanent withdrawals associated with desferrioxamine. Adverse events also occurred at a higher frequency in patients who received deferasirox than desferrioxamine in one trial. Eight trials reported local adverse reactions at the site of desferrioxamine infusion including pain and swelling. Adverse events associated with deferiprone included joint pain, gastrointestinal disturbance, increases in liver enzymes and neutropenia; adverse events associated with deferasirox comprised increases in liver enzymes and renal impairment. Regular monitoring of white cell counts has been recommended for deferiprone and monitoring of liver and renal function for deferasirox.</P>
<P>In summary, desferrioxamine and the oral iron chelators deferiprone and deferasirox produce significant reductions in iron stores in transfusion-dependent, iron-overloaded people. There is no evidence from randomised clinical trials to suggest that any one of these has a greater reduction of clinically significant end organ damage, although in two trials, combination therapy with desferrioxamine and deferiprone showed a greater improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction than desferrioxamine used alone.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-31 10:37:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Desferrioxamine is the recommended first-line therapy for iron overload in people with thalassaemia major and deferiprone or deferasirox are indicated for treating iron overload when desferrioxamine is contraindicated or inadequate. Oral deferasirox has been licensed for use in children aged over six years who receive frequent blood transfusions and in children aged two to five years who receive infrequent blood transfusions. In the absence of randomised controlled trials with long-term follow up, there is no compelling evidence to change this conclusion.</P>
<P>Worsening iron deposition in the myocardium in patients receiving desferrioxamine alone would suggest a change of therapy by intensification of desferrioxamine treatment or the use of desferrioxamine and deferiprone combination therapy.</P>
<P>Adverse events are increased in patients treated with deferiprone compared with desferrioxamine and in patients treated with combined deferiprone and desferrioxamine compared with desferrioxamine alone. People treated with all chelators must be kept under close medical supervision and treatment with deferiprone or deferasirox requires regular monitoring of neutrophil counts or renal function respectively. There is an urgent need for adequately-powered, high-quality trials comparing the overall clinical efficacy and long-term outcomes of deferiprone, deferasirox and desferrioxamine.<B> </B>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-08-22 10:14:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thalassaemia major is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world caused by an abnormality in a single gene (monogenic) (<LINK REF="REF-Weatherall-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weatherall 2001a</LINK>). It is becoming a more significant public health problem as demographics have reduced childhood mortality from infectious diseases and malnutrition. At present, it is estimated that there are over two million transfusion-dependent people with thalassaemia major throughout the world, with the majority of cases in South-East Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Weatherall-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weatherall 2001a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The common underlying pathology of the thalassaemia is an imbalance in the rate of synthesis of the alpha- and beta-globin chains of haemoglobin in red blood cells. The clinical spectrum of thalassaemia ranges from death <I>in utero</I>, through severe transfusion-dependent anaemia to asymptomatic anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Weatherall-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weatherall 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weatherall-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weatherall 2001b</LINK>). Anaemia is a reduction in the quantity of the oxygen-carrying component (haemoglobin) of the blood.</P>
<P>The thalassaemias are diagnosed by their clinical manifestations, by morphological changes in red blood cells, by characterising haemoglobin alpha- and beta-globin chains using electrophoresis or chromatography and by molecular detection of specific genetic mutations. Children with thalassaemia major or thalassaemia intermedia usually become symptomatic between six and 12 months of age with symptoms of anaemia and enlargement of the liver and spleen due to extramedullary hematopoiesis (<LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In children affected by severe thalassaemia major, blood transfusions are the mainstay of management to achieve a haemoglobin concentration high enough to suppress red cell production. Without blood transfusions, people with thalassaemia major may develop massive bone marrow or extra-medullary haematopoiesis, or both, resulting in severe pathology including deformities of the facial bones, spinal cord compression and pathological fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weatherall-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weatherall 2001a</LINK>). The second major component of management is iron chelation therapy.</P>

Regular iron cell transfusions may increase this iron load by up to 10 g per year. Without iron chelation, iron-mediated free radical damage may cause liver fibrosis, myocardial damage, skin pigmentation and endocrine failure including diabetes mellitus, growth failure and delayed onset of puberty (<LINK REF="REF-Kushner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushner 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Iron overload may be prevented or treated with a chelating agent that complexes iron and allows excretion of chelator-iron complexes from the body. The most widely used chelating agent is desferrioxamine mesylate (desferrioxamine, DFO) administered subcutaneously or intravenously (<LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1997b</LINK>). In earlier studies DFO was administered as an intramuscular injection up to seven times a week. Oral iron chelation agents are being developed of which deferiprone (L1) is licensed in the UK, Europe and India (<LINK REF="REF-Aydinok-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aydinok 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berdoukas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berdoukas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Del-Vecchio-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Vecchio 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hershko-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hershko 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoffbrand-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffbrand 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kushner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushner 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mazza-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazza 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pippard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pippard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tondury-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tondury 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wanless-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wanless 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wonke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wonke 1998</LINK>). The role of deferiprone in the management of people with iron overload remains to be established, and a separate Cochrane review of deferiprone use in thalassaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2013</LINK>) is being updated alongside this current update which specifically address the use of this agent in thalassaemia. Deferasirox is another oral iron chelator and can be given once daily as an oral suspension. The significant side effects of deferasirox include skin rashes and gastrointestinal disturbance and notably impairment of liver and renal function (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2012</LINK>). Deferasirox has been licensed for use in children aged over six years who receive frequent blood transfusions and in children aged two to five years of age who receive infrequent blood transfusions. Its short-term efficacy has been assessed as similar to that of DFO in another Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Meehpohl-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meehpohl 2012</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subcutaneous or intravenous iron chelator: desferrioxamine (DFO)</HEADING>
<P>The widespread clinical use of DFO is based on a series of well-documented comparative studies of morbidity and mortality of children with thalassaemia major born before the introduction of DFO (<LINK REF="STD-Aldouri-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Aldouri 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BorgnaPignatti-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">BorgnaPignatti 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brittenham-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittenham 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ehlers-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehlers 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gabutti-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabutti 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Modell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pippard-1978a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pippard 1978a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Propper-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Propper 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Propper-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Propper 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zurlo-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zurlo 1989</LINK>). Maintaining hepatic iron stores less than 15 mg/g dry weight has been associated with reduced mortality from cardiac disease in thalassaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Brittenham-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittenham 1994</LINK>). Other studies have shown that regular chelation therapy with DFO is associated with a reduction in hepatic fibrosis, reduced prevalence of endocrine problems and a decreased risk of cardiac disease (<LINK REF="REF-Brittenham-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittenham 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gabutti-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabutti 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>One problem of DFO is maintaining adherence of people with thalassaemia with the injections and the demanding schedule of overnight subcutaneous or intravenous infusions (<LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weatherall-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weatherall 2001a</LINK>). Other regimens, including continuous intravenous DFO and intermittent subcutaneous DFO, have been successful in those thalassaemia patients severely affected by iron overload (<LINK REF="REF-BorgnaPignatti-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">BorgnaPignatti 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franchini-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franchini 2000</LINK>). It has also been suggested that regimens combining DFO and vitamin C are more effective than DFO alone (<LINK REF="STD-Nienhuis-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Nienhuis 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Propper-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Propper 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wapnick-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wapnick 1969</LINK>).</P>
<P>A second problem concerns the toxicity of DFO, particularly at doses of greater than 40 mg/kg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Kushner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushner 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robins_x002d_Browne-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robins-Browne 1985</LINK>). Toxicity as a result of DFO includes retinal toxicity (optic neuropathy and retinal pigmentation and dysfunction) (<LINK REF="REF-Bacon-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacon 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Sanctis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sanctis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1993</LINK>), local skin reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Kushner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushner 2001</LINK>) and high frequency sensorineural hearing loss (<LINK REF="REF-De-Sanctis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sanctis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robins_x002d_Browne-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robins-Browne 1985</LINK>). Other systemic side effects of DFO include growth retardation (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Sanctis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sanctis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koren-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koren 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koren-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koren 1991</LINK>), increased susceptibility to Yersinia infection and, less frequently, renal impairment, pulmonary fibrosis and anaphylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koren-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koren 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koren-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koren 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robins_x002d_Browne-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robins-Browne 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tenenbein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tenenbein 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The final problem is the cost and availability of DFO. The cost of a year's course of DFO with consumables for standard therapy is approximately GBP 6000 to GBP 12,000 (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2012</LINK>) and so the availability of this treatment is limited by cost in many countries where the disease is prevalent.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Oral iron chelators: deferiprone</HEADING>
<P>Two oral iron chelators, deferiprone and deferasirox, have been developed and licensed for chronic iron overload when DFO is contraindicated or inadequate. The drug 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyroid-4-one, or deferiprone was the first oral iron chelator to be clinically evaluated and is pharmacologically efficacious in achieving iron excretion (<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kontoghiorghes-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kontoghiorghes 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tondury-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tondury 1990</LINK>). Since these early studies, a large number of centres have reported their experience with deferiprone (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Del-Vecchio-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Vecchio 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rombos-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rombos 2000</LINK>) and it has been suggested that deferiprone may be particularly effective in decreasing cardiac iron deposition.</P>
<P>As with DFO, adverse events have been reported in people with thalassaemia taking deferiprone. These include gastrointestinal disturbances (<LINK REF="REF-Ceci-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ceci 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Taher 2001</LINK>), arthropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoffbrand-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffbrand 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mazza-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazza 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Taher 2001</LINK>), raised liver enzymes (<LINK REF="REF-Ceci-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ceci 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2003</LINK>), neutropenia and agranulocytosis (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pati-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pati 1999</LINK>). Progression of liver fibrosis during treatment with deferiprone is of great concern and controversy by some (<LINK REF="REF-Berdoukas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berdoukas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tondury-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tondury 1998</LINK>), but not others (<LINK REF="REF-Wanless-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wanless 2002</LINK>); with ensuing correspondence (<LINK REF="REF-Brittenham-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brittenham 2003a</LINK>). Recent studies have not reported progressive liver fibrosis in patients taking deferiprone. However, neutropenia has remained a concern for patients taking this drug.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Oral iron chelators: deferasirox</HEADING>
<P>Deferasirox is an oral iron-chelator that binds iron in a 2:1 ratio and is excreted faecally. It can be given once a day as an oral suspension at a dose of 10 to 30 mg/kg. The significant side effects of deferasirox include skin rashes and gastrointestinal disturbance and notably impairment of liver and renal function (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2012</LINK>). </P>
<P>As an oral agent, deferasirox may improve adherence to therapy compared with DFO given by infusions. As for deferiprone, deferasirox may be useful to treat iron-overloaded patients intolerant of DFO. It is licensed in Europe for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions in patients with beta-thalassemia major aged six years and older and the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when DFO therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: patients with other anaemias; patients aged two to five years; and patients with beta-thalassemia major with iron overload due to infrequent blood transfusions (less than 7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) (<LINK REF="REF-European-Medicines-Agency-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">European Medicines Agency 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are currently no national guidelines for the use of deferasirox. However, a systematic review and economic assessment of deferasirox concluded that the data from the available short-term trials showed that there was little clinical difference between any of the three chelators in terms of removing iron from the blood and liver (<LINK REF="REF-McLeod-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 2009</LINK>). The economic analysis at that time suggested that deferasirox may be cost-effective compared with DFO in patients with haemoglobinopathies but it is unlikely to be cost-effective compared with deferiprone (<LINK REF="REF-McLeod-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 2009</LINK>). More recently, a Cochrane systematic review evaluating the use of deferasirox also concluded that the short-term efficacy of deferasirox and DFO were similar but that the long-term safety and efficacy of deferasirox remained to be established (<LINK REF="REF-Meehpohl-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meehpohl 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>The authors anticipated that the issue of blinding would be a challenge in the identified trials, given the different routes of administration of the iron chelators currently available (deferiprone: oral; desferrioxamine: predominantly subcutaneous infusion over 8 hours to 12 hours). It would have been very difficult to blind either the clinician or the participant to the trial treatments. However, blinding of the outcome assessor to the treatment allocation would have been possible for these trials and has been given particular attention.</P>

<P>The main method of analysis was quantitative but the authors made an overall interpretation from a balanced assessment of the patterns of results identified across the included trials. Due to the disparity in methods of reporting results between trials, and in order to formally assess as many trials as possible, the authors analysed outcomes using both end of trial data and mean change from baseline data where appropriate. Where the SD for the mean change from baseline was not reported and the trial did not report sufficient data to enable SD calculation (i.e. a correlation coefficient), the authors did not want to make the necessary assumptions about unknown statistical distributions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and in this case, used end of trial data to analyse reported outcomes.</P>
<P>The authors presented results for binary data as a risk ratio (RR) and for continuous data as a mean difference (MD). They analysed all participants in the treatment groups to which they had been randomised, with the exception of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>). In this trial, the authors analysed the end of trial data according to the treatment received rather than the treatment group to which the participants were randomised.</P>
<P>To facilitate comparison of results between trials, where SDs were not explicitly stated, the authors converted the standard error (SE) of the mean to the SD. Within this review, unless otherwise stated, the authors present data as mean and SD. Further, the authors have changed the units of serum ferritin concentration from µg/L or pmol/L to ng/ml and the units of liver iron concentration from mg/g to µg/g to facilitate the pooling, analysis and plotting of outcome data. Where results of individual trials were displayed graphically and the authors considered estimation to be reasonable, they estimated values visually from the graphs and stated these as such within tabulated results.</P>
<P>In one trial the investigators used the ratio of geometric means to describe the difference in change between treatment arms and reported exact P values (<LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>). The review authors calculated the SE from the exact P value using methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In a second paper, investigators reported the ratio of geometric means for baseline and end of trial measurements; however, exact P values were not available for all treatment arms and therefore the review authors could not calculate the difference in mean change (<LINK REF="STD-Tanner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tanner 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial reported results for serum ferritin concentration, liver iron concentration and total iron excretion separately for different doses of DFO or deferasirox, or both (<LINK REF="STD-Cappellini-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cappellini 2006</LINK>). In this case, the review authors combined data for different subgroups (doses) into a single group within each treatment arm using the formulae provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The authors had intended to group the outcomes into those measured at six monthly intervals, but this proved impossible due to the limited amount of outcome data reported in the included trials. Please refer to the results section to determine how outcome measures were grouped. </P>

<P>Authors performed meta-analyses using Review Manager 5.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2011</LINK>). They used a fixed-effect model for combining data in the first instance. Where considerable heterogeneity was identified in a fixed-effect meta-analysis, they repeated the analysis using a random-effects model. For many outcomes, meta-analysis was not possible due to diversity in the method or timing of the outcome measurement across trials. The authors did not undertake meta-analysis where differences in clinical outcome baseline levels occurred and they deemed the risk of selection bias to be unclear or high. Authors based their conclusions on inferences drawn from clearly tabulated results from included trials as well as qualitative and quantitative summary measures. They considered both direction and magnitude of effects. Authors present individual trial results in additional tables.</P>

<P>In 16 trials the use of blinding of participants, clinicians and outcome assessors was not reported and the risk of bias in these trials was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Aydinok-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aydinok 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aydinok-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aydinok 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borgna_x002d_Pignatti-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Borgna-Pignatti 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brissot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brissot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cappellini-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cappellini 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christoforidis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Christoforidis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galanello-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Galanello 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ha-_x0028_i_x0029_-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ha (i) 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ha-_x0028_ii_x0029_-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ha (ii) 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mourad 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tanner 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yarali-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yarali 2006</LINK>). Another trial with an unclear risk of bias was reported as an open-label study although the authors argued that this design "was considered appropriate in view of the differences in the treatment regimes and the fact that any potential bias would be counteracted by the objective nature of the efficacy parameters employed" (<LINK REF="STD-Piga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Piga 2006</LINK>). Blinding of participants and clinicians was also unclear in one other trial although the authors of this trial did state that cardiac treatment was undertaken by a clinician blinded to treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelrazik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelrazik 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The blinding of participants and clinicians was not undertaken in four trials, but this is unsurprising given the difference in the methods of administration between treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tamaddoni-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tamaddoni 2010</LINK>). However, in all four of these trials, outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation which was deemed adequate and these trials were therefore considered to have a low risk of bias.</P>

<P>An imbalance in missing data across the treatment arms was noted in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aydinok-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aydinok 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>). In the first of these trials four withdrawals were reported; these all occurred in the DFO group (<LINK REF="STD-Aydinok-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aydinok 2007</LINK>). Three withdrawals from the DFO group were also reported in the second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>). In this trial, three (30%) of the 10 randomised participants in the DFO alone group were lost to follow up: two participants were excluded and one participant changed treatment groups. No reasons were given as to why two participants were excluded from the trial. Follow-up data were not presented for the two excluded participants. End-of-trial data were analysed according to the treatment received rather than the treatment group to which the participants were randomised. Data from this trial were included in a meta-analysis within this review as it was clear to the authors which data were missing and what data analysis had been undertaken within the trial. However, given these noted concerns, the results from the meta-analysis need to be interpreted with caution. A further trial with a high risk of bias reported variable numbers of participants included in the analysis for each outcome (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>).

<P>One trial lost 46% of randomised participants (<LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1997</LINK>). Outcome data were presented for 54% of randomised participants.This trial collected and reported outcome data for participants who had completed two years of treatment. Of 71 participants entering the trial, 13 (18%) had withdrawn and 20 (28%) had not completed two years of follow-up. Outcome data were presented for 54% of randomised participants. This trial was stopped prematurely by the sponsoring pharmaceutical company (Apotex) when concerns were raised about the safety and effectiveness of deferiprone and the company made, as yet unproven allegations, over the conduct of the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Nathan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viens 2004</LINK>).</P>

In one trial an unexpected sudden death of a participant in the deferiprone arm prompted the termination of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ha-_x0028_i_x0029_-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ha (i) 2006</LINK>). The second trial sought to demonstrate an equivalence of treatment, with 80% power and a 0.2 chance of committing a Type 1 error. The trial investigators stated that to achieve this, 26 participants were needed, but to account for a large dropout rate, a total of 60 participants would be required (<LINK REF="STD-Ha-_x0028_ii_x0029_-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ha (ii) 2006</LINK>). A further trial was stopped early before the planned five years of treatment were completed for all patients due to observed beneficial effects of a reduction of serum ferritin levels in one of the treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2009</LINK>).</P>

In a second trial, seven participants (four in the treatment group and three in the comparator group) withdrew from the trial, but the number of participants included in the final outcome assessment was not reported and the risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data was therefore unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Tanner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tanner 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>Adverse events were reported as an outcome in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ha-_x0028_ii_x0029_-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ha (ii) 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>; Olivieri 1997; <LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>). However, in one trial the number of adverse events per treatment arm were not reported and data from this trial have therefore not been reported within this review (<LINK REF="STD-Ha-_x0028_ii_x0029_-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ha (ii) 2006</LINK>). In a further trial, the authors did not differentiate adverse events between the two treatment arms, deferiprone alone and deferiprone in combination with DFO and therefore no data were available for this comparison in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>). See an additional table for details of adverse events reported in individual trials (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial reported data that enabled a comparison of the risk of experiencing any adverse event (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>). In this trial, the risk of experiencing an adverse event in participants receiving DFO was lower compared with those receiving deferiprone, this result was statistically significant, RR 0.45 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.84) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The remaining trials did not provide enough data to allow for an analysis of the risk of experiencing cumulative adverse events between the treatment arms.</P>
<P>Permanent treatment withdrawal due to adverse events was reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>). All of the permanent treatment withdrawals in both trials occurred in patients who received deferiprone. Only one trial reported temporary treatment withdrawals which occurred in four participants in each treatment arm (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials reported dose reduction due to adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>); both trials reported dose reduction in the deferiprone treatment arm, due to arthropathy (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>) and nausea (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>). Only one of these trials reported details of the reduction in deferiprone: the dose was reduced to 50 mg/kg (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>). The Maggio trial also reported dose reduction in patients receiving DFO alone, due to pain or erythema or transient hypertransaminaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Joint pain or arthralgia was reported as an adverse event in four of the five trials; two of these documented joint pain in both treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>), whereas in a third trial joint pain was only reported in patients who received deferiprone (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>). The fourth trial reported joint pain in patients who received deferiprone (with or without DFO in combination) but no joint pain was reported in patients receiving DFO alone (<LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>). Meta-analysis of data from the three trials showed a significantly lower risk of joint pain or arthralgia associated with DFO, RR 0.38 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.83) (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials reported gastrointestinal symptoms in the form of nausea or vomiting in patients receiving deferiprone (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>). No cases of nausea or vomiting were reported in the DFO treatment arm although in one trial an absence of gastrointestinal symptoms in participants receiving DFO could not be clearly inferred (<LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>). A meta-analysis of two trials showed a significantly lower risk of nausea or vomiting, or both, associated with DFO, RR 0.09 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.64) (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five trials reported incidence of neutropenia or leucopenia, or both (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>). In two of these trials, one case of neutropenia (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>) and two cases of leucopenia (<LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>) were reported only in patients who received deferiprone. Three cases of agranulocytosis were observed in a third trial, all of which occurred in patients who received deferiprone (<LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1997</LINK>). The fourth trial reported one case of neutropenia which occurred in a patient treated with DFO and one case of agranulocytosis in a patient who received deferiprone (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>). No cases of neutropenia or leucopenia were observed in the Gomber trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>). When data were pooled across trials, neither treatment arm showed a significantly increased risk of neutropenia, leucopenia or agranulocytosis (or a combination of these), RR 0.31 (95% CI 0.08 to 1.28) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials observed increased liver transaminase in patients receiving either deferiprone or DFO, reported as: hypertransaminaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>); or jaundice and very high liver enzymes (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>). Maggio reported only one case of hypertransaminaemia in patients who received DFO compared with over 20% of patients who received deferiprone, RR 0.06 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.45) (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>). The second trial reported two patients (one in each treatment group) with jaundice or very high liver enzymes, RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.06 to 13.69) (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>). The combined risk of increased liver transaminase was significantly lower in patients treated with DFO than deferiprone, RR 0.11 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.48) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>). One other trial reported that the difference between the DFO and deferiprone treated groups in change of ALT at 12 months was not significant (<LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials reported adverse events specifically related to the administration of DFO, including skin reactions or swelling (5 out of 23, 21.7%) and systemic allergy (1 out of 23, 4.3%) (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>); pain or erythema at site of injection (6 out of 73) (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>); and local reactions at infusion site (12 out of 31, 38.7%) (<LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other adverse events reported in patients receiving deferiprone included infection (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>) and anorexia (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>).</P>

Although the first of these reported "excellent compliance during the study period" and documented four patients who were excluded from the trial due to lack of compliance, all of whom were randomised to the DFO treatment arm (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>). At 12 months, there was no significant difference in participant compliance between treatment groups, MD -1.00% (95% CI -4.88 to 2.88) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>). However, in one trial at three years, there was a statistically significant difference in participant compliance in favour of deferiprone, MD -23.30% (95%CI -25.08 to -21.52) (<LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1997</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of both dose and method of administration of the iron chelating agent DFO in people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia. However, the ability to fulfil this original aim was limited due to the design of the available trials and clinical diversity across trials. This systematic review has therefore sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DFO as an iron chelating agent and compared the efficacy and safety of DFO with iron chelators in transfusion-dependent thalassaemia major.</P>
<P>This updated review complements a concurrent systematic review of iron chelation 'Oral deferiprone for iron chelation in people with thalassaemia<I>', </I>which we previously undertook and which we have now also updated (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2013</LINK>). All trials in the current review which include a comparison with deferiprone (as monotherapy or in combination with DFO) are also presented in the concurrent review of deferiprone. A recent Cochrane systematic review has assessed the use of deferasirox in transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Meehpohl-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meehpohl 2012</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Analysis of RCTs of DFO and other iron chelators</HEADING>
<P>A total of 22 RCTs were eligible for analysis in this review. There was little opportunity for meta-analysis for the majority of outcomes; analysis of data was principally a commentary on the findings from each included trial. Few trials measured long-term outcomes, mortality was only measured in five trials and evidence of reduced end-organ damage was measured in six trials. Although measures of iron overload were reported in all but one trial, meta-analysis was often prohibited by different methods of assessment and measurement of outcomes used, variation in time points and a lack of sufficient data. Trials aimed at evaluating iron chelators may benefit from the development and application of agreed standardised sets of outcomes to be collected and reported, ideally through the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative (<A HREF="http://www.comet-initiative.org">www.comet-initiative.org</A>), which will better enable results of trials to be compared, contrasted and combined as appropriate (see also '<LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>' below).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>In five trials which reported mortality, a total of seven deaths occurred. Three of these deaths occurred in patients who received DFO alone and two in patients who received DFO in combination with deferiprone; one further death occurred in a patient who received deferiprone alone and one in a patient receiving deferasirox. One trial reported five further deaths in patients who withdrew from randomised treatment (deferiprone with or without DFO) and switched to DFO alone; these deaths were due to liver cancer in a patient randomised to combination therapy and due to pancreatic cancer, heart failure, stroke and myocarditis in four patients randomised to deferiprone alone (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2009</LINK>). While none of these deaths were thought to have been caused by the iron chelator, more long-term follow up is required for further assessment of the safety of these drugs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">End organ damage</HEADING>
<P>Reporting of long-term outcomes was limited and inconclusive. The effect of DFO and deferiprone on reduced end-organ damage has attracted some interest since the measurement of the MRI T2* signal suggested that deferiprone may reduce cardiac iron more quickly than DFO. In a direct measurement of the MRI T2* signal, that becomes lower when iron is present, a comparison of patients with low T2* (high cardiac iron) receiving DFO or deferiprone showed that T2* values increased in both treatment arms; the increase was twice as high at 12 months in patients who received deferiprone (26.9% increase from baseline) compared with those who received DFO (12.8%) (<LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measures the fraction of blood that is pumped from the final heart chamber - the left ventricle - in each cycle. In the comparison of DFO versus deferiprone monotherapy, meta-analysis of three trials which reported LVEF as a measure of cardiac function showed a significant difference in mean change from baseline in favour of deferiprone (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>). In a meta-analysis of two trials which compared LVEF between patients who received combined DFO with deferiprone and those who received DFO alone, LVEF was shown to be significantly reduced in patients who received DFO alone compared with combination therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelrazik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelrazik 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tanner 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The significance of differences in improvements in LVEF and MRI T2* to be translated into an ability to prevent cardiac disease is unclear without longer follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Neufeld-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neufeld 2006</LINK>). Several MRI studies have shown that iron loading in the liver, heart and endocrine glands are poorly correlated with each other (<LINK REF="REF-Argyropoulou-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Argyropoulou 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kolnagou-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolnagou 2009</LINK>) and regular follow up should include serial MRI estimates of iron deposition in different organs by MRI measurement of the T2* signal. Therefore, serum ferritin measurements do not necessarily predict iron loading in the myocardium or pancreas of individual patients. It is clear from retrospective and prospective clinical studies that intensified DFO treatment by either subcutaneous or intravenous route can reverse cardiac dysfunction because of iron overload, and increase survival in thalassaemia-major patients with early onset or overt cardiomyopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Maggio-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggio 2007</LINK>). The data from trials also suggest that combined DFO with deferiprone therapy may improve cardiac function (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelrazik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelrazik 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tanner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tanner 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Markers of iron overload</HEADING>
<P>In the absence of long-term follow up in all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2009</LINK>) and with limited data on mortality or end organ damage, data on the effects of chelation therapy rely on markers of iron overload or measurements of iron loading or excretion.</P>
<P>In the direct comparison of DFO and deferiprone, after six months, a statistically significant difference in mean change in serum ferritin concentration in favour of DFO was observed in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>); a third trial found no significant difference between treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Ha-_x0028_ii_x0029_-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ha (ii) 2006</LINK>). However, at 12 months, neither of two trials showed a significant difference in mean change in serum ferritin concentration between treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>), and there was also no significant difference at 24 months (<LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a single large trial with four years of follow up, there was significant difference in mean change of serum ferritin concentration in patients receiving the use of DFO in combination with deferiprone compared to deferiprone alone, favouring combined therapy, MD -579.00 ng/ml (95% CI -1041.89 to -116.11) (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2009</LINK>).  Furthermore, in three trials comparing DFO against DFO and deferiprone, meta-analysis showed a showed a significant difference favouring combined therapy, ratio of geometric means 1.17 (95% CI 1.10, 1.23) (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelrazik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelrazik 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mourad 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tamaddoni-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tamaddoni 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>These results suggest an advantage of combined therapy with DFO and deferiprone over monotherapy to reduce iron stores as measured by serum ferritin. Can such advantages for combination therapy be supported by other measurements of iron fluxes or stores, or both? Measures of urinary iron excretion are difficult to interpret as comparative measures of efficacy, as they do not include biliary iron excretion and so would underestimate the total iron excretion for DFO. Hence no real conclusion can be made by examining measurements of urinary iron excretion in five trials comparing deferiprone with DFO (<LINK REF="STD-Aydinok-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aydinok 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Liver iron concentration</HEADING>
<P>Liver iron concentration is a valuable measure of stored iron. Indeed, direct measurement of liver iron is the gold standard by which other assays are validated. Five trials which compared DFO with deferiprone reported liver iron concentration. However, conflicting results were observed between trials. Liver iron concentration at the end of the trial was significantly lower in the deferiprone treatment group in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>), significantly lower in the DFO treatment group in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1997</LINK>) and showed a non-significant difference in favour of DFO in a third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>). None of three trials reporting mean change from baseline found significant differences between treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Ha-_x0028_ii_x0029_-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ha (ii) 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neither trial which reported liver iron concentration for the comparison of DFO combined with deferiprone versus deferiprone alone found significant differences in liver iron concentration at the end of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Aydinok-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aydinok 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>). Similarly, in the comparison of DFO with deferiprone versus DFO alone, neither trial reporting this outcome found significant differences in mean change from baseline between treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Ha-_x0028_i_x0029_-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ha (i) 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galanello-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Galanello 2006</LINK>). There is, therefore, no conclusive or consistent evidence for the improved efficacy of combined deferiprone and DFO therapy against monotherapy from direct or indirect measures of liver iron.</P>
<P>Four trials compared DFO with the alternative iron chelator, deferasirox (<LINK REF="STD-Brissot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brissot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cappellini-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cappellini 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christoforidis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Christoforidis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Piga 2006</LINK>). However, only one trial reported data on mean change in serum ferritin concentration from baseline, which was significantly lower for DFO than deferasirox when data for each dose were pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Cappellini-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cappellini 2006</LINK>). Results stratified by dose showed a reduction in serum ferritin concentration only for higher doses of either treatment; lower doses of either treatment resulted in an increase in serum ferritin. A second trial displayed serum ferritin results graphically but reported "stable" mean serum ferritin levels for all treatment groups except the lower dose of deferasirox (10 mg/kg/day) (<LINK REF="STD-Piga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Piga 2006</LINK>). Liver iron concentration also increased in patients who received lower doses of either treatment, but a reduction in liver iron concentration was observed in both groups for higher doses. There were no significant differences in liver iron concentration between patients who received DFO and those who received deferasirox when data were pooled across different doses.</P>
<P>Only two trials compared different methods of administration of DFO (bolus injection versus continuous infusion) (<LINK REF="STD-Borgna_x002d_Pignatti-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Borgna-Pignatti 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yarali-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yarali 2006</LINK>). No significant differences between treatment arms were reported for any of the measures of overload reported by each trial.  </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Safety, compliance and cost of chelation therapy</HEADING>
<P>Given the apparently similar efficacy of DFO, deferiprone and deferasirox, the safety, compliance and cost of these drugs are of special interest. Indeed the safety of chelation therapy has been somewhat controversial. Given that DFO has been in clinical usage for some 20 years longer than deferiprone, adverse events as a result of DFO therapy have been observed, with epidemiological data suggesting that these may be dose related (<LINK REF="REF-Porter-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 2002</LINK>). The longer-term safety profile is much less certain for deferiprone than for DFO, although in the late 1990s liver fibrosis appeared to be associated with deferiprone during a clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-Olivieri-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivieri 1998</LINK>). There have been no consistent data in subsequent trials that have highlighted this particular problem.</P>
<P>Adverse event data were reported in 18 trials, but differences in how adverse events were measured (number of events or events per person), the time points for measurement and the lack of standard reporting of the severity of reactions precluded pooling of data across the trials in many instances.</P>
<P>In a direct comparison of DFO against deferiprone, meta-analysis showed an increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects associated with deferiprone, RR 11.71 (95% CI 1.57 to 87.31) (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>), increased liver transaminase levels, RR 8.90 (95% CI 2.08 to 38.11) in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>) and increased risk of joint pain or arthralgia in three trials, RR 2.64 (95% CI 1.21 to 5.77) (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>).  </P>
<P>Local adverse events specifically related to the administration of DFO are well described: local reactions at infusion sites occurred in 8 out of 45 (17.8%) patients (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>), 11 out of 40 (27.5%) patients (<LINK REF="STD-Tamaddoni-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tamaddoni 2010</LINK>), 12 out of 14 (85.7%) patients (<LINK REF="STD-Mourad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mourad 2003</LINK>) and 12 out of 31 (38.7%) patients (<LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>); local abscesses at the site of infusion occurred in 1 out of 30 (3.3%) patients (<LINK REF="STD-Galanello-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Galanello 2006</LINK>) and 1 out of 40 (2.5%) patients (<LINK REF="STD-Tamaddoni-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tamaddoni 2010</LINK>); and systemic allergy occurred in 1 out of 23 (4.3%) patients (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Beshlawy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">El-Beshlawy 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials reported data that enabled a comparison of the risk of experiencing any adverse event. In a comparison of DFO against deferiprone, there was a statistically significant increased risk of experiencing an adverse event in participants receiving deferiprone compared with those receiving DFO, RR 2.24 (95% CI 1.19 to 4.23) <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, two trials observed a greater proportion of adverse events in patients receiving deferiprone with DFO than those receiving DFO alone and in a meta-analysis, the increased risk of experiencing an adverse event in participants receiving deferiprone with DFO compared with those receiving DFO alone was significantly greater, RR 3.04 (95% CI 1.18 to 7.83) (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelrazik-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelrazik 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galanello-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Galanello 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The limited data from the four trials comparing DFO with deferasirox also suggest that adverse events are more frequently observed for deferasirox treatment than DFO, particularly gastrointestinal disturbances and increased liver transaminase although one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Piga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Piga 2006</LINK>) reported an extensive range of symptoms observed in both treatment arms (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Dose-dependent reduction in renal function is a well described side effect with deferasirox and monthly monitoring of renal function is recommended (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>These conclusions must be viewed with some caution; RCTs are not designed to measure the adverse effects of an intervention and thus data from RCTs do not represent a formal comparison of adverse events caused by iron chelation therapy. A complete review of adverse events would have to be the subject of a separate, formal analysis incorporating data from non-RCTs and observational studies.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the major concern of prescribing DFO is compliance. It has been suggested that participants given an oral iron chelator may be more compliant with treatment than those given a continuous subcutaneous infusion of DFO. Eleven trials reported compliance, with this suggestion being supported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olivieri-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olivieri 1997</LINK>), although reporting of compliance in other trials was often purely descriptive. The observed differences may be medically important, especially as the difference in compliance associated with these two iron chelators may become greater outside the rigours and discipline of a formal RCT setting. Thus, objective assessment of safety and compliance with these chelating agents will require studies with long-term follow up in a variety of settings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Difficulties performing meta-analyses</HEADING>
<P>Several factors have contributed to the disappointing absence of meta-analyses of trial results. Trials included participants with substantial clinical and demographic diversity, which was not always fully defined. In particular, there were differences in the measurement of outcomes across trials, notably the different techniques used to assess liver iron concentration between trials (magnetic spectrometry (SQUID), atomic spectrophotometry, liver T2*), the presence of hepatitis C in participants in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>), the skewed nature of the data in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mourad 2003</LINK>) and the undermining of the randomisation process (<LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>). Some trials failed to report baseline data, making valid comparisons impossible between trials. Moreover, where reported, baseline values for serum ferritin and liver iron concentration differed substantially between trials, and in two trials between treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Gomber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gomber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pennell 2006</LINK>). The impact of these differences on any overall results is difficult to evaluate due to the limited number of trials and the small sample sizes of the included trials. The skewed nature of the data in two trials gives rise to concerns of the likely skewing of the data in the remaining trials. Without obtaining the individual patient data from all trials, this issue could not be confirmed.</P>
<P>Variation in the time points used for outcome measurement was also a factor that precluded meta-analysis. While very short-term outcome measurement was the appropriate objective of the two iron balance trials and measures of iron overload can be assessed over a six or twelve month period, much longer follow up is needed to examine the effect of iron chelation on mortality and reduced end-organ damage or other toxicity.</P>
<P>The validity of the data is a third issue to note. With the exception of four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brissot-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brissot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cappellini-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cappellini 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maggio-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 2009</LINK>), the sample sizes of the included trials were small with 40 or fewer participants in each treatment arm. Only seven trials presented information on sample sizes required to power the trial around a main outcome, whilst several trials failed to clearly state the primary end point for analysis. Data were presented in abstract form for three trials, presumably with a lack of peer review, therefore limiting the amount of data that could be reported.</P>
<P>The risk of bias of the included trials was difficult to assess given the general absence of information on randomisation and blinding to treatment allocation. As such, the influence of potential risks of bias of the included trials was not explored with respect to the robustness of any results. With the interventions in these trials, blinding to treatment allocation would be impossible for clinicians and participants. However, blinding of outcome assessors would be desirable as a means of minimising bias, particularly where subjective measurements such as functional status and histological results are concerned.</P>
<P>Although no quantitative assessment of publication bias was undertaken, attempts were made to minimise the likelihood of publication bias by the use of a comprehensive search strategy, the handsearching of relevant conference abstract books and by contacting the manufacturers of iron chelators.</P>
<P>This review has highlighted the difficulty of undertaking an analysis in such intervention comparisons, not least the limited ability to pool and meta-analyse crucial aspects of measures of iron stores and chelation across the trials. These difficulties seem to be inherent in the population being studied. Children with thalassaemia may enter trials at different points in their clinical course, after variable amounts of blood transfusion, with variable endogenous iron loading, with different prior treatment and with differing biochemical levels as a result of past treatment and their thalassaemia. It seems unlikely that any one particular methodology could overcome these problems in future trials. It would therefore be important that each RCT comparing iron chelators or different schedules, doses or methods of administration of iron chelators should provide extensive details of baseline measures, collect follow-up data at times appropriate to the outcomes of interest and be sufficiently powered to provide a significant comparison within the trial.</P>
<P>These difficulties highlight the importance not only in designing trials to optimise subsequent meta-analysis, but of ensuring individual patient data are made available to the scientific community. Perhaps deposition of the individual patient data for an RCT will ultimately become a requirement for publication in the same way as molecular data for experimental data is deposited in public databases now. Moreover, consensus on the appropriate methods and sampling to measure iron overload would greatly help data from future trials to be combined. Finally, accurate recording of compliance and adverse events for different schedules of iron chelation should be an essential feature of future trials.</P>
<P>In summary, the available data provide limited evidence to compare the efficacy and safety of desferrioxamine with other iron chelating agents. However, the review does support the clinical use of DFO as first-line therapy in people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia. Desferrioxamine and the oral iron chelators deferiprone and deferasirox produce significant reductions in iron stores in transfusion-dependent, iron-overloaded people although these reductions are dependent on achieving an adequate dose of chelator. There is no evidence from RCTs to suggest that any one chelator has a greater reduction in clinically significant end-organ damage, although combination therapy with DFO and deferiprone showed a greater improvement in LVEF than DFO used alone in two trials. Furthermore, one trial of combination therapy with DFO and deferiprone showed a greater improvement in serum ferritin but not liver iron stores than DFO used alone. These potential benefits, the degree of organ-specific iron loading, the increased side effects of combination therapy with DFO and deferiprone or deferasirox alone compared to DFO alone, and the convenience of oral therapy against infusion of DFO have to be weighed up carefully for each patient.</P>
<P>Intensified DFO treatment (by either subcutaneous or intravenous route) or the use of other oral iron chelators, or both, remains the established treatment to reverse cardiac dysfunction because of iron overload. Indeed, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved deferiprone only as "last resort treatment of iron overload in thalassemia" (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2011</LINK>) and combination therapy with DFO and deferiprone has been used in spite of the lack of RCT-data in specific clinical situations, particularly where there is evidence of myocardial iron deposition, or where compliance with continuous DFO is a severe problem, or both.</P>
<P>Factors are suggested that should be considered in further trials to improve the efficacy and applicability of desferrioxamine in people with iron overload.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-05 12:02:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-08-05 11:57:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both desferrioxamine (DFO) and the alternative oral iron chelators (deferiprone and deferasirox) produce a significant reduction in iron stores in transfusion-dependent, iron-overloaded people. There is no evidence to suggest that one treatment is more clinically efficacious than another.</P>
<P>Desferrioxamine is the recommended first-line therapy for iron overload in people with thalassaemia major and deferiprone or deferasirox are indicated for treating iron overload when DFO is contraindicated or inadequate. The oral iron chelator deferasirox has been licensed for use in children aged over six years who receive frequent blood transfusion and in children aged two to five years who receive infrequent blood transfusions.  In the absence of RCTs with long-term follow up, there is no compelling evidence to change the conclusion that DFO is the recommended first-line therapy for iron overload in people with thalassaemia major and deferiprone or deferasirox are indicated for treating iron overload when DFO is contraindicated or inadequate, nor change the approved indications for the use of deferasirox in children. The FDA have approved deferiprone only as "last resort treatment of iron overload in thalassemia".</P>
<P>One trial suggested an advantage of combined therapy with DFO and deferiprone over monotherapy to reduce iron stores as measured by serum ferritin (an indirect measure of iron stores that can be made from blood samples). However, there is no conclusive or consistent evidence for the improved efficacy of combined deferiprone and DFO therapy against treating with DFO or deferiprone alone from measures of liver iron.</P>
<P>Worsening iron deposition in the heart in patients receiving DFO alone would suggest that a change of therapy is required by intensification of DFO treatment by either subcutaneous or intravenous route or the use of DFO and deferiprone combination therapy.</P>
<P>Adverse events are increased in patients treated with oral iron chelators compared with DFO. People treated with all chelators must be kept under close medical supervision and treatment with deferiprone or deferasirox requires regular monitoring of neutrophil counts or renal function respectively.</P>
<P>The major difference in the route of administration between subcutaneous infusion of DFO and oral iron chelators may lead to differences in compliance, but the majority of the included trials in which compliance was reported achieved good to excellent compliance with oral chelators and DFO. Therefore practical issues and preferences, the age of the patient, assessment of iron loading in the liver, heart and pancreas, adverse events and cost will determine the chelation regime of choice.</P>
<P>There is an urgent need for adequately-powered, high-quality trials comparing the overall clinical efficacy and long-term outcome of deferiprone, deferasirox and DFO.<B> </B>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-05 12:02:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are four implications for further research, derived from this review.</P>
<P>First, the most urgent need is for long-term (i.e. minimum of five years) prospective trials starting early in life before there is significant iron loading and carried through to adolescence and beyond. Ideally, these should be funded by research bodies independently of the manufacturers of these chelating agents.</P>
<P>Secondly, future trials should include outcomes that enable a comparison of the long-term clinical efficacy and safety of these agents. Trials comparing the two drugs should use comparable and combinable measures of pharmacological and clinical outcomes that have been, or may be, validated. Liver iron burden, liver histology (tissue structure) and cardiac function are of special interest. Measures and outcomes should therefore include serum ferritin, liver histology, direct measures of hepatic iron stores and indirect measures of hepatic and cardiac iron using MRI or similar techniques, and measures of cardiac function including LVEF. To combine data it is necessary to have full data including the SD for baseline and end of trial data and the change between start and finish for all participant groups. Ideally, agreed standardised sets of outcomes should be collected and reported, ideally though the COMET initiative (<A HREF="http://www.comet-initiative.org">www.comet-initiative.org</A>), which will better enable results of trials to be compared, contrasted and combined as appropriate. Where necessary, agreement to use individual patient data should be forthcoming.</P>
<P>Thirdly, information is required about minimal clinically important differences for people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia receiving iron chelation therapy, i.e. what level of difference in tissue (liver and cardiac iron) concentration would lead to a clinically important difference in survival. This information need not be derived from RCTs, but from observational studies specifically designed for this task. The reporting of adverse events would require comparable indices and outcomes to be used across trials to allow more comprehensive pooling of data.</P>
<P>Finally, there are little data on the relative cost of these chelating agents, but this will clearly be of major interest in many countries where iron chelators are widely used.</P>
