<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-04 12:29:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breastfeeding provides pain relief for newborn babies undergoing painful procedures. Medicine for pain relief is commonly given for major painful procedures, but may not be given for minor painful procedures such as blood sampling (by heel prick or venepuncture). There are different forms of non-pharmacological strategies that may be used to reduce pain in babies, such as holding, swaddling them, sucking on a pacifier, or giving sweet solutions (such as sucrose or glucose). Different studies done in babies have shown that breastfeeding is a good way to reduce the pain babies feel when subjected to minor painful procedures. These studies have been done in full-term babies and they have shown that breastfeeding is effective by demonstrating that it reduces babies' crying time and reduces different pain scores that have been validated for babies. Breast milk given by syringe has not shown the same efficacy as breastfeeding itself. No studies have been done in premature babies, and so new studies are needed to determine if the use of supplemental breast milk in these small babies is effective in reducing their pain.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-29 13:10:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Physiological changes brought about by pain may contribute to the development of morbidity in neonates. Clinical studies have shown reduction in changes in physiological parameters and pain score measurements following pre-emptive analgesic administration in situations where the neonate is experiencing pain or stress. Non-pharmacological measures (such as holding, swaddling and breastfeeding) and pharmacological measures (such as acetaminophen, sucrose and opioids) have been used for this purpose.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-09-29 15:57:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of breastfeeding or supplemental breast milk in reducing procedural pain in neonates. The secondary objective was to conduct subgroup analyses based on the type of control intervention, gestational age and the amount of supplemental breast milk given.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-09-29 13:10:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed a literature search using the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2011<I>, </I>Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2011), EMBASE (1980 to February 2011), CINAHL (1982 to February 2011), abstracts from the annual meetings of the Society for Pediatric Research (1994 to 2011), and major paediatric pain conference proceedings. We did not apply any language restrictions.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-09-29 13:11:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of breastfeeding or supplemental breast milk versus no treatment/other measures in neonates were eligible for inclusion in this review. The study must have reported on either physiologic markers of pain or validated pain scores.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-09-29 13:11:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of the trials using the information provided in the studies and by personal communication with the authors. We extracted data on relevant outcomes, estimated the effect size and reported this as a risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and weighted mean difference (MD) as appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-29 13:12:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of twenty eligible studies, ten evaluated breastfeeding and ten evaluated supplemental breast milk. Sixteen studies analysed used heel lance and four used venepuncture as procedure. We noted marked heterogeneity in control intervention and pain assessment measures among the studies. Neonates in the breastfeeding group had statistically a significantly lower increase in heart rate, reduced proportion of crying time and reduced duration of first cry and total crying time compared to positioning (swaddled and placed in a crib), holding by mother, placebo, pacifier use, no intervention or oral sucrose group, or both.</P>
<P>Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) scores were significantly lower in the breastfeeding group compared to positioning, placebo or oral sucrose group, or both. However, there was no statistically significant difference in PIPP scores when compared to no intervention. Douleur Aigue Nouveau-ne scores (DAN) were significantly lower in the breastfeeding group compared to the placebo group and the group held in mother's arms, but not when compared to the glucose group. Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) was significantly lower in the breastfeeding group compared to the no intervention group, but there was no difference when compared to the oral sucrose group. The Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS) was significantly lower in the breastfeeding group when compared to oral glucose, pacifier use, holding by mother and no intervention, but no difference was found when compared to formula feeding.</P>
<P>Supplemental breast milk yielded variable results. Neonates in the supplemental breast milk group had a significantly lower increase in heart rate, a reduction in duration of crying and a lower NFCS compared to the placebo group. Neonates in the supplemental breast milk group had a significantly higher increase in heart rate changes when compared to the sucrose group. Sucrose (in any concentration, i.e. 12.5%, 20%, 25%) was found to reduce the duration of cry when compared to breast milk, as did glycine, pacifier use, rocking, or no intervention. Breast milk was found not to be effective in reducing validated and non-validated pain scores such as NIPS, NFCS, and DAN; only being significantly better when compared to placebo (water) or massage. We did not identify any study that has evaluated safety/effectiveness of repeated administration of breastfeeding or supplemental breast milk for pain relief.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-09-29 13:13:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If available, breastfeeding or breast milk should be used to alleviate procedural pain in neonates undergoing a single painful procedure rather than placebo, positioning or no intervention. Administration of glucose/sucrose had similar effectiveness as breastfeeding for reducing pain. The effectiveness of breast milk for painful procedure should be studied in the preterm population, as there are currently a limited number of studies in the literature that have assessed it's effectiveness in this population.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-10-03 11:00:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pain is "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage" (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2000</LINK>). Evaluation of pain in neonates is difficult due to the subjective nature of pain and the inability of neonates to verbally express pain. Surrogate measures used to describe pain in neonates include motor responses (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Craig-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1993</LINK>), facial expressions (<LINK REF="REF-Grunau-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunau 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1993</LINK>), cry (<LINK REF="REF-Grunau-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunau 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1993</LINK>) and changes in physiologic parameters like heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. Various changes have been compiled to create various scores (<LINK REF="REF-Abu_x002d_Saad-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abu-Saad 1998</LINK>). Validated scores for the assessment of pain include the Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS) (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1994</LINK>), Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1993</LINK>) or Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1996</LINK>). These reactions to pain may contribute to the development of hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis, ventilator asynchrony, pneumothoraces, reperfusion injury and venous congestion and subsequent late intraventricular haemorrhage or late extension of early intraventricular haemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia (<LINK REF="REF-Abdel_x002d_Rahman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdel-Rahman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anand-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anand 1998</LINK>). These behavioural changes may also disrupt postnatal adaptation, parent-infant bonding and feeding schedules.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-03 11:00:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical studies have shown beneficial effects of pre-emptive analgesic administration in reducing neonatal pain and stress (<LINK REF="REF-Anand-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anand 1989</LINK>). Pharmacological interventions include acetaminophen, sucrose and opioid analgesics. Non-pharmacological interventions include reduction of noxious stimuli (<LINK REF="REF-Schechter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schechter 1997</LINK>), implementation of neurobehaviorally supportive relationship-based care (<LINK REF="REF-Gunnar-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunnar 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corff-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corff 1995</LINK>), limitation of the number of painful procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Anand-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anand 2001</LINK>) and breastfeeding during the actual procedure.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-10-03 11:01:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several potential mechanisms by which breast milk or breast feeding might provide an analgesic effect. Components of breast feeding that may be analgesic include presence of a comforting person (mother) (<LINK REF="REF-Blass-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blass 1995</LINK>), physical sensation (skin-to-skin contact with comforting person) (<LINK REF="REF-Blass-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blass 1995</LINK>), diversion of attention (<LINK REF="REF-Gunnar-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunnar 1984</LINK>) and sweetness of breast milk (presence of lactose or other ingredients present in the breast milk) (<LINK REF="REF-Blass-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blass 1997</LINK>). Compared to artificial formulas, breast milk contains a higher concentration of tryptophan (<LINK REF="REF-Heine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heine 1999</LINK>), a precursor of melatonin. Melatonin is shown to increase the concentration of beta endorphins (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2000</LINK>) and could possibly be one of the mechanisms for the nociceptive effects of breast milk. Preterm neonates incapable of direct breastfeeding from the mother may benefit from placement of breast milk on the tongue or administering breast milk via the naso/orogastric route (supplemental breast milk) through some of the mechanisms listed above. Among the analgesics studied for neonatal pain, breastfeeding/breast milk is a natural, easily available, easy to use and potentially risk free (<LINK REF="REF-Schollin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schollin 2004</LINK>) intervention. It is an intervention that could be easily adopted from the perspectives of health care providers and parents. No adverse effects of breastfeeding apart from rare transmission of micro-organisms have been reported.</P>
<P>In a systematic review, 24% sucrose was found to be effective in alleviating procedural pain in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2010</LINK>). Both opioid and non-opioid mechanisms were suggested for its effectiveness. Breast milk contains only 7% lactose and may not be as effective as sucrose. On the other hand, interventions like pacifiers or positioning may result in an effect similar to breastfeeding or supplemental breast milk without interruption of the regular breastfeeding schedule.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-10-09 17:56:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All review authors independently evaluated the quality of included trials using the following criteria in the first version of the review.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Masking of randomisation.</LI>
<LI>Masking of intervention.</LI>
<LI>Completeness of follow-up.</LI>
<LI>Masking of outcome assessment.</LI>
</OL>
<P>There were three potential answers to these questions - yes, no and cannot tell.</P>
<P>In this review update, we used the 'Risk of bias' assessment tool suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration and reassessed all included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?  For each included study, we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non-random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear. </LI>
</OL>
<LI>Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear. </LI>
</OL>
<LI>Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? For each included study, we described the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk for study personnel;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk for outcome assessors and specific outcomes assessed. </LI>
</OL>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We addressed whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We assessed methods as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>unclear. </LI>
</OL>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study, we assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to be reported);</LI>
<LI>or unclear.  </LI>
</OL>
<LI>Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? For each included study, we noted any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We planned to assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>

<P>The infants were between 30 to 55 hours of age at the time of blood collection for routine neonatal screening using the heel lance procedure. 2 ml of the allocated solution was given either by slow administration via syringe over a span of two minutes or by allowing the infant to suck a pacifier dipped in the solution every 30 seconds for two minutes. Prior to the procedure, baseline data were obtained for 60 seconds and continuous monitoring was done throughout and after the procedure during the recovery time. The blood collection was done by an experienced phlebotomist for 49 of the 60 infants. The outcomes measured were reduction in the percentage crying and grimacing times during the procedure;,the mean crying time following the procedure, and the mean heart rate change during and following the procedure. Despite repeated requests, we were unable to obtain data regarding individual groups from the authors.</P>

<P>In Group 1 and 2, the interventions were started two minutes before the procedure and continued throughout the procedure. In groups 3 and 4 the intervention was commenced two minutes prior to the procedure. Venepuncture was performed when infants were at least 24 hours of age and had not been fed for the previous 30 minutes.<B> </B>The primary outcome measure was the DAN scale (<LINK REF="REF-Carbajal-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carbajal 1997</LINK>), a behavioural scale developed to rate acute pain in term and preterm neonates. The score comprised of three items namely facial expressions, limb movements, and vocal expression with values in each ranging from zero (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain). The secondary outcome measure was the PIPP score. Mothers were interviewed 48 to 72 hours after the study by standardised questionnaires to assess any change in the sucking behaviour. One infant was excluded from the analysis as the outcome measure could not be assessed properly due to the mother's head partially covering her infant's face. Data from all four groups were used in their respective appropriate comparisons.</P>

<P>Infants underwent heel lance for routine newborn screening. Infants in group 1 were held by mother and breastfed until there was a continuous active suction prior to heel lance. Group 2 infants were laid on a changing table and a bolus of 1 ml of 25% sucrose solution was administered through a syringe in the mouth two minutes before the heel lance. The outcomes measured were the PIPP scale, changes in heart rate and saturation 30 seconds after the procedure, duration of first cry, and percentage of crying in the first two minutes after the procedure. The procedure was taped (audio) and the tape recording was evaluated by two assistants (who were blinded to the groups) to assess cry behaviour.</P>

<P>Infants underwent venepuncture for routine screening of phenylketonuria and hyperbilirubinaemia. Infants in Group 1 were held in skin-to-skin contact with their mothers during the entire procedure. Three minutes after the first jaw movements were observed, the venous blood sample was taken. Infants continued to breastfeed during and after the venepuncture. Group 2 infants received 2 ml of 25% sucrose solution dipped into pacifiers. The infants started to suck the pacifier with sucrose three minutes before the venepuncture and continued to suck during and after sampling. The control group infants were wrapped in a blanket with only the hand that would be used for sampling outside the blanket. The mother stayed next to the infant trying to soothe him verbally. After the sample was collected, the infant was cuddled by the mother and could be given a pacifier. The outcomes measured were NIPS, heart rate, oxygen saturation levels and crying time. Crying time was assessed by audio tapes.</P>

<P>Infants underwent a routine neonatal screening procedure using venepuncture at three to five days of age. The data from Group 3 were not used for this review. For the breastfed group, the infants were allowed breastfeeding <I>ad libitum</I> 45 minutes prior to blood sampling, while infants in the fasting group had blood sampling performed at least two hours after the last feeding. 1 ml of either sterile water or 30% glucose was administered through a syringe into the infants mouth, and one minute later the blood sampling was performed. After sampling, the infants were left undisturbed for three minutes during recovery phase. The outcomes measured were the PIPP score and mean crying time. Parents were asked to assess pain using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The agreement between the parental assessment of pain and the PIPP score and crying time was determined. The primary author provided missing data. Nine infants were excluded from the study by the authors mostly due to technical problems with the video recordings (n = 6) and maternal choice to withdraw their infants from the study (n = 3). Data from groups 1, 3 and 4 were used for this review as the combination of breastfeeding and glucose was not planned to be compared a priori.</P>

<P>Infants underwent heel prick at more than 24 hours of age for collection of blood for bilirubin estimation. 2 ml of expressed breast milk, 20% sucrose or distilled water were administered in the baby's mouth with a dropper. In the non-nutritive sucking group, a sterile pacifier was held gently in the baby's mouth and the palate was tickled to stimulate sucking. This was continued during and for two minutes after the heel prick. In the massaging group, neonates were subjected to firm, gentle stroking with bare fingers in a rhythmical manner starting from the forehead and going down to the chest, arms and legs, during and for two minutes after the heel prick. In the rocking group, newborns were rocked by lifting the baby's head off the cot on the palm of the hand (without lifting the body off the cot) and making rocking movements in a gentle rhythmic manner for two minutes after the heel prick. The outcomes measured were duration of first cry, total crying time and DAN score at 30 seconds, one minute, two minutes and four minutes after the prick. For the purpose of this review, we analysed the DAN score at two minutes. Other outcome variables were heart rate increase and saturation reduction; however, results were not shown, but they commented that there were no significant differences.</P>

This was a RCT of 120 neonates (66 preterm neonates between 30 to 37 weeks and 54 term neonates). The infants were randomly assigned to one of the following groups (30 neonates in each group).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Group 1: no intervention.</LI>
<LI>Group 2: 1 ml of 30% glucose via syringe.</LI>
<LI>Group 3: 1 ml of 10% glucose via syringe.</LI>
<LI>Group 4: 1 ml of breast milk via syringe.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The infants were studied on mean (SD) postnatal day five at the time of blood collection for their routine care using the heel lance procedure. 1 ml of the allocated solution was given via syringe by a nurse not aware of allocation. Prior to the procedure, baseline data were obtained and continuous monitoring was done throughout and after the procedure during the recovery time. The blood collection was performed two minutes after administration of solution. The outcomes measured were heart rate change and duration of crying. The data were presented in graphical format, however, the contact author provided the data necessary for the review. As this study had two comparative groups with different concentrations of glucose, for the purpose of analyses we combined the group who received 30% glucose with data from the <LINK REF="STD-Ors-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ors 1999</LINK> study where they used 25% sucrose in one group (presuming very minimal difference in pain responses between 25% and 30% sugar solution). We compared the group who received 10% glucose with the breast milk group separately.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Upadhyay-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Upadhyay 2004</LINK> compared the effects of supplemental breast milk to sterile water. This was a RCT of 87 full-term neonates. The infants were randomised to two groups.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Group 1: received 5 ml of expressed breast milk (n = 40).</LI>
<LI>Group 2: received 5 ml of distilled water (n = 41) prior to venepuncture.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Venepuncture was performed based on clinical indications. Three babies from each group were excluded from the study by the authors due to venepuncture failure and failure to attain state 3 or 4 of wakefulness. Data from 81 infants were analysed. The primary outcome was the duration of the cry after the venepuncture. The secondary outcomes included changes in physiological parameters, namely heart rate and oxygen saturation from baseline to one and three minutes after venepuncture and the modified NFCS. Only five easily recordable parameters of the NFCS (out of ten) were assessed by the investigators. Data on heart rate and oxygen saturation were provided as mean and SD at baseline and three minutes. We contacted authors to provide data on mean changes in these parameters, but no response was obtained. We calculated the MD and SD of the difference assuming 50% correlation between baseline and subsequent findings.</P>

<P>All infants underwent heel lance blood sampling by a single performer. The allocated solution was given by syringe into the baby's mouth. The heel prick was performed two minutes after administration of the solution. Crying duration and heart rate changes at one, two, and three minutes were recorded from the time of the heel prick. The outcomes measured were crying time, percentage change in heart rate and NFCS at one, two and three minutes. The data from Group 1 and 2 were combined for the analyses.

<LINK REF="STD-Blass-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blass 2001</LINK>: The infants were initially assessed to determine whether they were successfully breastfed or not and then randomised into the colostrum groups and non-colostrum groups. Investigators initially planned the assignment of the infants based on a table of random numbers. Group assignment needed to be adjusted because some mothers were unable to obtain sufficient colostrum. After passing the exclusion criteria, investigators assessed mother's success regarding breastfeeding. If the mother was unsuccessful, she was assigned to groups that didn't involve breast milk (Groups 1, 3, 4 and 6). If breastfeeding was established the infant was assigned to Groups 2 or 5. The phlebotomist who performed the heel lance was unaware of allocation, study purpose or hypotheses. The authors did not define what constituted successful breastfeeding. The data collection for sucrose, water and pacifier groups was completed in June 1998, while colostrum data collection ended in March 1999.</P>
<P>Although the phlebotomist and the person who rated the video data were unaware of treatment allocation, this could have introduced a degree of bias. Masking of intervention was not possible in this study since it involved the use of a pacifier and a liquid (colostrum) that differed in colour from two other solutions. Masking of outcome assessment was possible with crying time and heart rate changes, but not so when assessing grimacing since the intervention involved the use of a pacifier. A number of infants in the water and colostrum groups were excused (data collection not continued and infant allowed to be comforted in other ways) after 90 seconds of recovery period due to excessive crying, although all infants were included in the final analysis with the assumption that these behaviours would have continued at the same level for the rest of the recovery period.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2000</LINK>: The randomisation was done through sealed envelopes. One nurse administered the solution in the absence of investigators and was not involved in heel prick or data collection. Masking of outcome assessment was done by blinding observer as to the assignments to the study group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Carbajal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Carbajal 2003</LINK>: The randomisation was done by a research assistant using numbered envelopes. Allocation was concealed from the investigators. Masking of the intervention was not possible in this study since it involved breastfeeding, the use of a pacifier and cuddling before and throughout the procedure. The outcome assessment was masked as the observers who assessed the outcome measures were not aware as to the purpose and hypothesis of the study. However, personal bias on the part of the outcome observer could not be excluded.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Codipietro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Codipietro 2008</LINK>: Randomisation was done by using a computer random number generator. Allocation was concealed using opaque, sealed envelopes, which were opened sequentially by the paediatric nurse who performed blood sampling. Masking of intervention was not possible since it involved breastfeeding before and throughout the procedure. However, assessment of one of the outcomes (cry behaviour) was masked as it was assessed by two assistants who listened to tape recordings. All infants were accounted for in the analysis of outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Efe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Efe 2007</LINK>: It was a quasi-randomised trial as allocation was done according to the mothers' preferences. There was no allocation of concealment or blinding of the intervention. All patients were accounted for in the analysis of outcomes.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Jatana-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jatana 2003</LINK>: There is no comment on how the randomisation was done, although the authors comment that the groups were matched for gestational age, birth weight and sex distribution. There are also no comment on whether the intervention was masked or not, which could have been possible, given that all the solutions were administered in the same way. No comments on whether the outcome assessment was masked or not. One of the outcomes, neonatal facial scoring, was not published in the results.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Leite-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Leite 2009</LINK>: Randomisation was done by a computer random number generator. Masking of the intervention was not possible since it involved breastfeeding before and throughout the procedure. Two digital cameras were used to record the newborns' behaviour, one focused on the newborns' face and the second camera on the neonates' body. Analysis of facial actions was carried out by a person who was blinded to the phase of the procedure (blood collection, compression or recovery). It was not possible to blind for group assignment as the information about breastfeeding was easily determined in both body and face videos. All participants were accounted for in the analysis of outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mathai-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mathai 2006</LINK>: Randomisation was done through a random number table. Masking of the intervention was not possible since some of the participants took oral solutions while others were held or rocked in different ways. Masking of cry behaviour was possible, as one of the investigators stood behind a screen during the assignment of the infant and during the procedure (this observer assessed the total duration of cry). Not all of the study's prespecified outcomes were reported, no data were available for two of the outcomes i.e. heart rate and saturations, although the authors commented that there was no significant difference between the groups. All infants were accounted for in the analysis of outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Okan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Okan 2010</LINK>: Randomisation was done through a random number table. Masking of the intervention was not possible since it involved breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, and no contact at all. Authors commented that NFCS was not assessed in breastfed infants, as facial actions of these babies could not be evaluated. All infants were accounted for in the analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ors-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ors 1999</LINK>: The manner of randomisation was not discussed by the authors. Masking of the intervention was made possible by using a placebo and by performing the heel prick one minute after giving the solutions. The two investigators who analysed the data were unaware of the treatment intervention, hence, the outcome measure analysis was blinded. All infants were accounted for in the analysis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ozdogan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdogan 2010</LINK>: This was a quasi-randomised trial. Participants were consecutively allocated to the different groups by order of admission. There is insufficient information to know if this study was blinded or not, as the authors do not comment on whether the syringe was wrapped or covered and whether the person watching the video tape could see the contents of it or not. The first three groups were probably masked (as the intervention occurred before the video was taken), but we do not know if the intervention was masked for the two-dose groups. All infants are accounted for in the analysis.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-29 15:00:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breastfeeding was associated with a reduction in changes in heart rate, percentage of time crying, duration of crying and duration of first cry, validated and non-validated pain measures such as the Neonatal Infant Pain Score (NIPS), Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), and Douleur Aigue Nouveau-né Scale (DAN), when compared to positioning, held by mother, placebo, pacifier use, no intervention or oral sucrose, or both. However no statistical difference was found in heart rate change when compared to formula feeding or high concentrations of glucose (30%). Breastfeeding was not found to be advantageous in duration of crying when compared to formula feeding, and there was no statistical difference when compared to skin-to-skin contact. No difference was found in other physiological parameters such as oxygen saturation change and blood pressure changes when comparing breastfeeding with pacifier use or oral sucrose. In terms of pain scores, there was no statistically significant difference in NIPS when compared to sucrose, in PIPP scores when compared to no treatment, in NFCS scores when compared to formula feeding and in DAN scores when compared to sucrose/glucose. One study developed a pain Composite score, and breastfeeding was found to be effective in reducing this score.</P>
<P>Supplemental breast milk yielded variable results. No statistical difference was found in changes in heart rate when compared to placebo, no treatment, 10% glucose, artificial sweetener and glycine. Higher concentrations of glucose (25% sucrose and 30% glucose) were associated with a reduction in heart rate when compared to breast milk. No statistical difference was found in terms of oxygen saturation change when compared to placebo. No statistical difference was found between breast milk and placebo or glycine in terms of percentage of time crying, while artificial sweetener reduced it. Breast milk reduced duration of crying when compared to placebo and massage, however there was no statistical difference when compared to two doses of placebo, 10% glucose and 30% glucose, or artificial sweetener. Sucrose (in any concentration, i.e. 12.5%, 20%, 25%) was found to reduce the duration of cry when compared to breast milk, as did glycine, pacifier use, rocking, and no intervention. Breast milk was found not to have an effect in duration of first cry; it was either non-statistically significant or favoured the control (in 20% sucrose and pacifier use). Breast milk was found not to be effective in reducing validated and non-validated pain scores such as NIPS, NFCS, and DAN; only being significantly better when compared to placebo (water) or massage. Sucrose, use of pacifier and rocking of the infant were shown to reduce the scores significantly when compared to breast milk. Body pain score was reported in one study and there was no statistically significant difference between breast milk and placebo, artificial sweetener or glycine.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-09-29 15:00:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All studies evaluated in this review assessed the effects of breastfeeding or supplemental breast milk on single painful procedure only. Based on the available results of these studies we can conclude that neonates undergoing single painful procedure should be provided breastfeeding for analgesia when possible, compared to positioning/pacifier/holding and swaddling. If it is not available or feasible to give breastfeeding, alternatives such as glucose or sucrose should be considered. It appears that none of these agents completely eliminate the pain. On the other hand, the efficacy of supplemental breast milk on physiological or pain scores was not convincing. However, provision of breastfeeding or supplemental breast milk for painful procedures may further encourage mothers to breastfeed their infants, facilitate bonding, and provide psychological advantage for the mother in terms of her involvement in the care of her infant without any additional cost to the health care system.</P>
<P>The results of these studies are applicable to a large population, i.e. term infants requiring heel lance or venepuncture in their first days of life. Currently, in many countries around the world, all neonates are subjected to heel lance in the first week of life for metabolic screening, and even in those countries where metabolic screening is not yet available, healthy full-term neonates frequently require heel lance for simple tests such as glucose or bilirubin testing; therefore, the results of these studies are easily applicable to hospitals with obstetric wards.</P>
<P>The majority of the studies included in this review have included healthy term neonates or stable late preterm neonates. A different population of interest who are subjected to a significantly higher number of interventions include preterm or sick full-term neonates who are subjected to repeated painful procedures during hospitalisation; for them, the ideal analgesic has not yet been identified. <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2002</LINK> evaluated effects of repeated administration of sucrose prior to painful procedures in infants &lt; 31 weeks postmenstrual age. Use of sucrose was associated with reduced scores on motor development, vigour, alertness and orientation at 36 weeks; affected motor development and vigour at 40 weeks and had higher Neuro-Biological Risk Score at two weeks postnatal age. Although unproven, breast milk may be an effective and safe alternative to sucrose, even for repeated use. Placing a small amount of solution in the oral cavity of small preterm infants was only associated with minor complications such as transient desaturation or transient choking, which did not require any intervention. As breast milk is the most natural/physiological substance available for oral stimulation, repeated exposure is not perceived to be associated with complications of oral aversion or repeated tongue thrusting. However, this needs to be studied. Though the reasons for the effectiveness of breastfeeding over simple measures such as positioning or no intervention are unclear, it is perceived to be due to psychological or chemical properties of breast milk, or both.</P>
<P>Several methodological challenges were apparent during this review. First, assessment of pain varied between studies. This has been a problem encountered in a previous review of sucrose for procedural pain in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2010</LINK>). Behavioural and physiological parameters of pain or validated pain measures, or both were used to assess pain at random in various studies. Standardisation of utilising only validated pain scales should be the framework of further research. Future studies of adequate sample size should only include validated measures of pain as outcomes. Second, all studies explored effects of breastfeeding or breast milk following a single painful procedure. Future studies should include preterm or term neonates who require repeated painful stimuli to assess side effects of repeated oral administration of breast milk. Additionally, it should also measure the future success of breastfeeding as an outcome, as repeated conditioning may prime infants to refuse breastfeeding at a later stage. This is an important consideration, particularly for preterm neonates. Only one study that evaluated maternal perception regarding sucking after single venepuncture while breastfeeding found no changes; however, the effect of repeated exposure has not been studied. Finally, it must be recognised that there was marked heterogeneity between studies in terms of control intervention, amount/time of prior exposure to breastfeeding or breast milk, and the time interval between this exposure and the type of painful procedure.</P>

<P>Quality of evidence in these studies is high, given that we have only included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled studies. However, the majority of studies lost points on "other bias", as for many studies we were not able to find the protocol with the completed study. Additionally, due to inherent limitations, masking is not possible for the breastfeeding group. Some investigators have utilised independent assessors to score pain scales from video recordings; however, this may not be always feasible.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-09-29 15:01:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are multiple studies in the literature that have studied the effect of sucrose as a means to provide procedural pain relief in newborns. The Cochrane review of sucrose (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2010</LINK>) included 44 studies and they concluded that sucrose is also a safe and effective way of significantly reducing pain from a single painful procedure in newborns. Other studies have shown the benefits of other methods for procedural pain in newborns. In a meta-analysis <LINK REF="REF-Warnock-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnock 2010</LINK> reported that maternal kangaroo care significantly reduced pain from a single pain procedure in term infants and stable preterm infants (of more than 26 weeks of gestational age). Therefore, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions available for procedural pain in neonates have increased significantly. It is important that non-pharmacological measures are given first preference, especially when there is a need for repeated analgesia.</P>
