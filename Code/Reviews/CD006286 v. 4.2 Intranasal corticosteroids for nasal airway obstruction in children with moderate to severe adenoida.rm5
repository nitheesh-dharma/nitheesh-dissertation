<P>Adenoidal hypertrophy is generally considered a common condition of childhood and represents one of the most frequent indications for surgery in children. In less severe cases, non-surgical interventions may be considered, however few medical alternatives are currently available. This review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of intranasal corticosteroids for improving nasal airway obstruction in children aged 0 to 12 years with moderate to severe adenoidal hypertrophy. Evidence derived from five of the six randomised controlled trials included in this review suggests that intranasal steroids may significantly improve symptoms of nasal obstruction in children with adenoidal hypertrophy and that this improvement may be associated with the reduction of adenoid size. One study did not find a significant improvement in nasal obstruction symptoms. Further large and high-quality randomised controlled trials are warranted.</P>

<P>Six randomised trials involving a total of 394 patients were included. Five of the six trials demonstrated a significant efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids in improving nasal obstruction symptoms and in reducing adenoid size.</P>
<P>The first eight-week cross-over study showed that treatment with beclomethasone (336 mcg/day) yielded a greater improvement in mean symptom scores than placebo (-18.5 versus -8.5, P &lt; 0.05) and a larger reduction in mean adenoid/choana ratio than placebo (right, -14% versus +0.4%, P = 0.002; left, -15% versus -2.0%, P = 0.0006) between week 0 and week 4. The second four-week cross-over study showed that the Nasal Obstruction Index decreased by at least 50% from baseline in 38% of patients treated with beclomethasone (400 mcg/day) between week 0 and week 2, whereas none of the patients treated with placebo had such improvement (P &lt; 0.01). The third parallel-group trial showed that 77.7% of patients treated with mometasone (100 mcg/day) for 40 days demonstrated an improvement in nasal obstruction symptoms and a decrease in adenoid size, such that adenoidectomy could be avoided, whereas no significant improvement was observed in the placebo group. The fourth parallel-group trial showed that eight weeks of treatment with flunisolide (500 mcg/day) was associated with a larger reduction in adenoid size than isotonic saline solution (P &lt; 0.05). The fifth parallel-group trial demonstrated that eight weeks of treatment with fluticasone (400 mcg/day) significantly reduced nasal obstruction symptoms and adenoid size, and adenoidectomy was avoided in 76% of these patients compared with 20% of the patients treated with normal saline (P &lt; 0.05).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-09-06 12:51:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 3, 2008.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-09-06 12:51:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The pharyngeal tonsils (adenoids) are a lobulated mass of lymphoid tissue located on the upper and posterior walls of the nasopharynx. This lymphoid structure is capable of considerable hypertrophy (enlargement) under adverse conditions such as chronic and recurrent infection of the upper respiratory tract or allergies (or both) (<LINK REF="REF-Brodsky-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodsky 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Javadyan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Javadyan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raphael-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raphael 1987</LINK>). There are few prevalence or incidence data available, but adenoidal hypertrophy is generally considered a common condition of childhood and represents one of the most frequent indications for surgery in children (<LINK REF="REF-Rutkow-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutkow 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Enlarged adenoids can obstruct the nasopharyngeal airway, particularly at night when the patient is supine. Classically, the symptoms and physical signs considered indicative of adenoidal nasal airway obstruction in children are mouth breathing, hyponasal voice and nocturnal snoring (<LINK REF="REF-Kenna-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenna 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paradise-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paradise 1998</LINK>). In more severe cases obstructive sleep apnoea may occur, potentially causing neurocognitive disturbance, growth failure and cor pulmonale (<LINK REF="STD-Brouillette-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Brouillette 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gozal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gozal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guilleminault-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guilleminault 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Menashe-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menashe 1965</LINK>). Enlarged adenoids may also obstruct the Eustachian tube orifice resulting in a conductive hearing loss. The presence of fluid in the middle ear (otitis media with effusion) is frequently associated with adenoidal hypertrophy and suggests Eustachian tube dysfunction or chronic adenoidal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Grimmer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimmer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kenna-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenna 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A diagnosis of adenoidal hypertrophy should be considered when a child presents with signs or symptoms of nasal airway obstruction. The validity of standardised clinical assessment of adenoidal obstruction of the nasopharynx has been confirmed by a well-designed prospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Paradise-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paradise 1998</LINK>). The degree of a patient's mouth breathing and speech hyponasality were rated by one of eight study-team nurse practitioners on a four-point scale (none = 1; mild = 2; moderate = 3; marked = 4). The two ratings were averaged to obtain a Nasal Obstruction Index (NOI) from 1 to 4. This study demonstrated a high inter-observer agreement for mouth breathing and speech hyponasality (weighted k = 0.84 to 0.91). The overall correlation between NOI and radiological assessment ratings was moderate, however a high correlation was found in children with NOI values at the lower and upper extremes (i.e. 1.0 and 3.5 respectively). Another instrument for the clinical measurement of nasal obstruction symptoms associated with adenoidal hypertrophy is a parent-administered symptom questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>). This encompasses assessment of a child's nasal congestion, nasal voice, snoring, daytime drowsiness, sleep quality, nasal discharge, ear popping or pain, and bad breath. The degree of each symptom was scored from 0 (never) to 10 (constant) using a visual analogue scale.</P>
<P>As nasal obstruction may be caused by other conditions, such as rhinitis, nasal polyps or septal deviation, complementary examinations are needed for a definitive diagnosis of adenoidal hypertrophy. The lateral neck radiograph remains a widely employed investigation in some countries for children with suspected adenoidal hypertrophy. The low cost, widespread availability, non-invasive nature and good correlation with symptoms and fibreoptic nasopharyngeal endoscopic findings are the main advantages of this diagnostic test (<LINK REF="REF-Mary-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mary 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Modrzynski-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modrzynski 2005</LINK>). The following radiological assessment methods have been reported to measure the adenoidal size in children:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Cohen and Konak's method (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1985</LINK>): the ratio between the soft plate thickness (1 cm below the hard palate or 1/2 cm in children under three years old) and the air column width between the palate and the highest point of convexity of the adenoidal shadow;</LI>
<LI>Fujioka's method (<LINK REF="REF-Fujioka-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujioka 1979</LINK>): the ratio between the maximal thickness of the adenoidal shadow and the distance measured along a line from the superior/posterior edge of the hard palate to spheno-occipital synchondrosis on the skull base;</LI>
<LI>Johanneson's method (<LINK REF="REF-Johanneson-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johanneson 1968</LINK>): the distance between the perpendicular line from the pharyngeal tubercle on the skull base and the adenoidal shadow convexity.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Of these methods, Cohen and Konak's shows the best correlation with endoscopic findings and clinical symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Modrzynski-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modrzynski 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wormald-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 1992</LINK>). This method accounts for the relationship between nasopharyngeal and adenoidal size and it is known that it is not the absolute adenoidal size but its ratio to the dimensions of the whole nasopharyngeal cavity which seems crucial in the clinical manifestation of adenoidal hypertrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another method for the assessment of adenoidal size is trans-oral mirror visualisation. A high correlation between mirror examination and fibreoptic nasopharyngeal endoscopy has been demonstrated by a recent prospective and blinded study, however the degree of choanal obstruction may be underestimated by this diagnostic test (<LINK REF="REF-Chisholm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chisholm 2005</LINK>). Fibreoptic nasopharyngeal endoscopy is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and evaluation of adenoidal hypertrophy. This diagnostic method allows direct visualisation of the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx providing a dynamic evaluation of the magnitude of nasal airway obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1992</LINK>). The diagnostic accuracy of fibreoptic nasopharyngeal endoscopy may be of fundamental importance in establishing suitable indications for adenoidectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Neri-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neri 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1992</LINK>), however the requirement of costly equipment and the need for child co-operation limit this diagnostic approach.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-08-25 09:10:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The management of adenoidal hypertrophy in children is dependent on the degree of nasal airway obstruction and any associated morbidity. When obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) or cardio-respiratory syndrome occurs, adenoidal and tonsillar hypertrophy are usually implicated and adenoidectomy is generally indicated. However, the effects of surgical intervention in children with OSA attributable to adenoidal hypertrophy have not yet been sufficiently investigated by randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2009</LINK>). Other potential indications for adenoidectomy include chronic sinusitis and otitis media with effusion (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paradise-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paradise 1995</LINK>). The risk-benefit ratio of surgical intervention for the individual child needs to be carefully assessed in the light of potential anaesthetic complications (cardiac arrhythmia, malignant hyperthermia, vocal cord trauma and aspiration) and postoperative complications (haemorrhage, airway obstruction secondary to oedema, prolonged muscular paralysis and palato-pharyngeal insufficiency). In less severe cases, non-surgical interventions may be considered, however few medical alternatives are currently available. Commonly medical management is limited to the treatment of concurrent infections and the complications of adenoidal enlargement (<LINK REF="REF-Sclafani-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sclafani 1998</LINK>). The effects of intranasal corticosteroids in children with adenoidal hypertrophy have been assessed by randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Criscuoli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Criscuoli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-08-24 13:02:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mechanism by which intranasal corticosteroids reduce nasal airway obstructive symptoms is unclear, however the following mechanisms have been suggested (<LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>):</P>
<OL>
<LI>direct reduction of adenoidal size by lympholytic action of steroids on adenoidal tissues;</LI>
<LI>reduction in adenoidal and nasopharyngeal inflammation by anti-inflammatory effects of steroids; and</LI>
<LI>reduction in the significance of the adenoids as a reservoir for infection.</LI>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-08-24 13:02:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the uncertainty of the precise mechanism, establishing a therapeutic role for intranasal corticosteroids in children with adenoidal hypertrophy may have significant clinical implications. This modality may provide an effective non-surgical alternative treatment for children with adenoidal hypertrophy. The use of intranasal corticosteroids has been generally considered safe in the paediatric population, despite uncommon reports of some local and systemic adverse events, including epistaxis, nasal mucosal irritation, septal perforation, moderate adrenal suppression and growth retardation (<LINK REF="REF-Adamopoulos-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamopoulos 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gazis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gazis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LaForce-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaForce 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skoner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoner 2000</LINK>).

<P>Given the significant heterogeneity of outcome measures across the included trials, we planned to convert the result of each individual study into a standard measure by calculating a standardised mean difference (SMD) which is the difference of the means of both treatment arms divided by the pooled standard deviation. For a cross-over study without a wash-out period, we planned to include in the analysis only the data from the first treatment period. Unfortunately, after contacting the corresponding authors, we were only able to obtain original data from the study by Lepcha et al (<LINK REF="STD-Lepcha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lepcha 2002</LINK>). This precluded performing a formal meta-analysis, and data were therefore summarised in a narrative format.</P>
<P>If in the future data become available that are suitable for meta-analysis, we will proceed as follows. Data analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis. The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group statistical guidelines and plan for assessment of heterogeneity will be followed. We will perform pooling of data if the data extracted from the included trials are comparable and of sufficient quality. We will calculate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all dichotomous data. For continuous data, we will calculate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) or standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

A visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (never has the symptom) to 10 (constantly has the symptom) was used by <LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK> to measure patients' nasal obstruction symptoms (nasal congestion, nasal voice, snoring, daytime drowsiness, restless sleep, nasal discharge, ear popping/pain and bad breath). The total symptom score varied from 0 to 80. In the <LINK REF="STD-Criscuoli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Criscuoli 2003</LINK> trial a Nasal Obstruction Index with a four-point scale was used to assess nasal obstruction symptoms (1 = absent, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = marked). In the <LINK REF="STD-Lepcha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lepcha 2002</LINK> trial nasal obstruction, snoring and nasal discharge were scored as follows: 0 = none at all, 1 = occasional during colds, 2 = frequent, 3 = constant. <LINK REF="STD-Berlucchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berlucchi 2007</LINK> used a clinical scoring system ranging from 0 to 3 (0 = absent; 1 = occasional; 2 = frequent; 3 = daytime and night-time symptoms) to assess the degree of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, cough, snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea. In the <LINK REF="STD-Demirhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Demirhan 2010</LINK> trial nasal congestion, mouth breathing, snoring, nasal speech and apnoea were scored as: 0 = none, 1 = sometimes, 2 = often, 3 = day-long, whereas cough was scored as: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe.</P>
<P>Adenoid size was an outcome measure in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Berlucchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berlucchi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demirhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Demirhan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lepcha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lepcha 2002</LINK>). In the Demain, Ciprandi, Berlucchi and Demirhan trials adenoid size was assessed using photographic images taken during fibreoptic nasopharyngeal endoscopic examination. The degree of adenoid obstruction was estimated as the ratio of the two-dimensional area of the adenoid relative to the area of the posterior choana (<LINK REF="STD-Berlucchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berlucchi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demirhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Demirhan 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Demirhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Demirhan 2010</LINK> classified adenoid obstruction into four degrees: 1) first degree: the adenoid tissue occupied only the upper segment in the nasopharyngeal cavity (&lt; 25%) and choanal openings were free, 2) second degree: the adenoid tissue was confined to the upper half (&lt; 50%) of the nasopharyngeal cavity, 3) third degree: the adenoid tissue extended over the nasopharynx (&lt; 75%) with obstruction of the choanal openings and partial closure of Eustachian tube orifice, 4) fourth degree: the obstruction was almost total and both the Eustachian tube orifice and the lower choanal border could not be observed. In the <LINK REF="STD-Lepcha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lepcha 2002</LINK> trial adenoid size was measured by neck X-ray and by fibreoptic nasopharyngeal endoscopy. For radiological assessment the narrowest distance between the nasopharyngeal soft tissues and the soft palate was measured and scored as 1) &gt; 6 mm, 2) 4 to 6 mm and 3) 0 to 3 mm. For endoscopic examination, the distance from the adenoid tissues to the vomer was measured and scored as 1) &gt; 1 cm, 2) 0.5 to 1 cm and 3) &lt; 0.5 cm.</P>

<P>In the eight-week cross-over study with 17 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>), improvement in mean symptom scores was significantly larger in the beclomethasone group than that in the placebo group during the first four-week period (-18.5 versus -8.5, P &lt; 0.05). The improvement in the beclomethasone group represented approximately a 45% reduction in the initial mean symptom scores. Over the full eight-week cross-over study the mean (± SD) obstruction score after beclomethasone treatment (20.5 ± 3.0) was significantly improved compared to baseline (43.1 ± 2.9) and placebo scores (31.1 ± 4.2) (P &lt; 0.05).

Among the patients who had responded to the initial two-week steroid therapy, an additional 24-week treatment with beclomethasone at a lower dosage was associated with a significant 51- and 100-week improvement in nasal obstruction symptoms and with a reduction in the need for adenoidectomy compared with patients who had not responded after the initial two-week steroid therapy (relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.98).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Demirhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Demirhan 2010 </LINK>eight weeks of treatment with fluticasone yielded a significantly greater reduction in each of the six measured symptom scores (nasal congestion, mouth breathing, nasal speech, snoring, apnoea and cough) compared with normal saline. At the end of eight weeks the average total symptom score decreased from 13.72 to 2.96 in the fluticasone group, while the normal saline group score changed from 14.85 to 14.65.

During an eight-week cross-over study (n = 17) stinging was reported by six patients while taking beclomethasone and one patient while receiving placebo (P = 0.06); epistaxis was recorded by two patients on beclomethasone and one in the placebo group (P = 1.00); and sneezing was reported by one subject while receiving beclomethasone compared to four receiving placebo (P = 0.25). The <LINK REF="STD-Lepcha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lepcha 2002</LINK> study reported that there was no untoward effect of the nasal spray and parents did not complain of nasal bleeding, stinging or allergies in either beclomethasone (n = 13) or placebo group (n = 13). In <LINK REF="STD-Berlucchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berlucchi 2007</LINK> only one patient in the steroid group (n = 30) reported episodic epistaxis. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 2007</LINK> in either the flunisolide (n = 139) or normal saline group (n = 39).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-08-24 14:14:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Among the six trials included in this review, five showed significant benefits of intranasal corticosteroids in improving nasal obstruction symptoms and in reducing adenoid size (<LINK REF="STD-Berlucchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berlucchi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ciprandi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ciprandi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Criscuoli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Criscuoli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demirhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Demirhan 2010</LINK>). In contrast, another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lepcha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lepcha 2002</LINK>) did not find significant efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids in improving nasal blockage, nasal discharge or snoring, although a five-fold reduction in adenoid size was observed in the nasal corticosteroid group compared with the placebo group. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Low statistical power due to a small sample size may have contributed to this negative result. Unfortunately meta-analysis was not applicable in this review, so we could not pool the data derived from these five trials to estimate the overall effect size.</P>
<P>The mechanism by which topical steroids would improve nasal airway obstructive symptoms remains unclear. Three trials demonstrated that intranasal corticosteroids could improve nasal obstruction symptoms as well as reduce adenoid size (<LINK REF="STD-Berlucchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berlucchi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demirhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Demirhan 2010</LINK>). Moreover, a good correlation between nasal symptom score and adenoid/choana ratio was found (<LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>). These data suggest that the improvement in nasal obstruction symptoms may be associated with the effect of intranasal corticosteroids of reducing adenoid size.</P>
<P>None of the six included trials specifically addressed the question of minimum adequate intranasal corticosteroid dosage in children with adenoidal hypertrophy. Among the three trials using intranasal beclomethasone, the two that showed significant benefits in improving nasal obstruction symptoms or in reducing adenoid size (or both) after the two-week treatment used initial daily doses of 336 and 400 mcg respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Criscuoli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Criscuoli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>). These benefits were maintained during the subsequent maintenance treatment with beclomethasone at lower doses (168 to 200 mcg/day). In contrast, beclomethasone was administered at a lower dosage (200 mcg/day) in <LINK REF="STD-Lepcha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lepcha 2002</LINK> and no significant benefits were observed during the eight-week treatment. These results suggest that a moderate initial dose of intranasal beclomethasone may be needed for treatment of children with adenoidal hypertrophy, although a low dose may be effective for maintenance therapy. However, there is still a need to establish the adequate dosage through further randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>The duration of treatment with intranasal corticosteroids in the six trials varied from eight to 24 weeks. None of the trials investigated the relationship between the effect size of intranasal corticosteroids and the duration of treatment. More studies are needed to establish the optimal duration of treatment with intranasal corticosteroids in children with adenoidal hypertrophy. The benefits may be expected shortly after initiation of treatment as one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Criscuoli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Criscuoli 2003</LINK>) showed that 45% of patients treated with beclomethasone had a significant improvement in nasal obstruction after a two-week treatment. In spite of the short-term effect of intranasal corticosteroids demonstrated by four trials, the long-term outcome in patients who respond to the therapy remains unclear. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Criscuoli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Criscuoli 2003</LINK>) had a relatively long-term follow-up period (100 weeks). Among 24 patients who had responded to the initial two-week therapy with beclomethasone and received an additional 24-week treatment at a lower steroid dosage, 13 (54%) patients still needed adenotonsillectomy at the 100-week follow-up. This means that nasal obstruction symptoms reappeared or worsened in more than half of patients two years after the clinical improvement obtained by a 26-week treatment with intranasal corticosteroids. These results suggest that, in a considerable proportion of patients with adenoidal hypertrophy, the effect of intranasal corticosteroids may only be maintained for a relatively short period of time. Further studies are needed to define the long-term outcome in patients who initially respond to the steroid therapy.</P>
<P>Intranasal corticosteroids have been generally well-tolerated and cause only mild side effects, even in the paediatric population (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Sayyad-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Sayyad 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taramarcaz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taramarcaz 2003</LINK>). In this review, adverse events associated with intranasal corticosteroids were observed in three of the included trials. Epistaxis was reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Berlucchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berlucchi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>) and stinging and sneezing in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>). The occurrence of these events was infrequent and none of the withdrawals were associated with adverse events. However, a relatively small number of patients included in this review does not permit any conclusion regarding a side effect profile of intranasal corticosteroids, especially potential adverse systemic effects such as adrenal suppression and growth retardation. The safety of long-term use of intranasal corticosteroids in the paediatric population still needs to be addressed by further prospective studies.</P>
<P>Numerous methodological flaws could be observed in the included studies and they may weaken the strength of evidence provided in this review. In none of the six studies was the method of randomisation explicitly described, sample size calculated or analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle. Allocation concealment was clear in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Demain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Demain 1995</LINK>). Moreover, the reporting of the results was generally not standardised and this made it impossible to extract sufficient data from the individual trials regarding the effect size of the interventions and their precision, so as to enable meta-analysis.</P>

<P> Current evidence suggests that intranasal corticosteroids may significantly improve nasal obstruction symptoms in children with moderate to severe adenoidal hypertrophy and that this improvement may be associated with a reduction in adenoid size. Given the potential clinically relevant benefits and relatively good tolerability of intranasal corticosteroids, these drugs may be indicated as an alternative treatment for children with moderate to severe adenoidal hypertrophy when adenoidectomy is not urgently required or not available. However, more robust evidence is needed to make a formal recommendation to use intranasal corticosteroids as an effective treatment in children with adenoidal hypertrophy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-08-24 13:31:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further large, high-quality randomised controlled trials are still needed to confirm the results of the six randomised trials included in this review. The reporting of future trials should follow the recommendations of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, which would facilitate any future meta-analyses. For a cross-over design, an appropriate wash-out period between intervention and placebo is needed. The optimal duration of treatment, minimum adequate intranasal corticosteroid dosage and risk of adverse events, including adrenal suppression and growth retardation, also need to be explored in future studies. The follow-up period should be sufficient to assess the long-term outcome of patients who respond to treatment with intranasal corticosteroids.</P>
