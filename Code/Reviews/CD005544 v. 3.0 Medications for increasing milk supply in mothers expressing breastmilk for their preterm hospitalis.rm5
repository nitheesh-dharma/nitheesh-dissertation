<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-07 17:35:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breastmilk remains the optimal form of enteral nutrition for term and preterm infants until up to six months postnatal age. Mothers of premature and sick infants are separated from their infants while they are receiving hospital-based care. These mothers often have difficulty supporting lactation, when milk production is solely maintained by breast expression.</P>
<P>In preterm infants, expressed breastmilk (EBM) given by a nasogastric tube, until sucking can be established, has been shown to reduce a bowel disease called necrotising enterocolitis where parts of the bowel become injured or dies. Further evidence suggests that EBM might improve feeding tolerance and may reduce infection.</P>
<P>Trials of medications used to improve the breastmilk supply in mothers who have insufficient milk for their hospitalised preterm infants' needs have been reported in two randomised controlled studies involving 59 mothers. These two studies gave the women domperidone 10 mg three times a day when mothers had insufficient EBM, two to three weeks after delivery. These studies showed a modest improvement in EBM volume over the following one to two weeks. No side effects to mothers or infants were noted in these studies.</P>
<P>These medications should only be considered in mothers who have received full lactation support and are more than 14 days post delivery but have insufficient EBM for their infants' needs.</P>

<P>Breastmilk remains the optimal form of enteral nutrition for term and preterm infants until up to six months postnatal age. Mothers of preterm infants who have not established suck feeds must express their breastmilk and often have difficulty in maintaining sufficient volume for their infants' needs (<A HREF="Donath 2008">Donath 2008</A>). In preterm infants, donor breastmilk reduced the occurrence of necrotising enterocolitis, when compared with formula feeds (<A HREF="McGuire 2003">McGuire 2003</A>).

Both trials gave the same dose of domperidone (10 mg three times per day) with a duration of seven days in the smaller trial and 14 days in the larger.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-17 13:17:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two studies with a total of 59 mothers suggest modest improvements in short-term EBM volumes when a medication is used after insufficient EBM occurs in mothers following preterm delivery. In both studies, the medication was commenced &#8807;14 days post delivery and following insufficient EBM supply with other lactation supports.</P>
<P>Currently, no studies support prophylactic use of a galactagogue medication at any gestation. Use of any galactagogue medication has only been examined at more than 14 days post delivery and after full lactation support has been given. Further trials should examine larger groups of preterm mothers and consider breastfeeding outcomes over a longer period.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-17 13:17:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breastmilk remains the optimal exclusive form of nutrition for term and preterm infants until up to six months postnatal age and extensive evidence from multiple sources including the World Health Organization have outlined short- and longer-term benefits from breastmilk feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Dyson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Amongst randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in preterm infants, donor breastmilk reduced the occurrence of necrotising enterocolitis, when compared with formula feeds (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 2003</LINK>). Also, data from case-control studies have suggested that breastmilk is associated with a reduction in feed intolerance (in preterm infants defined as excess gastric residual milk or vomiting <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2008</LINK>), a reduction in significant gastrointestinal infective events (<LINK REF="REF-Beeby-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beeby 1992</LINK>) and a reduction in late-onset sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Schanler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schanler 1999</LINK>) when compared with formula feeds in hospitalised infants.</P>
<P>Infants who are born preterm, or are otherwise ill, are dependent on expressed breastmilk (EBM) for a substantial period of their hospitalisation. A high proportion of mothers have been reported to initiate lactation, and despite recommendations from health professionals and available support, a significant proportion of these mothers cease breastfeeding over the initial postnatal months (<LINK REF="REF-ABS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ABS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donath 2008</LINK>). A variety of significant socio-economic, medical, cultural and health service factors are reported to have an influence on observed breastfeeding rates (<LINK REF="REF-McCarter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1999</LINK>). In particular, mothers of premature and sick infants are separated from their infants while their infants are receiving hospital-based care. These mothers often have difficulty supporting lactation, when milk production is solely maintained by breast expression (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1999</LINK>). Population cross-sectional reports suggest that the exclusive and partial breastfeeding rates for preterm infants are lower than in term infants at discharge from their birth hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Donath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donath 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-QPDC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">QPDC 2000</LINK>). The most common reason cited by mothers for their cessation of breastfeeding has been a perceived or apparent 'insufficient milk supply' (<LINK REF="REF-ABS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ABS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brodribb-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodribb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simic-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simic 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Multiple interventions have been assessed in attempts to improve breastmilk supply in mothers whose lactation has been insufficient to meet their infant's needs. Interventions reported to increase breastmilk supply have included hand and mechanical breast expression, enhanced maternal support, galactagogue medications and complementary medicines (<LINK REF="REF-Brodribb-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodribb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riordan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riordan 1999</LINK>). Galactogogue medications have included medications thought to improve breastmilk supply by increasing milk production or milk release from the breast during expression or suckling.</P>
<P>This review will focus on randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials that have assessed the use of medications for improving breastmilk supply in mothers of hospitalised preterm infants. These mothers have received advice on supportive measures (in a hospital setting) including maternal health, expression frequency and technique to assist their breastmilk expression. Only those mothers where these supportive measures did not result in expressed milk that was sufficient to meet their infant's enteral requirements were considered for a trial of medication.</P>
<P>It is not clear from the literature over what minimum period a preterm infant must receive exclusive breastmilk feeds to obtain the well documented improvements in their outcome. Non randomised observational studies in preterm infants that have reported improved outcomes for late onset sepsis and feeding tolerance have generally compared infants who were exclusively breastmilk fed for most of their hospital stay with those receiving infant formula (<LINK REF="REF-Beeby-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beeby 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hylander-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hylander 1998</LINK>). The shortest randomised trials of exclusive EBM versus formula feeding that showed improved preterm outcomes used donor breastmilk for four weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1992</LINK>). We have included all randomised trials of galactagogue interventions that were given to mothers of preterm infants for at least seven days as shorter periods are unlikely to provide clinically significant differences in preterm outcome. Trials of galactagogue medications that were initiated before one week post delivery were excluded as this was judged to be prophylactic rather than rescue treatment for established EBM supply failure and this use of galactagogues is to be the subject of a separate review.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).

If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we planned to use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary when an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials.

<P>We identified two RCTs which assessed the effect of medications on expressed breastmilk volumes. The trial by Silva included 14 mother-infant pairs (<LINK REF="STD-Silva-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2001</LINK>). The infants were preterm with a mean gestational age of 29.1 weeks and the mothers had insufficient milk supply to meet their infants' daily enteral feeding requirements.

<LINK REF="STD-Silva-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2001</LINK> used a random numbers table for allocation. Despite this blind randomisation, mothers in the placebo arm had much lower baseline EBM volumes, with placebo 48.2 ± 63.3 mL and the domperidone arm 112.8 ± 128.7 mL. The authors in <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2001</LINK> also noted that randomisation resulted in three mothers of multiple pregnancies (two triplet and one twin pregnancy) receiving domperidone with only one mother of a multiple pregnancy receiving placebo.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The meta-analysis of the two included studies of domperidone suggest a moderate benefit in daily EBM volume (mean difference (MD): 99.49 mL/day, 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.94 to 200.92; random-effects, T² 3511.62, I² 63%) when mothers with insufficient EBM were given domperidone (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). This result was derived from only 59 mothers and there was high heterogeneity between the trials with wide variance in the standard deviation of the response suggesting large differences in individual responses. Because of this heterogeneity, we used a random-effects analysis which yielded a P value for overall effect of 0.05. Limited subgroup analysis failed to further explain this effect. Both studies used a medication intervention and compared this with placebo with all mothers otherwise receiving full lactation support. <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2001</LINK> found a significant increase in the mean volume of expressed breastmilk per day in their report. However, when the two mothers with no EBM data from day five were excluded and the results were re-analysed using change in EBM from baseline to day seven rather than from day two to day seven as reported, the results were not significant in this study for domperidone (MD: 57.12 mL 95% CI -3.66 to 117.90, <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> ). In the second study examining domperidone by <LINK REF="STD-Campbell_x002d_Yeo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell-Yeo 2010</LINK>, there was a significant improvement in the mean volume of EBM over the 14 days of the trial, in the domperidone arm compared with the placebo arm (MD: 162.7 mL, 95% CI 52.5 to 272.9, <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Sensitivity analysis because of the 30% post randomisation loss in the <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2001</LINK> trial suggested that the overall outcome of intervention with domperidone would not be substantially changed if mean EBM values were substituted for missing EBM values or if the trial was excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The secondary outcomes of the duration of partial or exclusive breastfeeding were reported for the two domperidone studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Campbell_x002d_Yeo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell-Yeo 2010</LINK>, the partial or exclusive breastfeeding rate at discharge was reported as 54.6% (12 of 22) in the domperidone group and 52.2% (12 of 23) in the placebo group. The authors acknowledged high rates of domperidone use after the 14-day intervention trial with subsequent domperidone exposure for 63.6% of the intervention arm and 41.7% of the placebo arm. Because of this confounding, the breastfeeding rates at discharge have been presented in this review as text only. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2001</LINK>, it was reported that the proportion of infants discharged home "who were breastfeeding" did not differ between the intervention and placebo groups but no quantitative results were given.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-01-17 13:17:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite strong evidence supporting the feeding of preterm infants with their mother's breastmilk, there remain a limited number of postnatal interventions currently proven to increase expressed milk supply in these mothers. For mothers where lactation support, relaxation techniques and advice on mechanical expression have not produced sufficient breastmilk to meet their preterm infant's requirements, only one medication has undergone short-term trials of up to 14 days, domperidone (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell_x002d_Yeo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell-Yeo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>As many infants born at &#8804; 32 weeks' gestation spend three weeks or longer feeding on predominantly expressed breastmilk, it remains important to measure outcomes over a longer period to best assess any of these interventions. When a medication is given to support breastfeeding, it is often used over a period of greater than seven days before weaning. None of the currently reported trials of medications to increase breastmilk supply have examined the effects on expressed milk volume for more than 14 days of treatment.</P>
<P>The timing of introduction of a medication to further support expressed breastmilk production remains controversial. The two included studies commenced at 31.9 ± 10.5 days (<LINK REF="STD-Silva-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2001</LINK>) and at more than 21 days (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell_x002d_Yeo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell-Yeo 2010</LINK>) following preterm delivery. Although it is necessary to establish other lactation supports for these mothers before beginning any medication intervention, it is also important to establish as early as possible sufficient expressed breastmilk for the grading up of a preterm infant's enteral intake which is usually established well before 21 days post delivery.</P>
<P>Two excluded studies examined 'prophylactic' metoclopramide starting before 96 hours post delivery, both showed no significant improvement in outcome. In the excluded study by <LINK REF="STD-Hansen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hansen 2005</LINK>, mothers delivering before 34 weeks were randomised to receive metoclopramide or placebo at less than four days after delivery. No significant change in expressed breastmilk volume or reported breastfeeding duration was found. The other excluded study of metoclopramide given on day one to term mothers post caesarean section, showed no difference in breastfeeding outcomes at 10 days, six weeks and three months after delivery (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1980</LINK>). A further excluded study compared metoclopramide against domperidone or placebo in a preterm population (<LINK REF="STD-James-2004" TYPE="STUDY">James 2004</LINK>). This study of mothers delivering before 34 weeks commenced &gt; 12 days post delivery but only measured expressed milk volume for five days. A significant improvement when compared with placebo between baseline expression and day five occurred only in the domperidone arm (119 ± 40 mL, P &lt; 0.008) but not in the metoclopramide arm (84 ± 27 mL). Outcomes beyond five days were not reported and numbers in each arm of this trial were small, increasing the chance of missing a significant effect if one were present.</P>
<P>The side effects of promoting lactation with either metoclopramide or domperidone have been reported in non controlled studies. At recommended doses, metoclopramide may produce dystonic reactions in about 1% of adults (<LINK REF="REF-Pinder-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinder 1976</LINK>) but this has yet to be reported in randomised studies. Domperidone is reported to less readily cross the blood-brain barrier and thus to have less neurologic side effects on both infants and their mothers (<LINK REF="REF-Fischer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 1998</LINK>). Future studies should include careful ascertainment of any maternal and infant side effects of medications used to increase breastmilk supply.</P>

<P>In conclusion, despite accumulating evidence of the significant advantages of breastmilk in a preterm population, relatively few controlled trials have examined the outcome of medications to increase breastmilk supply in those mothers whose expressed breastmilk (EBM) volume is insufficient. Two studies have examined rescue intervention when insufficient EBM is available more than 14 days post delivery. Two studies of domperidone together show a significant improvement on EBM expressed over a seven- to 14-day period of observation in the short-term (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell_x002d_Yeo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell-Yeo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2001</LINK>). In summary, there is evidence of a significant and clinically important improvement in EBM volume over the short-term in mothers of preterm infants who have insufficient EBM for their infant's needs with the use of domperidone, although this is based on limited data (59 mother-infant pairs).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-17 13:17:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Further research is likely to be clinically relevant in the preterm population with the current evidence supporting breastmilk feeds in this group. Future trials of medications to support preterm mothers should include larger numbers to identify any maternal or infant side effects, and with outcomes measured at discharge, or later.</P>
