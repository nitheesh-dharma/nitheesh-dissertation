<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-03-16 07:48:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>The best outcomes in childbirth for both mothers and babies are when the baby is born head-first. If the baby is in another position, there is a higher risk of complications including the need for caesarean section. In a &#8216;breech presentation&#8217; the baby is bottom-down instead of head-down. External cephalic version (ECV) is a technique for turning the unborn baby so it lies head-down. This review looked at the effects of using ECV on babies that were in the breech position at the end of pregnancy (around 36 weeks or more).</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Everyone wants to avoid complications in childbirth and many women want to avoid having a caesarean section. Avoiding the need for surgery is very important in countries with limited resources for healthcare. ECV is sometimes used before the end of pregnancy (around 34 weeks) but the results might be different when it is used just before childbirth. Also, it might not be possible to turn the unborn baby at this late stage. We wanted to know if using ECV at the end of pregnancy resulted in safer childbirth or was harmful.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We found 8 studies involving 1308 women. (We included studies up to 28 February 2015.) All the studies were randomised and involved women with low-risk pregnancies. Using ECV around 36 weeks or more increased the chance that babies were born head-first and reduced the risk of having a caesarean section. There were no clear differences in other outcomes such as the risk of babies dying. The quality of the studies and therefore the strength of the evidence was varied.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>If an unborn baby is lying bottom-down, turning it by ECV just before birth can reduce some of the problems this position can cause. These studies are too small to show if ECV is safe to use in women with low-risk pregnancies, however other types of studies suggest that it is safe. We also do not know if it should be used in high-risk cases, such as mothers who have already had a caesarean section, or who are expecting twins.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Management of breech presentation is controversial, particularly in regard to manipulation of the position of the fetus by external cephalic version (ECV). ECV may reduce the number of breech presentations and caesarean sections, but there also have been reports of complications with the procedure. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of ECV at or near term on measures of pregnancy outcome. Methods of facilitating ECV, and ECV before term are reviewed separately.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-09 12:12:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register (28 February 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.</P>

<P>Randomised trials of ECV at or near term (with or without tocolysis) compared with no attempt at ECV in women with breech presentation.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-28 09:47:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight studies, with a total of 1308 women randomised. The pooled data from these studies show a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in non-cephalic presentation at birth (average risk ratio (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.61, eight trials, 1305 women); vaginal cephalic birth not achieved (average RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.62, seven trials, 1253 women, evidence graded very low); and caesarean section (average RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.82, eight trials, 1305 women, evidence graded very low) when ECV was attempted in comparison to no ECV attempted. There were no significant differences in the incidence of Apgar score ratings below seven at one minute (average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.37, three trials, 168 infants) or five minutes (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.36, five trials, 428 infants, evidence graded very low), low umbilical vein pH levels (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.44, one trial, 52 infants, evidence graded very low), neonatal admission (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.34, four trials, 368 infants, evidence graded very low), perinatal death (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.64, eight trials, 1305 infants, evidence graded low), nor time from enrolment to delivery (mean difference -0.25 days, 95% CI -2.81 to 2.31, two trials, 256 women).</P>
<P>All of the trials included in this review had design limitations, and the level of evidence was graded low or very low. No studies attempted to blind the intervention, and the process of random allocation was suboptimal in several studies. Three of the eight trials had serious design limitations, however excluding these studies in a sensitivity analysis for outcomes with substantial heterogeneity did not alter the results.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-03-21 08:00:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Attempting cephalic version at term reduces the chance of non-cephalic presentation at birth, vaginal cephalic birth not achieved and caesarean section. There is not enough evidence from randomised trials to assess complications of ECV at term. Large observational studies suggest that complications are rare.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-25 10:25:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-25 10:25:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Approximately 3% to 4% of all pregnant women who reach full term will have a fetus in breech presentation. This may be caused by an underlying fetal or maternal abnormality, or could be an apparently chance occurrence, or related to an otherwise benign variant such as cornual placental position. In the latter instance, breech presentation places a healthy fetus and mother at increased risk of a complicated vaginal delivery or caesarean section.</P>
<P>Breech delivery, whether vaginally or by caesarean section, has a higher incidence of poor perinatal outcomes than cephalic birth. For example, the incidence of minor childhood handicap following breech presentation has been found to be high (19.4%) and similar for those delivered following trial of labour and those following an elective caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Danielian-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danielian 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of women with a breech presenting baby would prefer a vaginal birth although most would choose caesarean section if there is a medical indication (<LINK REF="REF-Gamble-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gamble 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geary-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geary 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hildingsson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hildingsson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turnbull-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turnbull 1999</LINK>). For the singleton fetus in breech presentation, caesarean section has been shown to be safer for the fetus than vaginal birth in many settings (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2005</LINK>), although a large prospective study suggested that vaginal breech delivery may be safe under certain conditions with experienced practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Goffinet-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goffinet 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risks associated with caesarean section are low, however caesarean section is not without maternal risk and in developed countries remains the largest contributing factor to the incidence of maternal mortality and morbidity following childbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Minkoff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minkoff 2003</LINK>). A Cochrane review of planned caesarean section versus planned vaginal delivery for breech pregnancy at term, reported that even though 45% of women in the planned vaginal delivery group were delivered by caesarean section, planned caesarean section was associated with an increase in maternal morbidity (risk ratio (RR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.61) (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, although the overall risk is very small, recent estimates of the incidence of mortality associated with elective caesarean section were nearly tripled compared to vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1999</LINK>). In addition to the increase in immediate morbidity following caesarean section, intra-abdominal adhesions may occur after caesarean section resulting in subsequent infertility (<LINK REF="REF-LaSala-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaSala 1987</LINK>). The presence of the uterine scar puts future pregnancies at increased risk of complications such as ectopic pregnancy, placenta previa, accreta and abruption, and uterine rupture (<LINK REF="REF-Dashe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dashe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilliam-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilliam 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lydon_x002d_Rochelle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lydon-Rochelle 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minkoff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minkoff 2003</LINK>). A further deterrent to caesarean section is that the procedure requires the expertise of an obstetrician or other health worker with surgical training, and limits the role for low-risk obstetrical care providers such as midwives and family practitioners. A review of strategies to reduce caesarean section rates identified external cephalic version (ECV) as the only clinical intervention with demonstrated Level 1 evidence for reducing primary caesarean section rates overall (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-03-25 10:25:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Considering the complications that can arise from breech delivery, it is not surprising that, over the years, the possibility of manipulating the baby from the breech to the cephalic presentation has intrigued obstetric caregivers. ECV is a procedure in which the baby is manipulated by pressure through the mother's abdominal wall into a cephalic (head-down) position.</P>
<P>ECV before term (usually before 34 weeks' gestation) came into routine obstetric practice on the basis of the self-evident immediate effectiveness of the procedure as well as reassuring results from several non-randomised trials, and in spite of the negative results of the only randomised trial reported prior to 1980 (<LINK REF="REF-Brosset-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosset 1956</LINK>). The popularity of ECV before term waned after the mid-1970s, partly because of reports of a substantial perinatal mortality associated with the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley_x002d_Watson-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley-Watson 1975</LINK>), and the increasing perception of caesarean section as a safer option than ECV or breech delivery.</P>
<P>Prior to the mid-1970s, ECV was usually attempted before term because of the belief that the procedure would seldom be successful at term. Subsequent studies showed that with the use of tocolysis (medication to relax the uterus), ECV could be achieved in a substantial proportion of women with breech presentation at term. ECV at term differs in many fundamental ways from that performed before term. These include the fact that the fetus is mature and may be delivered more readily in the event of complications, and that spontaneous versions without ECV attempt, or reversion after successful ECV, are less common at term. ECV before term is therefore evaluated as a separate procedure (<I>see</I> '<I>External cephalic version for breech presentation before term</I>' (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2006</LINK>)). The current review includes studies in which the intention was to include pregnant women at or near term (i.e. from 36 weeks' gestation).</P>
<P>External cephalic version at term has been shown to be feasible in two small uncontrolled trials in women with previous caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Flamm-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flamm 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schachter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schachter 1994</LINK>), and in two in women in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fortunato-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortunato 1988</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Muzaini-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">El-Muzaini 2008a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Muzaini-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">El-Muzaini 2008b</LINK> are abstract reports of prospective controlled studies of ECV in labour and with previous caesarean section respectively, with results in favour of ECV, but it is not clear whether these studies were randomised. To our knowledge, no randomised trials of these interventions have been reported.</P>
<P>Several authors have investigated which factors are associated with an increased chance of successful external cephalic version (<LINK REF="REF-Boucher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fortunato-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortunato 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lau-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Le-Bret-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Bret 2004</LINK>). Factors which have been found to predict failure of ECV attempt include engagement of the presenting part, difficulty in palpating the fetal head and a tense uterus on palpation (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1997</LINK>), and increased amniotic fluid volume (<LINK REF="REF-Boucher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucher 2003</LINK>). However, a prediction model based on clinical parameters was found to be insufficiently accurate to be useful in predicting the outcome of ECV attempts (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of women prefer vaginal birth over caesarean birth (<LINK REF="REF-Hildingsson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hildingsson 2002</LINK>). As ECV is the primary intervention to achieve a vaginal delivery when the baby is in breech presentation, it would seem logical that women would be highly motivated to try it. The preferences of women with breech presentation regarding their care appear to have changed over the past couple of decades, and vary by location. In an Israeli study in 1995, 54% were willing to consider ECV and 65% preferred planned caesarean section if the breech presentation persisted, compared with 24% and 97% respectively in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Yogev-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yogev 2002</LINK>). In an Australian study in 2001, 39% of women attending antenatal clinic would choose ECV if needed, and 22% were undecided (<LINK REF="REF-Raynes_x002d_Greenow-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynes-Greenow 2004</LINK>). In another Australian study, <LINK REF="REF-Nassar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nassar 2007</LINK> evaluated a decision aid for women with breech presentation at term. The decision aid was not intended to increase or decrease intervention rates, but rather aim to support informed decision-making that is consistent with personal values. Seventy-four per cent of women who were randomised to receive the decision aid expressed an intention to have ECV if needed, while 66% of women who received normal care would choose ECV. A higher proportion of women who received the additional information reported that they had enough information to make a decision (95.7%, compared with 73.6%, at first follow-up). The women who received the decision aid experienced lower decisional conflict, increased knowledge, and greater satisfaction with their decision. <LINK REF="REF-Murray_x002d_Davis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray-Davis 2012</LINK> reported that women participating in a trial comparing the timing of ECV preferred the procedure to be carried out at 34 to 36 weeks' gestation rather than after 37 weeks, as it was perceived to have physiological and practical advantages. However, their sample is likely to have over-estimated preferences for early ECV as that option was only available to trial participants.</P>
<P>Complications reported following ECV at term include fracture of the baby's femur (<LINK REF="REF-Papp-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papp 2004</LINK>), prolonged tachycardia (rapid heartbeat) of the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Nzewi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nzewi 1999</LINK>), sinusoidal baby's heart rate pattern (a fluctuating pattern sometimes indicating compromise) (<LINK REF="REF-Ferber-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferber 1999</LINK>), and fetal-maternal haemorrhage (bleeding from the baby's to the mother's circulation in the placenta) (<LINK REF="REF-Shankar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shankar 2004</LINK>). The rate of caesarean section during labour has been found to be greater following successful ECV than in spontaneous cephalic presentation: 20% versus 6.3%, RR 3.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Ben_x002d_Haroush-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ben-Haroush 2002</LINK>); 27.6% versus 12.5%, RR 2.04; 95% CI 1.43 to 2.91 (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2004b</LINK>); odds ratio 2.04 for nulliparous women, 4.30 for multiparous (<LINK REF="REF-Vezina-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vezina 2004</LINK>). This is not surprising, given that women with persistent breech presentation in the first instance are a high-risk group. Cord blood gases at delivery were no different (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2004c</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, series of cases have reported very low complication rates with ECV (<LINK REF="REF-Boucher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Impey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Impey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Impey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Impey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tong-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2012</LINK>). A review of 44 studies of ECV (7377 participants) from 1990 to 2002 found the most frequently reported complication to be transient abnormal baby's heart rate patterns (5.7%). Less frequent complications were persisting pathological baby's heart rate patterns (0.37%); vaginal bleeding (0.47%); placental abruption (0.12%); emergency caesarean section (0.43%); and perinatal mortality (0.16%) (<LINK REF="REF-Collaris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collaris 2004</LINK>). Because of the risk of allo-immunisation, anti-D prophylaxis is recommended for non-sensitised D-negative women following ECV attempts (<LINK REF="REF-Fung-Kee-Fung-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fung Kee Fung 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Contra-indications to ECV include: multiple pregnancy, severe abnormality, unsatisfactory condition or death of the baby, caesarean section necessary irrespective of the presentation (e.g. major placenta praevia), and ruptured membranes. Relative contraindications include previous caesarean section, poor growth of the baby, and bleeding from the uterus.</P>
<P>The question of whether ECV might increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission of viral infections such as HIV is important and, in the absence of direct evidence, we have reviewed the relevant biological evidence and concluded that, unlike fetal-maternal transfusion (bleeding from the baby's to the mother's circulation in the placenta), maternal-fetal transfusion is extremely rare, and unlikely to be precipitated by ECV (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2004</LINK>). It is also reassuring that in a randomised trial of fundal pressure to expel the baby during caesarean section, no evidence of maternal-fetal transfusion was found (<LINK REF="REF-Owens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owens 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several authors have reported success rates for ECV at term in routine clinical practice in the region of 40% to 50%: 53% (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>); 39% (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1999</LINK>); 55% (<LINK REF="REF-Guyer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyer 2001</LINK>); 45% (<LINK REF="REF-Devendra-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devendra 2002</LINK>); 43% (<LINK REF="REF-Lojacono-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lojacono 2003</LINK>); 51% (<LINK REF="REF-Skupski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skupski 2003</LINK>); 42% to 65% (depending on amniotic fluid volume (<LINK REF="REF-Boucher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucher 2003</LINK>)); and 51% (<LINK REF="REF-Le-Bret-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Bret 2004</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-03-25 10:25:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is a higher risk of complications when delivering a baby presenting in the breech rather than in the cephalic position. Caesarean section appears to be safer for the baby, but presents a higher level of maternal morbidity. Achieving a cephalic vaginal delivery by successfully rotating the baby in utero therefore, potentially offers a way to reduce the caesarean section rate, and improve perinatal and maternal outcomes. It may be of particular importance in resource-poor situations in which women may be unable to reach health services during labour, and caesarean sections are unavailable or unsafe (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (Higgins 2011). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. In future updates, we will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>
<LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>.</P>
<P>For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparisons.</P>

<P>The GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-Grade-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grade 2008</LINK>) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>We would have included cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials had there been any.

In future updates of the review, if we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. Had we identified both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we planned to synthesise the relevant information. We would consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there was little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit was considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-03-25 10:28:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Due to the potentially high risk of bias in three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brocks-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Brocks 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dafallah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dafallah 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hindawi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hindawi 2005</LINK>) and our lack of success in contacting the latter two trial authors, we undertook the meta-analyses of included studies twice: first, including all the studies and second, excluding the studies at high risk of bias. When sensitivity analyses showed that the overall results and conclusions from primary outcomes were not affected by their inclusion, we regarded the results of the review with a higher degree of certainty. If both or either of these studies had greatly influenced the findings of the review, we would have recommended an appropriate degree of caution. </P>
<P>It has been suggested that ECV may be more successful (and spontaneous version more common) in black African than Caucasian women, possibly because of the tendency for the presenting part to remain high until the onset of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1986</LINK>).

<P>Due to the nature of the intervention, no studies attempted to blind participants or clinicians to group allocation. Women would have been aware of the intervention and this may have affected decisions regarding care in later pregnancy and at the birth. Staff would be aware of the intervention and this may have affected other aspects of care and decision-making at the birth. This may have had an impact on outcomes such as caesarean section. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Pavert-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Pavert 1990</LINK>), it was much more likely that women would have a caesarean section if external cephalic version (ECV) had been attempted and failed than in women where ECV had never been attempted, so it is possible than attempt and failure of ECV affects decision-making about caesarean section.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Mahomed-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mahomed 1991</LINK>) described blinding assessors to some outcomes (Apgar scores, admission to neonatal unit, stillbirth, neonatal death). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hofmeyr-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hofmeyr 1983</LINK>), outcome assessment was from records (it was not clear whether attempted ECV or randomisation group was stated in the records). It states that "there was no subsequent intervention in their management by the investigator". In all other studies, it was not clear whether outcome assessment was carried out by staff who were involved in women's care. It is unlikely that lack of blinding of outcome assessors could have influenced most of the outcomes measured, but assessment of the infant may have been affected by knowledge of randomisation group.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Brocks-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Brocks 1984</LINK> studied 65 women who agreed to randomisation and a further 65 who either specifically requested or refused an ECV attempt.

<P>The exclusion of three women after enrolment in <LINK REF="STD-Van-Dorsten-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Van Dorsten 1981</LINK> is unlikely to have affected the results materially. <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Pavert-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Pavert 1990</LINK> attempted ECV without tocolysis in 21/25 of the study group, and with tocolysis in 16/20 initial failures.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-05 13:45:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen M West">
<P>The evidence from randomised trials shows that attempting external cephalic version at term increases the chance of vaginal cephalic birth, and reduces the chance of caesarean section and vaginal breech delivery. There is not enough evidence from randomised trials to assess complications of external cephalic version at term, however large observational studies suggest that complications are rare (<LINK REF="REF-Boucher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boucher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Impey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Impey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Impey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Impey 2005</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-11-25 14:25:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The absolute numbers of non-cephalic births and caesarean sections vary considerably between trials. This probably reflects differences in study populations and caesarean section policies. The direction of effects is, however, consistent, with the exception of the rates of caesarean section in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Pavert-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Pavert 1990</LINK>. Considerable cross-over between groups in the latter study may have reduced the power of the study to show differences related to external cephalic version (ECV). The study authors suggest that against a background of low caesarean section rates for breech presentation, the negative experience of failed ECV may render the woman or doctors more likely to opt for caesarean section.</P>
<P>The women included in these studies had low-risk pregnancies and medical histories. Women with previous caesarean sections were excluded, for example. This limits the applicability of the evidence to other populations of women.</P>
<P>The recent trend to routine caesarean section for persistent breech presentation may result in a greater impact of ECV on caesarean section rates than was apparent in the studies reviewed.</P>
<P>The trials reviewed do not give information on women's views.</P>
<P>No analgesia was used in these studies. This review included trials with and without tocolysis. Four trials used tocolysis routinely for ECV (ritodrine: <LINK REF="STD-Brocks-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Brocks 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hindawi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hindawi 2005</LINK>, hexaprenaline: <LINK REF="STD-Mahomed-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mahomed 1991</LINK>, terbutaline sulphate: <LINK REF="STD-Van-Dorsten-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Van Dorsten 1981</LINK>). In two trials tocolysis was used if the initial ECV attempt was unsuccessful (hexaprenaline: <LINK REF="STD-Hofmeyr-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hofmeyr 1983</LINK>, ritodrine: <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Pavert-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Pavert 1990</LINK>). No tocolysis was used in <LINK REF="STD-Dafallah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dafallah 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rita-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rita 2012</LINK>. The use of tocolytic drugs and other interventions to help ECV is covered by a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Cluver-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cluver 2012</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-03-25 11:09:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All of the trials included in this review had design limitations. Due to the nature of the intervention, no studies attempted to blind participants or clinicians to group allocation. Women would have been aware of the intervention and this may have affected decisions regarding care in later pregnancy and at the birth. Staff would be aware of intervention and this may have affected other aspects of care and decision-making at the birth. This may have had an impact on outcomes such as caesarean section. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Pavert-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Pavert 1990</LINK>), it was much more likely that women would have a caesarean section if ECV had been attempted and failed than in women where ECV had never been attempted, so it is possible than attempt and failure of ECV affects decision-making about caesarean section.</P>
<P>The descriptions of randomisation and allocation procedures were not optimal in several studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brocks-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Brocks 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dafallah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dafallah 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hindawi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hindawi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rita-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rita 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Pavert-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Pavert 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Dorsten-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Van Dorsten 1981</LINK>). It is unclear whether this is due to omissions in the reporting of the studies, or limitations of study design.</P>
<P>The level of evidence was graded low (perinatal death) or very low (vaginal cephalic birth not achieved, caesarean section, Apgar score &lt; 7 at five minutes, umbilical vein pH &lt; 7.20, neonatal admission) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The two graded outcomes addressing mode of delivery (vaginal cephalic birth not achieved, caesarean section) were downgraded for quality of evidence due to design limitations in the studies, and inconsistency due to statistical heterogeneity. The four graded outcomes addressing perinatal outcomes (Apgar score &lt; 7 at five minutes, umbilical vein pH &lt; 7.20, neonatal admission, perinatal death) were downgraded for quality evidence due to design limitations in the studies, and imprecision due to wide confidence intervals and few events.</P>

<P>No recent systematic reviews of randomised trials were found. A systematic review of cohort studies (three) and case-control studies (eight), found an increased caesarean delivery rate for women with a successful external cephalic version (21%; odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 3.0) (<LINK REF="REF-De-Hundt-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Hundt 2014</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-25 10:29:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The studies in this review provide convincing evidence that the chance of breech birth and caesarean section may be substantially reduced by attempting external cephalic version (ECV) at or near term. The numbers studied are too small to give an accurate assessment of the risks of ECV, though data from observation studies are reassuring. There is sound reason for the clinical use of ECV at term, with the appropriate precautions, in any woman in whom the value of an improved chance of a cephalic birth outweighs the risk of the procedure. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-25 10:29:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Future research should be directed towards refining the selection of women suitable for ECV attempt at term. For example, previous caesarean section has been regarded as a contraindication to ECV. In an uncontrolled series, ECV was found to be successful in 82% of 56 women with one or two previous caesarean sections (<LINK REF="REF-Flamm-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flamm 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The place of ECV during labour requires further study. This procedure was reported to be successful in 11 (73%) out of 15 women in labour considered unsuitable for vaginal breech delivery. Caesarean section was avoided in 10 (67%) of the women (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further research is needed to define more accurately the effect of ECV on perinatal outcome, and the place of ECV in non-longitudinal lies.</P>
<P>Future studies should include an assessment of women's views.</P>

<P>The outcomes vaginal cephalic delivery not achieved and vaginal breech delivery were added for this 2015 update. Outcomes that were not prespecified in the original protocol include: vaginal cephalic delivery not achieved, vaginal breech delivery, Apgar score less than seven at one minute, and enrolment-delivery interval. </P>
<P>Methods for subgroup analysis for future updates were added. It has been suggested that ECV may be more successful (and spontaneous version more common) in black African than Caucasian women, possibly because of the tendency for the presenting part to remain high until the onset of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1986</LINK>).
