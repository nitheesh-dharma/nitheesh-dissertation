<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-24 10:11:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with depression are very often heavy smokers. We wanted to know whether treatments to help people quit smoking are effective for people with current depression or with a history of depression. In this review, treatments were divided into those with or without specific attention to handling depression. We found that smoking cessation treatments with specific attention to handling depression helped smokers who suffered from depression to quit. Psychosocial 'mood management' interventions, where participants learn how to handle depressive symptoms with psychological techniques, were effective in those with current depression and with a history of it. Bupropion, an antidepressant medication to help quit smoking, has been shown to be effective for smoking cessation in healthy smokers. Our findings show that bupropion may benefit smokers with a history of depression as well. However, this was not found for those with current depression. There was a lack of evidence for the effectiveness of other antidepressants to help smokers with a history of depression to quit. There was also not enough evidence for the use of antidepressants in smokers with current depression. Although treatments without specific attention to handling depression, such as nicotine replacement therapy and standard psychosocial smoking cessation interventions, have been shown to help other groups of people to quit smoking, there was not enough evidence to show that they were helpful in people with a history of or with current depression.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-24 16:17:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Individuals with current or past depression are often smokers who are more nicotine dependent, more likely to suffer from negative mood changes after nicotine withdrawal, and more likely to relapse to smoking after quitting than the general population, which contributes to their higher morbidity and mortality from smoking-related illnesses. It remains unclear what interventions can help them to quit smoking.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-04-19 16:00:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, with and without specific mood management components, in smokers with current or past depression.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-24 09:54:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In April 2013, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, other reviews, and asked experts for information on trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-24 16:17:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Criteria for including studies in this review were that they had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing smoking cessation interventions in adult smokers with current or past depression. Depression was defined as major depression or depressive symptoms. We included studies where subgroups of participants with depression were identified, either pre-stated or post hoc. The outcome was abstinence from smoking after six months or longer follow-up. We preferred prolonged or continuous abstinence and biochemically validated abstinence where available.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-24 09:59:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When possible, we estimated pooled risk ratios (RRs) with the Mantel-Haenszel method (fixed-effect model). We also performed subgroup analyses, by length of follow-up, depression measurement, depression group in study, antidepressant use, published or unpublished data, format of intervention, level of behavioural support, additional pharmacotherapy, type of antidepressant medication, and additional nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-24 16:17:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forty-nine RCTs were included of which 33 trials investigated smoking cessation interventions with specific mood management components for depression. In smokers with current depression, meta-analysis showed a significant positive effect for adding psychosocial mood management to a standard smoking cessation intervention when compared with standard smoking cessation intervention alone (11 trials, N = 1844, RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.92). In smokers with past depression we found a similar effect (13 trials, N = 1496, RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.77). Meta-analysis resulted in a positive effect, although not significant, for adding bupropion compared with placebo in smokers with current depression (5 trials, N = 410, RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.27). There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine and paroxetine for smokers with current depression. Bupropion (4 trials, N = 404, RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.18) might significantly increase long-term cessation among smokers with past depression when compared with placebo, but the evidence for bupropion is relatively weak due to the small number of studies and the post hoc subgroups for all the studies. There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, selegiline, and sertraline in smokers with past depression.</P>
<P>Twenty-three of the 49 trials investigated smoking cessation interventions without specific components for depression. There was heterogeneity between the trials which compared psychosocial interventions with standard smoking cessation counselling for both smokers with current and past depression. Therefore, we did not estimate a pooled effect. One trial compared nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo in smokers with current depression and found a positive, although not significant, effect (N = 196, RR 2.64, 95% CI 0.93 to 7.45). Meta-analysis also found a positive, although not significant, effect for NRT versus placebo in smokers with past depression (3 trials, N = 432, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.60). Three trials compared other pharmacotherapy versus placebo and six trials compared other interventions in smokers with current or past depression. Due to heterogeneity between the interventions of the included trials we did not estimate pooled effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-24 16:17:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence suggests that adding a psychosocial mood management component to a standard smoking cessation intervention increases long-term cessation rates in smokers with both current and past depression when compared with the standard intervention alone. Pooled results from four trials suggest that use of bupropion may increase long-term cessation in smokers with past depression. There was no evidence found for the use of bupropion in smokers with current depression. There was not enough evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of the other antidepressants in smokers with current or past depression. There was also not enough evidence to evaluate the group of trials that investigated interventions without specific mood management components for depression, including NRT and psychosocial interventions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-01 15:50:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Regina van der Meer">
<P>As smokers are not an homogeneous group, it may be important to develop tailored smoking cessation interventions for specific groups such as those with depression (<LINK REF="REF-Borrelli-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borrelli 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ranney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranney 2006</LINK>). Subsequently, smokers with depression need standard smoking cessation treatment strategies that are supported by evidence of effectiveness in their population (<LINK REF="REF-Evins-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evins 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hitsman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hitsman 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Smoking and depression are strongly associated. People with depression are about twice as likely to be smokers than individuals who are not depressed (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lasser-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lasser 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziedonis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziedonis 2008</LINK>). This relationship between depression and smoking usually starts in adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1996</LINK>). The literature describes a number of possible mechanisms for the association between smoking and depression (<LINK REF="REF-Mendelsohn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendelsohn 2012</LINK>), shared genetic factors (<LINK REF="REF-Kendler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendler 1993</LINK>), shared environmental influences (<LINK REF="REF-Kendler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendler 1993</LINK>), bidirectional causality (<LINK REF="REF-Breslau-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breslau 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Markou-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markou 2002</LINK>), and self-medication (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several studies have shown that attempts to quit smoking are more likely to fail in smokers with depression than in those without (<LINK REF="REF-Covey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Covey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glassman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glassman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hitsman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hitsman 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinberger-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinberger 2012</LINK>). Some evidence suggests that people with current depression are less likely to successfully quit smoking when compared to those with past depression (<LINK REF="REF-Weinberger-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinberger 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Furthermore, compared to people in the general population who smoke, those with depression are more nicotine dependent, more likely to suffer from negative mood changes after nicotine withdrawal, more likely to relapse to smoking after quitting, and have a greater risk for smoking-related morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Bolam-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolam 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gierisch-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gierisch 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Torres-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torres 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinberger-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinberger 2013</LINK>). Hence for people with depression standard smoking cessation interventions may be less effective than shown in the general population.</P>
<P>It is often thought that smokers with depression do not want to quit smoking but several studies show the contrary (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haukkala-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haukkala 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siru-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siru 2009</LINK>). However, they are not often encouraged by health professionals to quit smoking because many of the latter believe that quitting may exacerbate depressive symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hitsman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hitsman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 2010</LINK>), although evidence suggests that quitting smoking may improve rather than exacerbate depressive symptoms in those who are able to remain abstinent (<LINK REF="REF-Blalock-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blalock 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorsteinsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorsteinsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsoh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsoh 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Smoking cessation interventions for smokers with depression can be divided into interventions with and without specific components for handling depression. The assumption that smoking and smoking cessation relapse are linked to a high incidence of current and past depression has resulted in several studies examining smoking cessation interventions that include an antidepressant for smoking cessation, or a psychosocial mood management component for managing depressive symptoms above and beyond standard smoking cessation counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patten-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Patten 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Meer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Meer 2010</LINK>). Among the psychosocial mood management interventions, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in particular, has been examined. There are also many smoking cessation interventions without specific components for handling depression. The effectiveness of these interventions is mostly studied in the general group of smokers. Smokers with past depression, and in particular smokers with current depression, have often been excluded from these trials.</P>

<P>The primary outcome was smoking status at a minimum of six months from the quit day. We used sustained cessation rates in preference to point prevalence, where available. By sustained cessation we meant either continuous abstinence from quit date or prolonged abstinence (continuous abstinence following a short period of grace in which lapses are not regarded as treatment failure) (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2003</LINK>). We used biochemically validated cessation in preference to self-reported quitting. The strictest definition of smoking cessation reported was used in the meta-analysis. We examined types of abstinence (continuous, prolonged, point prevalence) and levels of verification (biochemical, self report) as potential modifiers of outcome. Participants lost to follow-up were assumed to be continuing smoking.</P>

<P>We examined statistical heterogeneity among trials with the Cochran's Q test and by calculating the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic describes the percentage of the variability in the summary estimate due to systematic heterogeneity rather than random chance stemming from sample error alone (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Values over 50% suggested moderate heterogeneity and values over 75% suggested substantial heterogeneity.</P>

<P>We conducted subgroup analyses separately for smokers with current depression or past depression. Within the psychosocial mood management versus control comparison, we analysed length of follow-up (abstinence at six months versus 12 months follow-up), measurement of depression (major depression versus multi-item scale depressive symptoms versus one item question on depressive symptoms), depression group in study (depression inclusion criteria versus subgroup pre-stated versus subgroup post hoc), publication source (published data versus unpublished data), antidepressant use by participant (antidepressant use an exclusion criterion versus not an exclusion criterion), intervention format (group versus individual versus telephone versus self help, etc.), level of behavioural support (multi-session behavioural support versus no behavioural support), and additional pharmacotherapy (pharmacotherapy versus no pharmacotherapy).</P>
<P>Within the antidepressants for smoking cessation versus placebo comparison, we separately analysed the type of antidepressant (bupropion, fluoxetine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, selegiline, sertraline). Within the group of bupropion studies we conducted the subgroup analyses bupropion alone versus bupropion and additional NRT separately for smokers with current depression or past depression.</P>
<P>Furthermore, within the psychosocial versus control comparison, we conducted the subgroup analysis of telephone counselling versus self help for current depression. Within the NRT versus placebo comparison, we analysed NRT versus placebo for past depression.</P>

<P>We identified 5220 reports from the electronic search of the databases (482 reports from the Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, 581 from CENTRAL, 1281 from MEDLINE, 1373 from EMBASE, and 1503 from PsycINFO). See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> for a summary of the process for identifying trials for inclusion. We identified 33 reports by checking the reference lists of relevant reviews and through communication with experts in the tobacco control and depression field. After screening, we reviewed the full text of 106 trials that were considered potentially eligible. Of these, 45 trials were excluded after reviewing the full text (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Four studies were ongoing and the outcomes are expected in 2013 to 2014 (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>).

<P>Thirteen trials with a total of 1949 participants investigated adding psychosocial mood management to a standard smoking cessation intervention compared with the standard smoking cessation intervention alone, for smokers with current depression, on abstinence at six months or longer follow-up. The meta-analysis, including 11 trials (N = 1844), showed a positive effect on smoking cessation of adding psychosocial mood management for smokers with current depression (11 trials, RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.92; I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Batra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Batra 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Duffy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 2006</LINK> were not included in this analysis because of: different advice for pharmacotherapy in both arms, and psychosocial mood management and pharmacotherapy in the experimental condition alone, respectively. <LINK REF="STD-Batra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Batra 2010</LINK> found an abstinence rate of 30.4% (7/23) for the experimental condition compared with 11.1% (2/18) in the control condition (RR 2.74, 95% CI 0.65 to 11.62). <LINK REF="STD-Duffy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 2006</LINK> showed abstinence rates of 51.4% (18/35) for the experimental condition compared with 17.2% (5/29) in the control condition (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.26 to 7.05). We also performed a meta-analysis without <LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vickers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Vickers 2009</LINK> because their experimental psychosocial mood management component consisted of hypnosis and exercise counselling, compared with a (cognitive) behavioural therapy component in the other trials. The meta-analysis without <LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vickers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Vickers 2009</LINK> also showed a positive effect of adding mood management for current depression (9 trials, RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.88; I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We conducted eight subgroup analyses with the 11 included trials. There were no important differences in effect estimates between the five trials reporting abstinence at six months follow-up and the six with 12-month outcomes (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Estimates were similar across the different ways of measuring depression (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). There were no important differences in effect estimates between the two trials recruiting only people with depression, the five trials where depression was a pre-stated subgroup analysis, and the four trials where depression was a post hoc subgroup analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Data came from published reports in only three trials (N = 188) and although the point estimate was higher in this group the confidence intervals overlapped with the eight trials (N = 1663) where we obtained subgroup data from the authors (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Only three trials excluded people using antidepressants, and there was no evidence of a difference between the subgroups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). There were too many formats of intervention categories to make a sensible subgroup analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). The seven trials (N = 1647) where multi-session behavioural support was provided to all participants showed a significant benefit from the additional components in the experimental group. There were only 197 participants in trials without this level of support for all participants and the pooled estimate had wide confidence intervals (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). There was no evidence that the relative effect was different for trials where participants were offered pharmacotherapy and those where they were not (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).

<P>Fourteen trials with a total of 1554 participants investigated adding psychosocial mood management to a standard smoking cessation intervention compared with the standard smoking cessation intervention alone, for smokers with past depression, on abstinence at six months or longer follow-up. The meta-analysis, including 13 trials (N = 1496), showed a positive effect for adding psychosocial mood management for past depression (13 trials, RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.77; I² = 23%; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hall-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 2009</LINK> was not included in the meta-analysis because the differences between the experimental intervention (extended CTB) and control intervention (standard treatment) included more than only the addition of a psychosocial mood management component. This trial found an abstinence rate of 48.3% (14/29) for the experimental condition compared with 27.6% (8/29) in the control condition (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.87 to 3.52). We also performed a meta-analysis without <LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK> because the experimental psychosocial mood management component of this trial consisted of hypnosis, compared with CBT components in the other trials. The meta-analysis without <LINK REF="STD-Carmody-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carmody 2008</LINK> also showed a positive effect of adding psychosocial mood management for smokers with past depression (12 trials, RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.74; I² = 25%; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We conducted eight subgroup analyses with the 13 included trials.

Data from published reports in seven trials showed a higher point estimate than the obtained data from authors in six trials, although the confidence intervals overlapped (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). There were no important differences in effect estimates between the six trials where antidepressant use was an exclusion criterion and the seven where antidepressant use was not an exclusion criterion (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>). There were too many format intervention categories to make a sensible subgroup analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>). The nine trials (N = 1252) where multi-session behavioural support was provided to all participants showed a significant benefit from the additional components in the experimental group. In the four trials without this level of support for all participants (N = 244), the confidence intervals overlapped between the two subgroups (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-31 14:59:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Regina van der Meer">
<P>This systematic review is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions separately for smokers with current and past depression. Our evidence suggests that adding a psychosocial mood management component to a standard smoking cessation intervention, compared with standard smoking cessation alone, increases cessation rates for smokers with current depression or past depression (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> for smokers with current depression). Subgroup analyses show that the outcome was not influenced by any of the following: the length of follow-up, depression measurement, depression group in study, antidepressant use, antidepressant exclusion criteria, published or unpublished data, format of intervention, level of behavioural support, or additional pharmacotherapy.</P>
<P>Bupropion seems to increase long-term cessation for people with past depression, although the evidence is relatively weak due to the small number of studies and post hoc subgroups for all the studies. We found no strong evidence for long-term abstinence due to bupropion use in smokers with current depression (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK> for bupropion use in smokers with current depression). There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of the other antidepressants for smoking cessation. There was also not enough evidence for the group of trials which investigated interventions without specific components for handling depression, including NRT and psychosocial interventions.</P>
<P>An alternative explanation for the positive effect of the psychosocial mood management component might be the higher number of sessions in the experimental condition for some of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabius-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Rabius 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Meer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Meer 2010</LINK>), as the number of sessions might be associated with a larger effect size in quitting. Three reviews indirectly compared the number of sessions and quitting, for which two reviews did not find an association (<LINK REF="REF-Pan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2006</LINK>) and one found a positive association (<LINK REF="REF-Fiore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiore 2008</LINK>). Another review looked at the direct evidence by including only studies where participants were randomised to more sessions or fewer sessions, and no effect was found to support the effect of number of sessions on quitting (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005</LINK>). Given these findings and the modest number of studies that did not control for number of sessions, it seems unlikely that the positive effect of the psychosocial mood management component is the result of a higher number of sessions; but we cannot rule out this possibility.</P>
<P>We have no explanation for why bupropion probably seems to work for smokers with past depression and not for smokers with current depression. This result is counterintuitive, although the strength of the evidence for bupropion is relatively weak due to the small number of studies and the post hoc subgroups for all the studies. More trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of bupropion for smokers with current depression and also for smokers with past depression</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-24 16:17:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Regina van der Meer">
<P>In this review, we found most evidence for the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions with a psychosocial mood management component for smokers with current or past depression. Although the number of trials was relatively small, there was no significant heterogeneity among them. There is weak evidence for the effectiveness of bupropion for smokers with past depression, but there aren't enough trials to evaluate the effectiveness of the other antidepressants for smoking cessation.</P>
<P>The evidence for the other interventions without specific components for depression was very limited, despite good evidence of their benefit in other populations of smokers. Hence, it is possible that the lack of efficacy for these interventions is likely due to the lack of evidence rather than to negative results from trials. The effectiveness of these interventions is mostly studied in the general group of smokers, with smokers with depression often being excluded from these trials. In the group of interventions without specific components for depression, only two trials had an inclusion criterion of depression, therefore most of our data came from trials with post hoc subgroups.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-07-24 12:12:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has several limitations. One limitation is that few RCTs have been conducted that test smoking cessation interventions for smokers with depression. Therefore, we decided to also include trials with subgroups of depression. Much of the data came from post hoc subgroups and pre-stated subgroups as only seven trials had an inclusion criterion of depression. Thus the findings for the results should be interpreted cautiously.</P>
<P>Another limitation was that major past depression defined as a dichotomous 'yes or no' variable may have poor predictive power because it does not differentiate between smokers with a single episode or those with multiple episodes of past major depression. Psychosocial mood management interventions might be more effective for recurrent past depression compared with single past depression (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, the multi-item scales such as CES-D, BDI, and The Hamilton Depression Scale are frequently used in smoking cessation research but are not replacements for clinical diagnosis or semi-structured clinical interviews (for example DSM-IV-TR). In this review self-reported single item questions and multi-item scales and clinical diagnosis were taken together for defining depression. Therefore, this review contains heterogeneity among participants classified as depressed.</P>
<P>Because there were almost no trials with an inclusion criterion of depression, we also included subgroups of people with past and current depression. This means that we had to ask many authors for unpublished data that had not been subjected to peer-review processes, although the studies from which they originated were. We cannot rule out that unpublished data might be a limitation of this review. However, the strength of unpublished data is that the data might decrease the degree of publication bias. Furthermore, subgroup analyses showed that the outcome was not influenced by published or unpublished data.</P>
<P>Finally, the variations in outcome measurements reported by the studies hampered the comparison of the trials. Some trials used point prevalence while other used sustained abstinence (continuous abstinence or prolonged abstinence), and some used both. In this review we preferred sustained abstinence and biochemically validated abstinence, and included the longest follow-up. The outcome was abstinence from smoking for six months or longer. Thus in the meta-analysis for some studies we used the point prevalence data when no data on sustained abstinence were available and for other studies we used sustained abstinence. For most trials the point prevalence data and sustained abstinence data did not favour either the experimental or control condition; but this was not always the case. For example in <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2001</LINK> the continuous abstinence favours the experimental group, as does the point prevalence data.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-24 12:13:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In a recent systematic review of smoking cessation interventions for patients with depression, <LINK REF="REF-Gierisch-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gierisch 2011</LINK> showed that adding psychosocial mood management has a positive effect (5 trials, N = 402, RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.96) for smoking cessation. We performed separate analyses for smokers with current depression and past depression and found comparable findings for both groups. Their review also showed a positive but not significant effect for antidepressants (3 trials, N = 255, RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.34). In our review we did not pool different antidepressants for smoking cessation. However, our results appear to show a positive effect for bupropion for both smokers with current and past depression, although we found only a significant effect for past depression. However, as previously described, these latter findings should be interpreted with caution. <LINK REF="REF-Gierisch-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gierisch 2011</LINK> found three NRT trials that demonstrated small, positive effects, which were not significant, on smoking cessation rates for smokers with depression. We also found positive but not significant effects for the use of NRT when compared with placebo for smokers with current depression and those with past depression.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-24 12:13:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the best currently available evidence, our results support the effectiveness of adding a psychosocial mood management component to a smoking cessation intervention for smokers with current and past depression. Health professionals should consider encouraging their smoking patients with depression to use a smoking cessation intervention that includes a psychosocial mood management component. The results also seem to support the effectiveness of using bupropion for smokers with past depression, although the evidence for bupropion is relatively weak due to the small number of studies that used post hoc subgroups. For interventions without specific mood management components for depression, including NRT and psychosocial interventions, we did not find sufficient convincing evidence to support their use in clinical practice for smokers with depression.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-24 12:13:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence for the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in depression is restricted to a limited number of mostly small studies without adequate power to detect reasonable treatment effects. Further trials with an inclusion criterion of smokers with past depression, or especially current depression, would be informative.</P>
<P>In addition, the following areas should be considered for future research for smokers with current or past depression:</P>
<P>1. the effectiveness of antidepressants for smoking cessation;</P>
<P>2. the effectiveness of a combination of a psychosocial mood management and an antidepressant for smoking cessation;</P>
<P>3. the effectiveness of interventions without specific components for depression, including NRT, varenicline, psychosocial interventions, and the essential component(s) for the effectiveness of the intervention.</P>
