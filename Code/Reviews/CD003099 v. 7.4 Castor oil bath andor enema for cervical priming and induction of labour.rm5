<P>Sometimes it is necessary to bring on labour artificially. Castor oil has been widely used as a traditional method of inducing labour in midwifery practice. It can be taken by mouth or as an enema. The review of three trials, involving 233 women, found there has not been enough research done to show the effects of castor oil on ripening the cervix or inducing labour or compare it to other methods of induction. The review found that all women who took castor oil by mouth felt nauseous. More research is needed into the effects of castor oil to induce labour.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Castor oil, a potent cathartic, is derived from the bean of the castor plant. Anecdotal reports, which date back to ancient Egypt have suggested the use of castor oil to stimulate labour. Castor oil has been widely used as a traditional method of initiating labour in midwifery practice. Its role in the initiation of labour is poorly understood and data examining its efficacy within a clinical trial are limited. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology.</P>

<P>Three trials, involving 233 women, are included. There was no evidence of differences in caesarean section rates between the two interventions in the two trials reporting this outcome (risk ratio (RR) 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 4.55). There were no data presented on neonatal or maternal mortality or morbidity.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between castor oil and placebo/no treatment for the rate of instrumental delivery, meconium-stained liquor, or Apgar score less than seven at five minutes. The number of participants was too small to detect all but large differences in outcome. All women who ingested castor oil felt nauseous (RR 59.92, 95% CI 8.46 to 424.52).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-12-05 11:51:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The three trials included in the review contain small numbers of women. All three studies used single doses of castor oil. The results from these studies should be interpreted with caution due to the risk of bias introduced due to poor methodological quality. Further research is needed to attempt to quantify the efficacy of castor oil as an cervical priming and induction agent.</P>

<P>Two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic) prespecified clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction. They resolved differences by discussion.</P>
<P>Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications:<BR/>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (or period specified by trial authors);<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) caesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);<BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this is unlikely. All these events will be rare, and a modest change in their incidence will be easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented. The incidence of individual components are explored as secondary outcomes (see below).</P>

<P>The terminology of uterine hyperstimulation is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1987</LINK>). In the reviews we will use the term 'uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes' to include uterine tachysystole (more than five contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) and uterine hypersystole/hypertonus (a contraction lasting at least two minutes) and 'uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes' to denote uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (tachysystole or hypersystole with fetal heart rate changes such as persistent decelerations, tachycardia or decreased short-term variability). However, due to varied reporting there is the possibility of subjective bias in the interpretation of these outcomes. Also, it is not always clear from trials if these outcomes are reported in a mutually exclusive manner.</P>

We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>

<P>We have assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).

<P>In future updates, If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-12-20 11:48:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The three trials included in the review contain small numbers of women. All three studies used single doses of castor oil. One trial used alternation as a method of allocation, although the other two studies were unclear on the methods used to allocate women. Hence the results from all these studies should be interpreted with caution due to the risk of bias introduced due to poor methodological quality. The incidence of maternal side effects was high in association with castor oil ingestion. Further research is needed to attempt to quantify the efficacy of castor oil as a cervical priming and induction agent.</P>

<P>Reviewed following translation. main comparison is multiple vaginal misoprostol (4 x 50 micrograms) versus 5 fried egg yolks (cooked) in rincinus oil). Also in this arm, participants received intravenous oxytocin within 12 hours. Hence the study does not use castor oil as a solitary intervention and also uses the egg yolks as a complex intervention with oxytocin in a different manner to the active (misoprostol) arm.</P>

<P>A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. Many methods have been studied, examining the effects of these methods when induction of labour was undertaken in a variety of clinical groups e.g. restricted to primiparous women or those with ruptured membranes. Most trials are intervention-driven, comparing two or more methods in various categories of women. Clinicians and parents need the data arranged according to the clinical characteristics of the women undergoing induction of labour, to be able to choose which method is best for a particular clinical scenario. To extract these data from several hundred trial reports in a single step would be very difficult. We therefore developed a two-stage method of data extraction. The initial data extraction was done in a series of primary reviews arranged by methods of induction of labour, following a standardised methodology. The intention was then to extract them from the primary reviews into a series of secondary reviews, arranged by the clinical characteristics of the women undergoing induction of labour.</P>
<P>To avoid duplication of data in the primary reviews, the labour induction methods were listed in a specific order, from one to 25. Each primary review included comparisons between one of the methods (from two to 25) with only those methods above it on the list. Thus, the review of intravenous oxytocin (4) included only comparisons with intracervical prostaglandins (3), vaginal prostaglandins (2) or placebo (1). Methods identified in the future will be added to the end of the list. The current list is as follows:</P>
<P>(1) placebo/no treatment;<BR/>(2) vaginal prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2009</LINK>);<BR/>(3) intracervical prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Boulvain-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulvain 2008</LINK>);<BR/>(4) intravenous oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2009</LINK>);<BR/>(5) amniotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Bricker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bricker 2000</LINK>);<BR/>(6) intravenous oxytocin with amniotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Howarth-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howarth 2001</LINK>);<BR/>(7) vaginal misoprostol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2010</LINK>);<BR/>(8) oral misoprostol (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2006</LINK>);<BR/>(9) mechanical methods including extra-amniotic Foley catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Boulvain-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulvain 2001</LINK>);<BR/>(10) membrane sweeping (<LINK REF="REF-Boulvain-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulvain 2005</LINK>);<BR/>(11) extra-amniotic prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2001</LINK>);<BR/>(12) intravenous prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Luckas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luckas 2000</LINK>);<BR/>(13) oral prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-French-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2001</LINK>);<BR/>(14) mifepristone (<LINK REF="REF-Hapangama-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hapangama 2009</LINK>);<BR/>(15) oestrogens with or without amniotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>);<BR/>(16) corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Kavanagh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavanagh 2006</LINK>);<BR/>(17) relaxin (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2001</LINK>);<BR/>(18) hyaluronidase (<LINK REF="REF-Kavanagh-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavanagh 2006a</LINK>);<BR/>(19) castor oil, bath, and/or enema;<BR/>(20) acupuncture (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>);<BR/>(21) breast stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Kavanagh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavanagh 2005</LINK>);<BR/>(22) sexual intercourse (<LINK REF="REF-Kavanagh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavanagh 2001</LINK>);<BR/>(23) homoeopathic methods (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2003</LINK>);<BR/>(24) nitric oxide (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2011</LINK>);<BR/>(25) buccal or sublingual misoprostol (<LINK REF="REF-Muzonzini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muzonzini 2004</LINK>);<BR/>(26) other methods for induction of labour.</P>
<P>The primary reviews were analysed by the following subgroups:<BR/>(1) previous caesarean section or not;<BR/>(2) nulliparity or multiparity;<BR/>(3) membranes intact or ruptured;<BR/>(4) cervix favourable, unfavourable or undefined.</P>
<P>The secondary reviews would have included all methods of labour induction for each of the categories of women for which subgroup analysis has been done in the primary reviews. There would have thus been six secondary reviews, of methods of labour induction in the following groups of women:</P>
<P>(1) nulliparous, intact membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);<BR/>(2) nulliparous, ruptured membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);<BR/>(3) multiparous, intact membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);<BR/>(4) multiparous, ruptured membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);<BR/>(5) previous caesarean section, intact membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);<BR/>(6) previous caesarean section, ruptured membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined).</P>
<P>Each time a primary review is updated with new data, those secondary reviews which included data which have changed, would also have been updated.</P>
<P>The trials included in the primary reviews were extracted from an initial set of trials covering all interventions used in induction of labour (see above for details of search strategy). The data extraction process was conducted centrally. This was co-ordinated from the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit (CESU) at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, in co-operation with the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of the Cochrane Collaboration. This process allowed the data extraction process to be standardised across all the reviews.</P>
<P>The trials were initially reviewed on eligibility criteria, using a standardised form and the basic selection criteria specified above. Following this, data were extracted to a standardised data extraction form which was piloted for consistency and completeness. The pilot process involved the researchers at the CESU and previous reviewers in the area of induction of labour.</P>
<P>Information was extracted regarding the methodological quality of trials on a number of levels. This process was completed without consideration of trial results. Assessment of selection bias examined the process involved in the generation of the random sequence and the method of allocation concealment separately. These were then judged as adequate or inadequate using the criteria described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for the purpose of the reviews.</P>
<P>Performance bias was examined with regards to whom was blinded in the trials i.e. patient, caregiver, outcome assessor or analyst. In many trials the caregiver, assessor and analyst were the same party. Details of the feasibility and appropriateness of blinding at all levels was sought.</P>
<P>Predefined subgroup analyses are: previous caesarean section or not; nulliparity or multiparity; membranes intact or ruptured, and cervix unfavourable, favourable or undefined. Only those outcomes with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>Individual outcome data were included in the analysis if they met the pre-stated criteria in 'Types of outcome measures'. Included trial data were processed as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2002</LINK>). Data extracted from the trials were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (when this was not done in the original report, re-analysis was performed if possible). Where data were missing, clarification was sought from the original authors. If the attrition was such that it might significantly affect the results, these data were excluded from the analysis. This decision rested with the reviewers of primary reviews and is clearly documented. If missing data become available, they will be included in the analyses.</P>
<P>Data were extracted from all eligible trials to examine how issues of quality influence effect size in a sensitivity analysis. In trials where reporting was poor, methodological issues were reported as unclear or clarification sought.</P>
<P>Once the data had been extracted, they were distributed to individual reviewers for entry onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>), checked for accuracy, and analysed as above using the RevMan software. For dichotomous data, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and in the absence of heterogeneity, results were pooled using a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>The predefined criteria for sensitivity analysis included all aspects of quality assessment as mentioned above, including aspects of selection, performance and attrition bias.</P>
<P>Primary analysis was limited to the prespecified outcomes and subgroup analyses. In the event of differences in unspecified outcomes or subgroups being found, these were analysed post hoc, but clearly identified as such to avoid drawing unjustified conclusions.</P>
