<P>This review was updated in June 2006 and two additional RCTs were identified, which provide further support that visibility aids used by pedestrians and cyclists have the potential to improve detection and recognition by car drivers. However, the safety benefit of visibility aids on pedestrians and cyclists has yet to be determined.</P>

<TITLE>Increasing pedestrian and cyclist visibility to prevent deaths and injuries</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-29 09:46:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Blackhall">
<P>Pedestrians and cyclists are often killed or seriously injured in traffic crashes, especially in developing countries where walking and bicycling are essential modes of transportation. In the UK, one in three road traffic fatalities is a pedestrian or cyclist. Usually, in these crashes drivers fail to see the pedestrian or cyclist until it is too late. In recent years reflective garments, flashing lights, and other visibility aids have been used to try to prevent crashes.</P>
<P>The authors of this Cochrane review looked for studies which showed how effective visibility aids are for protecting pedestrians and cyclists. They focused their search on a type of study called a randomised controlled trial, which compares two similar groups of people who only differ on the issue being studied, for instance, the rate of crashes in communities with and without introduction of visibility aids. The authors found no studies that compared number of crashes but to date they have found 42 studies which compare driver detection of people with or without visibility aids. These studies showed that fluorescent materials in yellow, red and orange improved driver detection during the day; while lamps, flashing lights and retroreflective materials in red and yellow, particularly those with a 'biomotion' configuration (taking advantage of the motion from a pedestrian's limbs), improved pedestrian recognition at night. Although these visibility measures help drivers see pedestrians and cyclists, more research should be done to determine whether the increased visibility actually does prevent deaths and serious injuries.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:12:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Pedestrians and cyclists account for nearly one in three of all road users killed and seriously injured in road traffic crashes. Late detection of other road users is one of the basic driver failures responsible for collisions. Aids to improve pedestrians and cyclist visibility have been used to avert potential collisions. However, the impact of these strategies on drivers' responses, and on pedestrian and cyclist safety is unknown.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To quantify the effect of visibility aids versus no visibility aids, and of different visibility aids on the occurrence of pedestrian and cyclist-motor vehicle collisions and injuries. <BR/>2. To quantify the effect of visibility aids versus no visibility aids, and of different visibility aids on drivers' detection and recognition responses.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-11 21:01:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Searches were not restricted by date, language or publication status. All electronic databases were searched from date of inception to the most recent date available. We searched CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), TRANSPORT (to 2007/06), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), PsycEXTRA (Ovid SP), ISI Web of Science: Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (CPCI-S). We searched the reference lists of included trials, contacted authors and searched the websites of relevant transport research organisations. The searches were last updated in May 2009.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-07-28 14:31:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-11 21:01:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no trials assessing the effect of visibility aids on pedestrian and cyclist-motor vehicle collisions and injuries. To date we have identified 42 trials assessing the effect of visibility aids on drivers' responses. Fluorescent materials in yellow, red and orange colours improve detection and recognition in the daytime. For night-time visibility, lamps, flashing lights and retroreflective materials in red and yellow colours increase detection and recognition. Retroreflective materials enhance recognition, in particular when arranged in a 'biomotion' configuration, taking advantage of the motion from a pedestrian's limbs. Substantial heterogeneity between and within the trials limited the possibility for meta-analysis. Summary statistics and descriptive summaries of the outcomes were presented for individual trials when appropriate.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-11 21:00:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Visibility aids have the potential to increase visibility and enable drivers to detect pedestrians and cyclists earlier. Biomotion markings, which highlight the movement and form of the pedestrian, showed evidence of improving pedestrians' conspicuity at night. Public acceptability of various effective strategies which improve visibility would merit further development. However, the effect of visibility aids on pedestrian and cyclist safety remains unknown. A cluster randomised controlled trial involving large communities may provide an answer to this question. It would, however, be a challenging trial to conduct. Studies that collect data of road traffic injuries relating to the use of visibility aids also warrant consideration.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:12:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Road traffic crashes account for over a million deaths and some ten million permanent disabilities a year worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>). Nearly three-quarters of road deaths occur in low and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Odero-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odero 1997</LINK>), predominantly as a result of bicycle and pedestrian injuries. In Ethiopia, pedestrian and bicyclist injuries account for 85% of all road traffic fatalities compared with 37% in the UK and 17% in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Barss-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barss 1998</LINK>). In 2008, there were 28,482 pedestrian and 16,297 bicyclist casualties in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Transport-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Transport 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the basic driver errors responsible for collisions is the late detection of other road users (<LINK REF="REF-Rumar-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumar 1990</LINK>). Pedestrian casualties are over-represented at night, partly due to reduced visibility (<LINK REF="REF-Owens-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owens 1993</LINK>). Over 60% of all pedestrian fatalities occur between the hours of 8pm and 4am, and more than half of all pedestrian deaths and injuries occur when pedestrians cross or enter streets (<LINK REF="REF-National-Safety-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Safety 1994</LINK>). Night-time cycling is two to five times more dangerous than cycling in daylight. Forty per cent of cyclist fatalities occur during the hours of darkness (<LINK REF="REF-Jaermark-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaermark 1991</LINK>) with a high proportion related to frontal rather than rear conspicuity (<LINK REF="REF-Gale-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gale 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Walking and cycling are essential modes of travel for many people in low and middle-income countries, and are also promoted for their environmental, economic and health benefit. The Highway Code states that pedestrians and cyclists should wear or carry materials to improve their visibility to drivers in poor daylight conditions and at night (<LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Transport-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Transport 2009</LINK>). Visibility aids such as bright coloured clothing, lights and reflectors enhance the conspicuity of the pedestrians and cyclists, thus attracting the driver's attention to their presence. Reflective garments are also widely used by construction workers, firefighters, police and emergency medical workers at accident scenes for high visibility and safety.</P>
<P>Many factors affect conspicuity, including object contrast, size, movement, illumination, background 'clutter' and road condition, also the cognitive process of the drivers' responses in detection and recognition. The efficiency of visibility aids depends on whether they can visually alert the drivers in time to avoid a collision. Longer times and distances before impact indicate earlier detection, which may allow hazard recognition and evasion. To assess the effect of visibility aids on occurrence of pedestrian and cyclist-motor vehicle collisions and injuries, and on drivers' responses in detection and recognition, we conducted a systematic review for randomised controlled trials of visibility aids.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:12:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We found no randomised controlled trials or controlled before-and-after trials which compared the effect of visibility aids versus no visibility aids, or of different visibility aids on the occurrence of pedestrian and cyclist-motor vehicle collision. The effect of visibility aids on pedestrian and cyclist safety therefore remains unknown.</P>
<P>Results of the trials suggest that visibility aids influence drivers' reaction, detection and recognition. For daytime visibility, fluorescent materials in yellow, red and orange colours improved detection and recognition. Yellow was the most effective non-fluorescent colour. For night-time visibility, lamps, flashing lights and retroreflective materials in red and yellow colours enhanced drivers' detection and recognition. 'Biomotion' markings also improved recognition.</P>
<P>Any potential effect of visibility aids needs to be considered in the context of the dynamic complexities of any road environment and the users. These 42 trials highlighted the many factors which could influence visibility, such as road condition, contrast, weather, street lighting, background 'clutter' and the roadworthiness of the vehicles. However, detection of an object does not equate to its recognition as a hazard and subsequent evasion. Driving is a highly skilled activity, situated in a complex and unpredictable environment. The cognitive process of understanding and correct interpretation of visual information in recognition is complex, influenced by driver expectancy, level of vigilance, attention, judgement, experience, etc. which can lead to perception errors in drivers who 'looked but did not see' (<LINK REF="REF-Gale-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gale 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hills-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hills 1980</LINK>). The behaviours of the drivers and pedestrians/bicyclists, such as intoxication and speeding are important considerations. Past studies have shown that pedestrians tend to over-estimate their own visibility (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shinar-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Shinar 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyrrell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyrrell 2004</LINK>). It has also been argued that laboratory trials which use films, video or slides as presentation of visibility aids do not adequately reproduce the quality of lights and reflective or fluorescent materials in a real life setting (<LINK REF="REF-Cairney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairney 2001</LINK>). The plethora of different experimental settings and visibility measures demonstrated in the studies reviewed may influence the generalisability of the findings. A more unified framework for future research to improve ecological validity in conspicuity research needs to be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Langham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langham 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Based on these 42 trials, visibility aids have the potential to increase conspicuity and enable drivers to detect and recognise pedestrians and cyclists earlier. This does not imply that evasive actions will be taken and collisions avoided. Public acceptability of these strategies would depend on their ease of application, maintenance and cost. High visibility garments can be cumbersome and unsuitable to wear in hot and humid climates. Lights and lamps need to be kept in working order. Visibility aids which can yield simultaneous detection and recognition, and made with a combination of fluorescent and retroreflective materials would be useful as they cover both day and night conditions. Detachable accessories such as tags, strips and vests may encourage user acceptability.</P>
<P>The focus of recent research has been on the effects of biomotion markings which make pedestrians conspicuous by highlighting the movement and form of the pedestrian, whether moving or not. Biomotion configuration showed evidence, over other visibility aids, in improving pedestrian conspicuity, in particular taking advantage of the motion from a pedestrian's limbs (arms or legs), can be of great benefit to pedestrians' safety at night (<LINK REF="STD-Balk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Balk 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owens-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Owens 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sayer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sayer 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The problem of pedestrian and cyclist death and injuries will not be fully resolved in terms of increased conspicuity. Visibility aids may be relatively low cost to produce and purchase but it will require the individual road user to buy, wear and maintain them. Efforts to implement complementary measures such as improved street environment, traffic calming schemes, better vehicle design, speed limit, and continuous driver and pedestrian/bicyclist education may also contribute towards improving the safety of all vulnerable road users. Whether visibility aids will make a worthwhile difference needs careful economic evaluation alongside research efforts to quantify their effect on pedestrian and cyclist safety.</P>

<P>The objective of this review was to make explicit the totality of the evidence available from randomised trials on the effects of visibility aids. The TRANSPORT database provided the main source of records for the identification of potential trials in this review. This database has a limited range of indexing terms describing study methodology, and the problem of devising reliable electronic search strategies in the TRANSPORT database has been highlighted (<LINK REF="REF-Wentz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wentz 2001</LINK>). It is possible that a small number of relevant trials may have been missed. To avoid the effect of publication bias, we contacted trialists and experts in the field of visibility and illumination research, manufacturers of high-visibility materials and Standards authorities for further information, and from this two additional trials were identified. Websites of transport and related organisations worldwide were also searched, which identified two more trials. Some trials were unavailable due to proprietary reasons. Details of some trials carried out before 1970 were unavailable as the authors had retired or the records were inaccessible.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-08-03 17:49:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The primary outcome of death and injury rates are of universal relevance to all concerned with traffic safety. None of the trials studied these outcomes. However, the surrogate outcomes of reaction, detection, and recognition are considered valid field measures of visibility. We chose to compare red, orange and yellow colours with other colours, as the former are the colours most commonly used by firefighters and emergency workers and vehicles for high visibility and safety. This decision was made post-hoc.</P>
<P>The Latin Square design of some of the trials permit systematic presentation of the interventions to be viewed by the observers under different conditions. This is considered to be appropriate in visibility investigations to simulate a dynamic road environment. However, foreknowledge of the order of presentation of the interventions by the trialists and the non-blinding of outcome assessment can introduce an important source of potential bias. The recruitment of participants from research centres where the trials took place can also introduce selection bias and ascertainment bias.</P>
<P>In combining data to create dichotomies for comparisons in each of the trials, we obtained an overall effect of visibility aids on detection and recognition. This effect would have masked some of the important differences of the individual interventions. Reflectors viewed at low beam and high beam would yield different detection and recognition measurements. Substantial heterogeneity between the trials limit the potential for meta-analysis. Summary statistics for individual trials were presented when data details were available.</P>

<P>A recent randomised controlled trial conducted in Nottingham reported that school children provided with free visibility aids and educational booklets on road safety are more likely to use these aids, thus increasing their conspicuity and potential detection by car drivers (<LINK REF="REF-Mulvaney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulvaney 2006</LINK>). However, the potential impact of visibility aids in reducing pedestrian and cyclist death and injuries needs to be determined. While challenging, a cluster randomised controlled trial involving large communities may provide the answer to this question. Research including large observation studies and data collection of road traffic injuries in relation to the use of visibility aids, in particular biomotion apparels, would warrant consideration.</P>

<P>M = Male<BR/>F = Female<BR/>Fl = Fluorescent<BR/>Definitions:<BR/>Fluorescence - Fluorescent colours absorb short wavelength light to which the eye is not sensitive, and then re-emit the energy as visible light. </P>
<P>Retroreflectance - Retroreflection occurs when light rays are returned in the direction from which they came, achieved with microprismatic technology.</P>
<P>Biomotion - When light points are attached to major joints of the body (shoulders, hips, elbows, wrists, knees and ankles), relative motions among the joints provide virtually immediate perception of the person in action.</P>
