<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-22 21:01:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is a disease of the newborn lung in which meconium, the fetal stool, is passed before birth and then is inhaled into the lung. Little effective treatment is available, other than supportive measures including artifical respiration and, occasionally, the use of heart-lung bypass. This review examined whether cleansing the lung using a natural chemical called surfactant, or another similar fluid, is helpful in MAS. This cleansing procedure is known as lung lavage. Lung lavage with diluted surfactant may help improve the clinical course of infants with MAS, in particular, the likelihood of survival without the need for heart-lung bypass. More trials will be needed to properly evaluate lavage treatment in MAS.</P>

<P>Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) can occur when a newborn infant inhales a mixture of meconium and amniotic fluid into the lungs around the time of delivery. Other than supportive measures, little effective therapy is available.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-03-22 20:56:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE, and EMBASE up to December 2012; previous reviews including cross-references, abstracts, and conference proceedings; and expert informants. We contacted authors directly to obtain additional data.

<P>Randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of lung lavage in infants with MAS, including those intubated for the purpose of lavage.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-03-22 20:57:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review authors extracted from the reports of the clinical trial, data regarding clinical outcomes, including mortality, requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), pneumothorax, duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy, length of hospital stay, indices of pulmonary function, and adverse effects of lavage.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-24 16:51:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only four small randomised controlled trials fulfilled the selection criteria. For one of these trials, no data are available for the control group. Two studies compared lavage using diluted surfactant with standard care. Meta-analysis of these two studies did not show a significant effect on mortality (typical relative risk 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12 to 1.46; typical risk difference -0.10, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.04) or the use of ECMO (typical relative risk 0.27, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.86; typical risk difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.04). For the composite outcome of death or use of ECMO, a significant effect favoured the lavage group (typical relative risk 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.96; typical risk difference -0.19, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.03; number needed to benefit [NNTB] 5). No other benefits were reported. The other published study compared surfactant lavage followed by a surfactant bolus with surfactant bolus therapy alone in MAS complicated by pulmonary hypertension. No significant improvements in mortality, pneumothorax, duration of mechanical ventilation. or duration of hospitalisation were observed.</P>

<P>In infants with meconium aspiration syndrome, lung lavage with diluted surfactant may be beneficial, but additional controlled clinical trials of lavage therapy should be conducted to confirm the treatment effect, to refine the method of lavage treatment, and to compare lavage treatment with other approaches, including surfactant bolus therapy.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-03-24 16:51:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) occurs when a newborn infant inhales a mixture of meconium and amniotic fluid into the lungs around the time of delivery. Intrapartum passage of meconium, the viscid secretion of the fetal intestine, occurs in up to 15% of deliveries at term (<LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 1993</LINK>). Aspiration of meconium or meconium-stained amniotic fluid into the airways may occur prenatally (during hypoxic fetal gasping), or immediately after delivery as the first breaths are taken. Once inhaled, meconium migrates down the tracheobronchial tree, causing a variable degree of airway obstruction as it disperses into the distal airspaces (<LINK REF="REF-Tran-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 1980</LINK>). Thereafter a toxic pneumonitis ensues, with hemorrhagic edema and exudation of plasma proteins into the alveolar space (<LINK REF="REF-Tyler-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyler 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dargaville-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dargaville 2001</LINK>). The function of pulmonary surfactant may be secondarily impaired, both by meconium (<LINK REF="REF-Moses-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moses 1991</LINK>), and by plasma protein (<LINK REF="REF-Fuchimukai-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuchimukai 1987</LINK>). In many infants with MAS, particularly those with coexisting asphyxia, there is an added component of pulmonary hypertension, which may cause profound hypoxaemia. The reported incidence of MAS varies widely, but is of the order of 1 to 2 per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Approximately one-third of infants with MAS need mechanical ventilatory support (<LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 1993</LINK>), and many are treated with high-frequency ventilation or nitric oxide, or both. Infants ventilated for MAS are often treated with exogenous surfactant, which appears to reduce the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), but has no clear effect on mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Findlay-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Findlay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lotze-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lotze 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El-Shahed-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Shahed 2007</LINK>). Data regarding the effect of bolus surfactant therapy on pulmonary complications of MAS are conflicting; one small trial demonstrated a benefit in terms of air leak and duration of ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Findlay-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Findlay 1996</LINK>), but further studies have revealed no evidence of an effect on pulmonary complications (<LINK REF="REF-Lotze-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lotze 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chinese-Collaborative-Study-Group-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinese Collaborative Study Group 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maturana-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maturana 2005</LINK>). Meta-analysis of the data from these trials supports reduction in the use of ECMO, but not a reduced incidence of pulmonary complications of MAS (<LINK REF="REF-El-Shahed-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Shahed 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-03-22 21:03:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In human infants, the history of lavage as a therapy for MAS extends back to the early 1970s, when saline lavage was used in the delivery room to improve clearance of meconium from the airways of meconium-stained babies (<LINK REF="STD-Burke_x002d_Strickland-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Burke-Strickland 1973</LINK>). This technique was largely abandoned as a result of the increase in numbers of infants with transient tachypnoea after saline lavage, ascribed to lavage fluid retention in the lung (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 1976</LINK>). Isolated reports of lung lavage in infants with established MAS subsequently appeared (<LINK REF="REF-Ibara-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ibara 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mosca-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosca 1996</LINK>), in which lavage with a total volume of 20 to 40 mL/kg saline was performed, followed by bolus administration of natural surfactant. Improvement in oxygenation and carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) clearance was noted in each case. Several research groups have reported their experience of lavage with dilute surfactant in ventilated infants with MAS, on the whole suggesting improvements in oxygenation and/or duration of ventilation in comparison with historical or concurrent controls (<LINK REF="STD-Su-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Su 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lam-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lam 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kowalska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kowalska 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schl_x00f6_sser-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schlösser 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salvia_x002d_Roig_x00e9_s-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salvia-Roigés 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dargaville-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dargaville 2007</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-03-24 16:51:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recent experimental studies have suggested that lung lavage can remove meconium from the lungs in MAS, and as a result can improve lung function. In animal models of MAS, lung lavage using total fluid volumes of 10 to 60 mL/kg has resulted in considerable improvement in oxygenation and/or pulmonary mechanics, associated with removal of one-third to one-half of the meconium lodged in the airspaces (<LINK REF="REF-Paranka-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paranka 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohama-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohama 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohama-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohama 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dargaville-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dargaville 2003</LINK>). Saline, surfactant, and perfluorocarbon have been studied as potential lavage fluids. Comparative data suggest that exogenous surfactant, whether at full strength (<LINK REF="REF-Paranka-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paranka 1992</LINK>) or diluted in saline (<LINK REF="REF-Ohama-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohama 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohama-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohama 1999</LINK>), is a more effective lavage fluid than saline alone, in terms of both pulmonary function post lavage and removal of meconium from the lung. Lavage with perfluorocarbon appears to be superior to saline lavage (<LINK REF="REF-Marraro-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marraro 1998</LINK>) but less effective than dilute surfactant lavage (<LINK REF="REF-Dargaville-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dargaville 2003</LINK>). The volume of each lavage aliquot is another determinant of lavage efficacy, with aliquot volumes of 15 mL/kg being more effective than multiple 2- to 3-mL aliquots (<LINK REF="REF-Dargaville-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dargaville 2003</LINK>), or aliquots of 8 mL/kg (<LINK REF="REF-Dargaville-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dargaville 2008</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-06-21 02:16:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At present, the therapeutic emphasis in MAS is on providing supportive care, with little or no effort directed towards removal of meconium from the lung as a means of halting disease progression. Recent data suggest that meconium can be safely removed from the airspaces in MAS by lung lavage. The objective of this review is to critically appraise the data from controlled trials of lavage therapy in human infants with MAS, and thereby evaluate the efficacy and safety of lung lavage as a treatment for this disease. The following systematic review evaluates randomised controlled trials that have studied the efficacy of lung lavage therapy in infants with MAS.</P>

<P>The quality of eligible studies was assessed using The Cochrane Collaboration&#8217;s tool for assessing the risk of bias for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Two review authors performed the assessment, and they resolved any difference of opinion by involving coauthors in the discussion.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the following criteria: </P>
<UL>
<LI>Sequence<B> </B>generation (checking for possible selection bias): For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as follows:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator).</LI>
<LI>High risk (any nonrandom process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number).</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk. </LI>
</UL>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias): For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as follows: </LI>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes).</LI>
<LI>High risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth).</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Blinding (checking for possible performance bias): For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as follows:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for participants.</LI>
<LI>Low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for personnel.</LI>
<LI>Low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for outcome assessors. </LI>
</UL>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, and protocol deviations): For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data, including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomly assigned participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we included missing data in the analyses again.

<UL>
<LI>Low risk (&lt; 20% missing data).</LI>
<LI>High risk (&#8805; 20% missing data).</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Selective reporting bias: For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as follows:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported). </LI>
<LI>High risk (where not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; or study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported).</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Other sources of bias: For each included study, we described any important concerns that we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether a potential source of bias was related to the specific study design, or whether the trial was stopped early as the result of some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as follows:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk; high risk; unclear risk.  </LI>
</UL>
<LI>Overall risk of bias [described in Table 8.5c in the Handbook]. </LI>
</UL>

<LINK REF="STD-Wiswell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wiswell 2002</LINK> performed a phase I/II randomised controlled trial of surfactant lavage in conventionally ventilated infants with MAS who were at least 35 weeks' gestation and less than 72 hours of age, and had an oxygenation index (OI) between 8 and 25 inclusive on two separate blood gas analyses within a three-hour period. Surfactant lavage was performed at a mean age of 14 hours using 6 aliquots of 8 mL/kg of KL<SUB>4</SUB> (Surfaxin, Discovery Laboratories Inc, Doylestown, PA). The concentration of surfactant phospholipid was 2.5 mg/mL for the first four aliquots, and 10 mg/mL for the last two. Each lavage aliquot was instilled via the endotracheal tube while positive end-expiratory pressure continued, followed by closed endotracheal suctioning for 10 seconds, during which positive-pressure ventilation was re-instituted. The infant's physiological state was allowed to recover after each lavage aliquot before the next was administered. After the final aliquot, positive end-expiratory pressure was maintained at 6 to 8 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O for at least two hours. Control infants received conventional mechanical ventilation and standard supportive measures at the discretion of the site study investigator. In both groups, a treatment failure criterion (OI &gt; 25 or OI 50% above baseline) had to be reached before rescue therapies such as high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), bolus surfactant therapy, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and ECMO could be used.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Dargaville-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dargaville 2011</LINK> performed a multicenter randomised controlled trial of diluted surfactant lavage in infants who had a diagnosis of MAS.

Surfactant lavage was performed at a mean age of 13 hours using two aliquots of 15 mL/kg of bovine surfactant (Survanta, Abbott Laboratories, Columbus, OH) diluted with saline to a phospholipid concentration of 5 mg/mL. Lavage fluid was instilled over 20 seconds through a dispensing catheter with the ventilator circuit disconnected. Three positive-pressure inflations were then administered, followed by disconnection of the ventilator circuit and suctioning of the instilled fluid.

Surfactant lavage was performed with a total lavage volume of 15 mL/kg and an aliquot volume of 3.75 mL/kg at the mean age of 9.7 hours, using diluted bovine surfactant (Survanta) at a phospholipid concentration of 5 mg/mL. Lavage and suctioning were conducted via a closed system in four body positions: on the right and left sides, and in the Trendelenburg and anti-Trendelenburg positions. After the lavage treatment, one dose of bolus surfactant (Survanta, 100 mg/kg) was given. The control group received one dose of bolus surfactant (Survanta, 100 mg/kg) and conventional treatment.

<P>In the study by Wiswell et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wiswell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wiswell 2002</LINK>), randomisation was performed by drawing a randomisation slip from a closed envelope, with an allocation ratio of 2:1 (lavage:standard care). Treatment was not blinded to the clinical team, although the one-year follow-up was performed by an investigator who was blinded to the allocation. No exclusions were noted after randomisation, although three of the 15 infants randomly assigned to surfactant lavage did not receive the complete lavage series, two infants received only four of the scheduled six lavage aliquots, and another received only two aliquots. For the purposes of analysis, all infants were included in their respective allocation groups. Other bias may have existed in that the number of infants receiving rescue therapy exceeded the number reaching treatment failure criteria, even though rescue therapies were not permitted unless infants met treatment failure. The study was conducted without a formal sample size calculation and based on an estimate for assessing safety and potential efficacy in a rather exploratory fashion.</P>
<P>The study by Dargaville et al (<LINK REF="STD-Dargaville-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dargaville 2011</LINK>) described an adequate process of randomisation and allocation concealment.

</B>
<BR/>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wiswell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wiswell 2002</LINK>), the instillation and recovery of the six lavage aliquots took 50 to 60 minutes. In two infants the hypoxaemia that occurred during lavage was sufficiently pronounced to halt the lavage procedure. Overall 5 of 15 infants required hand ventilation to recover oxygen saturation after lavage. In one other infant, the lavage procedure was stopped because of hypotension, although this infant had coincident gram-negative sepsis. The occurrence and severity of episodes of hypoxaemia or hypotension are not reported in the control group, and thus it is not possible to make direct comparisons between groups. In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Dargaville-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dargaville 2011</LINK>), two infants experienced transient bradycardia at less than 100 beats per minute during lavage, with recovery by five minutes after lavage. Five infants had an oxygen saturation below 80% for longer than 10 minutes, with recovery to above 90% within 40 minutes in all cases. Six infants needed treatment for hypotension during or immediately after lavage. Overall, cardiopulmonary indices were affected transiently, and the lavaged infants and the control infants showed similar blood gas indices at four hours post lavage. One infant died of intractable pulmonary hypertension three hours after lavage.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-03-29 12:31:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Therapeutic lung lavage is an emerging treatment for MAS, which, by virtue of removal of meconium from the lung, would appear to have a potential advantage over the supportive measures currently employed for this condition. This review has identified three small randomised controlled trials of lung lavage using surfactant (<LINK REF="STD-Wiswell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wiswell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gadzinowski-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gadzinowski 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dargaville-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dargaville 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the meta-analysis of the trials comparing surfactant lavage and standard care (<LINK REF="STD-Wiswell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wiswell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dargaville-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dargaville 2011</LINK>), a significant difference was noted in the composite outcome of death or use of ECMO. Analysis of this outcome was necessary given that the availability of ECMO clearly affects mortality. Any other primary outcomes including mortality, pneumothorax, or use of ECMO did not demonstrate a significant benefit. Among the secondary outcomes examining pulmonary function, only OI at 48 hours was improved significantly in the surfactant lavage group. In one study in which a large total volume of lavage fluid was used, the lavage procedure was relatively protracted and in some cases was halted because of concern regarding hypoxaemia or hypotension (<LINK REF="STD-Wiswell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wiswell 2002</LINK>). In the other study, the lavage procedure was completed in all infants, but some experienced transient bradycardia and hypotension.</P>
<P>The two studies comparing surfactant lavage with standard care varied considerably in the severity of disease of enrolled infants at the time of recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Wiswell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wiswell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dargaville-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dargaville 2011</LINK>). In the study of Wiswell et al, infants with MAS of lesser severity were targeted (mean OI 12 at enrolment), and no deaths and relatively rapid weaning from ventilation were noted, in particular in the lung lavage group. By contrast, the other study focused on infants with severe disease (mean OI 25 at enrolment) (<LINK REF="STD-Dargaville-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dargaville 2011</LINK>). In this case, no difference was discernible in duration of mechanical ventilation, which was relatively prolonged in both groups, but fewer infants who underwent lavage died or required ECMO. This suggests that lung lavage has the greatest potential for benefit in infants with severe disease, although the possibility of an impact in milder cases on duration of ventilation or other pulmonary outcomes needs further exploration.</P>
<P>The study comparing surfactant lavage followed by bolus surfactant with surfactant bolus therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Gadzinowski-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gadzinowski 2008</LINK>) did not show an effect on mortality, pneumothorax, days on mechanical ventilation, or length of hospital stay. The intervention seemed to improve oxygenation, with a lower OI at 24 hours.</P>
<P>Because of the small number of RCTs and the lack of sufficient numbers of infants randomly assigned, the evidence regarding lung lavage in MAS is thought to be insufficient to allow firm conclusions, although a beneficial effect is noted in some important outcomes. A recent systematic review focusing on surfactant lavage therapy reviewed existing RCTs together with non-randomised controlled studies for supporting evidence; the results of meta-analysis also suggested that surfactant lavage had significant effects on mortality and morbidity for MAS (<LINK REF="REF-Choi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choi 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses according to type of lavage fluid, lavage aliquot volume, and timing of lavage were planned. However, none of the planned subgroup analyses were possible. Additional studies will be needed to fully assess the impact of these factors on the success of lung lavage in MAS.</P>
<P>Of the few RCTs identified, only one was judged to have a low risk of bias. The protocols of the other two studies were unavailable for full assessment.</P>
<P>Further randomised controlled trials of lung lavage are needed to properly evaluate the safety and efficacy of this treatment. A phase III RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Segal-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 2012</LINK>) evaluating the effect of surfactant lavage compared with standard care had been registered, and is recorded to have been terminated without completion. One trial comparing lavage with diluted surfactant versus standard care is currently under way (<LINK REF="STD-McNamara-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McNamara 2006</LINK>) and is aiming to recruit 60 infants. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sur_x002d_Lu_x002d_Lav-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sur-Lu-Lav 2011</LINK>) undertaken to investigate the effect of surfactant lavage compared with standard care is registered.</P>
