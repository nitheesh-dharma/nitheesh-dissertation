<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Newborn infants maintained in the appropriate temperature range have a better chance of surviving. When newborn infants are within the appropriate temperature range, they burn less energy and have improved growth. The concept of an incubator with additional insulation, namely a double wall of plexiglass, is appealing as it may help very low birth weight infants maintain this appropriate temperature environment. We assessed the effects of double wall incubators compared to single wall incubators on the energy needs and water balance of very low birth weight infants. In addition, we looked at important clinical outcomes such as growth, length of hospital stay and survival. Three studies were found that met our criteria. The double wall incubators had advantages as far as decreasing heat loss and decreasing heat production. These infants seemed to be in the best temperature range, as their need to burn energy was less. However, these effects were small and did not provide any evidence of any long-term improvement regarding duration of hospitalization or survival. Although it appears that caring for extremely small infants in double wall incubators may result in certain metabolic advantages, this review was unable to find any data in the literature to support or refute this theory. Available data is insufficient to directly guide clinical practice.</P>

<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of electronic databases: Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to 2006), EMBASE, previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conference and symposia proceedings, expert informants in all published languages, and CINAHL (1982 to 2006).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-01-04 09:23:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three studies met the criteria. Four other studies were excluded, as they did not compare double versus single wall incubators. Double wall incubators have the advantage of decreasing heat loss, decreasing heat production and decreasing radiant heat loss when compared to single wall incubators. There is also the advantage of reduced oxygen consumption. A minimal increase in conductive heat loss was noted when compared to single wall incubators. All of these effects are small and do not support the proposition that double wall incubators have a beneficial effect on long-term outcomes including mortality or the duration of hospitalization.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although it appears that caring for extremely small infants in double wall incubators may theoretically result in shorter hospitalization and may have metabolic advantages, this review was unable to find any data in the literature to support or refute this hypothesis. The studies do not provide any evidence that the small decrease in heat loss improves clinical outcome. Therefore, the available data is insufficient to directly guide clinical practice. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-04 09:16:27 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-01-04 09:15:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An association between survival of the newborn and environmental temperature has been long recognized. Incubators were first used by the obstetrician Tarnier in Paris in the 1830s (<LINK REF="REF-Berthod-1887" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berthod 1887</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Southwick-1890" TYPE="REFERENCE">Southwick 1890</LINK>). In the United States, commercial manufacture of an incubator was first begun in 1893. With the end of World War II, newly designed incubators with walls made of thin lucite were introduced. The practice of placing infants in these transparent boxes, without clothing, quickly became routine. Silverman and colleagues, in a series of randomized controlled trials published in the 1950's and 1960's using humidity and varying ambient temperatures, showed that the survival of the premature infant could be increased by reducing heat loss by either increasing ambient temperature or by increasing ambient humidity (<LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1957</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1958</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-01-04 09:16:14 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The modern incubator incorporates a transparent plastic hood with various access ports. A warming device is positioned under the bed surface and air is forced over the warming element. The infant's temperature is regulated by controlling the air temperature within the hood (to provide an optimal thermoneutral environment) or by servo-controlling the heating device to the infant's skin temperature. Four different modes of heat loss (conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation) are involved in the maintenance of a stable body temperature. Heat transfer by conduction occurs directly from the skin of the infant to the mattress surface. Convection is dependent on air flow, which is kept at a minimum, and on air temperature (not permitted to exceed 39<SUP>o</SUP>C) in the incubator. Radiation is direct heat transfer by electromagnetic radiation in the infrared spectrum. Heat may be gained by radiation if an external radiant energy source is used, or lost by radiation to the cooler walls of the incubator. Evaporative processes result in heat loss from the baby and can be limited by providing maximum relative humidity within the incubator.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-01-04 09:16:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The relative importance of the four mechanisms of heat loss (convection, conduction, radiation and evaporation) were studied in the 1950's and 1960's for a clothed infant cared for in a bassinet and for a naked infant cared for in an incubator. Nursing a naked infant in a single wall incubator, heated convectively by recirculating warm air, resulted in an increase in heat loss by radiation to the cool walls of the incubator. Raising the incubator air temperature reduced this radiation loss by reducing the differential between the infant and the now warmer walls of the incubator. Double wall incubators (with an additional inner wall suspended several centimeters from the outer wall), were introduced in the 1980's. Radiant heat loss to the walls of the incubator (inner walls) directly exposed to the infant's skin was significantly reduced in the double wall incubators. Paradoxically, convective heat loss was higher because less warm air temperature was required to warm the infant when radiant heat loss was thus reduced. Double wall incubators were found to be especially helpful in the maintenance of a stable temperature in infants less than 1500 gms. Studies in the 1960's showed that a carefully regulated skin temperature at 36<SUP>o</SUP>C further reduced the death rate of low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Buetow-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buetow 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Day-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 1964</LINK>).</P>
<P>The exchange of heat between the infant's skin and the environment is influenced by the metabolic rate, insulation and permeability of the skin, as well as environmental factors such as the ambient temperature and humidity. The ability of an infant to maintain a normal temperature is dependent on the relative role each of these mechanisms of heat loss play and the ability of the infant's metabolic processes to compensate for these heat losses. A thermoneutral environment has been defined as the temperature at which the metabolic rate and oxygen consumption are the lowest. Silverman, Sinclair and Agate showed that oxygen consumption was lowest when the infant's temperature had been regulated by servo-controlling the air temperature to maintain a constant abdominal skin temperature between 36.2 and 36.5<SUP>o</SUP>C (<LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1966</LINK>).</P>

<P>All publications retrieved from the search and deemed relevant by initial screening were reviewed independently by the two review authors with the second review author being blinded to the trial authors and institution. The two review authors then independently extracted the outcome data from each of the reports that were included in the meta-analysis. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the two review authors (NL, DLP) and then compared, with any differences resolved following discussion.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-01-04 11:52:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The systematic review followed the method described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Assessment was done independently by both review authors to determine whether each report should be included or excluded from the meta-analysis. Methodological quality assessment was performed with consideration of four major sources of potential bias and methods of avoidance as follows:<BR/>1. Selection bias - blinding of randomization<BR/>2. Performance bias - blinding of intervention<BR/>3. Attrition bias - complete follow-up<BR/>4. Detection bias - blinding of outcome assessment</P>
<P>The reviewer authors (NL, DLP) made a judgement whether each of the criteria for method of avoidance of bias was met. Each criterion was given a rating of either "A" if Yes (Adequate), "B" if Can't Tell (Unclear), or "C" if No (Inadequate) and potential impact considered.</P>
<P>For the updated review in 2009, the Risk of Bias table was completed. The two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>The Risk of Bias table addressed the following questions: </P>
<P>1. Sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); inadequate (any nonrandom process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or unclear. </P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or unclear. </P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; adequate, inadequate or unclear for study personnel; and adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors and specific outcomes assessed. </P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? </P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We assessed methods as: adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data) or unclear. </P>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? </P>
<P>For each included study, we assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias as: adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or unclear. </P>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: yes; no; or unclear.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-01-07 14:17:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal Review Group with the use of relative risk and risk difference with 95% confidence intervals for continuous data was used in the analysis. The weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals was calculated for outcomes measured on a continuous scale. If appropraite, we planned on reporting the number needed to treat. The inverse variance methodology, more applicable to the meta-analysis of crossover studies, was used. Two studies ((<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1981</LINK>) had adequate data available for analysis. For the <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK> study, we did not have access to the raw data. We only had access to the estimated means, standard deviations (SDs) and standard errors (SEs) separately for double wall and single wall incubators. The mean difference in each measure (double minus single) was easily estimated as just the differences in the corresponding means. However, estimates of the SDs and SEs for the differences could not be directly obtained. For two random variables, X and Y, the variance of the difference X-Y is var(X)+var(Y)-2cov(X,Y). Because we did not have access to the raw data, we could not estimate the covariance. However, we expect the correlation (and hence covariance) to be positive. Therefore, an upper bound on the variance can be obtained by setting cov(X,Y) to 0. For each measure, we obtained estimates of the SDs and SEs of the differences using this approach. These estimates are likely conservative (too large). In the meta-analysis, the results from <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK> study will be slightly down weighted (due to overestimated SEs). We believe this is an appropriate approach, as, intuitively, it makes sense to down weight a study for which we have less information. An alternative approach would be to estimate the covariance for each measure from the other two studies. However, this could potentially result in an underestimate of the SEs in the <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK> study (if the covariance in that study were less than that from the other studies), and putting too much weight on that study in the meta-analysis. Adequate data was not available for analysis and authors of the study could not be reached to obtain raw data from the crossover trial. Subgroup analyses were performed as proposed when data permitted. JR assisted with the statistical analyses.</P>

<P>Three studies were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1983</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Marks-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1981</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK>). Details of the studies are included in the table, Characteristics of Included Studies.</P>
<P>Participants in the included trials were similar. All three studies enrolled preterm neonates (gestational age 30 to 35 wks), who were appropriate for gestational age (between 10 and 90th percentile) with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1981</LINK>, where three of the 15 babies studied were small for gestational age (SGA). Infants were two to nineteen days old at the time of testing. All of the three studies were performed in a quiet, temperature controlled room on the same day. The studies did not assess any long term outcomes.</P>
<P>Temperature measurements were made every fifteen minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1983</LINK>) or every half hour (<LINK REF="STD-Marks-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK>). Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured by open circuit technique in all three studies. Barometric pressure was recorded from an aneroid barometer, and relative humidity inside the incubator was determined from wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures (<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1981</LINK>), and precalibrated standard hygrometer (<LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK>). Infant heart rate and respiratory rate were recorded every 15 minutes. No other outcomes were measured.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Each of the included studies was a crossover design with the infant serving as his own control. The studies were quasi randomized (<LINK REF="STD-Marks-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1981</LINK> replicated latin square design; <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK> sequence of study conditions alternated; <LINK REF="STD-Bell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1983</LINK> assigned order, but no details stated). None of the studies attempted blinding of intervention or outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK> did not explain why or how 15 studies were carried out in 10 infants (multiple attempts were made to contact the authors) and <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1981</LINK> intended to study 15, but excluded five infants (one for tachycardia and the other four for failure to establish thermal equilibrium within the time period of the experiment). </P>
<P>Only short term outcomes including oxygen consumption, heat production and heat loss, physiologic parameters (heart and respiratory rate), and heat exchange data were reported in the studies. Each outcome was measured for three to five and one-half hours under each experimental condition. Given the crossover design, no attempt was made by the authors to study any long term outcome (i.e. death, length of hospitalization, time to regain birthweight, incidence of PDA). <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1981</LINK> did not state whether infants were clothed or naked, while <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1983</LINK> studied all infants naked and did not make any comparisons with clothed infants. No infants smaller than 30 weeks were studied by any of the authors, therefore, no data are available for the smaller gestational age infants. No data are available for infants &lt; 1200 gms or for those small or large for gestational age. <BR/> </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-01-04 09:29:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review includes three trials that evaluated the short term effects of double wall incubators versus single wall incubators in 28 infants 1200 to 1890 gms. All studies used the crossover design, limiting them to the study of short term effects only. No publications were identified regarding clinical outcomes, such as effects on length of hospitalization, fluid balance, time to regain birthweight or survival.</P>
<P>Two of the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Marks-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK>) demonstrated that operative conditions like humidity were similar under both experimental conditions. Two of the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK>) used servo-control to regulate the infants temperature. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1981</LINK>, the incubator temperature was similar in both experimental groups. It has been argued that the single wall incubator would require a higher air temperature because of the cooler outer wall (<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1983</LINK>). Therefore, perhaps the infants cared for in single wall incubator were below the thermoneutral zone, leading to a higher metabolic rate under those conditions. Contrary to expectation, heat storage was favored in the single wall incubators. Heat storage is of special importance in a period of growth. Energy storage is the major factor contributing to the energy cost of growth.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK> used servo-control for maintaining the skin temperatures at 36.5<SUP>o</SUP>C. Despite the use of servo-control, <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1980</LINK> was able to show a significant difference in abdominal wall temperatures between the two study conditions. In their study, the infants in a double wall incubator had higher abdominal wall temperatures. <LINK REF="STD-Bell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1983</LINK> criticized the study as the mean abdominal temperature was &lt; 36<SUP>o</SUP>C in the single wall incubator, suggesting that these infants were not in the thermoneutral zone and, therefore, had higher metabolic rates. <LINK REF="STD-Bell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1983</LINK> was able to show a difference in the incubator air temperature and temperature of the inner incubator wall in the double wall incubator as compared to the single wall incubator, suggesting that there was a higher radiant heat loss to the cooler walls of the single wall incubator. They also showed that there was an increase in convective loss (skin to air gradient). No other studies made these comparisons.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1983</LINK> concluded that under the conditions of servo-control, there was no clear advantage to double wall incubators. However, they suggested that the double wall incubator may offer added protection against rapid fluctuations in ambient air temperature when the incubator doors were opened. No studies actually tested this hypothesis.</P>
<P>Each of these studies used a very small sample size, and the crossover trial design did not lend itself to the study of any long term outcomes. Further randomized controlled trials in which larger numbers of infants are allocated to double wall incubator versus single wall incubator from birth to 32 - 34 weeks gestation during their hospitalization are necessary, especially in the smaller premature infants. Many long term issues need to be addressed: thermal and non thermal effects, mortality, morbidity including intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, incidence of nosocomial infections. Other effects such as time to regain birth weight, overall rate of growth and time to discharge will be important outcomes in order to guide clinical practice. It will be important to evaluate conditions such as addition of humidity, use of clothing, and sleep regulation.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Double wall incubators have the advantage of decreasing heat loss, decreasing heat production, and slightly reducing radiant heat loss when compared to single wall incubators. There is also an advantage in reduced oxygen consumption. A slight increase in conductive heat loss is noted. All of these effects are small. Because the studies only looked at immediate outcomes, it is not known if these short term outcomes continue over the duration of hospitalization. The results of these studies do not provide any evidence demonstrating the long term effects of these changes in the various compartments of heat loss and gain. They do not provide any evidence to directly guide clinical practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Although caring for extremely small infants in double wall incubators may theoretically result in improvements in long term clinical outcomes such as shorter hospitalization, and may have metabolic advantages, this review is unable to find any data in the literature to support or refute this hypothesis. Randomized trials with sufficient numbers of infants are needed. Special emphasis should be placed on studying the extremely low birth weight infant. Studies should include appropriate, small and large for gestational age infants. Special care is needed in the design of the studies so that not only short term and immediate clinical consequences are studied, but also clinically relevant outcomes such as weight gain, duration of hospitalization and other clinically relevant morbidities. <BR/> </P>
