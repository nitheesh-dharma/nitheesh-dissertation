[I have made a stab at this]&lt;br&gt;OUTCOMES: A primary outcome is needed from this extensive list to avoid data-dredging. [Mike thought endurance would do so i have put this first]&lt;br&gt;METHODS: rather thin with no mention of subgroup analysis, sensitivity analyses, or checking for publication bias.  &lt;br&gt;RESULTS: there appear to be huge baseline differences between the active and control groups suggesting possible problems with randomisation.  Do the authors mention this.  I think it would be possible to enter some of the data into Metaview on the basis of  the change from baseline with a standard error back calculated from the P value so that control and active groups can be compared.  This may not be worth it if full data can be obtained from the authors or will be published soon.  The current comparisons to baseline alone are not of any use (as the authors point out).  PLEASE SEE BELOW FOR MY STAB AT THIS.&lt;br&gt;DISCUSSION: I am not sure that any conclusion can be drawn about the benefit of treatment until enough data is presented to allow comparison of active and control arms.  At the moment too much emphasis is being put on the results of a flawed analysis......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;6/11/2001&lt;br&gt;Key issues discussed on the phone with Mike Greenstone:&lt;br&gt;1. He will try to find out from the authors if the patients in the 2 Newell trials overlap (pooling of totals is not appropriate if they are the same patients!) for now I have assumed they are separate and gone ahead and pooled the results from the two trials.&lt;br&gt;2. Data from the post treatment columns have been entered into RevMan for analysis to compare the results of treatment with the results of sham or no treatment; (it is not correct to separately assess the p values of the treatment results compared to its baseline and the placebo compared to placebo baseline).&lt;br&gt;3. I have entered all the data into RevMan both as change and absolute results.  Since the baselines are quite different for some outcomes I suggest change scores are the most reliable to use.&lt;br&gt;4.  No data is presented from the 3rd group in Newellb so I have deleted the reference to the effects of PR as they cannot be elicited from the data provided.&lt;br&gt;5.  Using Metaview the effect sizes can be assessed using the SMD and are not quite the same as those presented previously.  I am not sure where the other effect sizes came from so have taken them out but feel free to re-instate these if suitable data is available to back them up.  Do you have other data not shown in the abstracts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you will see I have substantially altered the results and a bit of the discussion in the review as well as adding a synopsis and making some alterations to the abstract results section.  I hoped it would be helpful to do this for you, but please get back to me about the changes suggested.  Could you check through the altered version and let me know if you are happy with it ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;chris@nntonline.net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby/ Steve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find attached ammended review which has changes made as per &lt;br&gt;Chris's instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you address the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Should WMD be calculated for RV, VC, TLC see Newall a. If so &lt;br&gt;we would need to be instructed on how to do.&lt;br&gt;I AM NOT SURE THAT THIS WOULD ADD MUCH IF IT IS FROM ONE STUDY (cjc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Re heterogenity- Chris states that post treatment scores for &lt;br&gt;endurance shows heterogenity p=0.08. However change scores for &lt;br&gt;QoL also show heterogenity p=0.07. How do we deal with this.&lt;br&gt;SINCE THERE ARE ONLY TWO STUDIES WE HAVE DECIDED TO STICK WITH A FIXED MODEL FOR THIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judy and Fidelma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;22/2/2&lt;br&gt;I am happy to sign this off and pass the review on to Paul.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-09-30 14:59:38 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="PHYS-BRO" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.16" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="7.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>A search for controlled trials of physical training in bronchiectasis only identified two early reports (abstracts) including 43 patients in total. These suggest some benefits of inspiratory muscle training on exercise capacity, quality of life and respiratory muscle function at eight weeks, but further research is needed to confirm these findings in larger numbers of people with bronchiectasis. Further research is also needed to assess the benefit of other types of physical training and pulmonary rehabilitation in bronchiectasis.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The pathophysiology of bronchiectasis may result in the development of dyspnoea and decreased exercise tolerance, both of which can impact on a patient's quality of life and ability to perform activities of daily living. There is little information regarding the benefits of physical training in bronchiectasis: however it is probable that the benefits of physical training in bronchiectasis are at least comparable to benefits demonstrated in other respiratory conditions. There is also no information regarding the effects of non-adherence to prescribed physical training in bronchiectasis. However as in patients with COPD non-adherence may contribute to a deterioration in the patient's condition and conceivably the long term prognosis. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to determine whether a prescribed regime of physical training produces improvements or prevents deterioration in physiological and clinical outcomes in bronchiectasis compared to no physical training.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi randomised controlled trials in which a prescribed regimen of physical training is compared to no physical training in patients with bronchiectasis. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We identified three studies. One was did not meet the inclusion criteria and two appeared in abstract form only. More comprehensive data will be incorporated into this review once data from those two trials are published, and when further data is made available to the authors of this review. An update search in February 2005 identified one excluded study. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Results from the two studies published in abstract showed that inspiratory muscle training compared to sham or no inspiratory muscle training improved endurance exercise capacity: Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 264 metres (95% CI 16.4 to 512 metres). Maximum inspiratory pressure (PiMax) improved: WMD 25 cms H20 (95% CI 11.6 to 38.4 cms H2O ) as did quality of life measured with the CRQ: WMD 12.4 units (95% CI 2.4 to 22.5 units). <BR/> </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review only provides evidence of the benefits of inspiratory muscle training and provides no evidence of the effect of other types of physical training (including pulmonary rehabilitation) in bronchiectasis. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-30 14:59:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Bronchiectasis can be defined as a disease that results in an abnormal dilatation of one or more bronchi. The primary cause of bronchiectasis is an insult to the respiratory tract e.g. severe pneumonia, viral infection or aspiration of a foreign body. Genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (including Kartagener's syndrome) and immunodeficiency can also result in bronchiectasis. Any one of these conditions predisposes the airways to lower respiratory colonisation by bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. </P>
<P>Although infection and obstruction are implicated in the development of bronchiectasis , the inflammatory response may also be important in disease progression: the host's response to infection may fail to completely eradicate the infecting organism and chronic colonisation is established . A vicious cycle of microbial colonisation/ infection has been proposed whereby bacteria elaborate substances toxic to the mucociliary escalator and perpetuates the failure to eliminate the organisms. The inflammatory response leads to further damage of the bronchial tree and lung parenchyma and is usually associated with excessive secretions and the development of airflow obstruction. </P>
<P>The consequences of this may include the development of chronic respiratory symptoms including cough, excessive purulent sputum, haemoptysis, breathlessness and decreased exercise tolerance. The causes of breathlessness and decreased exercise tolerance are multifactorial and may include altered pulmonary mechanics, inefficient gas exchange, decreased muscle bulk and confounding psychological morbidity. All of these factors initiate a cyclical phenomenon whereby decreased exercise tolerance leads to progressive detraining which in turn results in further reductions in exercise tolerance. </P>
<P>Physical training is defined as participation in a programme of regular vigorous physical activity designed to improve physical performance, and/or cardiovascular function and/or muscle strength (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1994</LINK>). Physical training has been shown to improve exercise tolerance and reduce symptoms of breathlessness in many patient populations including CF and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A meta-analysis of randomised trials examining the role of physical training in COPD conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1992</LINK>, indicated a small non-significant trend in favour of respiratory muscle training for most outcomes. There is little information regarding the benefits of physical training in bronchiectasis: however it is probable that the benefits of physical training in bronchiectasis are at least comparable to benefits demonstrated in other respiratory conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1997</LINK>). There is also no information regarding the effects of non-adherence to prescribed physical training in bronchiectasis. However as in patients with COPD non-adherence may contribute to a deterioration in the patient's condition and conceivably the long term prognosis.</P>
<P>This review will aim to determine the evidence base benefit for the use of physical training programmes in the management of patients with bronchiectasis. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to determine whether a prescribed regime of physical training in bronchiectasis produces improvements or prevents deterioration in physiological and clinical outcomes in bronchiectasis compared to no physical training.</P>

<P>Two reviewers (JB, FM) independently selected the trials to be included in the review using a proforma capturing the main inclusion criteria listed above. Each reviewer assessed the methodological quality of each included trial.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the RCTs was assessed using the modified version of the five point instrument proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK> and the system for assessing treatment allocation concealment used by the Cochrane Collaboration.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Electronic searches yielded a total of 38 references. Three of these were identified as potentially relevant. One was excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Choe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Choe 1996</LINK>), for details see "Excluded studies table". The other two fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the review but have been published in abstract form only. In spite of efforts to obtain complete data from these trials none has been made available to the authors of this review. It is anticipated that more complete data will be available at a later date and will be incorporated into updated versions of this review. An update search conducted in February 2005 identified one excluded study (<LINK REF="STD-Kellett-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kellett 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Both studies are described below, but will be subject to amendment upon their full journal publication. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Newall-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Newall 2000a</LINK> was a randomised controlled eight week study. NIneteen participants were involved (10 in the inspiratory muscle training group, nine in the control group). Inspiratory muscle training was carried out using a pressure threshold device. The control group had no intervention. Concealment of allocation was unclear and no drop outs were reported. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Newall-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Newall 2000b</LINK> was a randomised controlled study, conducted over an eight week period. 33 patients were randomised to receive either inspiratory muscle training (using a pressure threshold device) plus pulmonary rehabilitation (education, exercise training) or sham inspiratory muscle training plus pulmonary rehabilitation or no intervention. Twelve participants were in the active inspiratory muscle training group, 12 in the sham inspiratory muscle training group and nine in the control group. No data was available for the control group in this study.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-09-30 14:58:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>In the two trials in this review, we ranked the method of concealment unclear (Grade B). Both studies achieved a score of 1/5 on the Jadad scale however both studies are only available in abstract form and this score may change when the full text studies are published. We will, therefore, provide a clearer indication of study quality when more data becomes available.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-09-30 14:59:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>A limited amount of data was reported in abstract form on 43 participants with bronchiectasis from the two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Newall-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Newall 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newall-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Newall 2000b</LINK>). No data was available for the control group in <LINK REF="STD-Newall-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Newall 2000b</LINK>, therefore no comparison has been made between pulmonary rehabilitation and no pulmonary rehabilitation. There were considerable baseline difference between groups in the studies. Therefore the results have been presented using changes from baseline, but the absolute post treatment results are also shown as a second comparison.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">EXERCISE TOLERANCE</HEADING>
<P>The pooled results of the two studies show significant increase from baseline in the inspiratory muscle training group versus sham or no inspiratory muscle training in endurance (method of assessment not detailed), Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 264 metres (95% CI 16.4 to 512 metres). Maximal exercise capacity (incremental shuttle walking test) did not show a significant increase from baseline, WMD 54 metres (95% CI -34 to 142 metres). The post treatment results showed bigger treatment effects, but also introduced heterogeneity. The baseline endurance in the treatment group was 160 m less (500 m versus 661 m) in the treatment group in <LINK REF="STD-Newall-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Newall 2000a</LINK> and 328 m more (732 m versus 404 m) in <LINK REF="STD-Newall-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Newall 2000b</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">QUALITY OF LIFE</HEADING>
<P>The pooled results of the two studies indicate an increase in the quality of life following treatment compared to baseline in the inspiratory muscle training group versus sham or no inspiratory muscle training WMD 12.4 units on the CRQ scale (95% CI 2.38 to 22.48). Again the larger treatment effects shown in the post treatment scores relate to the higher baseline quality of life in the treatment groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">PULMONARY FUNCTION</HEADING>
<P>Pooled results from the two trials showed significant increases in maximal inspiratory pressure (PiMax) from baseline following treatment compared to baseline in the inspiratory muscle training group versus sham or no inspiratory muscle training WMD 25 cms of water (95% CI 11.6 to 38.4 cms). Post treatment analysis showed similar results.</P>
<P>At present there is no evidence from randomised control trials to indicate whether physical training in bronchiectasis has an effect on peripheral muscle strength, mass, effort and general fatigue; dyspnoea; weight; expectorated secretions; physical symptoms; number of and treatment of acute exacerbations; duration, hospitalisation, IV antibiotic courses and time off work ; oxygen saturation of the haemoglobin of arterial blood (SaO2); bone mineral density and diabetes; compliance; nutritional regimes; adverse effects and cost.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review examined the effectiveness of physical training in the management of bronchiectasis. This was in order to determine whether a prescribed regimen of physical training in bronchiectasis produces improvements or prevents deterioration, in physiological and clinical outcomes in bronchiectasis compared to no physical training.</P>
<P>Despite an exhaustive review of available literature, we only identified two relevant primary trials. Both of these trials investigated the efficacy of inspiratory muscle training in bronchiectasis. As there are only two studies the results should be viewed in the context of possible publication bias. </P>
<P>Neither study was reported to be double blinded however this quality issue must be considered in the context of the difficulty of blinding any type of physical training study. Both studies used random allocation, however neither provided details on the specific procedures used. This may be due to the fact that both studies were reported in abstract form only. In both studies the randomisation used was not successful in ensuring the groups were balanced at baseline in all measures. These quality issues effect the internal validity of the studies and justify the low Jadad scores reported. </P>
<P>The primary outcome measure in this review was exercise tolerance. Secondary outcome measures included pulmonary function tests and quality of life. Analyses of the two studies suggest that there is some evidence of the effect of inspiratory muscle training on endurance exercise capacity, lung function and quality of life but did not show any benefit in terms of maximal exercise capacity. Baseline differences make it difficult to be sure of the size of the treatment effect, and the standard deviation of the changes from baseline is not reported so has been assumed to be similar to the standard deviation of the post treatment results (this is likely to be a conservative estimate).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>It has been suggested that the magnitude of improvement from physical training programmes in patients with bronchiectasis should at least be comparable to the improvements demonstrated in other respiratory disease populations. These claims are based primarily on expert opinion of the benefits of training in bronchiectasis, albeit supported by a sound physiological rationale. This review only provides evidence of the benefits of inspiratory muscle training and provides no evidence of the effect of other types of physical training (including pulmonary rehabilitation) in bronchiectasis. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review has identified that there are no trials assessing the effect of physical training in bronchiectasis. There is a need for well designed, adequately powered, randomised controlled clinical trials to assess the net benefit (positive effects and side effects) of adherence to different forms of prescribed physical training programmes, in patients with bronchiectasis. As it is likely that the benefits and side effects of adherence to different types of physical training differs in patients with mild, moderate and severe disease, the influence of disease severity should be considered in the design of any future trial. The full benefit of any prescribed physical training is unlikely to be demonstrated in programmes that are of insufficient length or intensity. Therefore any future trial should be of sufficient duration, intensity and frequency to assess the net benefit of training on measures of disease impairment, disability and handicap. Further research should also consider whether physical training programmes delivered within the context of a pulmonary rehabilitation program offers any additional advantages to physical training alone. </P>
