<P>We made the following corrections to the published review:</P>
<UL>
<LI>We added a new paragraph to <LINK TAG="EFFECT_MEASURES" TYPE="SECTION">Measures of treatment effect</LINK> &#8220;We used SMD to determine the overall effect of the BIS on requirements of the three volatile anaesthetics (desflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) and expressed it as standardized mean difference of minimal alveolar concentration equivalents (MAC SMD equivalents). We interpreted the SMD as follows: 0.2 represents a small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect, and 0.8 a large effect.&#8221;(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)</LI>

<LI>We added a new paragraph to <LINK TAG="AGREEMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</LINK>:The result of our updated review published in 2014 seems contradictory to the result in a recent review published in 2016 by Messina et.al .The result of our updated review published in 2014 seems contradictory to the result in a recent Cochrane review published in 2016 by Messina et.al.(<LINK REF="REF-Messina-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messina 2016</LINK>), regarding the effect of BIS-guided anaesthesia on the risk of intraoperative recall awareness. This could be explained by the differences between the two reviews. Our review focused only on studies which were conducted in surgical patients at a high risk of intraoperative recall awareness. Whereas <LINK REF="REF-Messina-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messina 2016</LINK>, included studies with mixed groups of surgical patients (with or without risk of intraoperative recall awareness). Furthermore, our review performed sub-group analyses based on studies using clinical signs or ETAG as their anaesthetic guide in the standard practice group. While <LINK REF="REF-Messina-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messina 2016</LINK>, included all studies regardless as to whether they used clinical signs or ETAG as an anaesthetics guide in the standard practice group. The result favouring BIS monitoring for definite awareness could only be demonstrated y in our sub-group analysis, where clinical signs were used as an anaesthetic guide in the standard practice group.</LI>

<P>The results from this updated review indicate that BIS can be useful in guiding the anaesthetic dose to avoid the risk of intraoperative awareness in surgical patients at high risk for awareness. Furthermore, anaesthesia guided by BIS improves anaesthetic delivery and recovery from anaesthesia.</P>
<P>General anaesthesia requires multiple agent administration to achieve unconsciousness (hypnotics), muscle relaxation, analgesia and haemodynamic control. Many anaesthesiologists rely on clinical signs alone to guide anaesthetic management. BIS is a scale derived from the measurement of cerebral electrical activity in anaesthetized patients so that the level of anaesthesia and drug delivery can be optimized. We systematically reviewed 36 randomized controlled studies to find out whether BIS could reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness and reduce anaesthetic use and recovery times in adult surgical patients. The risk of intraoperative awareness was determined in selected patients who were at potentially high risk for awareness. Four studies (7761 patients) that used clinical signs as a guide to anaesthetic administration in standard practice, as the control group, demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of awareness with BIS monitoring. Four studies (26,530 patients) compared BIS monitoring with end tidal anaesthetic gas (ETAG) monitoring as a guide to management of anaesthesia and they did not demonstrate any difference in terms of intraoperative awareness. There was an overall reduction in volatile anaesthetic dose and the dose of propofol in the BIS group. Recovery from anaesthesia was quicker and postanaesthesia recovery care unit stay was shorter. The limitations of some of the clinical trials on BIS are discussed.</P>
<P>We reran the searches in February 2017. Fourteen potential new studies of interest were added to a list of &#8216;Studies awaiting Classification'. In total there are now 17 studies awaiting classification. We will deal with studies of interest when we update the review. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-30 15:58:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 36 trials. In studies using clinical signs as standard practice, the results demonstrated a significant effect of the BIS-guided anaesthesia in reducing the risk of intraoperative awareness among surgical patients at high risk for awareness (7761 participants; odds ratio (OR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.48). This effect was not demonstrated in studies using end tidal anaesthetic gas (ETAG) monitoring as standard practice (26,530 participants; OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.26). BIS-guided anaesthesia reduced the requirement for propofol by 1.32 mg/kg/hr (672 participants; 95% CI -1.91 to -0.73) and for volatile anaesthetics (desflurane, sevoflurane, isoflurane) by 0.65 standardized mean difference of minimal alveolar concentration equivalents (MAC SMD equivalences) (95% CI -1.01 to -0.28) in 985 participants. Irrespective of the anaesthetics used, BIS reduced the following recovery times: time for eye opening (2557 participants; by 1.93 min, 95% CI -2.70 to -1.16), response to verbal command (777 participants; by 2.73 min, 95% CI -3.92 to -1.54), time to extubation (1501 participants; by 2.62 min, 95% CI -3.46 to -1.78), and time to orientation (373 participants; by 3.06 min, 95% CI -3.63 to -2.50). BIS shortened the duration of postanaesthesia care unit stay by 6.75 min (1953 participants; 95% CI -11.20 to -2.31) but did not significantly reduce the time to home readiness (329 participants; -7.01 min, 95% CI -30.11 to 16.09).</P>

<P>BIS-guided anaesthesia can reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness in surgical patients at high risk for awareness in comparison to using clinical signs as a guide for anaesthetic depth. BIS-guided anaesthesia and ETAG-guided anaesthesia may be equivalent in protection against intraoperative awareness but the evidence for this is inconclusive. In addition, anaesthesia guided by BIS kept within the recommended range improves anaesthetic delivery and postoperative recovery from relatively deep anaesthesia<I>.</I>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-13 13:20:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-05-11 00:31:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The practice of anaesthesia is based on the concept of components of anaesthesia resulting from separate pharmacological actions of multiple agent administration (<LINK REF="REF-Kissin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kissin 1997</LINK>). Many anaesthesiologists rely on somatic signs (motor responses, changes in respiratory pattern) and autonomic signs (tachycardia, hypertension, lacrimation, sweating) to guide the dosages of anaesthetic agents in order to achieve the basic goals of anaesthetic management; that is unconsciousness (hypnotic effects), blockade of somatic motor responses, and suppression of autonomic responses to noxious stimulation. However, these clinical signs are not reliable measures of the conscious state of anaesthetized patients (<LINK REF="REF-Mahla-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahla 1997</LINK>). The use of these clinical signs in judging the dosages of anaesthetic agents can lead to either overdosage or underdosage, which can result in adverse effects due to too deep or too light anaesthesia. Furthermore, there has been much concern regarding intraoperative awareness, which is an uncommon phenomenon occurring in about 0.1% to 0.2% of the general surgical population (<LINK REF="REF-Sebel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sebel 2004</LINK>) but which can lead to a serious psychological disturbance called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), resulting in major depression and suicide. The incidence may approach 1% in surgical patients at high risk for intraoperative awareness such as patients with poor cardiac reserve, or undergoing cardiac surgery or caesarean section, where doses of anaesthetics have to be reduced to a light level of anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Mashour-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mashour 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myles-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Myles 2004</LINK>). From a review of reported cases of intraoperative awareness, too light anaesthesia could account for 87% of the cases (<LINK REF="REF-Ghoneim-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghoneim 2009</LINK>). Hence, strategies to provide optimal anaesthesia depth are required to avoid too light anaesthesia.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-05-01 08:33:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The bispectral index (BIS) is a dimensionless numerical scale for measuring brain electrical activity. It is derived from cerebral electrical activity (an electroencephalogram (EEG)) captured from the scalp surface at the forehead to reflect the sedative and hypnotic components of anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Rampil-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rampil 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schneider-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 2010</LINK>). Its value is a number within a range between 0 to 100, where 0 represents 'no detectable brain electrical activity' and 100 represents 'awake state'.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-05-01 08:35:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>BIS has been recommended to guide doses of anaesthetics to achieve optimal depth of anaesthesia in individual patients. This is in order to avoid unnecessarily deep or too light anaesthesia due to overdosage or underdosage of the hypnotic medications during maintenance and recovery from anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sebel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sebel 2001</LINK>). The recommended range of BIS is between 40 to 60 during maintenance of anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Avidan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Avidan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myles-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Myles 2004</LINK>) and 55 to 70 at 15 minutes prior to the end of surgery.(<LINK REF="STD-Gan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gan 1997</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-05-13 13:20:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Several studies were conducted to assess the effect of BIS monitoring on the utilization of currently available anaesthetic agents, such as propofol, desflurane and sevoflurane (<LINK REF="STD-Gan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelskyla-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nelskyla 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Song 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Song 1998</LINK>). There was a survey among anaesthesiologists regarding the routine use of BIS monitoring in anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Johansen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 1998</LINK>). Although the majority of the respondents found that the monitor was easy to use, and it provided useful information, their comments revealed some ambivalence towards hypnotic titration using a BIS monitor. Most respondents felt that no changes occurred in their individual drug usage. Some respondents who reported a change in their practice felt that the hypnotic medication use might decrease while analgesic and haemodynamic control agent use might increase. A previous study by Song et al (<LINK REF="STD-Song-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Song 1997</LINK>) reported an increased use of mivacurium in the BIS-targeted group. <LINK REF="REF-Badrinath-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badrinath 1999</LINK> reported an increase in the use of intraoperative opioids in the BIS-guided group. The increased use of either a muscle relaxant or an opioid analgesic might relate to the ability to maintain 'lighter' planes of anaesthesia with BIS, to avoid movement and increased blood pressure or heart rate during the operation. Thus, the impact of BIS monitoring on drug usage in routine clinical practice remains to be confirmed.</P>
<P>Since 1977, several articles and abstracts regarding the utility of BIS have been published by numerous medical researchers and academic institutions. It has been suggested that close titration of anaesthetic effect with the BIS monitor may improve some measures of patient outcomes and operating suite efficiency. However, the results are still contradictory across studies. Many studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Anez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boztug-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Boztug 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kreuer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kreuer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muralidhar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Muralidhar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tufano-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tufano 2000</LINK>) have reported a significant improvement in anaesthetics delivery in terms of reduced anaesthetic consumption or requirements and improved recovery profiles but some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruhn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bruhn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kreuer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kreuer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luginbuhl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Luginbuhl 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zohar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zohar 2006</LINK>) have failed to demonstrate these effects. Moreover, the decreased anaesthetic consumption and enhanced recovery by BIS-guided anaesthesia has to be weighed against the cost of BIS monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Paventi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Paventi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yli_x002d_Hankala-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yli-Hankala 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nowadays, the impact of BIS monitoring on the incidence of intraoperative awareness is a matter of interest in anaesthesia practice. The optimisation of the depth of anaesthesia may avoid too light anaesthesia which may result in intraoperative awareness. However, because of the low incidence of intraoperative awareness in an unselected surgical population undergoing surgeries with low risk of intraoperative awareness, an extremely large number of patients would be needed to determine the effects of BIS on awareness <U>(</U>

<P>We assessed risk of bias separately for the different domains, namely sequence generation of randomization process; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias. The bias risk was classified as 'yes' for low risk of bias, 'no' for high risk of bias, and 'unclear' for unknown risk of bias due to insufficient information.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-08-30 15:58:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used mean difference (MD) as the effect measure for continuous variables having the same units across the studies and standardized mean difference (SMD) for variables with different scales of measurement. For binary outcomes, such as the occurrence of intraoperative awareness, we used the odds ratio (OR) calculated by the Peto method as the effect measure.</P>
<P>In order to determine the overall effect of the BIS on the requirements for volatile anaesthetics, we converted the end tidal concentrations of volatile anaesthetics into minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) equivalents (MAC is the alveolar concentration of an anaesthetic at 1 ATM (1 ATM = 760 mm Hg) that prevents movement in response to surgical stimuli in 50% of patients). The MACs of desflurane, sevoflurane and isoflurane are 6.0, 1.8 and 1.15 for people aged 30 to 60 years; and 5.17, 1.45 and 1.0 for people older than 65 years, respectively. For studies that reported the use of volatile anaesthetics in MAC hours, for example in <LINK REF="STD-Luginbuhl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Luginbuhl 2003</LINK>, we divided this value by the duration of anaesthesia.</P>
<P>We used SMD to determine the overall effect of BIS on the requirement for three volatile anaesthetics (desflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) and expressed it as standardized mean difference of minimal alveolar concentration equivalents (MAC SMD equivalents). We interpreted the SMD as follows: 0.2 represents a small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect, and 0.8 a large effect (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>To determine the overall effect of BIS on requirements of propofol, we calculated the MD of the infusion rate of propofol (mg/kg/hr). In study reports using &#956;g/kg/hr we converted the units to mg/kg/hr.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-03 08:37:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have found that BIS-guided anaesthesia can reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness in surgical patients at high risk for awareness compared to using CS as the guide to anaesthetic practice (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). BIS-guided and ETAG-guided anaesthesia may be equivalent in protection against intraoperative recall awareness but the evidence for this is inconclusive <U>(</U>
<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). In addition, anaesthesia guided by keeping the BIS within the recommended range can improve anaesthetic delivery and postoperative recovery from relatively deep anaesthesia. Furthermore, we have found that BIS-guided anaesthesia can significantly reduce anaesthetic recovery times and consumption.</P>
<P>The relatively light anaesthesia in BIS-guided anaesthesia has raised concerns about an increased requirement for narcotic analgesics and muscle relaxants to manage clinical signs of inadequate analgesia and relaxation. However, our current review has failed to demonstrate an effect of BIS-guided anaesthesia on requirements for narcotic analgesics. Furthermore, only few studies (<LINK REF="STD-Song-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Song 1997</LINK>) looked at the increased use of muscle relaxants in the BIS-quided group. Hence, our current review has not confirmed whether or not BIS-guided anaesthesia increases the use of narcotic analgesics and muscle relaxants.</P>
<P>One concern regarding the use of BIS is the cost. In this systematic review, <LINK REF="STD-Paventi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Paventi 2001</LINK> was the only RCT that directly compared the costs for the two groups. However, only the costs of the drugs and BIS monitoring were compared. To provide sufficient evidence to support the cost-benefit of BIS monitoring, a full economic evaluation is required. From a recent decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 2013</LINK>), an offset against cost savings regarding the reduced use of anaesthetics drugs could be the additional cost of depth of anaesthesia monitoring. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of depth of anaesthesia monitoring appears to depend on the effectiveness of the depth monitoring in reducing intraoperative awareness and its psychological sequelae.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-05-03 08:55:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review presents some evidence supporting the use of BIS to provide optimal depth of anaesthesia, avoiding unnecessarily high doses of anaesthetics. We have found a consistency across studies (80%) in a decreased propofol infusion rate. This information is very useful for anaesthesia providers who provide total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol.</P>
<P>We have found that, regardless of the anaesthetics used, BIS-guided anaesthesia reduces all components of early recovery times, that is time to eye opening, response to verbal command, extubation and orientation. This information will help anaesthesia providers to tail off doses of anaesthetics at the end of surgery to optimal light levels of anaesthesia, by using the BIS, and to facilitate recovery from anaesthesia. Despite a decreased PACU stay, our review did not demonstrate the impact of BIS-guided anaesthesia on time to home readiness following ambulatory surgery. Factors that might have affected the discharge following the ambulatory surgery were not only anaesthetic or surgical factors, such as drowsiness, nausea and vomiting, and pain, but also a system factor such as lack of immediate availability of an escort (<LINK REF="REF-Pavlin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavlin 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>From our systematic review, we have provided sufficient evidence supporting the use of BIS to guide doses of anaesthetics in the prevention of intraoperative awareness in either selected (<LINK REF="STD-Myles-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Myles 2004</LINK>) or unselected (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2011</LINK>) risk groups for intraoperative awareness. However, we have failed to demonstrate either the superiority or the inferiority of BIS monitoring over ETAG monitoring in guiding the delivery of volatile anaesthetics on the incidence of intraoperative awareness. From the combined result it seems that the effects of both the BIS and ETAG techniques were equivalent on the incidence of intraoperative awareness, however a good quality equivalence trial is required to provide stronger evidence regarding this matter.</P>
<P>In our current review we have not evaluated the impact of BIS-guided anaesthesia on the incidence of other outcomes such as postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and mortality.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-05-03 09:03:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found clinical heterogeneity across the studies in this review in anaesthetic administration, the protocol for management of insufficient anaesthesia or analgesia, and clinical endpoints (see Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). This could explain the statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 50%) of the trial results in our review. Therefore, we decided to combine the results using the random-effects model and found that BIS-guided anaesthesia could significantly reduce anaesthetic recovery times. Furthermore, we tried to explore the high statistical heterogeneity regarding the measured reduced anaesthetic consumption (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). We found extremely different results from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruhn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bruhn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Song 1997</LINK>), which went in opposite directions. <LINK REF="STD-Song-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Song 1997</LINK> favoured BIS (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.1; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.2) and <LINK REF="STD-Bruhn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bruhn 2005</LINK> favoured CS (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.1).

However, the removal of these studies from the analyses did not change the conclusion regarding the decreased requirement of anaesthetics in the BIS group.

Although some studies did not mention blinding with regard to the outcome assessors, both patients and the outcome assessors were blinded to the allocation assignment in most studies (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), particularly in those concerned about intraoperative awareness (<LINK REF="STD-Avidan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Avidan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avidan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Avidan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mashour-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mashour 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myles-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Myles 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2011</LINK>). From the sensitivity analyses, the exclusion of studies with an unclear blinding procedure did not affect the conclusion for the main outcome (intraoperative awareness).</P>
<P>Anaesthesia providers participating in the trials were not blinded to the assigned group. This could introduce a 'learning contamination' bias, which involves changing clinical practice in the parallel control or unmonitored group by using the information from the BIS group (<LINK REF="REF-Roizen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roizen 1994</LINK>). This could have affected the results in some studies, which failed to demonstrate a reduction of the requirement for anaesthetics and recovery times with BIS monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Bruhn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bruhn 2005</LINK>).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-08-30 16:00:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results from our analysis were similar to the results from a previous meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2004</LINK>), which was conducted in ambulatory surgical patients. The greater use of anaesthetics in the standard practice group of many studies indicated that the anaesthesia providers tended to use high doses of hypnotics (in a hypnotic-based anaesthesia regimen) to manage signs of inadequate anaesthesia or analgesia, which resulted in too deep anaesthesia as indicated by the BIS values in some studies (see Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Hence, BIS-guided anaesthesia could be helpful in optimising the dose of hypnotics.</P>
<P>There have been debates for years (<LINK REF="STD-Avidan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Avidan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myles-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Myles 2004</LINK>) regarding the incorporation of BIS into routine practice for prevention of intraoperative awareness, particularly for surgical patients at high risk of awareness during general anaesthesia. Evidence supporting each side depends on what monitors (CS versus ETAG) to guide doses of anaesthetics in the standard practice group. In our current review we have found that BIS can significantly reduce the risk of recall awareness in studies using CS-guided anaesthesia as standard practice (<LINK REF="STD-Myles-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Myles 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2011</LINK>). For those studies in which ETAG-guided anaesthesia was used as standard practice, maintaining a concentration of end tidal anaesthetics at a target of 0.7 MAC or above might be enough to decrease the likelihood of intraoperative awareness (<LINK REF="STD-Avidan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Avidan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gonsowski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonsowski 1995</LINK>). This may explain why we have failed to demonstrate the role of BIS in prevention of intraoperative awareness in studies using ETAG-guided anaesthesia as the comparison group. However, whether BIS is equivalent to ETAG in preventing intraoperative awareness requires a large, good quality equivalence trial for confirmation.</P>
<P>The result of our updated review published in 2014 seems contradictory to the result in a recent Cochrane review published in 2016 by Messina et.al.(<LINK REF="REF-Messina-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messina 2016</LINK>), regarding the effect of BIS-guided anaesthesia on the risk of intraoperative recall awareness. This could be explained by the differences between the two reviews. Our review focused only on studies which were conducted in surgical patients at a high risk of intraoperative recall awareness. Whereas <LINK REF="REF-Messina-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messina 2016</LINK>, included studies with mixed groups of surgical patients (with or without risk of intraoperative recall awareness). Furthermore, our review performed sub-group analyses based on studies using clinical signs or ETAG as their anaesthetic guide in the standard practice group. While <LINK REF="REF-Messina-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messina 2016</LINK>, included all studies regardless as to whether they used clinical signs or ETAG as an anaesthetics guide in the standard practice group. The result favouring BIS monitoring for definite awareness could only be demonstrated y in our sub-group analysis, where clinical signs were used as an anaesthetic guide in the standard practice group. </P>

<P>BIS-guided anaesthesia can reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness in surgical patients at high risk for awareness compared to using clinical signs as the guide for anaesthetic depth. BIS-guided and ETAG-guided anaesthesia may be equivalent in protection against intraoperative awareness but the evidence for this is inconclusive. In addition, anaesthesia guided by keeping the BIS within the recommended range improves anaesthetic delivery and postoperative recovery from relatively deep anaesthesia<I>.</I>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-05-03 09:25:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. The information on the decreased risk of intraoperative recall awareness, anaesthetic use, and recovery times may be useful for further full economic evaluation in terms of the cost savings of BIS monitoring in various clinical aspects and settings in the real world.</P>
<P>2. A further large, good quality equivalence trial is needed to elucidate the effect of BIS-guided anaesthesia compared to ETGA-guided anaesthesia on the incidence of intraoperative recall awareness.</P>
<P>3. Further systematic reviews should be conducted to evaluate the impact of BIS-guided anaesthesia on the incidence of other interesting outcomes such as postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and mortality.</P>

<P>During maintenance of anaesthesia, all patients were assessed for signs of inadequate anaesthesia, hypotension or bradycardia. Inadequate anaesthesia was defined as hypertension, tachycardia or patient movement, eye-opening, swallowing, grimacing, lacrimation or sweating. The definition of adverse haemodynamic responses was adapted from Garrioch et al<SUP>15</SUP>: responses were classified as &#8216;hypertension&#8217; (SAP &gt;40 mmHg from baseline), &#8216;hypotension&#8217; (SAP &lt;40 mmHg from baseline), &#8216;tachycardia&#8217; (HR &gt;100 beats/minute<SUP>-1</SUP>) and &#8216;bradycardia&#8217; (HR &lt;45 beats/minute<SUP>-1</SUP>). In the standard practice group, if anaesthesia was judged inadequate the propofol concentration was increased in steps of 1 mg/kg/hour as necessary</P>

<P>BIS group:If the patient in that group, exhibited hypertension or tachycardia the mode of treatment was dependent on the BIS index. If the BIS index was &gt;60, anaesthesia was deepened by increasing sevoflurane concentration until BIS index was between 50 and 60. If BIS index was already in the targeted range and the patient exhibited hypertension or tachycardia, fentanyl 25-50 &#956;g IV was given. If BIS index was &lt;50, sevoflurane was decreased and patient was checked for signs of lack of analgesia (i.e., lacrimation, grimacing, movement). In case of lack of analgesia, fentanyl 25-50 &#956;g IV was administered. But if no signs of lack of analgesia, labetalol 5-10 mg IV was administered</P>
