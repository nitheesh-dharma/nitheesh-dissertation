These types of blood clots are referred to as deep vein thromboses (DVT) and they may break free from the blood vessel wall and travel to the lungs and cause death, at which point they are referred to as a pulmonary embolism (PE). These types of blood clots and their prevention have been thoroughly studied in surgical patients but not as much in non-surgical, medical patients, who make up a greater proportion of hospital patients. Medical patients differ from surgical patients with regard to their health, the progression of clots and the impact that preventative measures can have. The extensive experience from clot prevention studies in surgical patients is therefore not necessarily applicable to non-surgical patients.</P><P>Heparin is a blood thinning drug, which has been shown to reduce the occurrence of blood clots in patients after they have had surgery. Heparin exists in two forms, the original unfractionated (UFH) form and a newer form called low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The aim of the current review is to determine the effectiveness and safety of heparin (UFH or LMWH) to prevent DVTs and PEs in non-surgical, medical patients admitted to hospital, excluding those admitted to hospital with a heart attack or stroke or those requiring admission to an intensive care unit. The outcomes investigated in this review were DVT, PE that did not cause death, PE that resulted in death, combined non-fatal and fatal PE, all-cause death, bleeding complications and thrombocytopaenia, which is a condition that can be caused by heparin and results in decreased platelets in the blood.</P><P>This review of 16 trials in 34,369 non-surgical patients who suffered an acute medical illness found that heparin reduced the number of patients suffering DVTs but also increased the risk of bleeding complications when compared to participants that received a placebo or no medication. We had some concerns over how reliable the results were from the unblinded studies, which made up just under half of the studies. Also, most of the studies were lacking explanations of how the allocation of the treatments was performed. The lower risk of PEs (when combining those that caused death and those that did not) with heparin could have been a chance effect. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the rate of death or thrombocytopaenia. The review also found that patients who were given LMWH developed fewer DVTs and fewer bleeding complications compared with those given UFH, leading to the conclusion that LMWH is more effective and carries a lower risk of adverse events in preventing blood clots than with UFH. There was no clear evidence of differences between LMWH and UFH for PE, death or thrombocytopaenia.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-02-15 11:26:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-10 06:44:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Venous thromboembolic disease has been extensively studied in surgical patients.

Two review authors extracted the data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We performed the meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model with the results expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-18 13:10:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Sixteen studies with a combined total of 34,369 participants with an acute medical illness were included in this review. We identified 10 studies comparing heparin with placebo or no treatment and six studies comparing LMWH to UFH. Just under half of the studies had an open-label design, putting them at a risk of performance bias. Descriptions of random sequence generation and allocation concealment were missing in most of the studies. Heparin reduced the odds of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.67; P = 0.0004) . The estimated reductions in symptomatic non-fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.20 to 1.07; P = 0.07), fatal PE (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.15; P = 0.16) and in combined non-fatal PE and fatal PE (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.02; P = 0.06) associated with heparin were imprecise. Heparin resulted in an increase in major haemorrhage (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.71; P = 0.05). There was no clear evidence that heparin had an effect on all-cause mortality and thrombocytopaenia. Compared with UFH, LMWH reduced the risk of DVT (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96; P = 0.02) and major bleeding (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.83; P = 0.01). There was no clear evidence that the effects of LMWH and UFH differed for the PE outcomes, all-cause mortality and thrombocytopaenia.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-10 06:53:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The data from this review describe a reduction in the risk of DVT in patients presenting with an acute medical illness who receive heparin thromboprophylaxis. This needs to be balanced against an increase in the risk of bleeding associated with thromboprophylaxis. The analysis favoured LMWH compared with UFH, with a reduced risk of both DVT and bleeding.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-02-15 11:26:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-11 08:40:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-10 07:07:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major health problem, the significance and seriousness of which is often not fully appreciated. VTE is one of the most important preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in hospital patients, having an annual incidence of one per 1000 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Dahlback-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahlback 2008</LINK>). Most clinicians, whatever their specialty, will experience patients with this condition.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-10 07:08:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>During the past 40 years numerous studies have shown that UFH and LMWH are effective and safe for the prevention of VTE in surgical patients (<LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2008</LINK>). This has led to the widespread use of these agents for thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients with a resultant reduction in the incidence of fatal PE (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1996</LINK>). During the same period of time, there have been fewer trials investigating the benefits and risks of thromboprophylaxis in medical patients. Most of these studies have concentrated on specific conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI) (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1996</LINK>) and ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Gubitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gubitz 2004</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2014-04-11 08:40:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Thrombosis results from a disturbance in the balance between pro-thrombotic and antithrombotic forces that exist within the blood stream. The pro-thrombotic forces include platelets and the formation of fibrin. There are two phases of normal haemostasis; the first phase is platelet activation and adhesion, and the forming of a 'platelet plug'. In parallel, the second phase results in the activation of a series of procoagulant clotting factors, which generate a burst of thrombin, formation of fibrin and stabilisation of the platelet plug, resulting in a thrombus. When this process becomes unregulated venous thrombosis may occur in any vein in the body, although it usually occurs in the deep veins of the lower limbs. People admitted to hospital with an acute medical illness appear to be particularly at risk of suffering from thrombosis of these lower limb deep veins.</P><P>Heparin (UFH and LMWH) binds to a naturally occurring anticoagulant, antithrombin (AT), via a pentasaccharide sequence. The heparin-AT complex inactivates thrombin (factor IIa) as well as coagulation factors Xa, IXa and XIa. As a direct result of inactivating or reducing the generation of thrombin, fibrin formation is inhibited, as is thrombin directed activation of coagulation factors V, VIII and XI. In addition, thrombin mediated platelet activation is attenuated (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2012</LINK>). Therefore, heparin affects both the primary and secondary phases of thrombus formation and this is the rationale behind its use as a thromboprophylactic agent.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-04-10 12:03:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Unlike their surgical counterparts, it wasn't until the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century that physicians caring for general medical patients had convincing evidence of the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis for their patients upon which to base prescribing decisions (<LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2008</LINK>). We believe that this has resulted in the underuse of thromboprophylaxis in the medical setting (<LINK REF="REF-Alikhan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alikhan 2001</LINK>), and this continues to be a problem (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2008</LINK>). The under use may in part explain the high incidence rate of fatal PE in this patient group (<LINK REF="REF-Alikhan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alikhan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandler-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandler 1989</LINK>).

The reduction in VTE risk is comparable to that previously reported in prophylaxis studies of patients following acute myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1996</LINK>), acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Gubitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gubitz 2004</LINK>), colorectal surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Wille_x002d_J_x00f8_rgensen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wille-Jrgensen 2004</LINK>) and orthopaedic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1988</LINK>).</P><P>The analysis found no clear difference in all-cause mortality in patients receiving heparin prophylaxis. However, these studies are not powered to show a difference in mortality, which would require over 200,000 patients (assuming an overall 5% mortality, 10% of deaths due to VTE, and a 50% relative risk (RR) reduction in events).</P><P>In the presence of heparin prophylaxis the rate of major haemorrhage (0.64%) was higher than with no prophylaxis (0.36%). LMWH resulted in less major haemorrhage than UFH. This suggests a favourable benefit-risk ratio for LMWH therapy in the prevention of VTE in general medical patients.</P><P>In summary, patients hospitalised with an acute medical illness who receive UFH or LMWH thromboprophylaxis have a reduced risk of DVT, however there is an increase in major haemorrhage when compared to those who do not receive chemical thromboprophylaxis. LMWH reduced the odds of DVT compared with UFH as well as reduced the odds of major bleeding, suggesting LMWH has a better efficacy profile and carries a lower risk of adverse events compared with UFH. There are currently insufficient published data to allow analysis of outcomes of interest based on patient medical diagnosis at hospital admission.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-04-10 12:48:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The conclusions provided in this analysis have a strong external application as the evidence was generated using 16 good quality studies that were sufficient to address the study outcomes. The 16 studies included 34,369 participants from at least 17 different countries, with the majority of studies being multi-centre, and four being multi-national.</P><P>Although this review does not identify heparin as preventing all-cause mortality in patients with an acute medical illness, it does appear to show a benefit in reducing DVT and possibly the combined outcome of symptomatic PE and fatal PE. Therefore, in patients with an acute medical illness heparin appears to reduce the risk of hospital acquired thrombosis (HAT), supporting the current medical practice of increasing awareness and advocating VTE prevention (<LINK REF="REF-NICE" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE</LINK>).</P><P>Currently, published studies are lacking outcome data specific to medical diagnosis at hospital admission. These data would help us to understand if certain patients, based on disease, would benefit more or less from thromboprophylaxis or are at a higher or lower risk of bleeding. Understanding these differences would help develop a stronger profile for the use of thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients.</P><P>Patients who develop VTE following an acute medical illness have a more severe presentation and significantly worse outcome than patients who develop VTE following surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Monreal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monreal 2004</LINK>).

All patients admitted to hospital with an acute medical illness should be risk assessed and thromboprophylaxis offered to those perceived to be at increased risk of VTE. In fact, patients are actively encouraged to question their admitting physicians as to their individual VTE risk and need for thromboprophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-NICE" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE</LINK>) in an attempt to reduce the risk of HAT.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-04-10 12:50:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Sixteen studies were used to compile evidence, 10 comparing heparin prophylaxis with no treatment or placebo and six which compared LMWH to UFH, with a total of 34,369 participants.

The meta-analysis found a statistically significant decrease in DVT (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.64; P &lt; 0.001) and clinical PE (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.68; P &lt; 0.001) when heparin was compared to control, which are consistent with our review, although Mismeti identified a stronger relationship with PE as our findings for non-fatal and fatal PE were imprecise and possibly due to chance effect. The Mismeti review found no difference in mortality, the same as our review, but they also found no difference in major bleeding, which is inconsistent with our review. No difference was observed in efficacy between UFH and LMWH in the Mismeti review, but our review found a decrease in DVT favouring LMWH. Also, our review found a decrease in major bleeding favouring LMWH, which is consistent with the Mismeti review findings.</P><P>The Mismetti review used six of the same studies as we did for the comparison of heparin to control (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bergmann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dahan 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraisse-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fraisse 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gardlund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gardlund 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ibarra_x002d_Perez-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ibarra-Perez 1988</LINK>) and one study which was excluded from our review. For the comparison between UFH and LMWH, the Mismeti study analysed four studies used in our review (<LINK REF="STD-EMSG-1996" TYPE="STUDY">EMSG 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forette-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Forette 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PRIME-1996" TYPE="STUDY">PRIME 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-THE_x002d_PRINCE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">THE-PRINCE 2003</LINK>) and five studies that we excluded. While the authors described that they excluded cases of acute ischaemic stroke and acute myocardial infarction some of the studies included patients with acute coronary disease that could not be removed for analysis. Other criteria that warranted exclusion in our review were not upheld in the Mismeti review, such as detection method and inclusion of surgical patients, which led to differences in the profile of the included studies and the minor differences seen in the results.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Dentali-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dentali 2007</LINK></P><P>A meta-analysis by Dentali et al assessed anticoagulant prophylaxis (UFH, LMWH and fondaparinux) to prevent symptomatic VTE in hospitalised medical patients (<LINK REF="REF-Dentali-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dentali 2007</LINK>). Nine trials were included in this analysis. Anticoagulant prophylaxis was associated with a borderline risk reduction in DVT (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.00), which is consistent with this review. The Dentali review found a reduction in all PE (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.71) for the prophylaxis group, but our review found no difference in non-fatal and fatal PE. It was also noted in the Dentali review that anticoagulant prophylaxis was associated with a RR 1.32 (95% CI 0.73 to 2.37) for major bleeding, where our review found a statistically significant increase in major bleeding (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.98; P = 0.02).</P><P>The Dentali review considered seven of the same studies that we included in this review for the comparison between anticoagulant prophylaxis and control (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bergmann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dahan 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraisse-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fraisse 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gardlund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gardlund 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MEDENOX-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MEDENOX 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PREVENT-2004" TYPE="STUDY">PREVENT 2004</LINK>) and two studies considered not relevant or excluded from our review. Although study inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar for the Dentali review and this review, the minor differences led to the different study profile and variations in results. A major difference is that the Dentali review included studies that observed effects of fondaparinux, and not solely heparin. Also, one included study did contain participants with a recent myocardial infarction, which excluded it from the current review.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Bump-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bump 2009</LINK></P><P>A meta-analysis published in 2009 by Bump et al compared heparin prophylaxis to control in seven studies, and LMWH to UFH in six studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bump-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bump 2009</LINK>). Comparing heparin versus control, the authors found a decreased risk of all DVT, with a RR of 0.55 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.83), and all PE, with a RR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.93) in the heparin treatment group, but no difference in mortality between the groups (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03). The findings on all DVT and all-cause mortality are consistent with our review, but our review found did not find a difference in non-fatal and fatal PE. The Bump review did not find a difference between heparin and control for major bleeding, but in our review we found major bleeding to be significantly increased in the heparin group. For the studies comparing LMWH to UFH there were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups for DVT, PE, death or bleeding. The data on PE and death are consistent with our review, but we found a decrease in DVT and major bleeding favouring LMWH.</P><P>For the comparison between heparin and control the Bump et al review included six of the same studies as in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bergmann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dahan 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gardlund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gardlund 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MEDENOX-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MEDENOX 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PREVENT-2004" TYPE="STUDY">PREVENT 2004</LINK>) with the addition of two studies that we excluded or considered not relevant. Comparing UFH to LMWH the Bump review included three of the same studies as in our review (<LINK REF="STD-EMSG-1996" TYPE="STUDY">EMSG 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PRIME-1996" TYPE="STUDY">PRIME 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-THE_x002d_PRINCE-2003" TYPE="STUDY">THE-PRINCE 2003</LINK>) with two extra studies which were excluded from our review. Although the Bump review sought to exclude trials predominantly made up of stroke or acute myocardial infarction patients, it did include studies that had some of these types of participants that could not be separated out for statistical purposes. This difference, along with the review being conducted before some of the big trials included in our review were published, has lead to a different profile of included studies and variations in results.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Lederle-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lederle 2011</LINK></P><P>A more recent meta-analysis published by Lederle et al analysed 10 studies that compared prophylaxis with heparin or related agents to no heparin and nine studies comparing LMWH with UFH, all in hospitalised medical patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lederle-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lederle 2011</LINK>). The review also analysed stroke patients, but this was performed separately and is not considered here. For studies that compared heparin prophylaxis with no heparin, a statistically significant decrease in PE was found in the heparin group with an OR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.90; P = 0.006), but our review found no difference in non-fatal and fatal PE. In the Lederle review there were no differences found for symptomatic DVT, fatal PE or all-cause mortality. The fatal PE and all-cause mortality results are consistent with our review, but DVTs were found to be statistically decreased in the heparin group compared to the placebo or no treatment group. No difference in major bleeding was observed in the Lederle review (OR 1.49; 95% CI 0.91 to 2.43; P = 0.110), whereas in our review the increase in major bleeding in the heparin arm was statistically significant. No differences were found between LMWH and UFH for efficacy or safety outcomes, but in our review we found a statistically significant decrease in both DVT and major bleeding favouring LMWH.</P><P>The Lederle review considered seven of the same studies as in the current review for the comparison between heparin and placebo or no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Belch-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Belch 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bergmann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dahan 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraisse-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fraisse 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gardlund-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gardlund 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MEDENOX-1999" TYPE="STUDY">MEDENOX 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PREVENT-2004" TYPE="STUDY">PREVENT 2004</LINK>), with the addition of three studies which were either considered not relevant or excluded from the current review.

The Lederle review extended inclusion to studies with common treatments for VTE, and not strictly heparin (which led to the inclusion of a study evaluating fondaparinux), and while studies including only acute myocardial infarction patients were excluded in the Lederle review it did include studies that had some acute coronary syndrome patients, which would have been excluded from our review. Also, the Lederle review was conducted before several newer studies were published that have been included in the current review. These differences can account for the variations in findings regarding both the heparin versus no heparin and UFH versus LMWH comparisons.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-10 13:17:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-04-10 13:13:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Evidence from this systematic review indicates that heparin (LMWH and UFH) thromboprophylaxis reduces the risk of DVT in patients with an acute medical illness (excluding stoke and myocardial infarction). The benefit of a reduction in venous thromboembolic events has to be balanced against a potential increase in the risk of bleeding. The risks of DVT and major bleeding are reduced with LMWH compared with UFH, indicating LMWH to be superior to UFH.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-10 13:17:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Medical patients in the trials included in this review received thromboprophylaxis for between six to 28 days; at present the optimum duration of prophylaxis is unknown but most guidelines recommend between six to 14 days following admission to hospital with an acute medical illness, or during the hospital stay or time of immobilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2012</LINK>). Autopsy studies have identified patients suffering a fatal PE up to six weeks after an acute medical illness (<LINK REF="REF-Alikhan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alikhan 2004</LINK>). The recently published <LINK REF="STD-EXCLAIM" TYPE="STUDY">EXCLAIM</LINK> trial showed that LMWH administered for up to 38 days reduced the rates of VTE following discharge from hospital when compared to placebo, but this was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Similar findings were found in two recent studies of extended thromboprophylaxis in medical patients, the <LINK REF="REF-ADOPT" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADOPT</LINK> trial showed a trend but no clear reduction in VTE and the <LINK REF="REF-MAGELLAN" TYPE="REFERENCE">MAGELLAN</LINK> trial showed a significant reduction in VTE. Both studies showed increased bleeding with extended therapy (<LINK REF="REF-ADOPT" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADOPT</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MAGELLAN" TYPE="REFERENCE">MAGELLAN</LINK>). These findings show that there are still questions, and little consensus, regarding optimal thromboprophylaxis duration and that further research is warranted in this area in order to determine how best to prevent VTE.</P><P>There are a number of emerging new oral direct anticoagulants which have been approved for use for thromboprophylaxis in elective orthopaedic hip and knee arthroplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Ageno-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ageno 2012</LINK>). However, studies in patients with an acute medical illness have found that the benefit of VTE reduction is outweighed by the increased risk of bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-ADOPT" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADOPT</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MAGELLAN" TYPE="REFERENCE">MAGELLAN</LINK>). Future thromboprophylaxis studies should look to individualise thromboprophylaxis, offering it to patients at high risk of VTE and low risk of bleeding.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2014-04-11 08:41:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The review authors would like to thank the PVD Group editorial base for all their assistance in updating this review.</P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2014-04-10 13:21:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Dr Alikhan has received travel expenses to attend educational meetings from the following companies marketing parenteral anticoagulants: Aventis, Leo Pharma and Pfizer.</P><P>Dr Cohen is a medical consultant and has received consultancy and clinical trial funding from many pharmaceutical companies, including Bayer, Boehringer-Ingelheim, BMS, Daiichi, GSK, Johnson and Johnson, Mitsubishi Pharma, Pfizer, Portola, Sanofi-Avenits, Schering Plough, and Takeda.

comprehensive analysis on this topic published to date. Your review helped enlighten us on the state of the evidence for an intervention that has been given a high level of importance in our clinical practice.</P><P>In your risk of bias assessment, you rate the PREVENT trial (1) as having low risk of attrition bias as &#8220;exclusions were explained and similar between groups&#8221;. Upon review of the PREVENT trial, we do not come to the same conclusion for your risk of bias assessment, and in fact believe that this trial is at high risk of attrition bias for the following reasons:</P><P>In the PREVENT trial, 1856 patients were randomized to the dalteparin intervention. The authors specified that randomized patients who had a documented clinical endpoint or evaluable compression ultrasonography exam by day 21 would be included in the primary endpoint analysis. The authors then went on to explain that patients were excluded if they did not receive the study drug (n=8), or ultrasound examination at day 21 was not evaluable (n=155) or not performed (n=175). This leaves us with 1518 patients analyzed for the primary endpoint at day 21 out of the 1856 that were randomized.</P><P>For each endpoint listed in Table 3 of the PREVENT trial, there are a vast number of patients unaccounted for. This trend in incomplete outcome data is prevalent throughout the trial for nearly all safety and efficacy endpoints and Leizorovicz et al. have made no explanation as to why these patients were excluded from their analyses.</P><P>When comparing the event rates of combined asymptomatic and symptomatic DVT in the PREVENT trial, there are 32 fewer events in the dalteparin group when compared to placebo. In Analysis 1.1 of Heparin vs Placebo for the outcome DVT in your review, the absolute difference in number of DVTs is 60. It is important to note that there are 330 patients in the PREVENT trial which have incomplete outcome data for this endpoint thus we do not know how many of them may have had an event. The magnitude of missing information is far greater than the effect size and, in our opinion, we do not believe that we can make a definitive conclusion regarding the effect size given the amount of incomplete data from this trial alone.</P><P>In addition, your review states that there is a &#8220;borderline statistically significant&#8221; reduction in combined non-fatal and fatal PE with dalteparin when compared to placebo or no treatment [OR 0.66 (0.42-1.02)]. In the PREVENT trial, there were 97 patients with incomplete outcome data for the primary endpoint of symptomatic PE in the dalteparin group for which the authors did not provide an explanation for their exclusion. We believe it is plausible that in these 97 patients with missing outcome data, some of them may have had a PE. If just two of these 97 patients had a PE, it could be argued that the results would no longer be considered &#8220;borderline statistically significant&#8221; with an OR 0.70 (0.45-1.07).</P><P>We believe that it is important for the readers of your review to understand the limitations of this study, especially as it carries the most weight in your analysis of DVT which was the only endpoint assessed in your review that demonstrated statistical significance. In light of all of this, we suggest that your risk of bias assessment be reviewed and updated accordingly for the PREVENT trial.</P><P>In addition, we were surprised to see that you made no mention of why the LIFENOX (2) trial, one of the largest studies included in your review (N=8323), was excluded from your DVT analysis. It is odd that the LIFENOX trial did not include VTE as a primary endpoint, however it is specified in their study protocol that clinical examination for VTE was performed at hospital discharge, and at days 30 and 90. The protocol also stated that enoxaparin was discontinued in patients with &#8220;positive VTE&#8221;, thus the event rate should be known by the investigators. The published results from the trial did specify that there was clinical suspicion of VTE in 0.5% of patients in the enoxaparin group (22/4072) and 0.7% of patients in the placebo group (27/4044). It is clear that the LIFENOX study authors have data regarding VTE, however you do not make any comment about this in your review and we ask whether your authors attempted to contact the study investigators for further information. As this is one of the largest studies included in your review, we believe it would contribute a great deal to your Analysis 1.1 of Heparin vs Placebo for the outcome DVT.</P><P>Based on our assessment of the incomplete outcome data from the PREVENT trial and the exclusion of VTE data from LIFENOX, we do not believe that there is definitive evidence of a significant reduction in DVT with heparin compared to placebo in acutely ill medical patients. We suggest that your review makes note of these limitations when making your final conclusion regarding the benefits of heparin in DVT prevention in medical patients.</P><P>References:</P><P>(1) Leizorovicz A, Cohen AT, Turpie AGG, Olsson C-G, Vaitkus PT, Goldhaber SZ, et al.

We would first like to say that by highlighting the issues within the PREVENT and LIFENOX studies you are drawing on some of the major issues facing systematic reviews in terms of outcome reporting. We appreciate that you take a critical role on reporting biases and it is important to always be improving techniques to identify and report on these types of biases.</P><P><B>PREVENT</B></P><P><B>Concern: There is high loss of participants that could result in increased attrition bias and concerns with outcome analysis</B></P><P>In the methods section we do note other studies included had a high loss of participants and performed sensitivity analysis on those that had a loss of 20% or great. The PREVENT trial was not included in this analysis as it did not meet the cut-off (by only 1%) but it is worth discussing if we should include PREVENT in this sensitivity analysis for the upcoming update of the review.</P><P>We would also like to note the PREVENT authors were expecting a high loss, as this is unfortunately common in these trials, and found a need of at least 1471 participants to achieve 90% power to detect a difference of &#945;=0.001 for clinically relevant VTE and sudden death at day 21. Both study arms met these requirements.</P><P>We came to the conclusion that &#8220;exclusions were explained and similar between group&#8221; because there was similarity between drop-out rates between the treatment and control group, indicating that the drop outs were unlikely to be due to the study medication and therefore low risk of attrition bias. The Dalteparin group lost 18% of their randomised participants and the control group lost 20%.</P><P>To try to combat the issues of reporting by the authors we chose to include all randomised participants in our own analysis. As we calculated the loss rates were similar between the treatment and placebo group this was deemed appropriate. As you commented in your 5<SUP>th</SUP> paragraph that our analysis does not account for 330 participants (we assume you only meant the Dalteparin group) that did not have evaluable compression ultrasounds, we would argue that the control group lost a similar number so overall the loss would not change the overall findings.</P><P>It is a shame that there were so many missing participants, but this is not unique to this study alone, and is a theme with this type of trial. As for Table 3, it is confusing with the different total n values and we do agree it is worth getting in contact with the study authors to ask about Table 3 and why some of the outcomes have less than the 1518 and 1473 of evaluable participants. This will be addressed in the next update of the review, and if we are unable to get a satisfactory answer from the study authors we will discuss re-evaluating the risk of bias of the trial. We will also plan to further discuss these issues within the review</P><P><B>LIFENOX</B></P><P><B>Concern: We did not include this study in DVT outcome</B></P><P>Response: It is explicitly stated by the study authors of LIFENOX that they had no intention to determine the effect of enoxaparin on VTE (as they believe this has been previously shown) and they are only interested in all-cause mortality, primarily at day 30, and also day 90. The authors say because of their main outcome of interest they did not screen for any asymptomatic DVT. In their protocol on ClinicalTrials.gov they only state the outcomes of interest as all-cause mortality and safety issues. In their report they do report deaths by PE, which we do include in our analysis. The report of the study does not in any place discuss DVT as an outcome separate from PE. However, we understand your interest in fully reporting the data within the study and we see where you describe the author&#8217;s findings of VTE after day 90, at the bottom page 2468 and top of 2469. We do not believe this offers enough description for our analysis at this point (VTE diagnosed in 0.2% enoxaparin and 0.1% placebo by &#8216;objective method&#8217;). They do not separate DVT from PE when using the term VTE, and we do not currently have a total VTE outcome for this comparison, so it would be inappropriate in the current analysis. We do agree that it is appropriate to determine if any further data could be included in the analysis and we will open communication with the LIFENOX authors to try to include this information in to the next update of the review. We would also have to verify how they diagnosed DVT and note they did not screen for any asymptomatic DVT.</P></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS MODIFIED="2016-08-25 14:35:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Feedback: Tania Alia B.Sc.(Pharm), Carolyn Wilson B.Sc.(Pharm), Aaron M.

Regarding analysis 1.4, the authors arrive at the conclusion that heparin had a &#8220;borderline statistically significant&#8221; reduction in combined non-fatal and fatal PE when compared to placebo. After looking at the studies in detail, we arrive at a different conclusion for this result.</P><P>Bergmann 1996 included in analysis 1.4 was, at the time, presented as an abstract when the reviewers were meta-analyzing the data. Mah 2005 (2) presents this data in a more recent, published report. The rates of PE used for this study in analysis 1.4 in the Cochrane review (10/1230 and 17/1244 for heparin versus placebo, respectively) implies that it represents all patients randomized (n=2474). However, in Mah 2005 (2), the same numerators used represent only those who had autopsies (10/63 and 17/60 for heparin versus placebo, respectively, as presented in Table 2), which represents approximately half of the patients who died (n=252) and 5% of the total population randomized. We believe the numbers used in analysis 1.4 in the Cochrane review is likely an underestimate, as it remains unknown how many of the 2531 (95% of those randomized) patients that are unaccounted for had a PE.</P><P>A similar error is seen with Gardlund 1996 (3) presented in this analysis. The rates of PE entered for this study in analysis 1.4 (15/5776 and 16/5917 for heparin versus placebo, respectively) implies that it represents all patients randomized (n=11,693). However, in Gardlund 1996, the same numerators used represent only those who had necropsies (15/194 and 16/189 for heparin versus placebo, respectively, as presented in table 2), representing only 3.3% (n=383) of the population randomized (3). Therefore, similar to the aforementioned Bergmann 1996 study error, there is incomplete data for 97% (n=11,310) of randomized patients. Therefore, the rates used in analysis 1.4 in the Cochrane review for Gardlund 1996 is likely underestimated as well.</P><P>Furthermore, in Gardlund 1996, rates of PE (non-fatal and fatal) are 33/194 and 26/189 in the heparin and control groups respectively, as presented in table 2 (3). However, the numbers in the numerators used in analysis 1.4 are 15 and 16, respectively, representing only the &#8220;clinically relevant fatal pulmonary embolism&#8221; rates from table 2 in the trial despite analysis 1.4 combining non-fatal and fatal PEs (3). If one were to use the combined non-fatal and fatal PE rates from the same Table in the original study report (33 and 26 as the numerators), the result of Analysis 1.4 changes to OR 0.85 [0.59,1.23], shifting towards a non-statistically significant result.</P><P>To summarize, the trial data from Bergmann 1996 (Mah 2005) and Gardlund 1996 presented in this Cochrane review assumes the rate of PEs is from all randomized patients (2,3). However, this rate represents those who had autopsies or necropsies, representing 3.6% (n=506) of the total population randomized in both trials. Given that these two trials contribute the most weight for this analysis (63.2%), we believe that the true rates of PE are grossly underestimated. Given the significant amount of missing and incomplete data for 96% (n=13,661) of the population in these trials combined, we do not believe there is definitive evidence for a significant reduction in combined non-fatal and fatal PE with heparin compared to placebo in acutely ill medical patients. We suggest that the review authors acknowledges these errors when making their final conclusion. We suggest the data for fatal and non-fatal PE not be analyzed until the PE rates for all randomized patients in all studies are known. Alternatively, Analysis 1.4 should be renamed to &#8220;fatal PE occurring in patients that had autopsies&#8221; with a thorough discussion regarding the limitations/bias of such a subgroup analysis. We also suggest the phrase &#8220;borderline statistically significant&#8221; in the summary of main results section for the fatal/non-fatal PE analysis be removed so as to not mislead readers.</P><P>References</P><P>1.

You have brought up several issues that are a general concern for all systematic reviews specifically that not all studies that evaluate the same treatment comparisons will report on the same outcomes in an identical manner. It is the Cochrane Collaboration&#8217;s position to gather as much relevant data as possible and report it in a manner that is as objective as possible.</P><P>You raised a concern regarding the inclusion of Bergmann 1996 and Gardlund 1996 in the combined non-fatal and/or fatal PE outcome because they only report on fatal PE. We agree that the analysis would be far more robust if they also reported on their clinically symptomatic non-fatal PE events, but the studies simply did not collect nor report this data, which is why the outcome is an 'and/or' outcome. We already have separate outcomes for non-fatal PE and fatal PE separately, and combining all outcomes of a similar type is a common technique in systematic reviewing. We disagree that analysis 1.4 should be considered just 'Fatal PE occurring in patients that had autopsies' as this outcome includes any PE that is considered clinically symptomatic or was verified as a fatal PE, and not simply fatal PE. Of course not all included studies will have provided all outcomes we are reporting on and we can only include what they report.</P><P>As for using the fully randomised cohort as our denominator instead of just those that received autopsies, we have stated in our methods we are using an intention-to-treat model. Although only a small percentage had autopsies performed, of an already smaller percentage of participants who died, we have to make the assumption that the events identified reflect over the whole randomised population. This is a common way to get around many issues when performing a systematic review as most studies will identify and report events in many ways.</P><P>For your concern regarding the additional participants in the Gardlund 1996 study (18 additional in the heparin group and 10 additional in the control group) that were found to have a PE at autopsy, please refer to the methods section of our review which states this outcome is interested only in &#8216;clinically symptomatic non-fatal PE and fatal PE&#8217;. The Gardlund study does not describe whether these additional embolisms found at autopsy were clinically symptomatic, only that they were not clinically relevant fatal PE. This criteria was applied to all included studies. However, we do agree that our use of &#8216;borderline statistically significant&#8217; for analysis of Combined non-fatal and/or fatal pulmonary embolism is a confusing term and we have amended throughout the text.</P></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS MODIFIED="2016-11-22 08:57:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Feedback: Kieran Shah and Aaron M Tejani.

At the onset of the review process we planned to include all general medical patients hospitalised with an acute illness excluding patients with stroke and myocardial infarction. It subsequently became apparent to us on reviewing studies for inclusion that a small number of published thromboprophylaxis studies in acutely ill medical patients also had surgical patients included in their analysis. These studies tended to be those where patients had been admitted to an ICU for medical care and so as it was not possible from the published results to differentiate the truly medical from the surgical patients. The Fraisse study included a clearly defined population of acutely ill medical patients (decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and there is no question that there were no surgical patients included and therefore after discussion between review authors RA and ATC a decision was made to include the study in the analysis.</P><P>We have clarified our inclusion/exclusion criteria in the <LINK TAG="OBJECTIVES" TYPE="SECTION">Objectives</LINK> and <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> sections to specify that we included studies from intensive care units only if they clearly defined their population as medical and not post-surgical.
