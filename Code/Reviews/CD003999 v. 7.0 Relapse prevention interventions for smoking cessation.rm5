<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:32:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="L S">
<P>Some people start smoking again shortly after quitting and are said to have 'relapsed'. Interventions used to help people avoid relapse usually focus on teaching the skills to cope with temptations to smoke. This approach and others have not been shown to be helpful, either for people who quit on their own or with the help of treatment, or for those who quit because they were pregnant or in hospital. Many trials conducted so far have not been of a strong enough design to detect possible small effects. Among drug treatments, extended use of varenicline may help some smokers. Studies of extended use of nicotine replacement treatment are urgently needed.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in May 2013 for studies mentioning relapse prevention or maintenance in title, abstracts or keywords.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:29:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews">
<P>Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of relapse prevention interventions with a minimum follow-up of six months. We included smokers who quit on their own, were undergoing enforced abstinence, or were participating in treatment programmes. We included trials that compared relapse prevention interventions with a no intervention control, or that compared a cessation programme with additional relapse prevention components with a cessation programme alone.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:30:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews">
<P>Studies were screened and data extracted by one review author, and checked by a second. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by referral to a third review author.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:30:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>Sixty-three studies met inclusion criteria but were heterogeneous in terms of populations and interventions. We considered 41 studies that randomly assigned abstainers separately from studies that randomly assigned participants before their quit date.</P>
<P>Upon looking at studies of behavioural interventions that randomly assigned abstainers, we detected no benefit of brief and 'skills-based' relapse prevention methods for women who had quit smoking because of pregnancy, or for smokers undergoing a period of enforced abstinence during hospitalisation or military training. We also failed to detect significant effects of behavioural interventions in trials in unselected groups of smokers who had quit on their own or through a formal programme. Amongst trials randomly assigning smokers before their quit date and evaluating the effects of additional relapse prevention components, we found no evidence of benefit of behavioural interventions or combined behavioural and pharmacotherapeutic interventions in any subgroup. Overall, providing training in skills thought to be needed for relapse avoidance did not reduce relapse, but most studies did not use experimental designs best suited to the task and had limited power to detect expected small differences between interventions. For pharmacological interventions, extended treatment with varenicline significantly reduced relapse in one trial (risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.36). Pooling of six studies of extended treatment with bupropion failed to detect a significant effect (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.35). Two small trials of oral nicotine replacement treatment (NRT) failed to detect an effect, but treatment compliance was low, and in two other trials of oral NRT in which short-term abstainers were randomly assigned, a significant effect of intervention was noted.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:32:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>At the moment, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific behavioural intervention to help smokers who have successfully quit for a short time to avoid relapse. The verdict is strongest for interventions focused on identifying and resolving tempting situations, as most studies were concerned with these. Little research is available regarding other behavioural approaches. </P>
<P>Extended treatment with varenicline may prevent relapse. Extended treatment with bupropion is unlikely to have a clinically important effect. Studies of extended treatment with nicotine replacement are needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-31 08:50:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-30 17:13:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>A number of interventions can help people who smoke to quit. These include pharmacological treatments, such as nicotine replacement, some antidepressants and nicotine receptor partial agonists; and behavioural approaches, whether delivered individually or in groups (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>). These interventions increase long-term quit rates compared with control interventions, but there is a steady attrition in overall success rates due to a proportion of initially successful participants returning to smoking over time (relapsing).</P>
<P>Several strategies for relapse prevention have been examined in randomized controlled trials. The most widely studied has been the skills approach, whereby patients learn to identify high-risk situations for relapse and are provided with cognitive and behavioural strategies to cope with these situations (<LINK REF="REF-Marlatt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marlatt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marlatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marlatt 2008</LINK>). A smaller number of studies have tested alternative psychological treatments (usually combined with the skills approach). These include imaginary cue exposure, writing tasks, aversive smoking, role-play, social support, and exercise. A separate group of studies have tested the effects of preventing relapse by extending the duration of therapeutic contact. Finally, studies have examined pharmacological treatments for relapse prevention.</P>
<P>There is no clear definition of a relapse prevention intervention as distinct from an extended cessation treatment because, in principle, resumption of smoking at any time after the quit date can count as relapse. In general, relapse prevention is considered to apply to interventions that explicitly seek to reduce relapse rates after an acute treatment phase is successfully completed, or at some time after the quit date of a self-quit attempt. The duration of the acute treatment phase varies, leading to variability in the point at which measurement of a relapse prevention effect begins. This is unavoidable, and the approach adopted in this review is to consider as relapse prevention interventions that are designated by the authors as such, or interventions involving extended treatment after what would be the normal treatment duration.</P>
<P>Trials of interventions for relapse prevention may randomly assign people who have already quit, or they may randomly assign smokers before their quit attempt and provide a general smoking cessation intervention to all participants, in addition to an extra component provided for those randomly assigned to relapse prevention. The former design has a number of methodological strengths, which are discussed later in this review. We have included both types of study in the review.</P>
<P>The aim of reviewing evidence of efficacy of relapse prevention interventions was to provide information for care providers that may be relevant when they must decide how to allocate resources between motivating attempts to stop smoking, supporting smokers who need help during the initial stages of their quit attempt and providing further support to prevent relapse.</P>

<P>We included interventions identified by study investigators as intended to prevent relapse, compared with no intervention or a shorter intervention or an intervention not oriented towards relapse prevention.

</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2013-07-31 08:44:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The preferred outcome was prolonged or multiple point prevalence abstinence at follow-up of at least six months since randomization. We also included trials that reported only point prevalence abstinence (number of participants not smoking at the point when assessment is made-abstinent at that time but not necessarily continuously since treatment) at six months or longer. For studies that reported more than one definition of abstinence, we considered whether the choice of outcome would affect any pooled effect estimate. We excluded studies with less than six months follow-up.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 12:01:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group register of trials, which includes the results of comprehensive searches of electronic bibliographic databases and conference abstracts. We checked for relevance all reports of trials with 'relapse prevention' or 'maintenance' or 'relapse near prevent*' in title, abstract or keywords. See <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for the full strategy. At the time of the search in May 2013, the Register included the results of searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), Issue 12, 2012; MEDLINE (via OVID) to update 20130329; EMBASE (via OVID) to week 201313 and PsycINFO (via OVID) to update 20130401.

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-30 12:03:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One review author (LFS or JHB) identified potentially eligible trials for inclusion. We included all studies that randomly assigned people already abstaining from smoking. In studies that randomly assigned smokers before quitting, almost all behavioural interventions include relapse prevention components. We included only studies that explicitly identified in their titles or abstracts a focus on relapse prevention or maintenance. In addition, we included all studies that tested the effect of extended contact by telephone after an initial intervention, whether or not relapse prevention was highlighted. Unless abstainers were randomly assigned, we did not include studies of exercise or studies of aversive smoking because the interventions used are similar, whether described as relapse prevention or not, and are covered in separate Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hajek-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajek 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ussher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ussher 2012</LINK>). We excluded most interventions for hospitalised participants because trials generally do not describe whether participants are already abstinent or not, and interventions typically contain a mixture of cessation and relapse prevention components. All studies of this type are also covered by a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Rigotti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigotti 2012</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-31 08:49:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the 2013 update, we assessed all included studies for risk of bias using the most recent Cochrane tool. We assessed each study's risk of bias on five domains: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessment; and incomplete outcomes data. We noted other risks of bias where relevant, and studies that provided insufficient information on which to make judgements were coded as 'unclear' in the relevant domains. Studies were considered to be at high risk of attrition bias (incomplete outcomes data) when lack of information meant that we were unable to include post-randomization dropouts in our denominators, or when less than 50% of participants were followed up at six months or longer. Had studies of pharmacotherapies not used placebo, we would have considered these to be at high risk of performance bias (blinding of participants/personnel), but we did not require blinding of participants in behavioural interventions. We judged studies to be at high risk of detection bias (blinding of outcomes assessors) when no biochemical validation was used <I>and </I>the intervention arm received more face-to-face contact than the control arm, as we considered differential misreport a possibility in these cases.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:03:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcome was the number of quitters at the longest follow-up. We used biochemically validated cessation in preference to self-report where available. When given a choice, we included continuous abstinence in preference to point prevalence abstinence. Randomly assigned participants who withdrew, were lost to follow-up or failed to provide samples for validation were usually classified as relapsers or continuing smokers. We noted any exceptions to this in the study details, and we estimated whether the choice of denominator was likely to alter the conclusions. If studies reported both strict and more lenient outcomes, we extracted both sets of data and conducted a sensitivity analysis on the pooled results.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:04:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the protocol for this review, we planned to approach authors to ask for additional data about end of treatment quit rates and long-term quit rates in early quitters. In view of the heterogeneity of interventions, timing of assessments and ways of defining abstinence, we decided that additional data, even if suitable and available, would not strengthen the review. We extracted short-term quit rates for trials that did not randomly assign abstainers and considered whether any benefit of relapse prevention intervention was apparent at this point and whether it differed from the long-term effect.</P>
</MISSING_DATA>
<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-31 08:44:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To investigate heterogeneity, we used the I² statistic, given by the formula [(Q - df)/Q] × 100%, where <I>Q</I> is the Chi² statistic and<I> df</I> is its degrees of freedom (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This describes the percentage of variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than to sampling error (chance). A value greater than 50% may be considered to indicate substantial heterogeneity. In the event of significant statistical or clinical heterogeneity between trials, we determined not to report pooled estimates.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:37:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We use the risk ratio rather than the odds ratio to summarise individual trial outcomes and to determine estimates of pooled effect. Treatment effects will seem smaller when expressed as risk ratios than when expressed as odds ratios, unless the event rates are very low. For example, if 20 of 100 participants have quit from the intervention group, and 10 of 100 from the control group, the risk ratio is 2.0 [(20/100)/(10/100)], and the odds ratio is 2.25 [(20/80)/(10/90)]. Whilst there are circumstances in which odds ratios may be preferable, there is a danger that they will be interpreted as if they are risk ratios, making the treatment effect seem larger than it is (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>). We estimated a pooled weighted average of risk ratios using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method with 95% confidence intervals. Had a study reported an odds ratio corrected for clustering or baseline imbalance, and were we unable to derive a risk ratio, we planned to pool odds ratios for trials in the same subgroup of a comparison using the inverse variance method to check whether there was an effect on the results.</P>

<P>We planned not to pool results from trials that randomly assigned abstainers with results from those that randomly assigned smokers, but we made two exceptions to this: see discussion of <LINK REF="STD-Killen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wetter-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wetter 2011</LINK> in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>. Our predefined subgroups were based on the type and intensity of intervention. We separated studies in which contact time was matched from those in which relapse prevention included a longer duration of contact.</P>
<P>Other prespecified subgroups included trials in spontaneous quitters such as pregnant women and in smokers seeking smoking cessation treatment. We added further subgroup analyses to distinguish between longer (longer than four weeks) and shorter intervention and control durations. We also considered subgroup analyses for 'skills' and social support studies. This replaced our planned subgroup division based on the format of the intervention (group versus individual) as this was more relevant within the available sample of studies.</P>

<P>We identified 63 studies for inclusion, 9 of which were new for the 2013 update. One paper reported two studies, each of which had multiple arms relevant to different comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Buchkremer-1991-1" TYPE="STUDY">Buchkremer 1991 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buchkremer-1991-2" TYPE="STUDY">Buchkremer 1991 2</LINK>), and six trials had subgroups or factorial designs that contributed to different sections or subgroups (<LINK REF="STD-Curry-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fortmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fortmann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Covey-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Covey 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Croghan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Croghan 2007</LINK>). Two studies did not specifically describe the intervention as involving relapse prevention. Two were similar to an included study by the same group (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klesges-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Klesges 2006</LINK>), and one randomized abstainers (<LINK REF="STD-Hajek-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hajek 2002</LINK>). Most studies were conducted in the United States. Details of each included study can be found in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>We describe and analyse separately those studies that randomly assigned people who had already stopped smoking and those that randomly assigned people who were still smoking. We made two exceptions to this scheme: we consider <LINK REF="STD-Killen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 2006</LINK> along with other extended pharmacotherapy trials, and we consider <LINK REF="STD-Wetter-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wetter 2011</LINK> along with other trials testing behavioural adjuncts to cessation programmes.</P>
<P>Details of 37 excluded studies are listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table. The main reasons for exclusion were follow-up of less than six months or not meeting our criteria for a study of relapse prevention. We also identified three ongoing studies, details of which can be found in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> table. Two of these test behavioural interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Jung-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jung 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2011</LINK>) and the third tests the efficacy of extended treatment with varenicline in people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00621777" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00621777</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Section 1. Studies randomly assigning abstainers</HEADING>
<P>Forty-one studies included people who had already stopped smoking.</P>
<P>We considered separately studies involving unaided abstainers who had stopped smoking where it is prohibited, due to factors such as pregnancy, hospital stay, or military training. Another group of studies concerned ex-smokers recruited from the general population.</P>
<P>We divided studies into those assessing behavioural interventions and those assessing pharmacotherapy. We classified behavioural interventions into intensive and less intensive categories. Intensive interventions involve repeated face-to-face contact, usually aimed at teaching clients to identify tempting situations and to apply a range of coping skills and cognitive strategies assumed to be of help in resisting relapse. Less intensive interventions usually attempt to teach these skills via written materials and may involve one brief face-to-face session and telephone contacts. In the event that any trials used telephone contacts of sufficient frequency and duration to be considered an intensive intervention, we would have investigated the sensitivity of our findings to alternative categorisation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Behavioural interventions in special populations</HEADING>
<P>Eighteen studies focused on populations other than smokers seeking treatment, including pregnant and postpartum women, hospital inpatients and army recruits. Most used minimal face-to-face contact and relied primarily on written materials and/or phone calls. Studies examining more intensive interventions had very small sample sizes. No study in this group used a pharmacological intervention.</P>
<P>Eight studies among pregnant women (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBride-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hajek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hajek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBride-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pbert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pbert 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morasco-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Morasco 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ruger 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hann_x00f6_ver-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hannöver 2009</LINK>) and one study in hospital inpatients (<LINK REF="STD-Schmitz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz 1999</LINK>) included both current smokers and recent ex-smokers but analysed the two subgroups separately and so were eligible for inclusion here. Two studies randomized smokers and recent ex-smokers during pregnancy and evaluated the effects of postpregnancy interventions on women from both groups who did not smoke at delivery (<LINK REF="STD-McBride-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBride-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Six studies evaluated relatively brief interventions, comprising an initial face-to-face counselling session supported by written materials given out at the session (<LINK REF="STD-Secker_x002d_Walker-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Secker-Walker 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Secker_x002d_Walker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Secker-Walker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hajek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hajek 2001</LINK>), repeated mailings over a period of time (<LINK REF="STD-Ershoff-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ershoff 1995</LINK>), or the addition of a video (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1997</LINK>). In each case, there was provision for opportunistic support of different intensity at other routine visits. One study provided the initial relapse prevention counselling session and reinforcements at later visits without written pamphlets (<LINK REF="STD-Van_x0027_t-Hof-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van't Hof 2000</LINK>). Two studies included no face-to-face contact specific to the intervention but provided a series of phone calls (<LINK REF="STD-McBride-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 2004</LINK>) or calls and letters, booklets, and newsletters (<LINK REF="STD-McBride-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 1999</LINK>). One study used a 90-minute psychotherapy session and additional phone calls (<LINK REF="STD-Morasco-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Morasco 2006</LINK>). Two studies evaluated motivational interviewing (<LINK REF="STD-Hann_x00f6_ver-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hannöver 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ruger 2008</LINK>). One study assessed a more intensive postpartum intervention that included a series of eight supportive telephone calls in addition to the initial session and written materials (<LINK REF="STD-Ratner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ratner 2000</LINK>). A further study evaluated six telephone-based counselling sessions that included two calls postpartum and four calls up to sixteen weeks postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Reitzel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Reitzel 2010</LINK>). This was a three-armed study, and participants in the second intervention arm were given two in-person counselling sessions, in addition to telephone counselling. The two intervention arms did not differ in outcomes, hence we combined them in our analysis. Finally, one study randomly assigned clinics to implement a provider counselling and office systems intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Pbert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pbert 2004</LINK>). We were unable to extract data from this study in a comparable format to pool with the other studies, so we report them separately.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Hospital inpatients</HEADING>
<P>Two studies randomized hospital inpatients diagnosed with cardiovascular illness who had not smoked from the time of hospital admission. One study evaluated a brief, routine, one-off intervention supported by written materials (<LINK REF="STD-Hajek-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hajek 2002</LINK>), and the other compared six weekly sessions of skills-oriented relapse prevention with didactic presentations (<LINK REF="STD-Schmitz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz 1999</LINK>). A third study randomly assigned participants who had quit during or shortly before hospitalisation to receive three telephone calls after discharge; all participants received counselling in hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Hasuo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hasuo 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Three studies provided interventions to smokers undergoing enforced abstinence during armed forces training. Two randomly assigned United States Air Force recruits: <LINK REF="STD-Klesges-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klesges 1999</LINK> provided a 50-minute session during training that covered the short-term health consequences, costs and social impact of smoking, and <LINK REF="STD-Klesges-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Klesges 2006</LINK> provided two one-hour sessions. <LINK REF="STD-Conway-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2004</LINK> randomly assigned naval recruits; in addition to regular smokers, the intervention targeted former, occasional and experimental smokers.

<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1984</LINK> was a factorial study. The arms comparing two variants of aversive smoking are combined in this analysis.

<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1986</LINK> compared three six-session treatments (i.e. active skills training, discussion of high-risk situations (not shown in graphs), and a standard programme). Only 45 participants were included in the study.</LI>
<LI>In one arm of a factorial study, <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1988</LINK> compared two programmes in a self-help format: one using a skills-oriented relapse prevention training permissive to slips, and the other stressing absolute abstinence. The other arm compared these two approaches delivered in a format of eight weekly group sessions, where the absolute abstinence approach also included gradual reduction and a quit date two weeks later than in the relapse prevention group. The two study arms are treated separately.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Emmons-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Emmons 1988</LINK> compared two programmes with different numbers of sessions across the same period of time, both accompanied by nicotine gum. The relapse prevention programme consisted of eight weekly sessions focused on coping with high-risk situations, cognitive behavioural strategies and role-play. The 'Broad Spectrum' behavioural programme consisted of 12 sessions that focused on strategies for dealing with cravings and weight control, with quitting preceded by nicotine fading over three weeks.</LI>
<LI>Two trials by Buchkremer and colleagues explored a variety of behavioural components, as well as different dosing schedules, for the nicotine patch. The programme consisted of nine weekly sessions with a target quit date after six weeks of gradual reduction. Relapse prevention components including role-play were included in one intervention, and this was compared with a control of the same length (<LINK REF="STD-Buchkremer-1991-1" TYPE="STUDY">Buchkremer 1991 1</LINK>). In a second study, an alternative relapse prevention approach was used; the programme was modified to reach total abstinence after four weeks, and behaviour therapy techniques such as covert sensitisation and thought-stopping were added.

<P>All studies were required by our inclusion criteria to report smoking status a minimum of six months from the start of the intervention. In the case of studies that randomly assigned smokers before quitting, this could have been from the quit date. Some studies timed follow-up from the end of treatment.

<P>All but one study stated that allocation was random, but few reported the methods of sequence generation and allocation in sufficient detail to be certain that the risk of bias was minimised, hence most were rated as unclear in these domains.</P>
<P>Nine studies used cluster-randomized designs. In the three among military recruits (<LINK REF="STD-Klesges-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klesges 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conway-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klesges-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Klesges 2006</LINK>), allocation was determined by training group, and selection bias was unlikely. In a further three, allocation was by midwife (<LINK REF="STD-Hajek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hajek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pbert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pbert 2004</LINK>) or paediatric practice (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1997</LINK>), and selection bias in the subsequent enrolment of participants might have been possible. Two of the cluster-randomized trials reported that correlation between outcomes in individuals in the same cluster was small, so that reporting of individual outcomes was acceptable. These two trials also had high loss to follow-up, although there was no evidence of differential loss between arms. One study in pregnant women (<LINK REF="STD-Pbert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pbert 2004</LINK>) randomly assigned six clinics, but one control clinic withdrew because of poor participant recruitment. Of the remaining five sites, two contributed more than 50% of the participants. An appropriate method of analysis was used; because of the small number of clusters, differences between crude effects and corrected estimates were noted, and we did not attempt to incorporate the results into a meta-analysis. One small study ran an intervention group and a control group in each of four workplaces. No information was provided on recruitment and participant blinding procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Schroter-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schroter 2006</LINK>). One quasi-randomized trial of quitline callers sent printed self-help materials aimed at relapse prevention to all quitline callers who ended treatment within a given six-week period (<LINK REF="STD-Sheffer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sheffer 2010</LINK>). Callers to the quitline during the six weeks preceding and following the given six-week period were used as a control group. One quasi-randomized trial of quitline callers sent printed self-help materials aimed at relapse prevention to all quitline callers who ended treatment within a given six-week period (<LINK REF="STD-Sheffer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sheffer 2010</LINK>). Callers to the quitline in the six weeks preceding and following the given six-week period were used as a control group.<BR/>
</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding (performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>Most studies did not provide sufficient detail to allow evaluation of risk of performance bias and hence were judged to be at unclear risk in this domain. Eighteen studies provided details of blinding procedures sufficient to rate them at low risk of bias in this domain (or, in the case of behavioural interventions where blinding of participants was not possible, where other study characteristics meant that performance bias was judged to be unlikely). Five studies were judged to be at high risk of performance bias: two studies testing NRT did not provide placebo to the control arms (<LINK REF="STD-Killen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1985</LINK>); in two studies of behavioural interventions, neither participants nor providers were blinded, and control participants were aware that the intervention arm was receiving additional treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Juliano-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Juliano 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reitzel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Reitzel 2010</LINK>); and in a fifth study, blinding was broken (<LINK REF="STD-Segan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Segan 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Validation of self-reported abstinence (detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>Biochemical validation of most or all self-reports of abstinence was reported for most studies. Fourteen studies did not attempt any validation (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klesges-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klesges 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van_x0027_t-Hof-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van't Hof 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mermelstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mermelstein 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conway-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klesges-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Klesges 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroter-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schroter 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Osch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">van Osch 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hann_x00f6_ver-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hannöver 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sheffer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sheffer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joseph-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Joseph 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Segan 2011</LINK>), but in some other cases, samples were not collected from all participants, were not collected at long-term follow up or were not used to correct self-reports. In one unpublished study, it was unclear whether results were validated (<LINK REF="STD-STRATUS_x002d_WW-2006" TYPE="STUDY">STRATUS-WW 2006</LINK>), and another study reported the use of biochemical validation but not the cut-off value or the level of misreport (<LINK REF="STD-Ruger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ruger 2008</LINK>). One study noted greater deception amongst intervention group participants than amongst those in the control condition (<LINK REF="STD-Pbert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pbert 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In studies of behavioural smoking cessation interventions, lack of biochemical validation of self-reported smoking status risks the introduction of significant bias. Participants who received more intensive care can be expected to be trying harder to please their advisors and report &#8216;good news&#8217;. When the intervention group received more face-to-face contact than the control group and the results were not biochemically validated, we judged studies to be at high risk of detection bias.</P>

<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 17:13:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Another risk of bias specific to smoking cessation studies concerns excluding participants lost to follow-up from the analysis or imputing their outcomes as if their loss to follow-up was independent of outcome. This is because in smoking cessation treatments, patients who fail in stopping smoking may feel embarrassed and may find further participation unhelpful, while those who are successful may be more likely to stay in touch. Treating those lost to follow-up as still smoking is likely to be a reasonable assumption, but sometimes the actual figures are not available, or loss to follow-up is such that most participants have not provided data, or many more participants have been followed up in one arm than in another. When these limitations were present, studies were judged to be- at unclear or high risk of attrition bias.</P>
<P>Most studies reported low or moderate losses to follow-up in sufficient detail to be judged at low risk of bias in this domain. One study was judged to be at high risk of attrition bias (<LINK REF="STD-van-Osch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">van Osch 2008</LINK>) because loss to follow-up was high in both arms (less than 40% of participants followed up at seven months); the study authors cautioned that this limited the validity of the results. A further six studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias in this domain, as the studies did not report results in sufficient detail to permit counting of all participants lost to follow-up as continuing smokers in our analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Brandon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brandon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buchkremer-1991-1" TYPE="STUDY">Buchkremer 1991 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buchkremer-1991-2" TYPE="STUDY">Buchkremer 1991 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emmons-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Emmons 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hann_x00f6_ver-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hannöver 2009</LINK>).</P>

This supports the observation that people who cannot maintain abstinence in the early days of a quit attempt are at particularly high risk of relapse and does not support the use of rapid smoking as a relapse prevention measure.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-31 08:45:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, we failed to detect a clinically significant effect of existing behavioural 'relapse prevention' methods for people quitting smoking. However, several factors may temper this disappointing conclusion. The included studies had both methodological and content limitations; the overall GRADE quality score was very low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Most studies reported only point prevalence abstinence, and only a small number of studies included in this review had adequate sample sizes to detect the expected effects. Most studies that randomly assigned recent abstainers focused on brief or written interventions rather than on more intensive treatments, and most of the existing studies tested only one particular treatment approach.</P>
<P>Results for some pharmacotherapies were more encouraging, with the quality of evidence ranging from low to moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). In the trial of extended varenicline use (<LINK REF="STD-Tonstad-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tonstad 2006</LINK>), 63% of participants who quit after 12 weeks on varenicline had relapsed by the end of a year, compared with only 56% of those who received a further 12 weeks of therapy. The study of rimonabant also detected a significant effect in favour of the intervention, but this drug has been withdrawn from the market because of concerns about its safety. The six studies of bupropion, when combined, narrowly failed to reach significance; none yielded a significant result on their own, and the two comparisons of bupropion plus NRT versus double placebo were also negative. This makes it unlikely that any clinically significant effect was missed.</P>
<P>In discussing the further implications of this review, we first comment on the technical aspects and limitations and attempt to make some methodological recommendations for future work in this area. We then discuss some of the conclusions pertaining to different treatment formats.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Inclusion and exclusion of studies</HEADING>
<P>Identifying criteria for including studies in this review was difficult. We included all studies that randomly assigned abstainers, as these provide the best test of interventions aimed at maintaining abstinence. Studies randomly assigning smokers before quitting presented a challenge. Although such studies may be described as studies of relapse prevention, they usually test primarily smoking cessation interventions, with interventions aimed at preventing relapse added to the treatment programme but not analysed separately. One of the problems involved in considering the inclusion of smoking cessation studies with a specified relapse prevention component is that they were sometimes similar in design to other studies that did not specifically mention relapse prevention in their title or abstract but used virtually identical methods. In our initial analyses, we included a wider group of studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zelman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Zelman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2001</LINK>), but in the end we decided to restrict the analysis of studies randomly assigning smokers to those that mentioned relapse prevention explicitly. The results of the review are not affected by this decision, as the excluded studies were also small and did not show significant treatment effects. We also excluded a small number of studies that randomly assigned smokers before quitting and that explicitly included relapse prevention or maintenance but concerned smoking cessation interventions that are already covered by three other Cochrane reviews: exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Ussher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ussher 2012</LINK>), aversive smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Hajek-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajek 2001a</LINK>), and interventions for hospitalised smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Rigotti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigotti 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The negative results of the individual studies are fairly consistent, and it is unlikely that using alternative inclusion criteria would lead to different conclusions; however, identifying appropriate studies in this challenging area is difficult. Possible limitations of the review are that we failed to identify relevant research and that we did not pool studies appropriately. We think it is unlikely that large effects have been missed in the trials so far conducted, but in some cases the studies were too small to allow detection of moderate effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The two trial designs according to the timing of randomization</HEADING>
<P>The key methodological feature of existing attempts to evaluate relapse prevention interventions concerns the time when participants were randomly assigned (i.e. before or after they stopped smoking).</P>
<P>The main logical argument in favour of randomly assigning smokers before they stop smoking is that much relapse prevention advice could be relevant even in the very first stages of quitting smoking. On the practical side, although it is relatively easy to attract smokers to start an experimental treatment, the samples would be much smaller if only those abstinent at the end of treatment were enrolled. However, combining cessation and relapse prevention reduces the power to detect specific relapse prevention effects. The primary outcome variable is normally the abstinence rate at follow-up, and it is difficult to differentiate any effects that the intervention may have had on the initial smoking cessation from effects on preventing relapse in smokers who were initially successful. The initial success or failure is likely to be determined by a number of intervention and participant variables other than the relapse prevention component, which is usually only a small part of the overall programme. One way to resolve this problem could be to focus the analysis on the initial successes only. However, none of the existing studies used this approach, and the published data usually do not include sufficient details to allow survival analysis. Even if relapse rates for initially successful abstainers were available, the relapse prevention effect would be difficult to interpret when comparison groups have different short-term cessation rates.</P>
<P>Randomly assigning only those smokers who have made a successful quit attempt represents a stronger study design. As cessation interventions are segregated from relapse prevention interventions, the results cannot be skewed by uneven initial cessation rates, any relapse prevention effects are more likely to be detected and the results are easy to interpret. On the downside, this approach requires greater effort to recruit sufficient samples. Among existing studies of behavioural treatments using this approach, most have used spontaneous abstainers such as pregnant women. In fact, of the eligible studies of behavioural methods for relapse prevention, only two studies randomly assigned smokers abstinent at the end of an initial treatment episode (<LINK REF="STD-Razavi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Razavi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mermelstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mermelstein 2003</LINK>), and three randomly assigned smokers abstinent five to eight days after their quit day (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The difference between the initial smoking cessation and later relapse prevention treatment is much clearer in pharmacotherapy, and all drug trials but one used this more robust paradigm.</P>
<P>The studies that randomly assigned abstainers varied considerably in the periods of time for which participants had already abstained from smoking (i.e. from 24 hours to 16 months). There seems to be broad agreement on the conceptual distinction between 'stopping smoking' and 'staying quit' and on the common understanding of the concept of relapse, but accepted operational definitions are lacking, although some suggestions have been made (<LINK REF="REF-Ossip_x002d_Klein-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ossip-Klein 1986</LINK>). It seems clear that abstinence for a period of time close to inter-cigarette intervals, or overnight abstinence, does not constitute cessation of smoking, and that a return to smoking after several weeks of total abstinence can be classified as a relapse. However, common behaviours such as abstinence for 24 hours or smoking only a few cigarettes every few days, become more difficult to classify. Little consensus has been reached on what amount of smoking after what type of smoking restraint over what period of time represents a relapse as opposed to the initial failure to stop smoking. Ideally, future relapse prevention studies should follow the example of existing drug trials and should use sufficiently long periods of no smoking and sufficiently strict definitions of the initial abstinence and outcome to avoid areas of contention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Some methodological recommendations</HEADING>
<P>The ideal study of a relapse prevention intervention aimed at complementing existing treatments for smokers seeking help would randomly assign smokers who were abstinent continuously and completely for at least four weeks. An appropriate outcome measure would be continuous lapse-free abstinence of at least six months when the intervention was aimed at avoiding lapses, but some lapses would have to be allowed when the intervention was aimed at helping patients to cope with lapses should these occur. General agreement has been reached that for dependent smokers seeking treatment, becoming an occasional smoker is usually not an option, and for a long-term success, any lapses would have to cease eventually. It would seem sensible to allow lapses over a limited 'period of grace' (e.g. three or even six months), followed by at least six months of lapse-free abstinence. Most studies in this review were seriously underpowered, using 15 or 20 participants per condition. Future research needs to acknowledge that any effects are likely to be small, and that large samples will be needed to avoid type 2 errors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interpreting the review results</HEADING>
<P>The 41 studies that randomly assigned abstainers represent the main interpretable body of data in this field. The results of both special population studies and studies of smokers seeking treatment suggest that behavioural brief interventions and interventions relying on written materials, mailings and telephone contact are ineffective for relapse prevention. It may be important to note that more intensive approaches were examined in only a handful of studies, and some were too small to allow detection of any realistic effect. Although intensive interventions in this area need to resolve the likely problems related to intervention costs and patient attendance, further work on such treatments may be needed.</P>
<P>Rates of abstinence were highly variable across studies because of such factors as the population studied, the intensity of any cessation intervention provided, the period for which abstinence had already been maintained, the length of follow-up and the definition of cessation. Because of obvious problems with comparisons of success rates across studies (<LINK REF="REF-Hajek-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajek 1994</LINK>), we did not discuss results in terms of the absolute abstinence rates achieved.</P>
<P>With regard to the contents of the behavioural interventions, the negative results concern primarily the traditional skills-based approach, which holds a virtual monopoly in this field. It remains a possibility that the original concept is valid (i.e. that patients can benefit from being taught how to identify tempting situations), and that effective strategies for coping with such situations can also be taught. If this is the case, the negative results could have been due to the fact that such skills are not being taught effectively. If future studies examine this approach, investigators should try to check whether participants acquired and practised the skills taught. However, an alternative possibility has to be considered - that despite the strong intuitive validity and popularity of the classic relapse prevention procedures, they do not produce the desired effect. Future studies may be better advised to focus on alternative approaches not studied extensively or at all so far, such as opportunistic use of nicotine replacement, contingency contracting, social support, cue exposure (only imaginary exposure has been studied so far), interventions aimed at maintaining abstainers' morale and awareness of the danger of feckless slips, and so forth.</P>
<P>Regarding pharmacological interventions, good large studies have investigated the extended use of bupropion and varenicline; however, NRT has been studied only in relatively small samples, as an add-on to bupropion trials and in paradigms likely to generate low treatment compliance, which lower the chance of detection of effects of the expected size. Given the good acceptability, safety, and cost profile of NRT, trials of extended NRT use in relapse prevention are needed.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-30 17:13:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One recent large review by Coleman and colleagues of relapse prevention interventions for abstinent smokers detected more positive results than ours for some outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Agboola-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agboola 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2010</LINK>). In particular, although we did not detect any significant effects in pooled comparisons, Coleman et al concluded that self-help materials, bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy were effective at six months and longer. We investigated the reasons for these discrepancies.</P>
<P>Coleman et al used similar search strategies and inclusion criteria to ours, hence our included studies lists map closely onto each other. Their review does not include some new studies added in the most recent update, nor does it include two studies from previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Juliano-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Juliano 2006</LINK> was excluded as it randomly assigned participants who had lapsed rather than abstainers; <LINK REF="STD-Klesges-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Klesges 2006</LINK> was excluded because participants included some never smokers). However, the differences in conclusions are not attributable to the exclusion of these studies. Differences between results for the most part are due to decisions about subgroups and outcomes presented.</P>
<P>Although our meta-analysis of bupropion includes an additional two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Killen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hays-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hays 2009</LINK>) to the four presented by Coleman et al, the reason for the discrepancy in our pooled results from bupropion studies lies in the outcome data used. Coleman et al use different definitions of abstinence and different denominators; in particular, they did not always count dropouts as continuing smokers. We followed the standard methods used by the Cochrane Review Group, which resulted in a more conservative outcome. The difference in NRT results is attributable to subgroup decisions. Our pooled results suggested that NRT could be effective in unaided abstainers but did not detect an effect in assisted abstainers; Coleman et al merged the two groups and detected a significant effect overall. Finally, Coleman et al detected a significant effect of written self-help at long-term follow-up. The three included studies from their analysis are included in our analysis of behavioural interventions for unaided abstainers, and our analysis contains an additional two studies. However, the exclusion of these two studies did not change the overall effect in a sensitivity analysis; rather, the difference in results is largely due to the data presented for <LINK REF="STD-Brandon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brandon 2000</LINK>. This was a factorial trial that tested access to a quitline and repeated mailings; whereas Coleman et al compared the arms that received mailings with the arms that did not (quitline only and control), we compared all intervention arms (quitline, quitline + mailings, mailings only) with the control arm and used slightly different data obtained via correspondence with the author.</P>
<P>With the exception of these three analyses, the results from Coleman et al are consistent with our own.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-30 17:13:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence does not support the use of any specific behavioural component or intervention to help smokers who have successfully quit for a short time to avoid relapsing to smoking again. The conclusion of lack of efficacy concerns specifically the traditional treatment focused on identifying and resolving tempting situations, as well as minimal interventions using one-off sessions and written materials. Hardly any evidence is available on alternative approaches. Until new positive evidence becomes available, it may be more efficient to focus resources on supporting initial cessation attempts rather than on providing extended relapse prevention interventions. Regarding pharmacotherapies, extended treatment with varenicline may prevent relapse. Extended treatment with bupropion is unlikely to have a clinically important effect.</P>

<P>The current research has limitations both in the methodology and in the treatment approaches tested. Future researchers, especially those exploring behavioural interventions, should take account of this in designing studies of adequate methodology and sample size, and in examining alternatives to attempts to teach skills to cope with risk situations. Studies of extended treatment with nicotine replacement are needed.</P>
