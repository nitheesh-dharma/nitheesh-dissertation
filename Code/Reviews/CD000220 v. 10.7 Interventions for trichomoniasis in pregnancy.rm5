<P>Metronidazole is effective against a trichomoniasis infection during pregnancy, but may increase the risk of preterm and low birthweight babies.</P>
<P>Trichomoniasis is a very common sexually transmitted infection. Symptoms include vaginal itching and discharge. It is not clear if pregnant women with trichomoniasis are more likely to give birth preterm, or have other pregnancy complications. The review of two trials, involving 842 women, found that the drug metronidazole is effective against trichomoniasis when taken by women and their partners during pregnancy, but it may harm the baby due to early birth. One of the trials was stopped early because women taking metronidazole were more likely to give birth preterm and have low birthweight babies. Further research into trichomoniasis treatments for pregnant women is needed.</P>

<P>We included two trials with 842 pregnant women. In both trials around 90% of women were cleared of trichomonas in the vagina after treatment. In the US trial, women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis between 16 and 23 weeks were treated with metronidazole on two occasions at least two weeks apart. The trial was stopped before reaching its target recruitment because metronidazole was not effective in reducing preterm birth and there was a likelihood of harm (risk ratio 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.66). The South African trial recruited women later in pregnancy and did not have the design and power to address adverse clinical outcomes. We excluded two recent studies, identified for the current update, because they did not address the primary question.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-27 08:28:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Metronidazole, given as a single dose, is likely to provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes. The cure rate could probably be higher if more partners used the treatment.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-04-05 14:41:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-03-16 12:09:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="A. Metin Gülmezoglu">
<P>Vaginitis due to Trichomonas vaginalis is probably the most common sexually transmitted disease. According to WHO the total number of new cases of the four main STIs in 2005 was estimated to be 448 million, broken down as, 101 million new cases of Chlamydia, 88 million new cases of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 11 million new cases of Syphilis, and 248 million new cases of Trichomonas vaginalis. And at any point in 2005 there were 153 million cases with Trichomonas vaginalis (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). Infection is characterized by green-yellow frothy vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, irritation of the vulva and urethra causing vulvovaginal soreness, itching and dysuria. The diagnosis is usually made on clinical findings and identification of the parasite in wetmount smear. Wetmount smear is a cheap and quick method whereby motile protozoa are identified under the light microscope. More sensitive techniques such as culture, immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassay are also available although they are more costly, time consuming and therefore not used very often in busy clinics, especially in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Lossick-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lossick 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is not clear whether Trichomonas vaginalis infection during pregnancy has any effect on adverse pregnancy outcomes. Concern has been raised about the possibility of increasing the transmission of HIV infection because of impairment of the vaginal mucosal barrier. It may, however, be difficult to single out any micro-organism with regard to these adverse effects, as many types of vaginitis are polymicrobial.<BR/>
<BR/>Metronidazole has been the main agent used in the treatment of trichomoniasis since the 1960s. It is generally advised to withhold metronidazole treatment during pregnancy until after the first trimester (<LINK REF="REF-Lossick-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lossick 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1994</LINK>). In early pregnancy other agents such as clotrimazole have been recommended as a local application. Tinidazole, ornidazole and nimorazole are other nitroimidazoles which are also effective against trichomonas. The Cochrane review comparing the effectiveness of various treatment options for trichomoniasis in nonpregnant women found metronidazole and other nitroimidazole group drugs effective in treating the infection (<LINK REF="REF-Forna-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forna 2003</LINK>). There were no major differences between different nitroimidazoles.</P>
<P>Trichomoniasis during pregnancy is a common occurrence in both developing and developed countries, treated by various healthcare professionals. The possible effects of trichomoniasis on pregnancy, the effectiveness of different preparations and different routes are potential areas of controversy. It is therefore important to document the evidence from randomized trials regarding the effectiveness and safety of various treatment protocols.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis where there was only one study per analysis and also for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials examined the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>

<P>We included two trials that differed in several ways. <LINK REF="STD-Ross-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1983</LINK> was conducted in South Africa and included both asymptomatic and symptomatic women, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Klebanoff-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Klebanoff 2001</LINK> included only asymptomatic women attending antenatal clinics in 15 centres across the USA.</P>
<P>The diagnosis was made by wetmount smear in the South African trial and by culture in the US trial. The US trial was set to investigate whether treatment of asymptomatic trichomoniasis could prevent preterm birth and the enrolment took place between 16 and 23 weeks, whereas in the South African trial enrolment was much later in pregnancy. The dose of metronidazole used in the US trial was double (2 g 48 hours apart) the dose used in the South African trial and was repeated after two weeks.</P>
<P>In the South African trial, 225 out of the 376 (60%) antenatal women tested were positive. In the US trial only 7.6% (2377/31,157) of women were trichomonas positive.</P>
<P>Metronidazole was given to women for their partners to take in both studies (<LINK REF="STD-Klebanoff-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Klebanoff 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1983</LINK>).</P>

<P>Both trials, <LINK REF="STD-Ross-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Klebanoff-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Klebanoff 2001</LINK>, showed high rates of parasitological cure (around 90%) following treatment.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-03-07 02:51:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trichomoniasis is a troublesome infection which causes significant discomfort and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Cotch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-French-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 1999</LINK>). The literature on metronidazole treatment during pregnancy and preterm birth is not conclusive. <LINK REF="REF-Hauth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauth 1995</LINK> used metronidazole and erythromycin and <LINK REF="REF-Morales-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morales 1994</LINK> used metronidazole alone in women with bacterial vaginosis and high risk of preterm birth; in both studies, preterm birth rates were reduced. <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1997</LINK> on the other hand did not find a clinically or statistically significant difference in preterm birth rate with metronidazole in women with bacterial vaginosis. The trials excluded from the review where metronidazole was given in combination with the other antibiotics for treatment of trichomoniasis for sexually transmitted infection control and prevention of HIV (<LINK REF="STD-Kigozi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kigozi 2003</LINK>) and for reduction of perinatal HIV transmission due to chorioamnionitis (<LINK REF="STD-Stringer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stringer 2010</LINK>) did not yield significant differences in terms of preterm birth and low birthweight.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-25 11:02:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Metronidazole is effective in clearing the trichomonas infection in the vagina. The increased tendency towards preterm birth as well as low birthweight in the intervention arm as compared to the control arm (<LINK REF="STD-Klebanoff-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Klebanoff 2001</LINK>) is difficult to explain and it is unknown whether it is real or not.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-01-25 11:02:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The statistical assessment of evidence suggests that treatment of trichomoniasis with metronidazole does not reduce the incidence of preterm birth and delivery of low birthweight babies. Therefore treatment may be encouraged keeping in view the effectiveness of metronidazole in parasitological cure of trichomoniasis (<LINK REF="STD-Ross-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1983</LINK>) for mainly women who are symptomatic.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-03-07 02:51:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two of the trials included in the review show reasonable rates of parasitological cure (<LINK REF="STD-Klebanoff-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Klebanoff 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1983</LINK>) and this could probably be improved if more emphasis is put on partner treatment. Despite the association of Trichomonas vaginalis with preterm birth and low birthweight, the US trial results suggest that a protective effect on preterm birth and low birthweight is unlikely. Surprisingly, there was an increase in preterm births in women receiving metronidazole (<LINK REF="STD-Klebanoff-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Klebanoff 2001</LINK>). The trial was stopped because it was highly unlikely that the treatment would be effective if all women would have been recruited. However, the question of whether the drug actually increases the preterm birth rate remains unanswered. Recruitment was stopped in one of the trials after 617 women were randomized (32% of total planned sample size) (<LINK REF="STD-Klebanoff-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Klebanoff 2001</LINK>). The authors discuss the possible reasons for an increase in preterm birth rate including the possibility of toxic substances being released from destroyed Trichomonas and an unpredicted change in the vaginal flora triggered by the high-dose metronidazole treatment. Whether inclusion of symptomatic women would have changed the result is unknown. With the limited evidence currently available, metronidazole treatment of asymptomatic trichomoniasis infection does not seem to reduce preterm birth or improve low birthweight while it does provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis infection. From a methodological point of view the results of prematurely stopped trials should be interpreted cautiously as they can be misleading.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-03-07 02:52:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found no evidence to support the use of metronidazole in pregnant asymptomatic women with trichomonas vaginalis. It is not clear why metronidazole should cause adverse pregnancy outcomes when it is effective in clearing the infection. Given that Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted infection with unpleasant symptoms and associated with adverse outcomes, including facilitating HIV transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Sorvillo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorvillo 2001</LINK>), it would seem prudent to treat symptomatic women during pregnancy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-25 11:04:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Metronidazole, or nitro-imidazoles in general, are the first choice agents against Trichomonas vaginalis. There are no other readily available medications to replace this class of drugs for the treatment of trichomonas infections. Metronidazole when given in combination with other antibiotics did not show decline in the rate of preterm birth or low birthweight. There are two research questions that need to be answered:</P>
<OL>
<LI>whether the treatment of pregnant women with symptoms (trichomonas vaginitis) is effective in reducing preterm birth;</LI>
<LI>whether the adverse effect of increased preterm birth in treated asymptomatic women with trichomonas observed in one, prematurely stopped trial is real.</LI>
</OL>

<P>This study is excluded as it is a secondary analysis of a randomized trial designed for evaluation of interventions for STD control for prevention of HIV. In this trial the intervention was a community-based trial of presumptive treatment of several antimicrobials including metronidazole as antitrichomoniasis agent. Therefore, to receive the treatment (or no treatment) the women were not required to have trichomoniasis in pregnancy. Also, the authors have acknowledged that some women in the intervention arm were likely to have received (presumptive) treatment before pregnancy.</P>
