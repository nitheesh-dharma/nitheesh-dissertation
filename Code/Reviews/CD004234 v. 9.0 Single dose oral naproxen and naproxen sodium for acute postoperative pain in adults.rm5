<P>This review assessed evidence from 1509 participants in 15 randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of naproxen or naproxen sodium (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. At doses equivalent to 500 mg and 400 mg, orally administered naproxen provides effective analgesia. About half of those treated experienced at least half pain relief over four to six hours, and the effects lasted, on average, up to nine hours. Associated adverse events did not differ from placebo, but these studies are of limited use for studying adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-03 13:28:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pain relief or pain intensity data were extracted and converted into the dichotomous outcome of number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours, from which relative risk and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) were calculated. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals were collected.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-12 10:16:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>The original review included 10 studies with 996 participants. This updated review included 15 studies (1509 participants); 11 assessed naproxen sodium and four naproxen. In nine studies (784 participants) using 500/550 mg naproxen or naproxen sodium the NNT for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours was 2.7 (95% CI 2.3 to 3.2). No dose response was demonstrated over the range 200/220 mg to 500/550 mg, but limited data was identified. Median time to use of rescue medication was 8.9 hours for naproxen 500/550 mg and 2.0 hours for placebo. Use of rescue medication was significantly less common with naproxen than placebo. Associated adverse events were generally of mild to moderate severity and rarely led to withdrawal.</P>

<P>Doses equivalent to 500 mg and 400 mg naproxen administered orally provided effective analgesia to adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. About half of participants treated with these doses experienced clinically useful levels of pain relief, compared to 15% with placebo, and half required additional medication within nine hours, compared to two hours with placebo. Associated adverse events did not differ from placebo.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 11:10:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-25 18:20:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 4, 2004) on 'Single dose oral naproxen and naproxen sodium for acute postoperative pain' (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2004</LINK>). The title now states that the review is limited to adults.</P>
<P>Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage either accidentally due to an injury or as a result of surgery. Acute postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation is a critical component of patient care. The aim of this series of reviews is to present evidence for relative analgesic efficacy through indirect comparisons with placebo, in very similar trials performed in a standard manner, with very similar outcomes, and over the same duration. Such relative analgesic efficacy does not in itself determine choice of drug for any situation or patient, but guides policy-making at the local level.</P>
<P>Recent reviews include lumiracoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Roy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2007</LINK>), paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>), and celecoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2008</LINK>), and the series will include updates of existing reviews like ibuprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1999</LINK>) and aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-Oldman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oldman 1999</LINK>), in addition to new reviews such as ketoprofen and dexketoprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2008</LINK>), lornoxicam (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2008</LINK>), diflunisal (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2008</LINK>), and parecoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Lloyd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lloyd 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Single dose trials in acute pain are commonly short in duration, rarely lasting longer than 12 hours. The numbers of participants is small, allowing no reliable conclusions to be drawn about safety. To show that the analgesic is working it is necessary to use placebo (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2005</LINK>). There are clear ethical considerations in doing this. These ethical considerations are answered by using acute pain situations where the pain is expected to go away, and by providing additional analgesia, commonly called rescue analgesia, if the pain has not diminished after about an hour. This is reasonable, because not all participants given an analgesic will have significant pain relief. Approximately 18% of participants given placebo will have significant pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>), and up to 50% may have inadequate analgesia with active medicines. The use of additional or rescue analgesia is hence important for all participants in the trials.</P>
<P>Clinical trials measuring the efficacy of analgesics in acute pain have been standardised over many years. Trials have to be randomised and double blind. Typically, in the first few hours after an operation, or following discontinuation of patient controlled analgesia, patients develop pain that is moderate to severe in intensity, and will then be given the test analgesic or placebo. Pain is measured using standard pain intensity scales immediately before the intervention, and then using pain intensity and pain relief scales over the following four to six hours for shorter acting drugs, and up to 12 or 24 hours for longer acting drugs. Pain relief of half the maximum possible pain relief or better (at least 50% pain relief) is typically regarded as a clinically useful outcome. For patients given rescue medication it is usual for no additional pain measurements to be made, and for all subsequent measures to be recorded as initial pain intensity or baseline (zero) pain relief (baseline observation carried forward). This process ensures that analgesia from the rescue medication is not wrongly ascribed to the test intervention. In some trials the last observation is carried forward, which gives an inflated response for the test intervention compared to placebo, but the effect has been shown to be negligible over four to six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>). Patients usually remain in the hospital or clinic for at least the first six hours following the intervention, with measurements supervised, although they may then be allowed home to make their own measurements in trials of longer duration.</P>
<P>Clinicians prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on a routine basis for a range of mild-to-moderate pain. NSAIDs are the most commonly prescribed analgesic medications worldwide, and their efficacy for treating acute pain has been well demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2003</LINK>). They reversibly inhibit cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase), the enzyme mediating production of prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 (<LINK REF="REF-FitzGerald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">FitzGerald 2001</LINK>). Prostaglandins mediate a variety of physiological functions such as maintenance of the gastric mucosal barrier, regulation of renal blood flow, and regulation of endothelial tone. They also play an important role in inflammatory and nociceptive processes. However, relatively little is known about the mechanism of action of this class of compounds aside from their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase-dependent prostanoid formation (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 1999</LINK>). Since NSAIDs do not depress respiration and do not impair gastro-intestinal motility, as do opioids (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2002</LINK>), they are clinically useful for treating pain after minor surgery and day surgery, and have an opiate-sparing effect after more major surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Grahame_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grahame-Smith 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Naproxen is an NSAID much prescribed worldwide, and is the most commonly prescribed NSAID in the USA. Naproxen is often prescribed as the sodium salt (naproxen sodium) to improve its solubility for oral administration. Naproxen sodium 550 mg, equivalent to 500 mg of naproxen (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 1999</LINK>), is considered an effective dose for treating postoperative pain (<LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 1993</LINK>). Specific data for the frequency of naproxen administration for postoperative pain relief are unavailable. However, in England in 2007 there were over 1.3 million prescriptions for oral naproxen and naproxen sodium in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-PCA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">PCA 2007</LINK>). A major concern regarding the use of conventional NSAIDs postoperatively is the possibility of bleeding from both the operative site (because of the inhibition of platelet aggregation) (<LINK REF="REF-Forrest-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forrest 2002</LINK>) and from the upper gastrointestinal tract, (especially in patients stressed by surgery, the elderly, frail, or dehydrated). Other potentially serious adverse events include acute liver injury, acute renal injury, heart failure, and adverse reproductive outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Hernandez_x002d_Diaz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hernandez-Diaz 2001</LINK>). However, such complications are more likely to occur with chronic use and NSAIDs generally present fewer risks if used in the short term, as in the treatment of postoperative pain (<LINK REF="REF-Rapoport-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapoport 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The previous version of this Cochrane review by <LINK REF="REF-Mason--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2004</LINK>, found ten studies, in which 582 participants received active treatment (505 naproxen sodium, 77 with naproxen) and 414 received placebo. For doses equivalent to 400 to 500 mg naproxen, between four and five participants needed to be treated for one to achieve at least 50% pain relief who would not have done so with placebo. The median time to use of rescue medication was 7.9 hours with naproxen, compared to 2.9 hours for placebo, and there was no significant difference in numbers of participants experiencing any adverse event. Since that review, a number of new studies have been published, which has permitted calculation of more robust estimates of both efficacy and harm.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>QUOROM guidelines were followed (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>). For efficacy analyses we used the number of participants in each treatment group who were randomised, received medication, and provided at least one post-baseline assessment. For safety analyses we used number of participants who received study medication in each treatment group. Analyses were planned for different doses. Sensitivity analyses were planned to investigate any effect of pain model (dental versus other postoperative pain), trial size (39 or fewer versus 40 or more per treatment arm), and quality score (two versus three or more) on the primary outcome. A minimum of two studies and 200 participants were required for any analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief</HEADING>
<P>For each study, mean TOTPAR (total pain relief) or SPID (summed pain intensity difference) for active and placebo groups were converted to %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID by division into the calculated maximum value (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1991</LINK>). The proportion of participants in each treatment group who achieved at least 50%maxTOTPAR was calculated using verified equations (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>). These proportions were then converted into the number of participants achieving at least 50%maxTOTPAR by multiplying by the total number of participants in the treatment group. Information on the number of participants with at least 50%maxTOTPAR for active treatment and placebo was then used to calculate relative benefit (RB) and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT).<BR/>Pain measures accepted for the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>five-point categorical pain relief (PR) scales with comparable wording to "none, slight, moderate, good or complete";</LI>
<LI>four-point categorical pain intensity (PI) scales with comparable wording to "none, mild, moderate, severe";</LI>
<LI>VAS for pain relief;</LI>
<LI>VAS for pain intensity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If none of these measures were available, numbers of participants reporting "very good or excellent" on a five-point categorical global scale with the wording "poor, fair, good, very good, excellent" were taken as those achieving at least 50% pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes:</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Use of rescue medication</HEADING>
<P>Numbers of participants requiring rescue medication were used to calculate relative risk (RR) and numbers needed to treat to prevent (NNTp) use of rescue medication for treatment and placebo groups. Median (or mean) time to use of rescue medication was used to calculate the weighted mean of the median (or mean) for the outcome. Weighting was by number of participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Numbers of participants reporting adverse events for each treatment group were used to calculate RR and numbers needed to treat to harm (NNH) estimates for:</P>

<LI>any adverse event;</LI>
<LI>any serious adverse event (as reported in the study);</LI>
<LI>withdrawal due to an adverse event.</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Withdrawals</HEADING>
<P>Withdrawals for reasons other than lack of efficacy (participants using rescue medication - see above) and adverse events were noted, as were exclusions from analysis where data were presented.</P>
<P>Relative benefit or risk estimates were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1995</LINK>). NNT, NNTp and NNH with 95% CI were calculated using the pooled number of events by the method of Cook and Sackett (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>). A statistically significant difference from control was assumed when the 95% CI of the relative benefit did not include the number one.</P>
<P>Homogeneity of studies was assessed visually (<LINK REF="REF-L_x0027_Abb_x00e9_-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">L'Abbé 1987</LINK>). The z test (<LINK REF="REF-Tram_x00e8_r-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tramèr 1997</LINK>) was used to determine if there was a significant difference between NNTs for different doses of active treatment, or between groups in the sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>Two of the previously included studies remain unpublished. These studies were conducted by the pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co Inc, Rahway, New Jersey, USA, and provided data from trials where naproxen sodium 550 mg was used as an active comparator for rofecoxib in acute dental pain (<LINK REF="STD-Merck-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Merck 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merck-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Merck 1997b</LINK>).

The relative benefit of treatment compared with placebo was 1.9 (1.5 to 2.4), and the NNT for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours was 5.3 (3.9 to 8.2) (z = 6.6, P &lt; 0.00006).</P>
<P>For 500 mg naproxen or 550 mg naproxen sodium, in dental studies (five studies, 402 participants), the relative benefit compared to placebo was 8.7 (5.2 to 14) and the NNT for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours was 1.8 (1.6 to 2.1), while for studies in other surgery the relative benefit was 1.8 (1.3 to 2.4) and the NNT was 5.4 (3.6 to 11) (z = 5.9, P &lt; 0.00006) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Excluding the single trial in arthroscopic knee surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Binning-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Binning 2007</LINK>) did not significantly change this result (NNT 4.5 (3.1 to 7.7)).</P>

<P>Nine studies had 40 or more participants in both treatment arms, and three had fewer than 40 participants. For the 500 mg/550 mg dose, there were five studies (two dental, three other surgery, 513 participants) with 40 or more participants and three (two dental, one other surgery, 191 participants) with less than 40 participants. There was no difference for the outcome of at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours between these groups, although the amount of information on which to base a conclusion was limited.</P>

<P>Withdrawals and exclusions were not reported consistently, particularly in older studies. Exclusions may not be of any particular consequence in single dose acute pain studies, where most exclusions result from participants not having moderate or severe pain (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 1982</LINK>). Withdrawals were sometimes reported without stating which treatment groups these referred to, or when withdrawals occurred, i.e., before assessment of analgesia at four to six hours, or at some other point before the end of the trial. Where details were given, withdrawals or exclusions were usually due to protocol violations or adverse events related to the surgical procedure.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 11:05:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>This updated review includes five additional studies (<LINK REF="STD-Binning-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Binning 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hill-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hill 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2005</LINK>) and adds information on 50% more participants treated with 500 mg/550 mg naproxen/naproxen sodium, the most commonly used dose. All the studies were of adequate methodological quality to minimize bias. The NNT for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours for 500 mg/550 mg compared to placebo was barely changed at 2.7 (2.3 to 3.3). About half of the participants treated with this dose achieved this level of pain relief, compared with about 15% treated with placebo. There were no additional trials using doses of 200 mg/220 mg or 400 mg/440 mg, and there remains no demonstrable dose response for this outcome.</P>
<P>Indirect comparisons of NNTs for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours in reviews of other analgesics using identical methods indicate that naproxen 500 mg/550 mg has equivalent efficacy to ibuprofen 400 mg (2.7 (2.5 to 3.0) (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1999</LINK>) and lumiracoxib 400 mg (2.7 (2.2 to 3.5) (<LINK REF="REF-Roy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2007</LINK>), and is better than paracetamol 1000 mg (3.6 (3.2 to 4.1)) (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>), but is worse than rofecoxib (2.2 (1.9 to 2.4) (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2005</LINK>). A current listing of reviews of analgesics in the single dose postoperative pain model can be found at <A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier">www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier</A>.</P>
<P>This review included eight studies in dental pain, with 452 participants treated with naproxen or naproxen sodium, and seven studies in other types of surgery, with 345 participants treated with naproxen or naproxen sodium. Analysing data from the different pain models separately demonstrated a significant difference between the response in the different models for the primary outcome of at least 50% pain relief. Doses were combined for this analysis because no dose response was demonstrated for the primary outcome in these studies, and because similar numbers (the majority of participants) in both groups were treated with 500 mg/550 mg. Compared with dental studies, those in other types of surgery had higher and more variable placebo response rates, and lower response rates with similar variability for naproxen. This result differs from a previous finding that the effect of the pain model is not significant (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004</LINK>), possibly reflecting the limited amount of information available with naproxen.</P>
<P>All the studies had fewer than 100 participants per treatment arm, with many having just below or just over the 40 participants selected <I>a priori</I> as a cut-off for the sensitivity analysis of study size. This set of studies therefore lacked sensitivity for this sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>The sodium salt of naproxen was introduced to improve its solubility for oral administration. The planned sensitivity analysis for effect of this formulation was limited to non-dental trials because all the dental studies used the sodium salt. The analysis demonstrated a difference between the two formulations, but the result should be treated with caution because of the small numbers involved.</P>
<P>A slow release formulation of naproxen sodium was tested in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2005</LINK>) in orthopaedic surgery. The expectation is that this formulation might take longer to achieve its analgesic effect, but that the effect would last longer. This particular study did not appear to do any better than others in the same pain model using half the dose, but no conclusions can safely be drawn on the basis of this single study.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that data on use of rescue medication, whether as a proportion of participants requiring it, or the median time to use of it, might be helpful in assessing the usefulness of an analgesic, and possibly distinguishing between different doses (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>). There were insufficient data for 200 mg/220 mg and 400 mg/440 mg doses to formally test for a dose response for this outcome, but the results of the individual studies did not suggest that there was one. The median time to use of rescue medication in these trials was almost nine hours, compared with two hours for placebo. This relatively long duration of action compares favourably with analgesics such as paracetamol where the median time is under four hours (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>). The full implications of the importance of remedication as an outcome awaits completion of other reviews, allowing examination of a substantial body of evidence.</P>
<P>Reporting of data for adverse events, withdrawals (other than lack of efficacy) or exclusions, and handling of missing data was not always complete, although it did appear to be better in the more recent studies. Adverse events were collected using various methods (questioning, patient diary) over different periods of time. This may have included periods after the use of rescue medication, which may cause its own adverse events. Poor reporting of adverse events in acute pain trials have been noted before (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK>). The usefulness of single dose studies for assessing adverse events is questionable, but it is non-the-less reassuring that there was no difference between naproxen (at any dose) and placebo for occurrence of any adverse event, and that serious adverse events and adverse event withdrawals were rare, and generally not thought to be related to the test drug. Long-term, multiple dose studies should be used for meaningful analysis of adverse events since, even in acute pain settings, analgesics are likely to be used in multiple doses.</P>
<P>Lack of information about withdrawals or exclusions may have led to an overestimate of efficacy, but the effect is probably not significant because it is as likely to be related to poor reporting as poor methods. In single dose studies most exclusions occur for protocol violations such as failing to meet baseline pain requirements, or failing to return for post treatment visits after the acute pain results are concluded. Where patients are treated with a single dose of medication and observed, often "on site" for the duration of the trial, it might be considered unnecessary to report on "withdrawals" if there were none. For missing data it has been shown that over the four to six hour period, there is no difference between baseline observation carried forward, which gives the more conservative estimate, and last observation carried forward (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-12 11:10:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-11-12 11:10:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Naproxen and naproxen sodium at the most commonly used dose of 500 mg/550 mg is an effective analgesic, providing at least 50% pain relief to about half of treated patients with acute, moderate to severe, postoperative pain. The NNT of 2.7 for at least 50% pain relief, and nine hour average duration of action, compare favourably with other analgesics commonly used for postoperative pain. In single dose, it  is associated with a low rate of adverse events, similar to that with placebo. Lower doses (400 mg/440 mg and 200 mg/220 mg) may provide equivalent levels of analgesia. This review suggests that there may be differences in efficacy following different types of surgery.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-03 13:39:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Further trials at lower doses could clarify whether they provide useful analgesia. It should always be the goal to use the lowest dose of a drug that provides the desired clinical effect, and lower doses are likely to be associated with fewer adverse events. Further studies in different types of surgery could clarify whether there are clinically important differences in efficacy in different surgical settings. The major implication is for better reporting of clinical trials, in avoiding average information from highly skewed distributions, in providing information about how many patients achieve a clinically useful level of pain relief, and in reporting other outcomes of clinical relevance, such as time to remedication.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Categorical rating scale:</HEADING>
<P>The commonest is the five category scale (none, slight, moderate, good or lots, and complete). For analysis numbers are given to the verbal categories (for pain intensity, none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2 and severe = 3, and for relief none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, good or lots = 3 and complete = 4). Data from different subjects is then combined to produce means (rarely medians) and measures of dispersion (usually standard errors of means). The validity of converting categories into numerical scores was checked by comparison with concurrent visual analogue scale measurements. Good correlation was found, especially between pain relief scales using cross-modality matching techniques. Results are usually reported as continuous data, mean or median pain relief or intensity. Few studies present results as discrete data, giving the number of participants who report a certain level of pain intensity or relief at any given assessment point. The main advantages of the categorical scales are that they are quick and simple. The small number of descriptors may force the scorer to choose a particular category when none describes the pain satisfactorily.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">VAS:</HEADING>
<P>Visual analogue scale: lines with left end labelled "no relief of pain" and right end labelled "complete relief of pain", seem to overcome this limitation. Patients mark the line at the point which corresponds to their pain. The scores are obtained by measuring the distance between the no relief end and the patient's mark, usually in millimetres. The main advantages of VAS are that they are simple and quick to score, avoid imprecise descriptive terms and provide many points from which to choose. More concentration and coordination are needed, which can be difficult post-operatively or with neurological disorders.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">TOTPAR:</HEADING>
<P>Total pain relief (TOTPAR) is calculated as the sum of pain relief scores over a period of time. If a patient had complete pain relief immediately after taking an analgesic, and maintained that level of pain relief for six hours, they would have a six-hour TOTPAR of the maximum of 24. Differences between pain relief values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the composite trapezoidal rule. The trapezoidal rule is a simple method that approximately calculates the definite integral of the area under the pain relief curve by calculating the sum of the areas of several trapezoids that together closely approximate to the area under the curve.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">SPID:</HEADING>
<P>Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) is calculated as the sum of the differences between the pain scores over a period of time. Differences between pain intensity values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the trapezoidal rule.</P>
<P>VAS TOTPAR and VAS SPID are visual analogue versions of TOTPAR and SPID.</P>
