<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Chinese herbal medicine is widely used as adjunct therapy to chemo- or radiotherapy in patients being treated for cancer of the oesophagus. As yet there is no evidence that Chinese herbal medicine is effective or not in this role.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>We performed a systematic review of the potential benefits of Chinese herbal medicine by comparing chemo- or radiotherapy for oesophageal cancer with and without concurrent herbal medicine. We searched the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP database, Wanfang database and the Chinese Cochrane Centre Controlled Trials Register up to 1 October, 2015. We also searched databases of ongoing trials, the Internet and reference lists.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs). All trials were conducted in China.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This updated review included nine trials involving 490 participants. When Chinese herbal medicine was used as adjunct therapy to chemo- or radiotherapy for oesophageal cancer, the results showed a positive effect on quality of life, increased tolerance of patients for adverse effects caused by radiotherapy or chemotherapy (e.g. radiation oesophagitis, gastrointestinal reactions and blood cell descent), but no effects on all-cause mortality, median survival times or time to progression.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We judged the quality of evidence to be low to moderate due to risk of bias; the small number of people enrolled in these studies caused imprecision and inconsistent results. The nine included trials did not allow a subgroup analysis of different kinds of Chinese herbal medicine, the therapeutic purposes of which are different between each other; this might be another reason for imprecise results. High quality trials are required in the future.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-04 10:30:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We tried to contact the 142 study authors by telephone, and finally included nine studies with 490 participants. All included studies were conducted in China, and allocated advanced oesophageal cancer patients to radiotherapy or chemotherapy groups, with and without additional Chinese herbal medicine. Quality of life, short-term therapeutic effects, TCM symptoms and adverse events caused by radiotherapy or chemotherapy were reported in these studies. Overall, we considered the trials to be at unclear or high risk of bias.</P>
<P>The quality of life measure was conducted before and after the intervention; our analysis showed a beneficial effect, both in number of participants experiencing an improvement (risk ratio (RR) 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 3.39; 5 RCTs, 233 participants, change of performance status score &#8805; 10) and number of participants experiencing a deterioration (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.62; 6 RCTs, 287 participants, change of performance status score &#8804; 10). We judged this to have low quality evidence, downgrading quality of evidence for risk of bias and imprecision, and upgrading quality of evidence for the large effect.</P>
<P>For short-term therapeutic effects, the results suggest that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a positive impact on improvement (complete response + partial response) (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.35; 8 RCTs, 450 participants), moderate quality evidence and downgrading for risk of bias. There was no significant difference for progressive disease (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.01; 8 RCTs, 450 participants), low quality evidence and downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision. Three studies assessed this outcome after four weeks or three months' follow-up, the remaining studies gave no detailed information for this outcome. TCM symptoms, which was similar to short-term therapeutic effects evaluated with TCM clinical criteria, was diagnosed in two studies of 88 people at the end of the intervention. The results suggest that TCM has a positive impact on both total effectiveness (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.81) and ineffectiveness (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.93); we judged the studies to have very low quality evidence, downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision.</P>
<P>Nine studies reported a series of adverse events caused by radiotherapy or chemotherapy at the end of the intervention, including mucositis, radiation oesophagitis, arrest of bone marrow, gastrointestinal reactions, renal and hepatic impairment, white blood cell descent, neurotoxicity, cardiac toxicity and anaemia. For those containing multiple studies, we conducted a pooled analysis. As a result, TCM showed a significant effect on radiation oesophagitis (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94; 2 RCTs, 90 participants), gastrointestinal reactions (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; 4 RCTs, 268 participants) and white blood cell descent (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.83; 4 RCTs, 224 participants). The quality of evidence was low or very low, downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-01-04 10:30:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We currently find no evidence to determine whether TCM is an effective treatment for oesophageal cancer. The effect of TCM on short-term therapeutic effects is uncertain. TCM probably has positive effects on quality of life and on some adverse events caused by radiotherapy or chemotherapy in advanced oesophageal cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The results of the review need to be interpreted cautiously owing to overall low quality evidence. Future trials should be large and correctly designed to detect important clinical effects and minimise risk of bias.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-01-04 10:30:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oesophageal cancer is a global health problem that has two subtypes: squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. As the seventh leading cause of cancer death worldwide, the occurrence of oesophageal cancer varies by geographic area, ethnic group and gender. The incidence of oesophageal carcinoma can be as high as 30 to 800 cases per 100,000 persons in particular areas of northern Iran, some areas of southern Russia, and in northern China; the incidence in the US is approximately three to six cases per 100,000 persons (<LINK REF="REF-Nishihira-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishihira 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pera-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pera 2001</LINK>). Oesophageal cancer is generally more common in men than in women, with a male-to-female ratio of 7:1, and occurs most commonly during the sixth and seventh decades of life (<LINK REF="REF-Blot-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blot 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirby-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oesophageal carcinoma arises in the mucosa. Subsequently it tends to invade the submucosa and the muscular layer of the oesophagus. Eventually contiguous structures such as the tracheobronchial tree, the aorta, or the recurrent laryngeal nerve become involved. Though firstly metastasising to the perioesophageal lymph nodes, oesophageal cancer can also spread to almost any other part of the body, including the liver, lungs, brain and bones (<LINK REF="REF-Nishihira-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishihira 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The etiology of oesophageal carcinoma is thought to be related to exposure of the oesophageal mucosa to noxious or toxic stimuli, resulting in a sequence of dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Lam-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some factors believed to trigger oesophageal carcinoma are: cigarette smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Broitman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broitman 1983</LINK>); alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Tuyns-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuyns 1979</LINK>); drinking exceptionally hot beverages such as tea (<LINK REF="REF-Victora-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victora 1987</LINK>); diets low in beta-carotene, vitamins A, C and B, magnesium and zinc; poor oral hygiene; protease inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Sammon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sammon 1998</LINK>); high-level exposure to asbestos (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Byrne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Byrne 2001</LINK>); tylosis palmaris et plantaris (<LINK REF="REF-Mandard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandard 2000</LINK>); swallowing lye or other caustic substances (<LINK REF="REF-Messmann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messmann 2001</LINK>); and Barrett's oesophagus (<LINK REF="REF-Williamsom-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamsom 1991</LINK>). A recent investigation reported that the high incidence of oesophageal carcinoma in Taiwan and India may be associated with betel chewing as a major independent risk factor (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2001a</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-01-04 10:30:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The management of oesophageal cancer presents great challenges in the current practice of gastroenterology; it is highly treatable in its earliest stages but is usually fatal when more advanced (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steup-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steup 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Non-operative therapy is usually reserved for patients who are not candidates for surgery. The goal of therapy for these patients is palliation of dysphagia, to allow them to eat. Chemotherapy has limited use as a single modality (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Entwistle-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Entwistle 2002</LINK>), but radiation therapy is successful in relieving dysphagia in approximately 50% of patients. In patients with advanced oesophageal cancer, the preoperative combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has shown good results (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herskovic-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herskovic 1992</LINK>). Intracavitary radiotherapy, with or without surgery, is safe for many patients (<LINK REF="REF-Homs-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homs 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Laser therapy can destroy cancerous tissue and relieve a blockage in the oesophagus when the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. The relief of a blockage can help to reduce symptoms, especially swallowing problems (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 1992</LINK>). When a tracheoesophageal fistula is present, intubating with expandable metallic stents is particularly useful (<LINK REF="REF-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knyrim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarper-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarper 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oesophageal resection (oesophagectomy) is used in patients who are suitable for surgery. If an oesophagectomy is indicated there are three main procedures that range from minimally invasive to highly invasive (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2003</LINK>). A transhiatal oesophagectomy without a thoracotomy, a 'standard' (transthoracic) oesophagectomy, or an en bloc oesophagectomy are current methods used. Many studies have been conducted using the three procedures but a consensus has not been formed as to the preferred technique (<LINK REF="REF-Goldminc-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldminc 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swanstrom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanstrom 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teng-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teng 1999</LINK>). The application of these treatments is dependent on the stage of the disease at diagnosis.</P>
<P>Chinese herbal medicine for oesophageal cancer has commonly been used as adjunct treatment for alleviating the side effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and for improving the quality of life of cancer patients. An investigation conducted in New Zealand found that 49% of cancer patients used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), including vitamins, antioxidants, alternative diets and herbal therapies. Usage was more common in younger patients. CAM was used by 47% of people to improve quality of life and by 30% in the hope of a cancer cure (<LINK REF="REF-Chrystal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chrystal 2003</LINK>). In one study, all participants used three or more types of CAM, most commonly herbal or nutritional supplements (<LINK REF="REF-Shumay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shumay 2001</LINK>); evidence suggests that at least one cancer patient in three uses some form of CAM (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 1999</LINK>). The most commonly-cited reasons for seeking complementary medicine were to reduce side effects of treatment, and because of the lack of effectiveness of standard therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Hilsden-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilsden 1999</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-01-01 01:07:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Possible benefits of herbal medicine includes increasing appetite (<LINK REF="STD-Jin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jin 2003</LINK>), boosting the immune system (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2002a</LINK>), facilitating the recovery of the body and preventing tumour regeneration or development of metastases (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1999</LINK>). Some herbs may be effective against cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Ye-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ye 2002</LINK>). For example, artemisinin-type compounds inhibit tumour cell growth (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003</LINK>), and membranous milkvetch root, Barbary wolfberry fruit, and heterophylly falsestarwort root may enhance immunity (<LINK REF="STD-Du-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Du 1998</LINK>). Common yam rhizome and Indian bread could decrease the side effects of radiotherapy and give a better outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Jia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jia 2001</LINK>). The Chinese herbal medicine spreading hedyotis can repress the proliferation of cancer cells and block the progression of oesophageal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 1996a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is used in the treatment of cancer by following a particular theoretical and methodological pathway that involves assessing the cause, diagnosis and treatment. Drug treatment within TCM typically consists of complex prescriptions of a combination of components.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-11-10 04:36:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence to support the use of herbal medicine for anticancer effects, reducing chemotherapy side effects and improving quality of life is mainly theoretical and experiential. Furthermore, there is evidence to indicate that not all CAM is risk-free, with concerns regarding adverse event issues such as allergic reactions and Chinese herbal nephropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Lampert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lampert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lord-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nortier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nortier 2000</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Random sequence generation (selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We classified a study as a RCT if it was described as randomised (this includes the use of words such as randomly, random, and randomisation, etc.). We judged the study as low risk, high risk, or unclear risk according to the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk, if the allocation sequence was generated by computer-generated random numbers, published random number table, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, or throwing dice.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk, if the trial was described as randomised but the method used for generation of the allocation sequence was not described.</LI>
<LI>High risk, if selection was based on patient numbers, birth dates, visit dates, or alternative allocation.</LI>

<LI>Low risk, if investigators were unaware of the allocation of each participant before they were entered in the trial. Acceptable methods included: central telephone randomisation schemes, pharmacy-based schemes, sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes, or sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk, if the authors did not report or provide a description of an allocation concealment approach that allowed for classification as concealed or not concealed.</LI>
<LI>High risk, when investigators may have been aware of the allocation of each participant before they entered the trial, e.g. when allocation was based on patient data such as date of birth, hospital case note number, or visit dates, sealed envelopes that were not opaque, or a random number table that was not concealed from an investigator.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Low risk, if both participants and physicians were blinded to the treatment allocation, and it was unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk, if no blinding information was available or there was insufficient information to permit a judgement of low risk or high risk.</LI>
<LI>High risk, if the authors defined the study as an open study, or no party was blinded. Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, and the non-blinding of others was likely to introduce bias.</LI>

<LI>Unclear risk, if insufficient reporting of attrition or exclusions to permit judgement of low risk or high risk (e.g. no reasons for missing data provided).</LI>
<LI>High risk, if reasons for missing outcome data were likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk were enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate; per protocol analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation; potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.</LI>

<LI>High risk, if not all of the study&#8217;s prespecified primary outcomes were reported; the primary outcome was reported using measurements, analysis methods, or subsets of the data that were not prespecified; the primary outcome was not prespecified or was reported incompletely; or the study report failed to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</LI>

<P>If data were sufficiently similar, we carried out meta-analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We expressed results as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes; we used mean difference (MD) or the standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We estimated time-to-event (survival) data by O - E (observed value minus expected value) with variance.</P>

<P>For trials with non-standard designs such as cluster-randomised trials and trials with multiple intervention groups, unit of analysis issues were taken into account.

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-01-04 10:30:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where required, we requested information about missing data from original trial authors by telephone interview. We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis for missing participants due to drop-out. If the missing data were unobtainable, we assumed that the unreported outcomes would provide dissatisfactory results. For example, the missing data from treatment groups would be added to the number experiencing deterioration in quality of life, progressive disease in short-term therapeutic effects and suffering adverse events caused by radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The missing data from control groups would be added to the number experiencing improvement in quality of life and improvement in short-term therapeutic effects.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">GRADE and 'Summary of findings' table</HEADING>
<P>We created a 'Summary of findings' table using the following outcomes, all-cause mortality, median survival times, time to progression, quality of life, short-term therapeutic effects or TCM symptoms and adverse events. We used the five GRADE (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>) considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes. We used methods and recommendations described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using GRADEproGDT software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEproGDT-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEproGDT 2015</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The included studies reported two different therapeutic evaluation methods; short-term therapeutic effects and TCM symptoms. Short-term therapeutic effects referred to improvement (complete response + partial response) and progressive disease. There were three evaluation criteria, five studies used the World Health Organization Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (<LINK REF="STD-He-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">He 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mu 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ren-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2010c" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2010c</LINK>), two studies used the New Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2013a</LINK>), and one study used the WanJun evaluation criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>). One study measured this outcome after four weeks' follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>), two studies followed up for three months after the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-He-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">He 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ren-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2013</LINK>), and the remaining gave no detailed information. TCM symptoms were diagnosed in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Shao-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2010c" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2010c</LINK>) at the end of the intervention. The studies classified participants as to total effectiveness and ineffectiveness according to <LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2002</LINK>. The total effectiveness meant the symptom scores decreased &#8805;30% after intervention, the ineffectiveness represented the symptom scores decreased &#8804;30% after intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>We focused on any adverse event that caused death, life-threatening illness or significant toxicity. In this updated review, the nine included studies reported many adverse events, such as, mucositis, radiation oesophagitis, arrest of bone marrow, gastrointestinal reactions (vomiting, dyspepsia, nausea), renal and hepatic impairment, white blood cell descent, neurotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, anaemia and low fever. All these adverse events were observed at the end of the intervention.</P>
<P>In addition, we were also concerned with outcomes which could reflect the adjunct treatment characteristics of Chinese herbal medicine, such as bodyweight (reflecting increased appetite) and T-lymphocyte and cancer bio-markers (reflecting boost the immune system).</P>

<P>In the last version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Wei-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2007</LINK>), we included <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2002a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK> as real RCTs based on the initial interview with the original trial authors. On 31 May, 2007, TW interviewed Dr. Degui Liu and Prof. Zhijian Chen, the original trial authors, to discuss the design and process of the study in detail. The two trial authors very kindly explained that they had not used any randomisation method to generate an allocation sequence; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK> was actually a retrospective case report. We therefore identified them as non-RCTs and excluded them from the review.</P>
<P>According to this situation, it was necessary to critically identify whether the studies which claimed they had "randomly allocated patients" were true RCTs or not. For this purpose, we telephoned the authors of these studies. In conclusion, 13 trial authors refused an interview, 48 studies were retrospective case reports, two trial authors confessed to using no random method, seven trial authors could not describe the details of the random method, and 22 trial authors misunderstood the random allocation method or used an incorrect random method. We recorded the process of telephone interviews, and two review authors (XC and TW) were responsible for judgements (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>We reported quality of life in terms of number of participants experiencing an improvement and number experiencing a deterioration in quality of life. More specifically, we assessed quality of life pre- and post-intervention with the Karnofsky performance status scale or other validated scales. Participants experiencing an improvement meant that the participants performance score would improve &#8805; 10 after the intervention, while experiencing a deterioration meant a change score &#8804; 10.</P>
<P>Five studies reported improvements in quality of life with a total of 233 participants undergoing radiotherapy or chemotherapy, with or without additional Chinese herbal medicine (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mu 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shao-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2010c" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2010c</LINK>). Six studies reported a deterioration in quality of life with 287 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mu 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ren-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shao-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2010c" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2010c</LINK>). TCM in these studies probably had a positive effect on quality of life, both in number experiencing improvement (risk ratio (RR) 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 3.39; I = 0%) and number experiencing deterioration (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.62; I = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). All studies in this outcome were parallel-group RCTs, but not blinded; the evaluation may have been affected by the subjective effect of the researcher, resulting in very serious risk of bias. Further, these studies included relatively few patients and few events and have wide confidence intervals around the estimate of the effect that could lead to serious imprecision. Due to the very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision, we downgraded the quality of evidence by three levels. With a RR of number experiencing improvement &#65310; 2.0 and RR of number experiencing deterioration &#65308; 0.5, the effect was large and so we upgraded the quality of evidence by one level. Overall, we judged this outcome to have low quality evidence.</P>
<P>In addition, one study provided the Karnofsky score for quality of life in 60 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK>). Results of this study suggest that Xiaoaiping injection may improve the Karnofsky score (mean difference (MD) 6.80, 95% CI 3.86 to 9.74) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Short-term therapeutic effects</HEADING>
<P>For short-term therapeutic effects, participants were divided into four different categories - complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease, which should have clear judgement criteria in individual trials. Improvement was defined as complete response and partial response, and it represented the patients being in a more beneficial state after therapy. In contrast to that, progressive disease represented a disadvantageous state after therapy.</P>
<P>In detail, eight studies reported short-term therapeutic effects in 450 participants experiencing radiotherapy or chemotherapy, with or without additional Chinese herbal medicine (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-He-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">He 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mu 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ren-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2010c" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2010c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2013a</LINK>). The data suggest that TCM probably leads to little or no difference in improvement (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.35; I = 0%, P = 0.03) and progressive disease (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.01; I = 0%, P = 0.06) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). If <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK> is removed from the analysis, the difference for improvement is no longer statistically significant (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.32; 7 studies, 360 participants; I = 0%, P = 0.17). This may be caused by different TCM formulations. However, the data were not sufficient to conduct a subgroup analysis, and we could not explore the potential diverse effects of TCM on short-term therapeutic effects. All studies were parallel-group RCTs but not blinded, the outcomes were measured by imaging such as CT, MRI or X-ray, and judged using the WanJun, WHO or RECIST Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours. Due to the lack of blinding, the observations would have experienced the Hawthorne effect. Therefore, the results might have serious limitations. In addition, the effect of progressive disease had wide confidence intervals, resulting in serious imprecision. Overall, we judged improvement to have moderate quality evidence, downgrading for serious risk of bias; and progressive disease to have low quality evidence due to serious risk of bias and serious imprecision (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">TCM symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Similar to short-term therapeutic effects, TCM symptoms divided participants into total effectiveness and ineffectiveness. The TCM symptoms scores were measured before and after intervention according to <LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2002</LINK>. The participants whose symptom scores decreased &#8805;30% were assigned to the total effectiveness group, the participants whose symptom scores decreased &#8804;30% were assigned to the ineffectiveness group. This outcome only included two studies with 88 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Shao-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2010c" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2010c</LINK>). As a result, TCM showed a positive impact on both total effectiveness (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.81; I = 37%) and ineffectiveness (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.93; I = 49%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). The two studies were not blinded and did not conceal allocation. TCM clinical criteria was ambiguous, the outcome may be more affected by the researcher, who prepared the TCM, so the risk of bias was very serious. Total effectiveness had serious limitations with only two included studies with few patients and few events, while the result for ineffectiveness had very serious limitations due to few patients, few events and wide confidence intervals. With a RR for ineffectiveness of &#65308; 0.5, the effect was large and so we upgraded the quality of evidence by one level. Overall, we judged total effectiveness to have very low quality evidence due to very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision; we judged ineffectiveness to also have very low quality evidence, downgrading for very serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision, and upgrading for the large effect.<BR/>

TCM exhibited a potential ability to reduce radiation oesophagitis (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94; I = 0%). We judged this to have low quality evidence; downgrading for serious risk of bias and serious imprecision.</LI>
<LI>One study reported arrest of bone marrow (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>). The result showed that TCM probably had an effect on arrest of bone marrow caused by chemoradiotherapy (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.58). We judged this to be of moderate quality evidence; downgrading for very serious risk of bias, and upgrading for the large effect.</LI>
<LI>Four studies reported gastrointestinal reactions (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-He-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">He 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2010c" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2010c</LINK>). The data showed that TCM probably had a potential effect on gastrointestinal reactions caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; I = 30%). We judged this to be of very low quality evidence; downgrading for very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision.</LI>
<LI>Two studies reported renal and hepatic impairment (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK>). However, pooled analysis showed significant heterogeneity with I = 88%, (50% is regarded as high level heterogeneity). Because only two trials were included in this adverse event, we could not explore potential sources of heterogeneity.</LI>
<LI>Four studies reported white blood cell descent (<LINK REF="STD-He-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">He 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ren-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shao-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 2011</LINK>). The data showed that oesophageal cancer patients may benefit from TCM after chemotherapy or radiotherapy (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.83; I = 0%) in blood cell descent. We judged this to be of very low quality evidence; downgrading for very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision.</LI>
<LI>One study reported neurotoxicity (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK>), there was no significant difference between the groups (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.55; P = 0.41). We judged this to be of low quality evidence; downgrading for very serious risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>One study reported cardiac toxicity (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK>), there was no significant difference between the groups (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.69; P = 0.72).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-04 10:30:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this systematic review, we intended to evaluate the efficacy and possible adverse effects of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) when used as an adjunct to treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy for oesophageal cancer. The overall treatment concept for TCM is different from that used in Western medicine, and we hoped to assess if TCM could be used in the effective treatment of oesophageal cancer. TCM is well established and widely used, and based on the principles that the root cause of illness, not the symptoms, must be treated. TCM can be described as being holistic in its approach; it views every aspect of the balance between mind, body, spirit and emotions. In using TCM to treat oesophageal cancer, physicians hope to strengthen and support the body's systems, using preparations that are formulated to act specifically on imbalances in the way the body functions.</P>
<P>In the last version of this review, we excluded all 43 studies which were self described by trial authors as being RCTs, as we later discovered this not to be the case. This may have been due to some Chinese trial authors in the field having misunderstood what the term means, underestimating the importance of randomly allocating participants with oesophageal cancer and knowing how to minimise risk of bias in a RCT. In this updated review, we tried to contact authors of 142 studies to critically identify whether the studies which claimed to be RCTs, were in fact true RCTs. Ultimately, we included nine of the studies (all conducted in China).</P>
<P>It is regrettable that none of the studies reported all-cause mortality, median survival times or time to progression, and so we are uncertain as to whether TCM has an effect on oesophageal cancer for these outcomes or how effective it may be. Most studies reported quality of life and short-term therapeutic effects. Both of these outcomes are measured by clinicians according to certain criteria, however, the process was not blinded, thereby increasing the risk of bias. The results of the meta-analyses show that TCM probably had an effect on quality of life. While, the results are complicated for short-term therapeutic effects, TCM showed a statistically significant effect on improvement (complete response + partial response), but no statistically significant effect on progressive disease. These inconsistent results may be caused by the small number of participants and few studies, which leads the result to be more sensitive and volatile. TCM symptoms, which were similar to short-term therapeutic effects evaluated with TCM clinical criteria, were diagnosed in two studies and showed a positive effect.</P>
<P>Nine studies reported a series of adverse events, such as mucositis, radiation oesophagitis, arrest of bone marrow, gastrointestinal reactions, renal and hepatic impairment, white blood cell descent, neurotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, anaemia and low fever. All of these adverse effects were caused by radiotherapy or chemotherapy, except for low fever, which was considered to be associated with TCM. After analyses, TCM showed a positive impact on radiation oesophagitis, arrest of bone marrow, gastrointestinal reactions and white blood cell descent. The effects of TCM on the other adverse effects are uncertain.</P>
<P>In this updated review, we were also concerned with the details of other outcomes not specified in the protocol, such as T-lymphocyte, cancer bio-markers and bodyweight. To some extent, these three outcomes would reflect the TCM effect, and as auxiliary outcomes, they have attracted the attention of researchers. If necessary, we will consider the analysis of these outcomes in a future review update.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-01-04 10:30:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is difficult to reach definitive conclusions due to variation between TCM formulations in the included studies. Variation in the components of herbal medical preparations is not unique to Chinese traditional herbal medicine; the variation between formulations and batches of treatments being an inevitable consequence of the nature of TCM. In China, the government specifies the limits of variation that are acceptable. This variation should be considered and may be a factor that contributes to any heterogeneity between different study results. Therefore, much importance should be attached to a high quality study when a study uses a self prepared herbal formulation and this study should provide evidence that is strong enough to encourage further studies in different locations to strengthen its validity. Studies treating oesophageal cancer with the same main components, as contained within an efficacious self prepared herbal formulation, are also encouraged. Chinese patented drugs have priority over the self prepared herbal formulations in order to achieve consistency.</P>
<P>In this review, we attempted to contact 142 authors, and completed 101 telephone interviews. Eventually we identified nine true RCTs. These RCTs allocated 490 participants in total to either usual treatment or usual treatment combined with TCM. Interventions, either usual treatment or TCM, were complicated. The usual treatment contained chemotherapy, radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy, while TCM contained eight different types. The included studies have addressed partial objectives assessing quality of life, short-term therapeutic effects and possible adverse effects. However, the question about other outcomes including all-cause mortality, median survival times and time to progression have not been answered.</P>
<P>In terms of applicability of evidence, all trials were conducted in China, this characteristic would limit the usage to a broader population. Further, the majority of trials gave no details about the duration of follow-up; the effects on quality of life and adverse events were measured at the end of the intervention. Thus, it was uncertain how long the effects of the intervention would last.</P>

<P>Overall, we rated the quality of evidence of the included studies between very low and moderate due to methodological limitations and imprecision.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>From the last published version of the review, we checked 142 studies labelled as "randomised controlled trial" by telephone interviews with authors, and finally obtained nine authentic RCTs. Although identified to be RCTs by telephone, all nine studies had problems with methodological quality. None of these studies provided information about allocation concealment, no TCM placebo was used in the control group (making it impossible to mask participants and physicians), there was no information about blinding of outcome assessors, no study had a statement on drop-outs or withdrawals, few studies reported the results of outcomes completely according to the methods section of the study, and self prepared TCM brought about conflicts of interest. All the factors mentioned above could lead to selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias or other bias - resulting in false positive findings.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The cumulative sample size and the total number of events were rather low, and 95% confidence intervals around relative effects were wide. We downgraded the quality of evidence for this imprecision of outcomes. In addition, we did not observe dose-response information in any outcomes of TCM to treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy for oesophageal cancer.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other</HEADING>
<P>The quality of trial reporting, particularly the descriptions of methodology, study processes and the results, were very poor, and we found it difficult to ascertain from the report how the studies were performed. In the future we would like to include high quality studies to determine the effect of Chinese herbal medicine on oesophageal cancer.<BR/>

<P>Publication bias was also a possibility but we were not able to assess this using a funnel plot due to having less than ten trials included in the review. Anther common problem was that the assessment of quality of life and TCM symptoms response of treatment were performed by authors who were not blinded in the trial conditions. This may have led to potential risk of detection bias and cause false positive results. Valuable assessment about quality of life and TCM symptoms response of treatment in a RCT should be participant-based, include use of a validated multidimensional questionnaire completed by the participant and use the internationally evaluated 'minimum standard checklist' (<LINK REF="REF-Efficace-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Efficace 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Efficace-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Efficace 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Efficace-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Efficace 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>We currently find no evidence to determine whether Chinese herbal medicine is an effective treatment for oesophageal cancer. There is uncertainty about the effect of TCM as an adjunct to radiotherapy or chemotherapy on short-term therapeutic effects for oesophageal cancer. TCM probably has an effect on quality of life in advanced oesophageal cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy or chemotherapy. There is very low or low quality evidence for TCM having positive effects on some adverse events caused by radiotherapy or chemotherapy, such as radiation oesophagitis, gastrointestinal reactions and white blood cell descent. The overall low quality of evidence may be due to poor trial design and performance, few trials and small number of participants.</P>
<P>Considering the severe discomfort caused by chemotherapy, radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy in oesophageal patients, it is important to understand what role TCM plays as an adjunct to these interventions. Further, it would be important to understand which kind of TCM coupled with usual treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) is optimal for oesophageal cancer treatment.<BR/>

<P>Large, multicentre, correctly randomised, placebo-controlled, triple-masked, eliminating conflict of interest trials should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine for oesophageal cancer. The following factors should be taken into account in future studies: the sample size should be calculated before research; there should be an eligible randomisation procedure; the allocation concealment and blinding of both the participants or results assessors should be performed and reported in detail; the drop-outs or withdrawals should be recorded with an ITT analysis applied to analyse the outcomes; and the reports should be written following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>).</P>
