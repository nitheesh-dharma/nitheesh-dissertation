<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-14 15:37:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review could not provide evidence from randomised controlled trials that routine supplementation with vitamin B6 during pregnancy is of any benefit, other than one trial suggesting protection against dental decay. It may cause harm if too much is taken, as amounts well above the recommended daily allowance are associated with numbness and difficulty in walking.</P>
<P>Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin which plays vital roles in numerous metabolic processes in the human body and helps with the development of the nervous system. Vitamin B6 is contained in many foods including meat, poultry, fish, vegetables, and bananas. It is thought that B6 may play a role in the prevention of pre-eclampsia, where the mother&#8217;s blood pressure is high with large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction, and in babies being born too early (preterm birth). Vitamin B6 may be helpful for reducing nausea in pregnancy. This review of four trials (involving 1646 pregnant women) assessed routine B6 supplementation during pregnancy with the aim of reducing the chances of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. Vitamin B6 as oral capsules or lozenges resulted in a decreased risk of dental decay in pregnant women in one trial. Lozenges had a greater effect, suggesting a local or topical effect of pyridoxine within the oral cavity. We did not find any clear differences in the risk of eclampsia or pre-eclampsia (three trials and two trials, respectively, <I>low quality evidence</I>). The studies did not have enough data to be able to make any other useful assessments.</P>
<P>The included trials were conducted between 1960 and 1983 and did not include important newborn outcomes that have only recently been associated with vitamin B6, such as decreases in cardiovascular malformations and orofacial clefts. The trials began at different times during pregnancy, most had high rates of loss to follow-up, and adverse effects of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) use were not assessed.</P>
<P>Further research assessing outcomes such as orofacial clefts, cardiovascular malformations, neurological development, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia and adverse events would be helpful.</P>

<P>Vitamin B6 plays vital roles in numerous metabolic processes in the human body, such as nervous system development and functioning.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-14 15:37:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Four trials (1646 women) were included. The method of randomisation was unclear in all four trials and allocation concealment was reported in only one trial. Two trials used blinding of participants and outcomes. Vitamin B6 as oral capsules or lozenges resulted in decreased risk of dental decay in pregnant women (capsules: risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.98; one trial, n = 371, <I>low quality of evidence</I>; lozenges: RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83; one trial, n = 342, <I>low quality of evidence</I>). A small trial showed reduced mean birthweights with vitamin B6 supplementation (mean difference -0.23 kg; 95% CI -0.42 to -0.04; n = 33; one trial). We did not find any statistically significant differences in the risk of eclampsia (capsules: n = 1242; three trials; lozenges: n = 944; one trial), pre-eclampsia (capsules n = 1197; two trials, <I>low quality of evidence</I>; lozenges: n = 944; one trial, <I>low-quality evidence</I>) or low Apgar scores at one minute (oral pyridoxine: n = 45; one trial), between supplemented and non-supplemented groups. No differences were found in Apgar scores at five minutes, or breastmilk production between controls and women receiving oral (n = 24; one trial) or intramuscular (n = 24; one trial) loading doses of pyridoxine at labour. Overall, the risk of bias was judged as unclear. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was <I>low</I> for both pre-eclampsia and dental decay. The other primary outcomes, preterm birth before 37 weeks and low birthweight, were not reported in the included trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-27 16:24:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>There were few trials, reporting few clinical outcomes and mostly with unclear trial methodology and inadequate follow-up. There is not enough evidence to detect clinical benefits of vitamin B6 supplementation in pregnancy and/or labour other than one trial suggesting protection against dental decay. Future trials assessing this and other outcomes such as orofacial clefts, cardiovascular malformations, neurological development, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia and adverse events are required.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-14 15:37:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-25 09:13:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin, naturally occurring in three forms - pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine - all of which are converted to the co-enzyme pyridoxal phospate (PLP) (<LINK REF="REF-Whitney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitney 2002</LINK>). It plays a vital role in numerous metabolic processes in the human body including nervous system development and functioning. The role of vitamin B6 supplementation during pregnancy has been evaluated and there is some evidence supporting its use in reducing the severity of nausea during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Matthews-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wibowo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wibowo 2012</LINK>). Evidence from case-control studies has also shown a possible decrease in risk of orofacial clefts (cleft lip and/or palate) in babies of periconceptional folate-supplemented mothers consuming high dietary pyridoxine (<LINK REF="REF-Krapels-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krapels 2004</LINK>). Some decrease in cardiovascular malformations in the offspring of mothers treated with pyridoxine has also been found (<LINK REF="REF-Czeizel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czeizel 2004</LINK>). Earlier studies have reported higher birthweights with supplementation of two mg/day dose of vitamin B6 during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>), low serum and milk levels (<LINK REF="REF-Roepke-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roepke 1979</LINK>) and lower one-minute Apgar scores in babies of mothers with low vitamin B6 intake. Pyridoxine may also have a role in prevention of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-de-la-Calle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">de la Calle 2003</LINK>) and preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Ronnenberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ronnenberg 2002</LINK>). In animal experiments, vitamin B6 has been associated with a decreased incidence of tooth decay (<LINK REF="REF-Rapisarda-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapisarda 1981</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-14 15:37:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for pyridoxine for women during pregnancy is currently 1.9 mg/day, compared to 1.3 mg/day recommended for non-pregnant females between the ages of 19 and 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-DRI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRI 1998</LINK>). This additional requirement for pyridoxine is based on estimated increased weight and metabolic needs of the mother and accumulation by the fetus and placenta (<LINK REF="REF-DRI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRI 1998</LINK>). However, although vitamin B6 indices decrease during pregnancy, especially during the third trimester, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether this is indicative of a deficient state with associated clinical implications, or a normal physiological response to pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-DRI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRI 1998</LINK>). The tolerable upper intake limit in adults and in pregnancy is 100 mg/day (<LINK REF="REF-DRI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRI 1998</LINK>). Symptoms of toxicity include numbness, seizures and an inability to walk due to sensory nerve damage, which may be irreversible if high doses are consumed for prolonged periods of time (<LINK REF="REF-DRI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRI 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitney 2002</LINK>). The use of high doses in childbearing women may have possible detrimental effects on the developing nervous system of the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Masino-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masino 2002</LINK>) and possible reduction in breastmilk production (<LINK REF="REF-DRI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRI 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kang_x002d_Yoon-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kang-Yoon 1992</LINK>), although this has not been consistently reported.</P>
<P>Deficiency of vitamin B6 presents with symptoms of nervous system dysfunction, such as irritability, depression, confusion, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, and can also manifest as microcytic anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Chaney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaney 2002</LINK>). Vitamin B6 is present in moderate quantities in a variety of foods, but is destroyed by heating (<LINK REF="REF-Whitney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitney 2002</LINK>). Richest sources of B6 include meats, poultry, fish, potatoes, legumes such as peas and beans, and also bananas and liver, although it is suggested that several servings are necessary to meet recommended intakes (<LINK REF="REF-Truswell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truswell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitney 2002</LINK>). Substances interfering with vitamin B6 include alcohol and isoniazid (the anti-tuberculosis drug), and possibly, and to a lesser extent, oral contraceptives (<LINK REF="REF-Chaney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaney 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Truswell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truswell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Var-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Var 2014</LINK>). Thus, supplementation is required in people such as those with inadequate dietary consumption, malabsorption, alcoholism, or those taking isoniazid or other similarly interacting drugs. Vitamin B6 is absorbed well from the gastrointestinal tract, and is most commonly administered orally; alternate administration is via intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (<LINK REF="REF-RxMed-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">RxMed 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-05-14 15:37:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In the human body, PLP activates several pathways in amino acid metabolism, including the formation of neurotransmitters (such as serotonin, norepinephrine, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)); and also plays a role in heme (component of haemoglobin) synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Chaney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaney 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NDP-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">NDP 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitney 2002</LINK>). PLP is also required for myelin (nerve sheath) formation (<LINK REF="REF-Chaney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaney 2002</LINK>). It thus aids the normal development of the central nervous system and also influences cognitive function (<LINK REF="REF-Ramakrishna-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramakrishna 1999</LINK>). Vitamin B6 also lowers the level of homocysteine which, when elevated, is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chaney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaney 2002</LINK>). There is some evidence suggesting a favourable influence of vitamin B6 on oxygen transportation among animal models, premature newborns and term newborns requiring intensive care; suggesting the possible impact of administering vitamin B6 during labour for postnatal adaptation disturbances of newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Boda-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boda 1981</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Temesvari-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Temesvari 1983</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-02-24 14:18:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>Dietary vitamin B6 intake was estimated as inadequate in a very large proportion of female adults in the second US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) based on the RDA recommended at the time (<LINK REF="REF-Kant-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kant 1990</LINK>). Numerous other studies in the United States around that time also documented vitamin B6 intakes below the RDA among pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-NDP-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">NDP 1990</LINK>). Furthermore, a recent epidemiological survey in the US population showed that plasma PLP concentrations of women of childbearing age were significantly lower than those of comparably aged men (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2008</LINK>). Based on the recently lowered RDA of 1.3 mg/day (<LINK REF="REF-DRI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRI 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IFIC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">IFIC 1998</LINK>), the results of third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), suggest adequate dietary intakes among young women (mean daily intake 1.50 mg +/- 0.04 in females 20 to 39 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Alaimo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alaimo 1998</LINK>). However, the adequacy of a reduced RDA of vitamin B6 for young women - from 1.6 mg/day to 1.3 mg/day - has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2001</LINK>). In two recent small studies from Spain, women during pregnancy were not found to be meeting recommended B6 intakes (<LINK REF="REF-Arija-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arija 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rocamora-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocamora 2003</LINK>). This review evaluated clinical outcomes in mothers and newborns, from trials in which pyridoxine was administered during pregnancy or labour, or both, for purposes other than treatment of nausea and vomiting.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of quality in included studies</HEADING>
<P>For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparisons.</P>

<P>GRADEprofiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2014</LINK>) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes were produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>None of the included trials in this update was cluster randomised. For future updates, we will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely. We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity or subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-02-24 14:24:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>For included studies, levels of attrition were noted. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect will be explored by using sensitivity analysis. For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I was greater than 30% and either a Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. Had we identified substantial heterogeneity (above 30%), we planned to explore it by pre-specified subgroup analysis. </P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-05-14 15:38:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. Had there been clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we planned to use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. In future updates, if used, the random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials. If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% CIs, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<P>If we had identified substantial heterogeneity, we planned to investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We planned to consider whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, to use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>We carried out subgroup analyses according to the route of administration (oral, lozenges, intramuscular). We were unable to assess subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) owing to the limited number of included trials and paucity of data.</P>
<P>In future updates, if data allow, we will assess subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The majority of the studies are quite old. The estimated number of pregnant women included in this review is 1646 (which includes all 1532 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Hillman-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 1963</LINK>; 45 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Schuster-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 1984</LINK>; 33 in <LINK REF="STD-Swartwout-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Swartwout 1960</LINK>; and 36 in <LINK REF="STD-Temesvari-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Temesvari 1983</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 1963</LINK>) recruited women regardless of gestational age while two other trials recruited women who were less than or equal to 3.5 months (<LINK REF="STD-Swartwout-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Swartwout 1960</LINK>), and less than 5.5 months (<LINK REF="STD-Schuster-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 1984</LINK>) pregnant. The fourth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Temesvari-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Temesvari 1983</LINK>) recruited women in the delivery room. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schuster-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swartwout-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Swartwout 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Temesvari-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Temesvari 1983</LINK>) specified that only women who were free from complications were enrolled. Information regarding baseline dietary intake was available for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schuster-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 1984</LINK>), in which 83% of women were found consuming less than the then current RDA of pyridoxine of 2.6 mg/day for pregnancy. Dietary intake was not controlled in <LINK REF="STD-Hillman-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 1963</LINK>, although the authors reported that similar dietary instructions were given to intervention and control groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Temesvari-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Temesvari 1983</LINK>) administered a loading dose of 100 mg of pyridoxine hydrochloricum either intramuscularly (group 1) or orally (group 2) to previously unsupplemented women in the delivery room, whose labour lasted two to 10 hours after the loading dose was administered (mean for group (1) was four hours; mean for group (2) was 5.5 hours). Loading doses were administered to induce changes in blood oxygen affinity levels in the mother and newborn and were based on findings from an earlier study by the same authors, which showed the effect of high pyridoxine doses on newborn blood oxygen affinity (<LINK REF="STD-Temesvari-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Temesvari 1983</LINK>). We analysed this trial separately from the other trials due to the difference in timing and duration of pyridoxine supplementation. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Swartwout-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Swartwout 1960</LINK>) administered 25 mg pyridoxine-HCl orally. In <LINK REF="STD-Hillman-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 1963</LINK>, 20 mg pyridoxine was administered as part of a multivitamin supplement, or as three daily lozenges containing 6.67 mg of pyridoxine each. Schuster et al (<LINK REF="STD-Schuster-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 1984</LINK>) administered 2.6, 5, 7.5, 10 and 20 mg to different groups (providing 2.1, 4.1, 6.2, 8.2, 12.3, 16.5 mg pyridoxine equivalents respectively). For this trial, we merged the various pyridoxine supplemented groups into one group (of 2.6 to 20 mg) and compared it to the control group. Further dosage categorisations may be possible in future updates of the review. We did not combine different routes of administration of pyridoxine (intramuscular, oral, lozenges) to avoid double-counting the control groups of a single trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The author of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schuster-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 1984</LINK>) provided additional information on trial methodology and outcomes. Among primary outcomes, eclampsia and pre-eclampsia were reported in two (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuster-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 1984</LINK>) and were assumed as absent based on information presented in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Swartwout-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Swartwout 1960</LINK>). Dental decay was reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 1963</LINK>). One trial reported the effect of pyridoxine supplementation on breastmilk production, although it was measured only on one particular day, by weighing the baby before and after a single breastfeeding episode, and thus may have limited accuracy (<LINK REF="STD-Temesvari-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Temesvari 1983</LINK>). Mean birthweight was reported by one trial, but the test of significance used to generate the P value was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Swartwout-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Swartwout 1960</LINK>). Thus, caution is advised whilst interpreting mean birthweight, since the standard deviation we calculated was based on the assumption that the authors employed the conventional t-test. Certain required clinical outcomes, although reported by two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuster-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 1984</LINK>) could not be extracted due to incomplete information or varying format. Low Apgar score at one minute and five minutes were reported by two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schuster-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Schuster 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Temesvari-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Temesvari 1983</LINK>) and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Temesvari-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Temesvari 1983</LINK>) respectively. No included trial reported data for preterm birth, low birthweight, cardiovascular or orofacial malformations or adverse events in the neonate. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Temesvari-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Temesvari 1983</LINK>) mentioned that mothers and babies followed 'uncomplicated courses at the nursery'.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-05-14 15:40:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-14 15:40:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Oral pyridoxine supplementation was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the risk of dental decay in pregnant women (16%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2 to 29%), although CIs were wide. We found pyridoxine lozenges to be associated with a greater decrease in the risk of dental decay (32%; 95% CI 17 to 44%), although this finding was also associated with wide CIs. These results need further assessment in well-designed studies in different settings. However, the data suggest a primarily local or topical effect of pyridoxine within the oral cavity, and in vitro experiments suggest pyridoxine and its analogues inhibit various activities of bacteria (<I>Streptococcus mutans</I>) implicated in dental decay (<LINK REF="REF-Thaniyavarn-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thaniyavarn 1982</LINK>). The risk of low birthweight could not be assessed, as no included trial reported these data. The results of a small trial show that vitamin B6 was associated with a reduction in mean birthweight by 0.23 kg (CI 0.04 to 0.42 kg). However, there is some uncertainty regarding this outcome since the standard deviation calculated by us was based on the assumption that a t-test was used. Moreover, only 33 participants contributed data. Thus, this finding also requires corroboration from well-designed trials of large sample sizes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-05-14 15:40:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The data were not sufficient to detect any statistically significant differences in the risk of eclampsia, pre-eclampsia, breastmilk production or low Apgar scores among women receiving pyridoxine supplementation or control groups. The included trials were conducted between 1960 to 1983, and thus did not include important neonatal outcomes, which have only recently been associated with vitamin B6, such as cardiovascular malformations and orofacial clefts. In addition, adverse effects of pyridoxine use were not assessed.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-14 15:40:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There were only four included trials data on important clinical outcomes were seldom reported. All included trials, except one, were double or triple blinded; however, allocation concealment and the method of randomisation were deemed adequate in only one trial. There were high rates of loss to follow-up in most trials, which may also have been a potential source of bias in the results. The overall risk of bias is unclear. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was low for pre-eclampsia, and dental decay. The reasons for downgrading the quality of the evidence were because of most studies contributing data had design limitations, wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect and small sample sizes.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-05-13 16:12:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We undertook a systematic, thorough search of the literature to identify all studies meeting the inclusion criteria and we are confident that the included trials met the set criteria. Study selection and data extraction were carried out in duplicate and independently and we reached consensus by discussing any discrepancies.</P>
<P>A protocol was published for this review. All the analyses were specified a priori, with the exception of a post hoc analysis of the different cut-off values for biochemistry markers.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-05-13 16:13:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Most of the existing data on vitamin B6 supplementation during pregnancy focuses on the effectiveness of B-6 supplementation for reducing pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-Matthews-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthews 2014</LINK>). Our review findings are in concordance with existing reviews highlighting the need for additional studies to confirm positive effects of vitamin B6 supplementation on maternal and infant outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Dror-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dror 2012</LINK>).</P>
</AGREEMENT>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-19 11:29:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is at present not enough evidence to show any important clinical benefit of providing vitamin B6 supplementation in pregnancy. Although there may be some protection against tooth decay, more studies are required to confirm this finding. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-19 11:29:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Future well-designed trials evaluating neonatal outcomes such as cardiovascular malformations, orofacial clefts and long-term neurological development, as well as maternal outcomes such as preterm birth and pre-eclampsia are warranted. The risk of adverse events should also be evaluated.</P>

<P>Reasons for excluding this study were: (1) there was no control group (i.e. a non-vitamin B6 supplemented group) and (2) only biochemical outcomes were studied. 33 antenatal women were randomly assigned to multivitamin supplements containing 2.5, 4 or 10 mg pyridoxine.</P>
