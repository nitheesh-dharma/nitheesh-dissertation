<P>No evidence to show whether blood flow through the placenta is improved in pregnant women who have transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy for suspected placental insufficiency.</P>
<P>Babies who do not get enough nutrients and oxygen from their mothers may compensate this situation with some changes in the blood vessels which may lead to placental insufficiency. Doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to detect the movement of blood between the uterus, placenta and baby during pregnancy. TENS is a therapeutic non-invasive therapy that provides electrical stimulation via electrodes placed onto the skin. For women who have suspected placental insufficiency diagnosed by Doppler ultrasound, the review has found no evidence to show whether TENS therapy improves blood flow between the uterus, placenta and the baby.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-06 09:05:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-06 09:02:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Impaired fetal growth is the failure of a newborn to achieve its genetically determined growth potential, which may cause death as well as short or long-term childhood morbidity. It has been reported that 3% to 10% of neonates are small for corresponding gestational age and an estimated 30% of this is due to impaired fetal growth. Remaining 70% is due to constitutional factors such as maternal ethnicity, parity, weight and height (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1998</LINK>). The condition occurs with limited flow of nutrients or oxygen, or both, from mother to fetus as a result of fetal (e.g. chromosomal abnormalities, congenital malformations), placental factors (e.g. small placenta), or maternal factors (e.g. malnutrition, vascular/renal disease, drugs or other metabolic conditions) (<LINK REF="REF-Resnik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnik 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ultrasound evaluation of the fetus by measuring the abdominal circumference, head circumference, length of upper leg and interpreting these using standardised formulae allows the clinician to estimate the fetal weight, to relate this to the gestational age and to follow the growth progress. Ultrasound evaluation also allows to some extent to estimate the timing and the cause of the impairment. Symmetrical growth of the fetus is generally due to early problems such as chromosomal abnormalities, drugs, chemical agents or infection. Asymmetric growth usually results from inadequacy of substrates the fetus needs particularly later in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Resnik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnik 2002</LINK>). In low-income settings where early pregnancy ultrasound is not available fetal growth can be monitored by serial symphysis fundus measurements. However, there is no proven effective treatment that can be applied once growth impairment is diagnosed. In general, when no apparent congenital abnormality exists, management is conservative by frequent growth measurements, smoking cessation if the mother smokes and early delivery when the fetus is thought be mature enough to survive outside the womb.</P>
<P>The outcomes of impaired growth are variable and usually related to the specific cause. For example, if the growth impairment is due to chromosomal anomalies or congenital abnormalities, the fetus is more at risk of a perinatal death. Other short-term outcomes may be moderate to mild metabolic problems (hypoglycemia, polycythemia, meconium aspiration, etc.) due to the chronic oxygen and nutrient deprivation. Depending on the severity and the duration of the condition, long-term outcomes may differ from normal to small decreases in IQ to an increased risk of cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Restricted flow of maternal oxygen and nutrient supplies to the fetus is associated with an adaptation mechanism of decreased fetal growth, redistributed blood vessels in favour of vital organs and increased placental vascular resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1998</LINK>). These changes in fetal blood vessels can be detected by Doppler ultrasound techniques and are suggestive of poor fetal condition. In contrast, normal blood flow shown by Doppler is rarely associated with significant morbidity and likely indicative of a constitutionally small fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Resnik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnik 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Transcutaneous electrostimulation has been widely researched for its role in pain control and is also thought to improve blood flow by an effect on autonomic control of vascular contractility. It has therefore been suggested that it could improve blood flow to the fetus in cases in which an increased resistance to flow is detected by Doppler techniques.</P>

<P>Because of the possibility of selection bias resulting from the method of allocation used, the imbalance between the groups both in terms of numbers and pre-treatment Doppler categorisation and exclusion of a significant number of participants in the analysis (16/72), the results of this study should not be used to support the use of transcutaneous electrostimulation in routine practice.</P>
