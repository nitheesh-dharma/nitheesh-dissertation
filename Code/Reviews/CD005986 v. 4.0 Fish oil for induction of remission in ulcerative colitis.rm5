<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Fish oil for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Ulcerative colitis is an inflammation of the large intestine that causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding and fever. Since there is no cure for the disease the aim of treatment is to cause a reduction of the unpleasant and painful signs and symptoms. Current, proven, treatment options for active ulcerative colitis include corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, immunosuppressive and biological agents. However, these drugs can cause side effects. New treatments which cause fewer side effects are being sought. Fish oil, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids may reduce inflammation and decrease the need for anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with ulcerative colitis. Six studies looking at the effects of fish oil in active ulcerative colitis were included in the review. Study quality was mostly poor. One small study showed a positive benefit for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. However, this result should be interpreted with caution due to small study size and poor study quality. Due to limited data there is not enough information available to determine whether fish oil treatment is effective for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Fish oil supplements, which are rich in n-3 fatty acids, may reduce inflammation, decrease the need for anti-inflammatory drugs, and promote normal weight gain in people with ulcerative colitis.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review evaluates the efficacy of fish oil for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis using all available randomised controlled trials.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, the database of ongoing trials and the reference lists of all publications of included or excluded trials were searched. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials with active ulcerative colitis patients who were treated with fish oil.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The reviewers performed study selection, assessment of methodological quality by using different approaches: including Cochrane assessment of allocation concealment and Jadad quality assessment score. Data extraction forms were used by the two reviewers to extract the data independently. Authors were contacted for additional information. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six studies were included. Three were of cross-over design and three were of parallel design. No data were pooled for analysis due to differences in outcomes and methodology among the included studies. One small study shows a positive benefit for induction of remission (RR 19.00; 95% CI 1.27 to 284.24). Some of the other included studies show some positive benefits for secondary outcomes. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution due to small study size and poor study quality.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The current data does not allow for a definitive conclusion regarding the efficacy of fish oil. There is no adequate information to make recommendations for clinical practice. More research is required.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-15 12:24:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease, of unknown aetiology, in which the large intestine is inflamed and ulcerated, causing diarrhoea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding and fever. The pathogenesis of the disease is multifactorial and involves environmental, genetic and immunological factors. The incidence of ulcerative colitis is approximately 10 to 20 per 100 000 per year with a reported prevalence of 100 to 200 per 100 000 (<LINK REF="REF-Sandler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandler 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 2004</LINK>). Although ulcerative colitis is found worldwide, it appears to be more common in some industrialized countries such as Scandinavia, United Kingdom, North America and less common in Central and Southern Europe, Asia and Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Farrokhyar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrokhyar 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since ulcerative colitis cannot be cured by medication, the aim of treatment is to induce and maintain remission, minimise adverse events associated with treatment and improve quality of life. Medical treatment involves drugs such as 5-ASA (e.g. mesalazine), steroids (for acute attacks, but not for maintenance of remission), immunosuppressive agents such as thiopurine derivatives and cyclosporine and biological agents (e.g. infliximab). Colectomy may be required for severe disease. Due to therapeutic failures and adverse events associated with corticosteroids, the search for alternative therapies is very important. With the advent of commercially available compounds more and more people start with nutritional supplements in addition to their therapy. This trend and the data yielded by several trials provide new perspectives and may change therapy strategy in the future. </P>
<P>One of these nutritional supplements is fish oil. Fish oil contains two polyunsaturated fatty acids, namely docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). It is manufactured form EPA of high purity, is available over the counter as a soft gelatin capsule or nutritional liquid supplement. The risks of adverse events caused by the use of polyunsaturated fatty acids seems negligible (<LINK REF="REF-Eritsland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eritsland 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the last few years beneficial effects of fish oil have been shown in animal models (rats) of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (<LINK REF="STD-Seidner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Seidner 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nieto-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieto 2002</LINK>). Clinical trials in patients with ulcerative colitis have suggested that fish oil supplements, which are rich in n-3 fatty acids, may reduce inflammation, decrease the need for anti-inflammatory drugs, and promote normal weight gain in people with ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aslan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Aslan 1992</LINK>). Most clinical trials on fish oil treatment for active ulcerative colitis were small, used different formulas, dosages, routes of administration and differing methods. A systematic review may help synthesize such data.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and the safety (adverse events) of fish oil for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-randomised controlled trials published in any language were included in this systematic review.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with active ulcerative colitis defined by a disease activity index or by a combination of clinical symptoms, endoscopic appearance and histological criteria as reported and classified by the study authors. Children and adolescents (&lt; 18 years of age) were excluded because the review is focused on the adult patient population in which the condition is mostly found. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Trials evaluating oral fish oil supplementation regardless of type (i.e. capsules or liquid supplementation) and dosage were considered for inclusion. Trials that involved dietary supplements enriched with fish oil were excluded because other ingredients of the supplement may influence the effect of fish oil or have an independent effect. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>PRIMARY OUTCOME:<BR/>Proportion of patients achieving remission within 3 months after treatment, as defined by each individual study, and expressed as a percentage of the patients randomised (intention to treat analysis). </P>
<P>SECONDARY OUTCOMES:<BR/>Time to clinical remission<BR/>Proportion of patients with a clinical response <BR/>Difference in endoscopic score<BR/>Corticosteroid sparing effect <BR/>The overall incidence of adverse events <BR/>Withdrawals due to adverse events<BR/>Withdrawals for any reason<BR/>Incidence of colectomy<BR/>Acceptability</P>

<P>The results of this set were combined with the Cochrane highly sensitive search methodological filter (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>LANGUAGE<BR/>Searches were not limited by language. No full text translations were needed because there were no relevant non-English articles.</P>
<P>HAND SEARCH<BR/>The reference lists of all included studies and review articles were screened in order to identify possible studies of interest.</P>
<P>PERSONAL CONTACT<BR/>Authors of relevant identified studies and other experts were contacted in order to obtain additional information, articles, references, unpublished trials or ongoing trials.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>STUDY SELECTION<BR/>Two authors (MDL, PS) independently reviewed the titles, abstracts and full manuscripts identified from the above mentioned search strategy. Trials were rejected when the data presented in the title and abstract clearly indicated that the study was not eligible for further review. Otherwise the full text of the trial was obtained. All trials that met the inclusion criteria were considered for inclusion by two independent authors. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. When duplicate publications were found, the publication with the most complete data was included. </P>
<P>STUDY QUALITY<BR/>The quality of the RCTs was assessed by using the validated five point scale of Jadad (score 0 - 5) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1999</LINK>). The Jadad score can be categorized as: poor quality (score 0 - 2), good quality (score 3-4) and excellent quality (score 5) (<LINK REF="REF-Natural-Standard" TYPE="REFERENCE">Natural Standard</LINK>). Two authors (MDL, PS) independently assessed study quality. Differences in results were resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>Besides the Jadad items the following quality criteria were assessed because these are not described explicitly in the Jadad score (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).<BR/>1. allocation concealment<BR/>2. blinding of outcome assessors<BR/>3. intention-to-treat analysis</P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>Data were extracted independently onto data extraction forms by two authors (MDL, PS). The extracted data were recorded on standardized forms. Data were collected on general information (published or unpublished, title, authors, source, year of publication, duplicate publications), trial characteristics (design, duration, randomization, concealment of allocation, blinding), intervention (form and dosage of intervention, length of intervention, comparison intervention), participants (population, exclusion criteria, number (total and per treatment group), age, gender, disease severity, baseline characteristics, similarity of groups at baseline, medication use, assessment of compliance, withdrawals or losses to follow-up), outcomes and results (disease activity index, endoscopic score, remission rate, clinical response rate, number of bowel movements, adverse events). </P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>A total of 125 publications were identified (Central 34, PubMed 32, EMBASE 52, CINAHL 3, Database of ongoing trails 0, hand search 4) by the search of electronic databases. After review of titles and abstracts a total of 35 articles and abstracts, which were related to 28 studies, were identified for possible inclusion. After further selection, a final total of 9 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Almallah-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aslan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Aslan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dichi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dichi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Middleton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Middleton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tobin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tobin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varghese-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Varghese 2000</LINK>), were identified for inclusion. None of the studies met all the inclusion criteria. In particular the criteria of definition of clinical remission and definition of disease activity index were not defined in most cases. Therefore it was decided to omit these two criteria. </P>
<P>Attempts were made to contact all first authors of the included studies to obtain further information. If the first author could not be contacted one of the other authors was contacted. Four authors have responded to this request. One author could not be located and after assessment of the Jadad score both reviewers independently decided to exclude the study from the systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Tobin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tobin 1989</LINK>). After receiving additional information one study was withdrawn from the systematic review since the additional information showed that the study wasn't eligible (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>). Additional information revealed that <LINK REF="STD-Middleton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Middleton 1997</LINK> was a maintenance of remission trial. <LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK> was included although the main outcome of the study was steroid sparing effect and no other remission induction information was reported. One study was published five times, in three articles (<LINK REF="STD-Almallah-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Almallah-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Almallah-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 2000b</LINK>) and two abstracts (<LINK REF="STD-Almallah-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Almallah-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 1998b</LINK>) each reporting different aspects of the study. For the purposes of this review, the results of this study were extracted from all five papers. A total of 29 publications were excluded from the review. Details of the reason for exclusion are presented in the 'Table of characteristics of excluded studies'. An update conducted in June 2006 did not identify any additional studies.</P>
<P>Thus six studies were included in the review, four articles (<LINK REF="STD-Almallah-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aslan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Aslan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dichi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dichi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1992</LINK>) and two abstracts (<LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varghese-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Varghese 2000</LINK>). Details of the methods, participants, interventions and outcomes in these studies are presented in the 'Table of characteristics of included studies'. Of the 6 studies, 3 were of parallel design (<LINK REF="STD-Almallah-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varghese-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Varghese 2000</LINK>) and 3 studies were of cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Aslan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Aslan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dichi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dichi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The constituents of the placebos used in these studies were unencapsulated sunflower oil (<LINK REF="STD-Almallah-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 1998a</LINK>), unknown formulation of omega-6 essential fatty acids (<LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>), unknown formulation of sunflower oil (<LINK REF="STD-Varghese-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Varghese 2000</LINK>), corn oil capsule (<LINK REF="STD-Aslan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Aslan 1992</LINK>), and vegetable oil capsule (<LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1992</LINK>). One cross-over study (<LINK REF="STD-Dichi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dichi 2000</LINK>) used an active comparator (sulfasalazine capsule) instead of a placebo. A total of approximate 159 (38 from the cross-over studies and 121 from the parallel studies) patients with active ulcerative colitis were included in these six studies.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Allocation of concealment was assessed as: <BR/>Grade A: adequate allocation of concealment;<BR/>Grade B: unclear concealment; or<BR/>Grade C: inadequate concealment.</P>
<P>Many studies reported on randomisation to treatment allocation but did not describe the procedure used for allocation concealment or if it had been performed (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). One study was judged to have adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Almallah-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 1998a</LINK>). Allocation concealment was unclear in the other five studies. Methodological quality was also assessed using the Jadad score (<LINK REF="REF-Natural-Standard" TYPE="REFERENCE">Natural Standard</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Two studies received a Jadad score of 2 (<LINK REF="STD-Dichi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dichi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varghese-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Varghese 2000</LINK>). Two studies received a Jadad score of 3 (<LINK REF="STD-Almallah-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stack-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stack 1997</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Aslan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Aslan 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1992</LINK> studies received Jadad scores of 5 and 4 respectively.<BR/>The blinding of outcome assessors and the use of intention-to-treat analysis were also assessed (See additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Almallah-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Almallah 1998a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1992</LINK> studies were described as double blinded. The authors of the <LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1992</LINK> study reported that double blinding was difficult because of the fishy taste. Sigmoidoscopic, rectal dialysis and histologic evaluations were blinded in the <LINK REF="STD-Stenson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stenson 1992</LINK> study. Patients, clinicians and evaluators were blinded to treatment assignment in the <LINK REF="STD-Aslan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Aslan 1992</LINK> study. Although patients and clinicians were not blinded in the <LINK REF="STD-Dichi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dichi 2000</LINK> study, colonic biopsy specimens were assessed by a blinded endoscopist and pathologist.

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Products containing n-3 PUFA's are sold over the counter advertising their anti-inflammatory properties and claiming effectiveness for several inflammatory diseases. Patients are eager to use supplements because they are natural products and have a favourable safety profile. These characteristics may increase patient compliance. However, it is not clear whether n-3 PUFA's are effective for the treatment of IBD. For this reason it was decided to systematically review the data on treating active ulcerative colitis with fish oil.</P>
<P>This review identified 125 publications in medical literature on the subject of treating ulcerative colitis with fish oil preparations. Six of these publications were thought to be eligible for further review. However, none of these studies met all the originally specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. In particular the criteria of definition of clinical remission and definition of disease activity index were not defined in most cases. Therefore it was decided to include studies that lacked these specific definitions. The inclusion criteria were amended and six studies that met all other inclusion criteria were included in the review. The use of such definitions is a pivotal ingredient for a clinical trial that aims to meet current quality standards. The fact that none of studies defined remission by a disease activity score may be due to the fact that most of them were about 10 years of age. </P>
<P>Extracting the data on the endpoints from these publications yielded limited results. Data on primary outcomes and secondary outcomes were most often not reported and could not be obtained. One of the reasons for the limited information was the inclusion of two studies which were only published in abstract form. Despite the fact that it was unknown whether the reported data were interim-analysis results or the final results, it was decided not to exclude the studies from this review. These studies may still await publication. Excluding studies that are only presented as abstracts may introduce publication bias due to the fact that positive outcomes are more likely to be published in a full report. Indeed, the studies which were published as an article reported positive results. No studies publishing negative results were found. Publication bias may play a role here. The authors attempted to retrieve missing information by contacting authors of the included studies and some have responded to this request. Additional information received in the future will be processed in the first update of this systematic review. </P>
<P>The included studies differed in terms of outcome measures, dosages of fish oil and methodology (See additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Also, inter- and intra group analyses were both used. These findings precluded statistical pooling of the data. Therefore, most of the results presented in the review have a qualitative character. The methodological quality of most of the included studies could not be determined clearly from the information presented in the papers. To ensure better methodological quality of reports of future randomised controlled trials on fish oil for the treatment of ulcerative colitis investigators should follow the CONSORT recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Furthermore, the blinding of treatment assignment appeared to be difficult in some of the studies because patients noticed the fishy taste. Extra attention should be addressed to the preparation of the placebos so that blinding will be preserved in future studies. The numbers of included patients in the published studies were small: a total of approximately 159 active ulcerative colitis patients were included in six studies. Small studies may lack statistical power to detect clinical relevant treatment effects. A major limitation of this review is lack of data on clinical relevant outcomes of fish oil treatment in active ulcerative colitis patients. </P>
<P>One small study found a positive benefit for induction of remission (RR 19.00; 95% CI 1.27 to 284.24) and some of the other included studies showed benefit for some secondary outcomes. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution due to small study size and poor study quality. Currently, no randomised controlled data exist that support remission induction of active ulcerative colitis by means n-3 PUFA's. Although the ant-inflammatory properties of these fatty acids show important anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and some of the published trials provide some evidence favouring of fish-oil treatment, well designed trials are awaited to assess the efficacy of fish oil treatment. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The conclusion that can be made from the limited evidence from these six studies is that there is no adequate information to make recommendations for practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review has not been able to answer the question whether fish oil is effective for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. More large (phase 3), long-term, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trials, are required to determine if there is a significant therapeutic effect of fish oil in active ulcerative colitis. Extra attention should be addressed to the manufacturing of the placebo. The placebo should be indistinguishable from the fish oil. The fishy taste of the fish oil has broken study blinding in some cases. Investigators should be encouraged to use the CONSORT recommendations for randomised trials. Furthermore, disease specific reporting guidelines for ulcerative colitis studies are needed before different studies can be compared and well-founded decisions about IBD therapy can be made. These guidelines should include checklists of important standardized outcomes to be included. </P>
