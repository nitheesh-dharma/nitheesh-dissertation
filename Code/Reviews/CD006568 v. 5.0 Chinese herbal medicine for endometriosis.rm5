<P>Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition causing menstrual and pelvic pain. Treatment involves surgery and hormonal drugs, with potentially unpleasant side effects and high rates of reoccurrence of endometriosis. The two small studies in this review suggest that Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) may be as effective as gestrinone and may be more effective than danazol in relieving endometriosis-related pain, with fewer side effects than experienced with conventional treatment. However, the two trials included in this review were small and of limited quality so these findings must be interpreted cautiously. Better quality randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate a possible role for CHM in the treatment of endometriosis.</P>

<P>Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of tissue that is morphologically and biologically similar to normal endometrium in locations outside the uterus. Surgical and hormonal treatment of endometriosis have unpleasant side effects and high rates of relapse. In China, treatment of endometriosis using Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is routine and considerable research into the role of CHM in alleviating pain, promoting fertility, and preventing relapse has taken place.</P>

<P>Risk of bias assessment, and data extraction and analysis were performed independently by three review authors. Data were combined for meta-analysis using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-09 23:57:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two Chinese RCTs involving 158 women were included in this review. Although both these trials described adequate methodology they were of limited quality. Neither trial compared CHM with placebo treatment.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a significant difference in rates of symptomatic relief between CHM and gestrinone administered subsequent to laparoscopic surgery (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18). There was no significant difference between the CHM and gestrinone groups with regard to the total pregnancy rate (69.6% versus 59.1%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.59, one RCT).</P>
<P>CHM administered orally and then in conjunction with a herbal enema resulted in a greater proportion of women obtaining symptomatic relief than with danazol (RR 5.06, 95% CI 1.28 to 20.05; RR 5.63, 95% CI 1.47 to 21.54, respectively). Oral plus enema administration of CHM resulted in a greater reduction in average dysmenorrhoea pain scores than did danazol (mean difference (MD) -2.90, 95% CI -4.55 to -1.25).  For lumbosacral pain, rectal discomfort, or vaginal nodules tenderness, there was no significant difference between CHM and danazol.</P>
<P>Overall, 100% of women in both studies showed some improvement in their symptoms. Women taking CHM had fewer side effects than those taking either gestrinone or danazol.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-09 09:48:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Post-surgical administration of CHM may have comparable benefits to gestrinone. Oral CHM may have a better overall treatment effect than danazol and it may be more effective in relieving dysmenorrhoea when used in conjunction with a CHM enema. CHM appears to have fewer side effects than either gestrinone or danazol. However, more rigorous research is required to accurately assess the potential role of CHM in treating endometriosis.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-03-26 10:44:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Endometriosis is a disease characterized by the presence of tissue that is morphologically and biologically similar to normal endometrium in ectopic locations outside the uterine cavity. Hormonally stimulated cyclical bleeding from the endometriotic deposit appears to contribute to the induction of a local inflammatory reaction and fibrous adhesion; and, in the case of deep implants in the ovary, leads to the formation of an endometrioma or chocolate cyst.</P>
<P>Endometriosis classically presents with severe dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain, dyspareunia, menstrual irregularities, and infertility. Systemic symptoms may also occur, such as fatigue, increased incidence of allergies, and autoimmune disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ballweg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballweg 2004</LINK>). Definitive diagnosis is usually made through laparoscopic investigation although recent research suggests that non-invasive symptom evaluation may have a greater positive prediction value (<LINK REF="REF-Ling-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ling 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winkel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winkel 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The precise prevalence of endometriosis is unclear but there is a broad consensus that between 5% to 15% of the female population will have signs and symptoms of the disease during their reproductive years (aged 15 to 50 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Eskenazi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eskenazi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stenchever-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stenchever 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zondervan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zondervan 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Endometriosis is increasingly regarded as a complex, multi-factorial condition of uncertain aetiology where immunological (<LINK REF="REF-Ballweg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballweg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lebovic-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lebovic 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheng-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheng 1998</LINK>), hormonal (<LINK REF="REF-Noble-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noble 1997</LINK>), genetic (<LINK REF="REF-Bischoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bischoff 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malinak-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malinak 1980</LINK>), environmental (<LINK REF="REF-Ballweg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballweg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohtake-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohtake 2003</LINK>), and possibly even psychological (<LINK REF="REF-Low-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Low 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strauss-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 1992</LINK>) factors combine together to create a context for rogue endometrial cells to develop into a full-blown disease.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-07-09 09:59:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conventional treatment of endometriosis can be broadly divided into medical or surgical management. Medical treatment ranges from symptomatic control with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics through to treatments that aim to suppress the normal ovarian production of estrogen by either hormonally simulating pregnancy (continuous oral contraceptives (COC) and progestins) or menopause (danazol and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a). Surgical intervention can be either 'conservative', involving the removal of endometrial lesions or the severing of the nerve pathways responsible for the transmission of pelvic and uterine pain, or 'definitive', involving the removal of the uterus and ovaries.</P>
<P>Danazol, progestins, GnRH-a, and the COC have comparable short-term rates of success in alleviating the symptoms of endometriosis and in partially reducing the size of endometriosis-related lesions (<LINK REF="REF-GISG-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">GISG 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parazzini-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parazzini 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prentice-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentice 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Selak-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selak 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 1993</LINK>). Unfortunately the benefits are poorly sustained over time with studies frequently reporting a high level of returning symptoms at six months post-treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 1993</LINK>). Even studies with more positive findings commonly demonstrate a return of symptoms in over a third of the women two to three years after stopping treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Biberoglu-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biberoglu 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dmowski-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dmowski 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The short-term benefits of conventional medical treatment have to be balanced against the unpleasant and sometimes dangerous side effects resulting from these therapies. COC has been associated with increased thromboembolic risks (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2004</LINK>). It is unsuitable for certain patient groups, such as women over the age of 35 years who smoke or who have a history of cardiovascular disease, and is obviously inappropriate for women trying to conceive. Danazol is associated with androgenic changes such as acne and weight gain, and menopausal symptoms such as flushing and fatigue. Concerns raised have highlighted its potential role in raising low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2004</LINK>) and in possibly contributing to ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Cottreau-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cottreau 2003</LINK>). GnRH-a tend to produce a more hypo-estrogenic state than danazol with more severe menopausal side effects such as hot flushes, insomnia, reduced libido, and vaginal dryness (<LINK REF="REF-Prentice-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentice 2004</LINK>). Low estrogen levels can also cause serious osteoporosis and the long-term risks of add-back regimes using small amounts of progesterone and estrogen have not been adequately assessed as yet. Patients using progestin therapy reported a higher incidence of acne, fluid retention, bloating, and spotting. In addition, progestins are known to unfavourably reduce the level of high-density lipoproteins in the blood, which could potentially increase the risk of cardiovascular side effects such as thrombosis (<LINK REF="REF-Vasilakis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasilakis 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The surgical management of endometriosis is also far from satisfactory. Two RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Abbott-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbott 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 1994</LINK>) and several observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Abbott-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbott 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fedele-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedele 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wheeler-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheeler 1983</LINK>) demonstrate significant symptomatic relief after conservative laparoscopic surgery but in many cases these benefits were relatively short lived, with up to 44% of women experiencing a return of symptoms after one year (<LINK REF="REF-Lapp-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapp 2000</LINK>). Surgery is also associated with the potential for serious side effects, with one study reporting that 2% to 3% of cases had post-operative bowel perforations with peritonitis (<LINK REF="REF-Koninckx-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koninckx 1996</LINK>); an anonymous survey of 1951 gynaecologists revealed a significant number of unreported complications suggesting that the incidence of complications is higher than is commonly stated (<LINK REF="REF-Feste-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feste 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In summary, current treatments all have high rates of reoccurrence and their short-term benefits have to be balanced with concerns over immediate and longer-term side effects.</P>
<P>CHM typically involves the use of herbal formulae of between 10 and 20 separate herbal ingredients selected from a Materia Medica of several hundred commonly herbs that are prepared either as a boiled decoction, as dried herbal extracts, or taken as pills. Usually CHM is administered orally but methods may include the use of enemas and intramuscular injections. Diagnostic and therapeutic treatment principles are framed according to the traditional Chinese understanding of pathological processes which can appear arcane, but may provide clinically useful phenotypes that could be used to inform clinical practice.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-07-09 10:04:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is a system of medicine with an unbroken written tradition stretching back over two thousand years. Although endometriosis as a distinct entity did not exist in the classical tradition, the symptoms of dysmenorrhoea, dysuria, dyschezia, menorrhagia, and so on, were systematically differentiated and apparently well treated (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1997</LINK>). A common pattern underlying these conditions is the presence of what is known as stagnation of the blood and Qi (vital energy) causing localised obstructions and leading to pain. This is interestingly similar to the modern biomedical understanding of the central role that endometrial lesions play in the symptomatology of the disease.</P>
<P>We have recently seen increasing integration of western medicine and CHM in China, and in the past 10 years the use of laparoscopic diagnosis has allowed some evaluation of the specific benefits of CHM in the treatment of endometriosis through a number of clinical trials. For example, one Chinese language review identified 13 randomised clinical trials on CHM treatment of endometriosis from Chinese literature published between 1994 and 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Xu-et-al-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu et al 2004</LINK>). In these trials 1076 women were involved and Chinese herbal medicines were applied either alone or in combination with biomedical drugs. The suggested mechanism of Chinese medicine for endometriosis may involve regulation of endocrine and immune systems, improvement of blood circulation, and anti-inflammatory activity (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xu-et-al-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu et al 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Modern research has shown that Chinese herbs categorised as 'blood moving<U>'</U> can promote microcirculation, improve the speed and volume of pelvic blood flow and reduce blood viscosity as measured by eg ESR, reduce inflammation, and prevent fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Neeb-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neeb 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 1998</LINK>) . Blood moving herbs have also demonstrated an effect on regulating altered humoral (IgG, IgA, IgM etc) and cellular immune parameters (NK cells / macrophages/ PGF2 etc. (<LINK REF="REF-Neeb-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neeb 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 1998</LINK>). An altered immunological milieu is a recognised feature of endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lebovic-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lebovic 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition herbs described as 'Kidney yang tonics' have been reported as having similar immune-regulating functions (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Both 'blood moving' and 'kidney tonifying' herbs have been shown to be able to affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and thereby regulate FSH/LH oestrogen and progesterone levels (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ability of CHM to affect these physiological changes suggests that this approach may have a biologically plausible mode of action.</P>
<P>Whilst herbs might contain phyto-steroids these are considerably less potent than synthetic steroids. There are no reports of any androgenic or cholesterol raising adverse effects from herbs used in the treatment of endometriosis.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-07-09 09:59:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>At present no other English language systematic review has been conducted to evaluate the results of these studies. Given that the conventional treatment of endometriosis has limited long term benefits and is associated with a relatively high level of adverse effects it is important that novel approaches, that can be used either independently or as adjuvant treatments to conventional care, are identified and carefully evaluated. There is considerable anecdotal evidence supporting the use of CHM as a potential treatment for endometriosis and we have reviewed the available Chinese and English language literature on the subject in an attempt to establish whether CHM has a valid role in the treatment of this common and disabling condition.</P>

<P>In the first analysis, 85 trials were excluded from the review for the following reasons: 43 trials did not have equal numbers in the experimental and control groups and did not present a clear account of the randomisation procedures leading to this discrepancy; 13 trials combined CHM with several other non-herbal therapeutic interventions (such as acupuncture) as part of the experimental intervention; 10 trials used non-authorised or experimental treatments such as mifepristone or tamoxifen as the control intervention; six trials did not report results using validated diagnostic criteria or outcomes measures; five trials had insufficient or unclear data to enable a reasonable assessment of the trial; four trials did not consider the primary or secondary outcomes defined for this review; three trials were not RCTs; and one was a duplicate report.</P>
<P>This left 25 randomised trials for consideration. However, insistence on a laparoscopic diagnosis and a new Cochrane requirement to contact all authors of Chinese RCTs to check for adequate randomisation procedures resulted in a second analysis where 12 trials were excluded because they did not have a laparoscopically confirmed diagnosis. Of the remaining 13 trials, 11 were excluded because: for three the authors could not be contacted; two authors refused to respond to questions relating to randomisation; three trials allocated participants according to patient preference; and three trials were quasi-randomised, according to the time of their first visit.</P>
<P>An updated search completed in October 2010 identified another 39 trials for consideration. Only five of these trials reported details of laparoscopic confirmation or randomisation. After phone call confirmations it was apparent that three of these papers did not employ adequate randomisation and for the remaining two trials the authors could not be contacted. As a result there has been no amendment to the previous findings of this review. An further updated search in October 2011 identified 47 trials, and only four trials appeared eligible for inclusion. After checking against inclusion criteria, they were all excluded and the reasons were presented in the table 'Characteristics of excluded studies'.</P>

<P>Overall, 100% of women in both the CHM and the gestrinone groups showed some improvement in their symptoms. However, in some participants this may have been a relatively minor improvement in symptoms whilst in others it related to more substantial resolution of pelvic masses, disappearance of symptoms, and a successful pregnancy.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between the CHM Nei Yi Wan (oral plus enema) and gestrinone for the symptomatic relief rate (95.65% versus 93.87%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12) (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-SZ-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wu SZ 2006a</LINK>). The intention-to-treat analysis also showed no significant difference between the groups for the symptomatic relief rate (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18). The study followed the patients for one to 24 months for pregnancy. The number of participants with confirmed pregnancy was 4 (at 3 months), 17 (at 4 to 6 months), 8 (at 7 to12 months), 2 (at 13 to 24 months), and 1 (at over 24 months) in the CHM group; while it was 0, 12, 12, 3, and 2 in the gestrinone group, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the total pregnancy rate (69.6% versus 59.1%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.59) (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-SZ-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wu SZ 2006a</LINK>).</P>

<P>Oral plus enema administration of the CHM Nei Yi formulation showed a greater reduction in average dysmenorrhoea pain scores than with danazol (MD -2.90, 95% CI -4.55 to -1.25; P &lt; 0.01). There were no significant differences between either CHM Nei Yi pills and danazol (MD -1.01, 95% CI -3.11 to 1.09) or CHM oral plus enema and danazol (MD -1.89, 95% CI -3.89 to 0.11).</P>
<P>Combined administration of CHM Nei Yi, orally and by enema, showed a greater improvement measured as the disappearance or shrinkage of adnexal masses than did treatment with danazol (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.78).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-10 07:54:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>There were only very limited data available from two small trials comparing the same CHM interventions with two conventional treatments for endometriosis, danazol and gestrinone. The comparison of CHM with gestrinone showed no evidence of a difference between the two groups in the rates of symptomatic relief and pregnancy. However, there were fewer side effects in the CHM group than in the gestrinone and danazol groups. It should be noted that the shrinkage of adnexal masses reported in these trials was determined by ultrasound investigation and not via laparoscopy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-03-26 11:39:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>There was an unexplained discrepancy in the rates of symptomatic relief between the two trials. <LINK REF="STD-Wu-SZ-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wu SZ 2006a</LINK> reported a symptomatic relief rate for CHM of 95.65% and 93.87% for gestrinone; whilst <LINK REF="STD-Wu-SZ-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Wu SZ 2006b</LINK> reported symptomatic relief rates for oral CHM, oral plus enema CHM, and danazol of 56.3%, 62.5%, and 11.1%, respectively. Both trials used the same standardised assessment measures (<LINK REF="REF-CAITWN-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAITWN 1991</LINK>), however discussion with the authors revealed that in <LINK REF="STD-Wu-SZ-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wu SZ 2006a</LINK> laparoscopic investigation and confirmation of endometriosis was combined with active surgical treatment for both groups whilst in <LINK REF="STD-Wu-SZ-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Wu SZ 2006b</LINK> laparoscopy was solely for diagnostic purposes. This explains the substantial difference in rates of symptomatic relief between the two groups but introduces a new variable into the analysis. In effect we have one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-SZ-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wu SZ 2006a</LINK>) comparing laparoscopic treatment with either gestrinone or CHM as a post-surgical adjuvant treatment and a second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-SZ-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Wu SZ 2006b</LINK>) comparing purely medical interventions. Both trials reflect treatment options that are relevant to the management of endometriosis.</P>
<P>The completeness of the available data is limited by the tendency of Chinese reports to be restricted to two to three pages in length. These reports do not have the same depth of information required by Western journals. With regard to fertility, the papers do describe how many women are married and how many are sexually active but there are no relevant data on fertility (duration, clinical investigations etc). Other symptoms such as dyspareunia may be included in the overall analysis of symptoms but are not described as a separate outcome.</P>
<P>Fundamental to the understanding of endometriosis in Chinese medicine is the notion of stagnation of Qi, or vital energy, as a pre-requisite for the subjective experience of pain; and of blood, which tends to localise and intensify the experience of pain and can lead to the formation of distinctive, substantial lesions. Differential diagnosis is further refined into a number of single or complex syndromes on the basis of information derived from traditional methods of clinical assessment such as tongue and pulse diagnosis, investigation of aetiological factors, the subjective presentation of the symptoms of endometriosis (for example a description of the nature and location of the pain), and an evaluation of the general health of the patient as evidenced from sleep patterns, digestive status, and subjective sense of temperature for example. This complex and involved process is considered essential to the successful treatment of the disease.</P>

<P>There are no clear data on participant blinding during the trials. Although <LINK REF="STD-Wu-SZ-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Wu SZ 2006a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wu-SZ-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Wu SZ 2006b</LINK> claimed to be single blind trials, it is difficult to know how this was maintained in the group receiving the herbal enema. There was no evaluation of the success of blinding during the trials. This increased the risk of bias in the trials.</P>
<P>Many of the trials that were excluded due to poor methodology described the ability of CHM to act as an immunological and hormonal modulator, and to break down the fibrous adhesions that characterize endometriosis. These data are interesting and suggest biologically plausible mechanisms that could underpin the effectiveness of CHM. However, a detailed analysis of this work is beyond the remit of this review.</P>

<P>Compared with danazol, both the CHM groups produced a greater rate of symptomatic relief. However the confidence intervals for these outcomes were very large, which brings into question the reliability of the findings. The combined oral plus enema approach also led to women in the CHM group having a greater reduction of average dysmenorrhoea scores and more shrinkage of adnexal masses than for those taking danazol. There was no difference between the oral CHM group and the danazol group for any of these outcomes. There was no evidence of a difference between CHM and danazol in the relief of lumbosacral pain or rectal irritation. Women taking danazol exhibited considerably more adverse effects than did women taking CHM.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-03-26 11:43:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included trials suggest that following laparoscopic surgery, combined oral and enema administration of CHM has a comparable beneficial effect to gestrinone but with fewer adverse effects. Oral and enema administration of CHM may be more effective than danazol in providing extended relief of endometriosis symptoms and in shrinking adnexal masses, with fewer adverse effects. However, these are two very small trials and it may not be possible to generalize the results. </P>
<P>Further research, with larger numbers of participants, is required to substantiate these results and to explore the role of CHM as a stand-alone medical option or as a post-surgical adjuvant in the treatment of endometriosis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-03-26 11:46:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the large number of clinical trials exploring the role of CHM in the treatment of endometriosis methodological shortcomings have led to the exclusion of all but two trials. There are a number of reasons for these exclusions including no laparoscopic confirmation of endometriosis, unequal group sizes, and a lack of validated outcomes. The most worrying shortcoming in the trial reports is a misunderstanding of what is required for a randomised controlled trial. The use of quasi-randomisation or allocation according to patient preference does not constitute adequate randomisation and allows an unacceptably high risk of bias in a trial. There is an urgent need for Chinese researchers to adopt rigorous standards of randomisation and allocation concealment and to present the data in a transparent fashion. The nature of CHM and herbal products make blinding problematic and CHM clinical trials may have to be more pragmatic. In addition, it was not clear from the trial reports that laparoscopy involved active treatment in one case whilst in the other it was used only for diagnostic purposes. This is poor quality reporting that has the potential to confuse and undermine CHM research.</P>
<P>It is important that transparent, pragmatic but rigorous clinical research methodologies are developed that accommodate the complex, individualised, and changing nature of CHM interventions. Future research should provide more detailed accounts of symptomatic changes to include, for example, dyspareunia and daily pelvic pain rather than amalgamating these symptoms into an overall measure of change. In addition, future research should incorporate quality of life outcome measures and qualitative research to provide a more detailed account of the effect of the CHM intervention on the lives of women suffering from this disease. Finally, it is also essential that any research investigating CHM for endometriosis incorporates an extended follow-up period to identify any long-term benefits and to make an accurate record of rates of recurrence after CHM treatment. This will be an important point of comparison between CHM and conventional medicine.</P>
<P>In the period between the original review in 2009 and the revised review in 2012 it appears that the methodological quality of clinical trials of CHM for endometriosis has not improved. This apparent lack of development is unfortunate as it continues to undermine the ability of CHM trials to contribute to rigorous systematic reviews.</P>

<P>While I don't dispute the conclusions, this review seems to be written in a very partisan way.<BR/>1. The section on "how the intervention might work" is written much as one would expect from true believers in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Pre-scientific ideas should not be part of a Cochrane review.<BR/>2. Sentences like the following also exemplify this problem: "<I>Fundamental to the understanding of endometriosis in Chinese medicine is the notion of stagnation of Qi, or vital energy, as a pre-requisite for the subjective experience of pain; and of blood, which tends to localise and intensify the experience of pain and can lead to the formation of distinctive, substantial lesions"</I>. The idea of "Qi" is pre-scientific myth, and need not be mentioned in the assessment of clinical trials.<BR/>3. The abstract, under main results, says <I>"Two Chinese RCTs involving 158 women were included in this review. Both these trials described adequate methodology. Neither trial compared CHM with placebo treatment."</I> That immediately suggests that there is little stuff that's worth reviewing. Yet the plain language summary says<BR/>"<I>This review suggests that Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) may be useful in relieving endometriosis-related pain with fewer side effects than experienced with conventional treatment.</I>" This seems absurdly upbeat, given what was actually discovered.<BR/>4. The authors of this review seem to be true believers in TCM. The first author, at least, makes his living from it. No doubt anyone who does a trial hopes that the new treatment will turn out well, but most do not have an ideological belief that one treatment is better than another. That is certainly not true in alternative medicine.<BR/>It seems to me to be quite inappropriate for Cochrane reviews of alternative medicine to be written by people who make their living from practising it. Such people, by definition, believe in concepts that are outside science. This is not the first Cochrane review to suffer from this problem. In the interests of maintaining your excellent reputation, I suggest that you give this matter serious consideration.</P>

<P>1.The basis of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is to provide a set of clinical syndromes that describe the detailed presentations for a particular condition. These small, but to the Chinese clinically relevant differences, directly affect the herbal prescription provided to the patient. The syndromes represent a detailed phenotypic description of the presenting problem.</P>
<P>2. The quoted sentence about Qi is taken out of context and the author of the letter therefore implies that we have a belief system that is at odds with good science. This is incorrect. Our description is about how TCM should be evaluated regarding endometriosis. It does not directly impact on the very rigorous Cochrane systematic review process and assessment of the trials but it does provide some background information for the reader. Our group agreed that these phenotypic descriptions may possibly prove to have some clinical value and we would be remiss to leave them out at this stage. The history of science suggests that there is a danger in adhering too firmly to existing understanding/paradigms and too easily reject observations that do not fit with that understanding. Surely a great strength of science is to explore and quantify observations that may seem unlikely and investigate them thoroughly- in this particular case to search and critique the empirical evidence of effectiveness &#8211; and not to dismiss them because they offend our current understanding of what is plausible and real? In response to the Prof Colquoun's concerns we have edited the Background section of the review and provided some additional material about what constitutes a CHM intervention and introduced some of the modes of action that might be involved as biologically plausible mechanisms for CHM.</P>
<P>3. Cochrane reviews undergo an extremely rigorous peer-reviewed process. Only 2 out of 196 trials made it through this process. The two trials reported provided important comparisons with existing treatments, so for patients and clinicians are well worth reviewing and reporting. Our summary is a cautious and accurate assessment of the evidence that we considered. We also make it very clear that further work is needed to substantiate these findings. We are aware that a significant number of Cochrane reviews come to similar conclusions for both conventional and complementary medicine and are available on the Cochrane website. We have edited the Plain Language Summary of the review to specify which conventional treatments were reviewed.</P>
<P>4. There is no evidence (other than hearsay from the author of the letter) for the statement that the authors are &#8216;true believers&#8217;. Clinicians working in areas of uncertainty in both conventional and complementary medicine need to determine and critique the evidence base for their practice. It is vital that clinicians with expertise in their clinical areas are involved in research, including systematic reviews. This applies to all or most Cochrane reviews both on Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM) and in more traditional clinical areas, and is the basis of academic medicine. Academic GPs who make a living from being GPs are essential contributors to Cochrane reviews of therapies for primary care as indeed would be the case for all medical specialities. It would be harmful for the research process if general physicians, GPs and pharmacologists could not work in the areas where they receive funding for their clinical or research work. The research process in this review was rigorous and transparent and like all good science can be replicated by others in the scientific community using the same methods.</P>
<P>It is perhaps worth noting that a better term to avoid unnecessary polarisation of views and practice in this area is Complementary and Alternative medicine.<BR/>
