<TITLE>Etidronate for preventing fractures caused by osteoporosis in postmenopausal women</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-13 14:30:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of etidronate for preventing fractures (broken bones) caused by osteoporosis.</P>
<P>
<B>In women who have already been diagnosed with low bone density, putting them at risk of a fracture or have already had a fracture in the bones of their spine, etidronate: </B>
</P>
<P>-may prevent fractures in the bones of the spine.</P>
<P>- may lead to no difference in hip or wrist fractures or fractures in the bones other than in the spine.</P>
<P>
<B>In women whose bone density is closer to normal or who may not have had a fracture in the bones of their spine yet, etidronate: </B>
</P>
<P>- may lead to no difference in fractures in the bones of the spine, or in bones other than those of the spine.</P>
<P>- it is not known whether etidronate prevents hip or wrist fractures since no evidence was found that looked at the effect of etidronate in these women.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects may include digestive problems such as heartburn, nausea and upset stomach.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>What is osteoporosis and what is etidronate? </B>
<BR/>Bone is a living, growing part of your body. Throughout your lifetime, new bone cells grow and old bone cells break down to make room for the new, stronger bone. When you have osteoporosis, the old bone breaks down faster than the new bone can replace it. As this happens, the bones lose minerals (such as calcium). This makes bones weaker and more likely to break even after a minor injury, like a little bump or fall.<BR/>
<BR/>Women who have gone through menopause are more likely to get osteoporosis than other people. Etidronate belongs to the class of drugs called bisphosphonates. It is a type of medication that slows down the cells that break down the old bone.<BR/>
<BR/>

<B>The best estimate of what happens to women that have already been diagnosed with low bone density or have already had a fracture in the bones of their spine:</B>
</P>
<P>Fracture of the spine:</P>
<P>                 - 11 out of 100 women had a fracture when taking a placebo</P>

<P> </P>
<P>Fractures in the hip or wrist:</P>
<P>                 - there was no difference in the number of women who had hip or wrist fractures which may be the result of chance</P>

</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and bone deterioration leading to increased fracture risk. Etidronate belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs which act to inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of etidronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE for relevant randomized controlled trials published between 1966 to 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Women receiving at least one year of etidronate for postmenopausal osteoporosis were compared to those receiving placebo and/or concurrent calcium/vitamin D. The outcome was fracture incidence.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study selection and data abstraction was done in duplicate. Meta-analysis of fracture outcomes was performed with data presented as relative risks and a relative change greater than 15% was considered clinically important. Study quality was assessed through the reporting of allocation concealment, blinding and withdrawals.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eleven studies representing a total of 1248 patients were included in the review. </P>
<P>A significant 41% relative risk reduction (RRR) in vertebral fractures across eight studies (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.96) was found. The six secondary prevention trials demonstrated a significant RRR of 47% in vertebral fractures (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87) and a 5% absolute risk reduction (ARR); compared with the pooled result for the two primary prevention trials (RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.32 to 28.44), which was not significant. There were no statistically significant risk reductions for non-vertebral (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.42), hip (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.88) or wrist fractures (RR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.32 to 2.36).</P>
<P>For adverse events, no statistically significant differences were found in the included studies. However, observational data has led to concerns regarding potential risk for upper gastrointestinal injury.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Etidronate, at 400 mg per day, demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically important benefit in the secondary prevention of vertebral fractures. No statistically significant reductions in vertebral fractures were observed when it was used for primary prevention. In addition, no statistically significant reductions in non-vertebral, hip, or wrist fractures were found, regardless of whether etidronate was used for primary or secondary prevention. The level of evidence for all outcomes is Silver (www.cochranemsk.org.)</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Osteoporosis is in part a natural consequence of aging in postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Hodsman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodsman 2002</LINK>). It is a skeletal disorder characterized by decreased bone mass and deterioration in microarchitecture of bone resulting in an increased risk of fracture (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-Consensus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Consensus 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common consequences of osteoporosis are fractures of the hip, wrist and vertebrae. (<LINK REF="REF-Hodsman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodsman 2002</LINK>). "Bone strength reflects the integration of two main features: bone density and bone quality" (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>). The clinical indicator of bone quality is a patient's history of a fragility fracture. A fragility fracture is a fracture caused by an injury that would be insufficient to fracture normal bone (for example a fall from a standing height or less) (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>). The preferred method of evaluating bone density is the measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and hip by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which can be used to assess response to therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Hanley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanley 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>The interpretation of BMD results is based on comparison of a patient's BMD with the mean value for a young adult population. The 'T-score' is the number of standard deviations (SDs) above or below the mean BMD for normal young adults (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) Study Group on Osteoporosis defined osteoporosis as "a hip BMD level of more than 2.5 SDs below the mean BMD for young, white, adult women" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>). Using the WHO definition, approximately 30% of postmenopausal women have osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>). It should be noted that there are limitations associated with the WHO definition. The predictive value of BMD measurement for fracture varies depending on the site selected, the database used for comparison and the technology used. Furthermore, T-scores do not provide a good basis to establish comparable diagnostic thresholds between different regions of interest and different bone mass measurement techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2000</LINK>). As a result, between-site and technique variability introduces potential for misclassification and inappropriate treatment of some individuals. </P>
<P>Osteoporosis can be detected by BMD measurement or diagnosed by presence of osteoporosis-related fractures. The presence of pre-existing osteoporotic fractures is an important risk factor for future fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Hodsman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodsman 2002</LINK>). It is reported that 25% of women aged 80 years have had at least one vertebral fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Melton-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melton 1989</LINK>) and Cauley et al (<LINK REF="REF-Cauley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauley 2000</LINK>) have demonstrated excess mortality in women who have experienced a clinical vertebral fracture. The cumulative lifetime fracture risk for a 50-year old woman with osteoporosis is stated to be as high as 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1989</LINK>). As a result, effective fracture prevention would have a major impact on morbidity and a smaller but important impact on mortality in these women. </P>
<P>Osteoporosis-related morbidity is associated with significant medical and social consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>). The major source of morbidity and mortality from osteoporosis is attributed to hip fractures. Hip fractures are not only associated with an increased mortality risk but also influence long-term function and independence. Fifty per cent of women who sustain a hip fracture do not return to their previous functional state and become dependent on others for their daily activities (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>). The mortality associated with hip fractures in older women may be as high as 20% in the first year (<LINK REF="REF-Cauley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauley 2000</LINK>). This excess mortality may not be directly attributable to the hip fracture but to co-morbid conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Browner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>Prevention and treatment of osteoporosis can be complex, due to the multifactorial etiology of the disorder. Anabolic therapies directed at increasing bone formation, such as teriparatide PTH (1-34) (<LINK REF="REF-Shukla-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shukla 2003</LINK>), are available, however, most currently available osteoporosis drugs are anti-resorptive agents that act to decrease bone turnover. One class of anti-resorptive drugs includes the bisphosphonates: etidronate, alendronate and risedronate. They are recommended as first-line preventive agents in postmenopausal women with low BMD and as first-line agents for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Bisphosphonates are stable analogues of naturally occurring pyrophosphates. The mechanism of action of these drugs is to inhibit bone resorption through their effects on osteoclast function (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>). Bisphosphonates are poorly absorbed and avidly taken up by bone on active sites of resorption. Etidronate is a first-generation non-nitrogen containing bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclastic resorption and decreases bone turnover (<LINK REF="REF-Fleisch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleisch 1997</LINK>). It is considered a weaker anti-resorptive agent than the other bisphosphonates. It is given orally on a cyclical schedule, 400 mg for 2 weeks every 90 days, followed by calcium, to minimize any potential to inhibit bone mineralization and result in osteomalacia. Etidronate, relative to control, has been shown to increase bone mineral density after one to three years of treatment, by 4.06% (95% CI 3.12 to 5.0) in the lumbar spine and 2.35% (95% CI 1.66 to 3.04) in the femoral neck (<LINK REF="REF-Cranney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranney 2001</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to assess the clinical efficacy of etidronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women receiving these agents compared with untreated women over a follow-up period of at least one year.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of at least one year were included in this review.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Only postmenopausal women were included and both primary and secondary prevention trials were accepted. A hierarchy was used to define primary versus secondary prevention according to the information available. We selected a definition of primary and secondary prevention that gave more weight to study inclusion criteria than baseline statistics. That is, if the inclusion criteria restricted the population to women whose bone density was at least 2 SD values below the peak bone mass or the inclusion criteria restricted the population to women who had experienced previous vertebral compression fractures, then the trial was considered a secondary prevention study. If such inclusion criteria were not provided then the baseline statistics were considered as follows: (a) we considered the trial as primary prevention if the average T-score (and SD) was such that it included women whose bone density was within 2 SD of the mean or if the prevalence of vertebral fracture at baseline was less than 20%; and (b) when these data were not available, we considered a trial as secondary prevention if the average age was above 62 years.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Treatment: intermittent oral etidronate at any dose.<BR/>Comparators: no treatment (including placebo or calcium or vitamin D, or both). If the study used calcium and/or vitamin D controls these same treatments would have to be given concurrently in the etidronate group.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Incidence of fractures including vertebral, non-vertebral, hip and wrist fractures.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The Cochrane Collaborative approach for identifying randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as described by Dickersin et al (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>) and modified for the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group guided our literature search. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE® (1966 to November 2004), Current Contents® and citations of relevant articles. No language restrictions were applied to the search strategy. The actual literature search was conducted in three stages. The first stage was the basis for our systematic review published in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Cranney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranney 2001</LINK>) and the second stage involved updating the search. For the first search (1966 to 1998) included MEDLINE®, Current Contents® and handsearching of conference abstract books (Osteoporosis International, Journal of Bone and Mineral Research). This was followed by a MEDLINE® search (1998 to November 2004). This MEDLINE search was confirmed by a parallel literature search that was conducted for a companion bisphosphonate economic report (<LINK REF="REF-CADTH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADTH 2006</LINK>). For the final update (2004 to February 2007), we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. </P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Selection of studies<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Two review authors examined each title generated from the search and identified potentially eligible articles, for which we obtained the abstracts. For abstracts consistent with study eligibility, the full-text article was obtained. Overall, we only considered for inclusion studies for which findings were published, either as a full article or an abstract.</P>
<P>
<B>Data abstraction strategy </B>
</P>
<P>Two review authors independently abstracted all information and data using standardized data abstraction forms with a third review author verifying the data. Abstraction included information on pertinent methodological aspects of the study design, characteristics of the participants, the specific dose of the study drug used and the outcomes assessed (for example number of vertebral, non-vertebral, hip and wrist fractures). For fracture data, all reported fractures (whether clinical or radiographic) were considered. </P>
<P>For the yearly data, our unit of analysis was number of patients sustaining a fracture. If an article reported yearly data, we used the time points available. For baseline denominators we used the same baseline denominator for each time point. For follow-up denominators we used any yearly follow-up number of patients reported in the article, if available. If these were not available, we assumed a uniform dropout rate for each year and calculated the denominators by determining the proportion of participants that would have remained at the end of the year in question based on the number of withdrawals over the course of the study. If an article reported only end of study outcomes these were used for our analysis, with the exception of outcomes for which the numerator was zero for both treatment groups. In these instances we included the outcome (with any necessary adjustments for follow-up denominators) for the earlier years in the duration of the study. For example, if a trial reported zero hip fractures for both treatment arms at the end of year three, we would also include in our analysis zero hip fractures for that trial at years one and two. </P>
<P>For person year data, the unit of analysis, if available, was number of fractures. When these data were not available (that is in the majority of cases), we used the number of women sustaining a fracture. For denominators, we multiplied the number of women followed by the length of the study. For radiographic vertebral fractures we used the number of women with available radiographs, if the number was reported in the article. For clinical fractures, we estimated the number of women followed over the duration of the study by taking the mean of the baseline and follow-up denominators. </P>
<P>
<B>Strategy for quality assessment <BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Two review authors assessed each eligible RCT for quality based on allocation concealment. Research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) and studies can be judged on the method of allocation concealment. The method for assigning participants to interventions should be robust against patient and clinician bias and its description should be clear. The review authors were required to indicate whether allocation concealment was adequate (A), unclear (B), or inadequate (C) as per the Cochrane Collaboration criteria, as follows. </P>
<P>Adequate: some approaches that can be used to ensure adequate concealment schemes are centralized or pharmacy-controlled randomization, pre-numbered or coded identical containers which are administered serially to participants, on-site computer system combined with allocations kept in a locked unreadable computer file that can be accessed only after the characteristics of an enrolled participant have been entered or sequentially numbered or sealed, opaque envelopes. Other approaches may include those similar to ones listed previously, along with reassurance that the person who generated the allocation scheme did not administer it. </P>
<P>Inadequate: approaches to allocation concealment that are considered inadequate include alternation, use of case record numbers, dates of birth or day of the week and any procedure that is entirely transparent before allocation, such as an open list of random numbers. </P>
<P>Unclear: when studies do not report any concealment approach adequacy should be considered unclear. Examples include merely stating that a list or table were used, only specifying that sealed envelopes were used and reporting an apparently adequate concealment scheme in combination with other information that leads the review author to be suspicious. </P>
<P>In addition, blinding and loss to follow up were assessed. </P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis </B>
</P>
<P>For the analysis of fractures (that is vertebral, non-vertebral, hip and wrist), the relative risk (RR) of fracture was calculated using a fixed-effect model. The methods we used for pooling the results are described elsewhere by Fleiss (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1993</LINK>). The pooled or weighted RRs were calculated using the general inverse variance method for the weights. For the pooled results, site-specific 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for vertebral, non-vertebral, hip and wrist fractures and we tested for association using a chi-square test procedure taking a P value &lt; 0.05 for presence of statistical association. Statistically significant risk reductions were considered to be clinically important if a 15% or greater relative benefit was shown. We also tested for homogeneity using a chi-square test procedure taking the specific cut off for presence of statistical heterogeneity as P = 0.10. In the event of significant heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used. </P>
<P>If the relative risk reduction (RRR) was significant (P &lt; 0.05), then the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated. For these calculations, the five-year risk of fracture in the untreated population was based on the FRACTURE Index (FI) of Black et al (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2001</LINK>) and the lifetime and five-year age-specific risks in the untreated population were based on the model by Doherty et al (<LINK REF="REF-Doherty-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doherty 2001</LINK>) for predicting osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). </P>
<P>Trials varied as to the length of treatment (for example one to four years) and the number of patients available for study at the start of treatment (that is the baseline denominator) compared to those available at different time points during the trial (that is follow-up denominators). The base case taken for the review of fractures considered the data available for the longest period of time for the treatment in the trial (that is 'all years') and used the baseline denominators for the number of patients in the trial. </P>
<P>Data was initially pooled broadly across primary and secondary prevention trials. The overall analysis was also considered using person years of observation. In addition, we conducted subgroup analysis for: 1) primary versus secondary prevention, 2) treatment duration and 3) treatment dose. Furthermore, we conducted sensitivity analysis for: 1) baseline denominators versus follow-up denominators, 2) fixed-effect versus random-effects model and 3) baseline vertebral fracture rate. For the last sensitivity analysis, recall that the vertebral fracture criteria for a trial to be considered secondary was a prevalence of vertebral fracture at baseline of greater than 20%. A sensitivity analysis using different vertebral fracture rates (that is 100%, &gt; 80%, &gt; 60%, &gt; 40%, &gt; 20%) without the BMD and age criteria was conducted. Such sensitivity analysis allowed evaluating whether the effect of bisphosphonates on the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures varied depending on how strictly secondary prevention was defined. </P>
<P>
<B>Grading of evidence </B>
</P>
<P>We used the grading system described in the 2004 book Evidence-based Rheumatology (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK>) and recommended by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group.<BR/>Platinum <BR/>To achieve the platinum level of evidence, a published systematic review that has at least two randomized controlled trials, each satisfying the following, is required. <BR/>* Sample sizes of at least 50 per group - if these do not find a statistically significant difference, they are adequately powered for a 20% relative difference in the relevant outcome. <BR/>* Blinding of patients and assessors for outcomes. <BR/>* Handling of withdrawals &gt; 80% follow up (imputations based on methods such as last observation carried forward (LOCF) are acceptable). <BR/>* Concealment of treatment allocation. </P>
<P>Gold <BR/>The gold level of evidence requires at least one randomized clinical trial meeting all of the following criteria for the major outcome(s), as reported. <BR/>* Sample sizes of at least 50 per group - if these do not find a statistically significant difference, they are adequately powered for a 20% relative difference in the relevant outcome. <BR/>* Blinding of patients and assessors for outcomes. <BR/>* Handling of withdrawals &gt; 80% follow up (imputations based on methods such as LOCF are acceptable). <BR/>* Concealment of treatment allocation. </P>
<P>Silver <BR/>The silver level of evidence requires a randomized trial that does not meet the above criteria for gold or platinum ranking or evidence from at least one study of non-randomized cohorts that did and did not receive the therapy, or evidence from at least one high quality case-control study. A randomized trial with a 'head-to-head' comparison of agents would be considered silver-level ranking unless a reference was provided to a comparison of one of the agents to placebo showing at least a 20% relative difference. </P>
<P>Bronze<BR/>The bronze level of evidence requires at least one high quality case series without controls (including simple before and after studies in which patients act as their own control) or a conclusion derived from expert opinion based on clinical experience without reference to any of the foregoing (for example argument from physiology, bench research or first principles). </P>
<P>
<B>Clinical relevance tables<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Clinical relevance tables were compiled under 'Additional tables' to improve the readability of the review. Results were presented within the context of both the study population and moderate to high risk women from the population at large. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated using the relative risk (RR) in combination with either the risk of fracture in the control group or the five year FRACTURE Index (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2001</LINK>). To do this, the Visual Rx NNT calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2004</LINK>) was used. The weighted absolute risk difference was calculated using the risk difference (RD) statistic in RevMan and RR-1 was used to calculate the relative per cent change (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, for the outcomes of vertebral and hip fractures we prepared Summary of Findings tables using the GRADE criteria from the GRADE working group (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2004</LINK>), (<LINK REF="FIG-18" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 18</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-19" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 19</LINK>).</P>

Follow up for the 11 studies ranged from two to four years and the mean age of the participants was 53 to 72 years. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Montessori-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Montessori 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watts-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1990</LINK>) excluded women with a history of gastrointestinal (GI) disease and only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Watts-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1990</LINK>) reported fractures as a stated primary outcome. </P>
<P>We did not include data from the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) treatment arm or combined HRT and etidronate arm of the study by Wimalawansa (<LINK REF="STD-Wimalawansa-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wimalawansa 1998</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Watts-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1990</LINK>) there were four treatment groups included, of which two were placebo groups. As a result, this study was analyzed as two separate studies ( Watts A and Watts B). In Watts A, cyclical etidronate was compared with placebo whereas in Watts B cyclical etidronate and phosphate were compared with placebo and phosphate. Due to the separation of the Watts study into two, the analysis of fracture data reported in the following tables is considered to come from a possible total of 12 trials.</P>

<P>Considering the data available for the longest treatment duration in the trials and using the baseline denominators for the number of patients in the trial (that is base case), a summary of the overall review of fractures for the standard dose of etidronate (400 mg for two weeks every three months) is given in <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>. In general, the pooled estimate of RR of fracture after treatment with etidronate was not significant for non-vertebral, hip and wrist fractures whether it was used for primary or secondary prevention. For vertebral fractures, the pooled estimate of the RR was significant for secondary prevention but not for primary prevention. The Clinical relevance table provides a summary of the absolute and relative results. </P>
<P>
<B>Vertebral fractures <BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Vertebral fractures were reported in all 11 trials. Among these, two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ishida-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ishida 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shiota-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shiota 2001</LINK>) used a nonstandard dose of 200 mg and were later considered in the section on subgroup analysis. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Storm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Storm 1990</LINK>) reported results in person years only and the Watts trial was considered to consist of two studies, as previously explained. As a result, we considered the eight trials reporting vertebral fractures corresponding to the standard 400 mg dose. One trial reported that no fractures occurred in either treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Herd-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Herd 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pooled estimate of the RR of vertebral fractures from the eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Herd-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Herd 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lyritis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lyritis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montessori-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Montessori 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pacifici-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Pacifici 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pouilles-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pouilles 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watts-1990A" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1990A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watts-1990B" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1990B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wimalawansa-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wimalawansa 1998</LINK>) that could be analyzed resulted in a significant 41% reduction in vertebral fractures (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.96) as detailed in <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK> and as Comparison 01, 01. This demonstrated a fracture risk reduction with etidronate and results were consistent across the eight trials (P = 0.70). The significance in the overall RR of vertebral fractures was fundamentally due to the six secondary prevention trials that demonstrated a significant relative risk reduction (RRR) of 47% in vertebral fractures (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87); compared to the pooled result for the two primary prevention trials (RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.32 to 28.44), which was not significant. </P>
<P>Corresponding to the significant RRR of 47% for the secondary prevention of vertebral fractures, the measures (ARR, NNT) of the five year risk of vertebral fracture after treatment with etidronate were calculated for different levels of increasing risk as measured by the fracture index (FI). Results are provided in <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK> as well as for increasing age in <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>. For the illustrative case of the patient with a FI of 6 to 7, the ARR in vertebral fracture was 3.3% (that is a reduction in risk from 7.1% to 3.8%) and the NNT was 30 (that is 30 patients would need to be treated to avoid one vertebral fracture). Across the range of increasing FI risk, the ARR for vertebral fracture ranged from 0.6% to 5.3% and the NNT to avoid one vertebral fracture ranged from 167 to 19. For the illustrative patient in the age group 60 to 64 years, the ARR for the first vertebral fracture was 0.5% (that is a reduction in risk from 1.0% to 0.5%) and the NNT was 213 patients treated to avoid the first fracture. The ARR for a subsequent fracture was 4.6% (that is a reduction in risk from 9.7% to 5.1%) and the NNT was 22 patients treated to avoid one subsequent fracture. For increasing age, the 5-year age-specific ARR for the first vertebral fracture increased from 0.1% for the youngest age group (50 to 54 years) to 2.2% in the highest age group (90+ years). Accordingly, the NNT decreased from 1064 to 45. For the subsequent fracture, ARR increased from 0.2% to 13.1% and the NNT decreased from 426 to 8. </P>

<P>Non-vertebral fractures were reported in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lyritis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lyritis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pouilles-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pouilles 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Storm 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watts-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wimalawansa-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wimalawansa 1998</LINK>). The lack of effect of etidronate on non-vertebral fractures is depicted in <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK> and Comparison 02,01. The 95% CI around the RR estimate for all non-vertebral fractures was wide with a RRR of approximately 32% and a RR increase of 42% (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.42). Results were consistent across the seven trials (P = 0.87). </P>
<P>A similar lack of effect of etidronate on non-vertebral fractures was found for both primary and secondary prevention trials. Pooled results for both primary prevention trials (RR 0.56, 95%CI 0.20 to 1.61) and the five secondary prevention trials (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.60) were not significant. </P>
<P>
<B>Hip fractures</B> </P>
<P>Hip fractures were only reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lyritis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lyritis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Storm 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watts-1990A" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1990A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watts-1990B" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1990B</LINK>). Results of the pooled hip fracture data (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.88) were not significant, as detailed in <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK> and Comparison 03, 01. </P>
<P>
<B>Wrist fractures</B> </P>
<P>Wrist fractures were reported in the same three secondary prevention trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lyritis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lyritis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Storm 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watts-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1990</LINK>) as were hip fractures. Similarly, results of the pooled wrist fracture data (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.36) were not significant, as detailed in <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK> and Comparison 04, 01. </P>

Of note, the pooled result for vertebral fractures was not significant for the two primary prevention trials; however, for the six secondary prevention trials a significant 55% reduction in vertebral fractures (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.64) was found with results consistent across the secondary trials (P = 0.40). </P>

The pooled estimate demonstrated no significant difference between etidronate and placebo for the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.49) or for dropouts overall (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.26) (Comparisons 10, 01; 10, 02). Results were consistent across the trials.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Overall, using data available for the longest treatment duration and baseline denominators for the number of patients in the included trials, the pooled estimate of RR of fracture after etidronate was not statistically significant for non-vertebral, hip or wrist fractures. This was found whether etidronate was used for primary or secondary prevention (Silver level evidence). For vertebral fractures, the pooled RR estimate was significant for secondary but not for primary prevention. The evidence that in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis etidronate reduces the incidence of vertebral fractures is Silver level. </P>
<P>The pooled analysis suggests that etidronate, when used as part of a 90-day cyclical regimen, reduces the RR of vertebral fractures by 47%. It is cautioned that the 95% CI around this estimate was relatively wide and the upper boundary representing the smallest effect consistent with the data showed a RRR of only 13%. Nonetheless, a reduction in vertebral fractures is clinically important if associated with reduction in pain and functional disability. Observational studies have suggested such an association between fractures and pain (<LINK REF="REF-Ettinger-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ettinger 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ross-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okeksik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okeksik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1999</LINK>). Furthermore, it has been recently recognized that women who have suffered one incident vertebral fracture are at substantial risk of a subsequent vertebral fracture within the next year (<LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 2001</LINK>). Despite the effect on vertebral fractures, the point estimate of the effect of etidronate on non-vertebral fractures (as well as hip and wrist fractures individually) suggest no impact. Of note, the CIs were wide and for non-vertebral fractures a RRR of up to 32% remains possible. To conclude on etidronate's efficacy, readers are cautioned to the fact that the wide CIs observed indicates that a certain level of uncertainty still prevails around the drug's effect. A relatively small number (total = 624) of participants were recruited in the etidronate trials. </P>
<P>Secondary analyses showed that etidronate at a dose of 200 mg for secondary prevention resulted in a statistically significant reduction in vertebral fractures (RR 0.32, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.64) (Silver level evidence). This resulted from the pooling of two small trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ishida-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ishida 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shiota-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shiota 2001</LINK>) representing a total of 172 patients. No trials were available to assess the effectiveness of the 200 mg dose for secondary prevention of non-vertebral fractures or the primary prevention of any endpoint. Fracture reductions for the secondary prevention of hip and wrist fractures were not statistically significant.</P>
<P>There were no substantive differences in the results whether baseline, end of study or person year denominators were used. Sensitivity analyses indicated that there were no major differences based on the percentage of baseline vertebral fractures. Further, no trends were found for years of treatment. </P>
<P>From a drug tolerance perspective, adverse effects observed in the included trials were similar between etidronate and placebo. Also, the use of etidronate was not associated with statistically significant differences in either the rate of withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.49) or overall withdrawals (RR 0.91, 95%CI 0.71 to 1.26) when compared to placebo. It follows that study participants tolerated their etidronate treatment. </P>
<P>The results from our analysis are consistent with those of a previous meta-analysis by Cardona and Pastor (<LINK REF="REF-Cardona-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cardona 1997</LINK>). They reported a reduction in vertebral fractures of 28.3 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI 26.2 to 30.4); however, they did not derive a pooled estimate for non-vertebral fractures. This meta-analysis suggested a beneficial effect of etidronate on reducing vertebral fractures and the data provided no support for reduction of non-vertebral fractures. </P>
<P>
<B>Study limitations</B> </P>
<P>The results of this systematic review are believed to be robust as a comprehensive literature search was performed, inclusion and exclusion criteria were specified and a rigorous data analysis was conducted. A potential limitation of our approach may be that the update search (from 2000 to 2004) did not include non-MEDLINE® indexed journals. Recent empirical evidence indicates that this approach may have introduced a slight risk of bias into our meta-analysis. On average, such bias is estimated to result in a 6% variation in the pooled results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2003</LINK>). Accordingly, given that the initial literature search (from 1966 to 2000) was very extensive, the impact of only using MEDLINE® for the search update is expected to be minimal, if any. This was confirmed by a parallel literature search update (from 1999 to July 2004) that was conducted for an economic report published by The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) (<LINK REF="REF-CADTH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADTH 2006</LINK>). The search update included etidronate, alendronate and risedronate in addition to teriparatide. A number of databases were searched (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, BIOSIS Previews®, Toxfile, PubMed) and no additional articles meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. </P>
<P>While our methodology was robust, the results of our meta-analysis, however, are only as strong as the primary studies included. In keeping with this, the main limitations with regard to study quality were fracture assessment and classification, the lack of clarity of the concealment of allocation, length of follow up and the small number of participants enrolled in the trials. </P>
<P>A potential source of heterogeneity is the lack of uniform definition of non-vertebral fracture. While some researchers may use a rather liberal definition (any fracture other than vertebral fracture), others may use a more conservative definition which includes only fractures of the hip, clavicle, humerus, wrist, pelvis or leg (<LINK REF="REF-Mayo-Clinic-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo Clinic 2005</LINK>). Also, the statistical power to detect heterogeneity was extremely limited for some tests due to the low number of fractures in some categories. Another consideration is the fact that fracture data was not the primary outcome in the majority of the trials. </P>
<P>Another methodological limitation concerns the approach used for concealment of treatment allocation, which was not reported for any of the trials (that is classified as 'unclear'). </P>
<P>An additional limitation is the length of follow up in the studies (one to four years). It is difficult to extrapolate beyond the duration of the follow-up trials in the review with respect to the long-term impact on fractures. Ultimately, data from longer-term trials will help establish if the effect on fractures is maintained, increased or diminished. </P>
<P>For more uncommon events such as hip fractures, large sample sizes are required to detect important differences. For etidronate, the small pooled sample sizes for the non-vertebral outcomes (non-vertebral (N = 624), hip (N = 589) and wrist fractures (N = 589)) make this a particular concern. </P>
<P>In regards to our own methodology, we acknowledge that the approach used to evaluate the effect of bisphosphonates over time may result in some estimates that are not robust. In particular, in order to determine the effect on the five-year risk of fracture we based our evaluation on the FRACTURE Index by Black et al (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2001</LINK>) and for lifetime and five-year age-specific risks we used an existing model from Doherty et al (<LINK REF="REF-Doherty-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doherty 2001</LINK>). Although this latter approach allowed us to estimate the variation in risks between younger and older postmenopausal women these estimates may be associated with a certain level of uncertainty. Nonetheless, we believe such information may be useful to decision makers. </P>
<P>Lastly, a limitation of evaluating data on adverse effects from summary meta-analyses is that participants in RCTs tend to be healthier with fewer co-morbid diseases and therefore the results may not be generalizable to clinical practice. Patients with pre-existing GI disorders were excluded in two (<LINK REF="STD-Montessori-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Montessori 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watts-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1990</LINK>) of the 11 trials. An additional trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pouilles-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pouilles 1997</LINK>) possibly excluded GI patients as it indicated that patients were excluded for "any condition contraindicating study medication". Furthermore, RCTs are underpowered for rare effects and meta-analyses of these trials generally cannot provide conclusive information pertaining to drug toxicity. In addition, the heterogeneity of the adverse drug events (ADEs) reported in the RCTs described in this review, including their nature, low occurrence, and way they were assessed by investigators, made these improper for meta-analysis. Finally, because RCTs are not designed to measure ADEs, particularly rare ones, it is common practice to include sources of information other than RCTs. While some review authors include ADEs reported in observational studies we elected to obtain information from the Canadian Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Program (CADRMP), a governmental reporting system (<LINK REF="REF-CADRMP-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADRMP 2005</LINK>) (see below). </P>
<P>
<B>Generalizability of findings</B> </P>
<P>Generalizability of our findings is limited by the controlled design of the trials included in our review. Study participants were carefully selected in these trials and so utilization of the drugs in real life may vary substantially from study conditions. Furthermore, study participants were observed for periods of time varying from one to four years. Consequently, while our results provide support for efficacy (that is can the intervention have an effect on outcome?) they may possibly only provide partial information on the long-term effectiveness (that is does the intervention have an effect on outcome?) of etidronate in preventing osteoporotic fractures. </P>
<P>From a safety perspective, we could not find any statistically significant difference in either the rates of adverse drug events or withdrawal rates due to adverse drug events between patients receiving etidronate or patients receiving a placebo. However, outside controlled trials concerns exist regarding the safe use of bisphosphonate drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Kherani-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kherani 2002</LINK>). While such adverse events have mainly been identified through case reports and endoscopic studies, similar concerns are also reflected in the proportions of gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions associated with the use of bisphosphonates as reported to the CADRMP (<LINK REF="REF-CADRMP-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADRMP 2005</LINK>). Indeed, GI adverse drug reactions represented 18% of all reactions for etidronate <LINK REF="FIG-17" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 17</LINK>. These proportions should however be interpreted with caution as adverse drug reactions are reported to CADRMP on a volunteer basis by health professionals, which means that several reactions may be unreported (<LINK REF="REF-Medeffect-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medeffect 2005</LINK>). Also, a definite cause-effect relationship has not been established for these adverse drug reactions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Etidronate, used at 400 mg per day, demonstrated a clinically important benefit in the secondary prevention of vertebral fractures. The secondary prevention population was defined as having a bone density of at least 2 SD values below peak bone mass or one or more vertebral compression fractures, or both. There were no statistically significant reductions in vertebral fractures when used for primary prevention. Furthermore, no statistically significant reductions in non-vertebral, hip or wrist fractures were observed regardless of whether etidronate was used for primary or secondary prevention. No increased incidence in adverse effects was found in the included studies but the possibility of upper gastrointestinal symptoms cannot be ruled out from randomized controlled trials. </P>
<P>The prevention of osteoporotic fractures is an important public health intervention. This is particularly true for hip and clinical vertebral fractures (that is fractures of the spine that present for medical attention). The RR of death following such fractures is 6 to 9-fold greater in postmenopausal women aged 55 to 81 years with low BMD, which represents a typical postmenopausal population (<LINK REF="REF-Cauley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauley 2000</LINK>). In most cases the mortality increase reflects poor underlying health status and comorbidity in addition to the fracture itself (<LINK REF="REF-Cauley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauley 2000</LINK>). Osteoporotic fractures are also associated with increases in morbidity as it is reported that 50% of women who sustain a hip fracture do not return to their usual daily activities (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2002</LINK>) while 33% will require long-term care. Although a significant reduction in hip fractures was not observed for etidronate (possibly due to the paucity of data available), reducing the incidence of such fractures can potentially increase the quality of life of patients with osteoporosis. Such interventions may also potentially decrease mortality. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>For etidronate, most trials enrolled a small number of participants and were not necessarily designed to measure fractures, which limits our findings. </P>
<P>With regards to the bisphosphonates as a class, It has been suggested from clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McClung-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClung 2001</LINK>) that their effect in reducing non-vertebral fractures may be greater in those patients with lower BMD who initiate treatment. The existing data have not fully resolved the question of whether important differences in risk reduction across groups of patients with varying degrees of osteoporosis exist. The impact of bisphosphonates on the RR of non-vertebral fractures in populations without osteoporosis also merits further investigation. Additional research is needed to clarify the role of bisphosphonates in the primary prevention of osteoporotic fractures. There is also a need for further post-marketing safety surveillance. Finally, research into combination therapy with higher doses of vitamin D or anabolic agents would be merited as would research concerning adherence to bisphosphonate therapy. </P>
<P>Given the morbidity consequences associated with osteoporotic fractures, preventing their recurrence can potentially lessen the need for community-based health services (for example home care). It may also reduce or delay the demand for long-term care beds. However, very little comparative information is currently available to support this (<LINK REF="REF-Hodsman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodsman 2002</LINK>). There is also a lack of studies which evaluated the effect of bisphosphonates on hospital admissions (<LINK REF="REF-Hodsman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodsman 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review updated a previous review of etidronate conceived, conducted and completed, in part, by the authors of this report (<LINK REF="REF-Cranney-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranney 2001b</LINK>). There were four general differences in the manner in which the two reviews were conducted. First, the search was extended to include articles up to Feburary 2007 and the current review included two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ishida-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ishida 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shiota-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shiota 2001</LINK>) published after the previous review was completed. Second, although both published and additional data from study investigators were used in the previous review, only published data were used in this one. Third, in the previous review the random-effects model was always used whereas in the present review the base analysis used the fixed-effect model unless the results were heterogeneous. Fourth, although the previous review considered both bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture data, this review was only concerned with fractures and therefore the definition of primary and secondary prevention put more of an emphasis on the fracture study inclusion criteria.<BR/>
<BR/>Specifically, there were three changes in the choice and classification of the included trials. First, in the previous etidronate review (<LINK REF="REF-Cranney-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranney 2001b</LINK>) the trial by Watts (<LINK REF="STD-Watts-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1990</LINK>) was classified as primary prevention since the average t score was -1.7 and, as a result, women were included that were within 2 SD of the mean peak mass. However, an inclusion criterion restricted the population of women in the trial to those experiencing 1 to 4 previous vertebral compression fractures and, therefore, the trial was classified as secondary prevention in this review. Second, for the trial by Storm (<LINK REF="STD-Storm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Storm 1990</LINK>), additional vertebral data were obtained from the authors and this information was not used in the current review. Third, for vertebral fractures, the trials by Meunier and Pouilles (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pouilles-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pouilles 1997</LINK>) were excluded from the analysis of the previous review due to low incidence of vertebral fractures but they were included in this review.<BR/>
<BR/>The overall results (that is primary and secondary prevention combined) of the two reviews are essentially identical. For primary prevention, there are some differences: the RR of vertebral fracture is now greater than one but with a much wider CI; and for non-vertebral fractures, the RR of fracture is now smaller than one. However, for both reviews these results were non-significant. For secondary prevention, the RR for vertebral fracture is now smaller and is statistically significant. For non-vertebral fractures, the RR is larger and now above one but is still non-significant.<BR/>
<BR/>The differences in the results for primary and secondary prevention are due to reclassifying the Watts (<LINK REF="STD-Watts-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1990</LINK>) trial as secondary prevention. If this trial is considered as a primary prevention trial then the primary and secondary results for the two reviews are essentially the same. The sensitivity analysis of including and excluding unpublished data did not substantively change the results. Similarly, including and excluding the results of the trials by Meunier and Pouilles (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pouilles-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pouilles 1997</LINK>) did not change the results.<BR/>
<BR/>In summary, the conclusions are similar in that both reviews found no statistically significant reductions in vertebral fractures when etidronate is used for primary prevention; and no statistically significant reductions in non-vertebral fractures were observed, regardless of whether etidronate was used for primary or secondary prevention. However, in the current and previous reviews etidronate demonstrated a significant benefit in the secondary prevention of vertebral fractures.<BR/>
