<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-26 08:47:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cervical pre-cancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) can be treated in different ways depending on the extent and nature of the disease. Less invasive treatments that do not require a hospital stay may be used. A general anaesthetic is occasionally needed, especially if the disease has spread locally, early invasion is suspected or previous out-patient treatment has failed. Surgery can be done with a knife, cryotherapy (freezing the abnormal cells), laser or cutting with a loop (an electrically charged wire). This review found there was not enough evidence to confidently select the most effective technique and that more research is needed.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risks of bias.

<P>Twenty-nine trials were included. Seven surgical techniques were tested in various comparisons. No significant differences in treatment failures were demonstrated in terms of persistent disease after treatment. Large loop excision of the transformation zone appeared to provide the most reliable specimens for histology with the least morbidity.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-05-11 12:24:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-04-26 11:48:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2009</LINK>). A woman's risk of developing cervical cancer by age 65 years ranges from 0.8% in developed countries to 1.5% in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-IARC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 2002</LINK>). In Europe, about 60% of women with cervical cancer are alive five years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-EUROCARE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROCARE 2003</LINK>). Cervical screening aims to identify women with asymptomatic disease and to treat the disease with a low morbidity procedure thus lowering the risk of developing invasive disease. In countries with effective screening programmes, dramatic reductions have occurred in the incidence of disease and the stage of cancer if disease is diagnosed (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 2004</LINK>). Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the most common pre-malignant lesion, with atypical squamous changes in the transformation zone of the cervix. Mild, moderate or severe changes are described by their depth (CIN 1, 2 or 3). If CIN progresses it develops into squamous cancer. In contrast, the much rarer glandular pre-cancerous abnormalities (cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia or CGIN) becomes cervical adenocarcinoma.</P>
<P>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of pre-cancerous abnormalities of the cervix. HPV has over 100 subtypes and is present in over 95% of pre-invasive and invasive squamous carcinomas of the cervix. Serotypes associated with cervical squamous lesions may be designated as having a high or low risk for progression to malignancy. HPV infection in young women is commonly a transient infection and the body's own immune response clears the disease from the cervical tissues. If pre-invasive disease has been present and the immunological response clears HPV infection then the pre-invasive disease will resolve. Sexually active young women under 30 years of age have a very high rate of HPV infection whilst women over 30 years of age have a much lower HPV infection rate (<LINK REF="REF-Sargent-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sargent 2008</LINK>). This is a reflection of the natural history of disease, with a 50% regression rate and only a 10% progression rate of low grade CIN in young women (<LINK REF="REF-Ostor-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostor 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The frequency of abnormal Papanicolaou smear test results and subsequent CIN varies with the population tested, the test used and the reported accuracy. It is estimated to range between 1.5% to 6% (<LINK REF="REF-Cirisano-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cirisano 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>When CIN is identified, colposcopists generally treat CIN 2 or high grade disease and either observe or immediately treat CIN 1 depending on personal preference. The aim of this review was to compare different treatment modalities to assess their effectiveness for treating disease.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-05-11 12:24:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Current treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is by local ablative therapy or by excisional methods, depending on the nature and extent of disease. Traditionally, prior to colposcopy, all lesions were treated by knife excisional cone biopsy or by ablative radical point diathermy. Knife cone biopsy and radical point diathermy are usually performed under general anaesthesia and are no longer the preferred treatment as various more conservative local ablative and excisional therapies can be performed in an out-patient setting.</P>
<P>Patients are suitable for ablative therapy provided that:<BR/>(1) the entire transformation zone can be visualised (satisfactory colposcopy);<BR/>(2) there is no suggestion of micro-invasive or invasive disease;<BR/>(3) there is no suspicion of glandular disease;<BR/>(4) the cytology and histology correspond.</P>
<P>Excisional treatment is mandatory for a patient with an unsatisfactory colposcopy, suspicion of invasion or glandular abnormality. There is now a trend to utilise low morbidity excisional methods, either laser conisation or large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ), in place of destructive ablative methods. Excisional methods offer advantages over destructive methods in that they can define the exact nature of disease and the completeness of excision or destruction of the transformation zone. Incomplete excision or destruction of the transformation zone is an important indicator of patients at risk of treatment failure or recurrence of disease.</P>
<P>The treatment modalities included in this review are described below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Knife cone biopsy</HEADING>
<P>Traditionally, broad deep cones were performed for most cases of CIN. Excision of a wide and deep cone of the cervix is associated with significant short and long term morbidity (peri-operative, primary and secondary haemorrhage, local and pelvic infection, cervical stenosis and mid-trimester pregnancy loss) (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leiman-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leiman 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luesley-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luesley 1985</LINK>). A less radical approach is now generally adopted, tailoring the width and depth of the cone according to colposcopic findings. The procedure is invariably performed under general anaesthesia. Peri-operative haemostasis can be difficult to achieve and various surgical techniques have been developed to reduce bleeding. Routine ligation of the cervical vessels is commonly performed. This technique also allows manipulation of the cervix during surgery. Sturmdorf sutures have been advocated by some surgeons to promote haemostasis; others recommend circumferential locking sutures, electrocauterisation or cold coagulation, or vaginal compression packing.<BR/>The treatment success (that is no residual disease on follow up) of knife cone biopsy is reported as 90% to 94% (<LINK REF="STD-Bostofte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bostofte 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tabor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabor 1990</LINK>) in non-randomised studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Laser conisation</HEADING>
<P>This procedure can be performed under general or local analgesia. A highly focused laser spot is used to make an ectocervical circumferential incision to a depth of 1 cm. Small hooks or retractors are then used to manipulate the cone to allow deeper incision and complete the endocervical incision. Haemostasis, if required, is generally achieved through laser coagulation by defocusing the beam. A disadvantage of laser conisation is that the cone biopsy specimen might suffer from thermal damage, making histological evaluation of margins impossible.<BR/>The treatment success of laser cone biopsy is reported as 93% to 96% (<LINK REF="STD-Bostofte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bostofte 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tabor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabor 1990</LINK>) in non-randomised studies. The major advantages are accurate tailoring of the size of the cone, low blood loss in most cases, and less cervical trauma than with knife cut cones.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Loop excision of the transformation zone</HEADING>
<P>Large loop excision of the transformation zone is often abbreviated to LLETZ in the UK or LEEP (loop electrosurgical excisional procedure) in the USA. A wire loop electrode on the end of an insulated handle is powered by an electrosurgical unit. The current is designed to achieve a cutting and coagulation effect simultaneously. Power should be sufficient to excise tissue without causing a thermal artefact. The procedure can be performed under local analgesia.<BR/>Treatment success of LLETZ is reported as 98% (<LINK REF="REF-Prendeville-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendeville 1989</LINK>), 96% (<LINK REF="REF-Bigrigg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bigrigg 1990</LINK>), 96% (<LINK REF="REF-Luesley-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luesley 1990</LINK>), 95% (<LINK REF="REF-Whiteley-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whiteley 1990</LINK>), 91% (<LINK REF="REF-Murdoch-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murdoch 1992</LINK>) and 94% (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-TC-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright TC 1992</LINK>) in non-randomised studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Laser ablation</HEADING>
<P>A laser beam is used to destroy the tissue of the transformation zone. Laser destruction of tissue can be controlled by the length of exposure. Defocusing the beam permits photocoagulation of bleeding vessels in the cervical wound.<BR/>Treatment success of laser ablation is reported as 95% to 96% (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 1985</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cryotherapy</HEADING>
<P>A circular metal probe is placed against the transformation zone. Hypothermia is produced by the evaporation of compressed refrigerant gas passing through the base of the probe. The cryonecrosis is achieved by crystallization of intracellular water. The effect tends to be patchy as sublethal tissue damage tends to occur at the periphery of the probe.<BR/>In non-controlled studies the success of treatment of CIN3 varied, between 77% and 93%, 87% (<LINK REF="REF-Benedet-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benedet 1981</LINK>), 77% (<LINK REF="REF-Hatch-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatch 1981</LINK>), 82% (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 1978</LINK>), 84% (<LINK REF="REF-Ostergard-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostergard 1980</LINK>), and 93% (<LINK REF="REF-Popkin-et-al-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Popkin et al 1978</LINK>).<BR/>Utilising a double freeze-thaw-freeze technique improved the reliability in the observational study by <LINK REF="REF-Creasman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creasman 1984</LINK>. Rapid ice-ball formation indicates that the depth of necrosis will extend to the periphery of the probe. The procedure can be associated with unpleasant vasomotor symptoms.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-04-26 09:24:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review examines the efficacy and morbidity of local ablative and excisional therapies for eradicating disease. The effectiveness and morbidity of the various forms of treatment have generally been evaluated in uncontrolled observational studies. Hence direct comparison of treatment effects of alternative treatments is unreliable because of variable patient selection, treatment outcomes and follow-up criteria. We have, therefore, only included trials which appear to be randomised in order to reduce selection bias and potentially provide results with greater certainty.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-26 11:59:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>(1) For double versus single freeze technique cryotherapy, the evidence suggests that cryotherapy should be used with a double freeze technique rather than single freeze in order to reduce the risk of residual disease within 12 months, although statistical significance was not reached. The single freeze technique had higher treatment failure rates.</P>
<P>(2) Laser ablation demonstrated no overall difference in residual disease after treatment for CIN compared with cryotherapy. Cryosurgery appears to have a lower success rate but the majority of authors used a single freeze thaw technique. Creasman (<LINK REF="REF-Creasman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creasman 1984</LINK>) demonstrated that using a double freeze-thaw-freeze technique improves results towards those achieved by destructive and excisional methods. However, analysis of results demonstrated that there was no significant difference for the treatment of CIN1 and 2; laser ablation appeared to be better, but not significantly so, for treating CIN3. The clinician's choice of treatment of low grade disease must therefore be influenced by the side effects related to the treatments.<BR/>Laser ablation was associated with significantly fewer vasomotor symptoms and less malodorous discharge or inadequate colposcopy at follow up compared with cryotherapy. No other statistical differences were observed in any other side effects, although there may be more peri-operative pain and bleeding for laser ablation. Since the number of events was low, this needs to be explored further.</P>
<P>(3) Four trials compared laser conisation and knife conisation (<LINK REF="STD-Bostofte-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bostofte 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristensen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kristensen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathevet-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mathevet 1994</LINK>). For the two trials that evaluated residual disease after laser conisation or knife conisation, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. There was also no evidence of a difference between the two interventions for primary and secondary haemorrhage. Significant thermal artefact prevented interpretation of resection margins in 38% of laser cones compared to none in the knife cones, which was statistically significant. Laser conisation produced significantly fewer inadequate colposcopes (transformation zone seen in its entirety) at follow up and cervical stenosis was significantly less common after this treatment.</P>
<P>(4) Only the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Partington-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Partington 1989</LINK> compared laser conisation with laser ablation for ectocervical lesions. There was no significant difference with respect to residual disease at follow up, peri-operative severe bleeding, secondary haemorrhage or inadequate colposcopy at follow up.</P>
<P>(5) Six trials compared laser conisation with large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) (<LINK REF="STD-Crompton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Crompton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathevet-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mathevet 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oyesanya-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Oyesanya 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paraskevaidis-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskevaidis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vejerslev-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vejerslev 1999</LINK>). There was no significant difference with respect to residual disease at follow up, peri-operative severe pain, secondary haemorrhage, significant thermal artefact, inadequate colposcopy or cervical stenosis. However, laser conisation takes significantly longer to perform, has a significantly higher rate of perioperative bleeding and produces a greater depth of thermal artefact.</P>
<P>(6) Laser ablation compared to LLETZ was evaluated by four trials. <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 1994</LINK> was included in the comparison but its methodology differed from the trials of <LINK REF="STD-Dey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dey 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gunasekera-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gunasekera 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1998</LINK>. The <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 1994</LINK> trial performed LLETZ on all the patients randomised to that group whereas laser ablation was only performed if colposcopic directed biopsies were performed. There was no difference in residual disease rates between the two treatments. There was no significant difference in the risk of primary or secondary haemorrhage or peri-operative severe pain.</P>
<P>(7) For knife cone biopsy compared to loop excision, (a) six randomised trials evaluated knife cone biopsy and loop excision (<LINK REF="STD-Duggan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Duggan 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Giacalone-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Giacalone 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Girardi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Girardi 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mathevet-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mathevet 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sadek-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sadek 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Takac-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Takac 1999</LINK>). The trials found that there was no evidence of a difference between the two interventions on residual disease rate.<BR/>(b) Measuring primary haemorrhage, the trials of <LINK REF="STD-Giacalone-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Giacalone 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Duggan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Duggan 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mathevet-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mathevet 1994</LINK> found that there was no statistical difference in inadequate colposcopy rates between knife conisation and loop excision. There was also no clear evidence that there was any difference in primary haemorrhage or cervical stenosis rates.</P>
<P>(8) For radical diathermy versus LLETZ, there was no significant difference between these two modalities with regards to the side effects reported, with exception of significantly increased vaginal pain in those undergoing radical diathermy. Residual disease rates were not an outcome measure in the single trial identified.</P>
<P>(9) For haemostatic sutures, there was no evidence that haemostatic sutures were significantly different for the risk of primary haemorrhage or cervical stenosis compared to using no routine sutures or vaginal packing in the two included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristensen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kristensen 1990</LINK>). Use of haemostatic sutures did however increase the risk of secondary haemorrhage, dysmenorrhoea and inadequate follow-up colposcopy.</P>
<P>(10) One trial compared the use of bipolar electrocautery scissors with a monopolar energy scalpel during LLETZ (<LINK REF="STD-Cherchi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cherchi 2002</LINK>). Bipolar electrocautery scissors were associated with a significant reduction in perioperative bleeding and duration of the procedure but no change in the rate of primary haemorrhage.</P>
<P>(11) One trial compared the use of LEEP versus cryotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Chirenje-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chirenje 2001</LINK>). This trial found that women who received the loop electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP) had significantly lower rates of watery discharge and residual disease at 12-month follow up but an increased risk of secondary haemorrhage and offensive discharge. There was no significant difference in the rates of primary haemorrhage, residual disease at six months or peri-operative severe pain.</P>
<P>(12) One trial compared pure cut settings versus blend settings for LLETZ (<LINK REF="STD-Nagar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nagar 2004</LINK>) and found no significant difference in the rates of residual disease between the settings but a reduced depth of thermal artefact at the deep stromal margin in women whose surgeon used a pure cut setting for LLETZ.</P>
<P>(13) Two trials compared LLETZ and needle excision of the transformation zone (NETZ) (<LINK REF="STD-Panoskaltsis-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Panoskaltsis 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadek-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sadek 2000</LINK>) but reported on different outcomes. There was no significant difference between the techniques in terms of perioperative pain, bleeding requiring vaginal packing or cervical stenosis at follow up. LLETZ was associated with a reduction in peri-operative blood loss but an increase in residual disease rates at 36-month follow up. There was no difference in residual disease rates for NETZ compared to knife conisation.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-04-26 11:36:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The incidence of treatment failures following surgical treatment of CIN has been demonstrated by case series reports, as illustrated in the Background section, to be low. The reports from randomised and non-randomised studies suggest that most surgical treatments have around 90% success rate. In these circumstances, several thousand women would have to be treated to demonstrate a significant difference between two techniques. The vast majority of RCTs evaluating the differences in treatment success are grossly underpowered to demonstrate a significant difference between treatment techniques and no real conclusions can be drawn on differences of treatment effect. The largest of these studies recruited 498 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1998</LINK>) and the smallest recruited 40 women (<LINK REF="STD-Cherchi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cherchi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paraskevaidis-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskevaidis 1994</LINK>). It might be the case that if a well-conducted mega-trial was conducted no difference in treatment effect would be demonstrated. The RCTs and meta-analyses have demonstrated some clear differences in morbidity and these should be considered as significant outcomes when deciding upon optimum management.</P>
<P>The trials compare different interventions and report different outcomes, which limits the analyses and means that many outcome measures include only one trial per treatment pairing.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-04-26 11:39:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In total, 29 trials were included in this review. A total of 5441 women participated of whom 4509 were analysed. We have used a pragmatic approach to the RCTs included in the comparisons. Slight variations of surgical technique occur in some of the comparisons, which reflects the differences in clinical practice. If we considered that these differences did not seriously alter the intervention compared with the other interventions in the comparison, then the trial was considered in the same analysis. For example, when we compared laser ablation to cryotherapy, we included trials using single and double freeze techniques.</P>
<P>Many analyses included only one or two randomised trials due to the different outcome measures chosen and reported in the trials. This limits the conclusions which may be drawn from some of the analyses. Furthermore, the method of randomisation in many of the trials was not optimised so that the results might be prone to bias due to inherent methodological flaws in these trials.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-04-26 11:40:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A comprehensive search was performed, including a thorough search of the grey literature, and all studies were sifted and data extracted by at least two review authors working independently. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence available. Hence, we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be the possibility of publication bias. That is, studies that did not find the treatment to be effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility as the analyses were restricted to meta-analyses of a small number of trials or single trials.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-04-26 11:41:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conclusions reflect the previous findings from the original Cochrane review by the authors. Furthermore, a Canadian group published an independent systematic review on the same subject and the findings were the same as the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Nuovo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nuovo 2000</LINK>). The review by <LINK REF="REF-Nuovo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nuovo 2000</LINK> used similar methodologies as the original Cochrane review and used quasi-randomised trials as well as gold standard RCTs within their meta-analyses.</P>
<P>The single RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Dey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dey 2002</LINK> almost demonstrated a significant reduction in treatment failures with LLETZ compared to laser ablation, in contrast to other studies. This trial included HPV testing as well as cytology for screening for treatment failures, which enhances the detection of disease.</P>

<P>The evidence from the 29 RCTs identified suggests that there is no overwhelmingly superior surgical technique for eradicating CIN. Cryotherapy appears to be an effective treatment of low grade disease but not of high grade disease.<BR/>Choice of treatment of ectocervical situated lesions must therefore be based on cost, morbidity and whether excisional treatments provide more reliable biopsy specimens for assessment of disease compared to colposcopic directed specimens taken before ablative therapy. Colposcopic directed biopsies have been shown to under diagnose micro-invasive disease compared with excisional biopsies performed by knife or loop excision, particularly if high grade disease is present (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chappatte-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chappatte 1991</LINK>). However, the accuracy of colposcopic directed biopsies compared to excisional biopsies is not the objective of this review.</P>
<P>Cryotherapy is easy to use, cheap and, as demonstrated, associated with low morbidity. It should be considered a viable alternative for the treatment of low grade disease, particularly where resources are limited.</P>
<P>Laser ablation appears to cause more peri-operative severe pain and perhaps more primary and secondary haemorrhage compared to loop excision. The trials with adequate randomisation methods suggest that there is no difference in residual disease between the two treatments. It could be suggested that LLETZ is superior as equipment is cheaper and it also permits confirmation of disease status by providing an excision biopsy.</P>
<P>Laser conisation takes longer to perform, requires greater operative training and more expensive investment in equipment, produces more peri-operative pain, greater depth and severe thermal artefact than loop excision. Therefore, the use of LLETZ may be preferred rather than laser excision unless the lesion is endocervical. In this situation, a narrow and deep cone biopsy can be performed, reducing tissue trauma and providing a clear resection margin.</P>
<P>Knife cone biopsy still has a place if invasion or glandular disease is suspected. In both diseases adequate resection margins that are free of disease are important for prognosis and management. In such cases, LLETZ or laser conisation can induce thermal artefact so that accurate interpretation of margins is not possible.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-26 11:47:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We would advocate a large multi-centre trial of sufficient power to evaluate whether ablation is as effective as LLETZ in terms of treatment failures. A systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Kyrgiou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kyrgiou 2004</LINK>) of pre-term delivery rates after treatment suggests that there is a higher rate after excisional treatment compared to ablation. The single RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Dey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dey 2002</LINK> suggests that ablation is associated with higher failure rates after treatment. A definitive RCT of ablation compared with LLETZ, to see if the two modalities have similar outcomes, is needed. If one modality has genuinely poorer treatment outcomes, this might influence decision making based on pregnancy outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Restriction to RCTs</HEADING>
<P>We restricted the review to RCTs in the update so quasi-randomised trials included in the original review were excluded.</P>
<P>Other types of surgical interventions for CIN, other than those specified in the protocol were also considered as relevant trials were found. We also compared variations in technique within a single intervention (for example blend versus cut setting for LLETZ, single versus double freeze cryotherapy).</P>
<P>There was an insufficient number of trials in each of the meta analyses to assess reporting biases and carry out sensitivity analysis so the following sections were removed:</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Assessment of reporting biases  </HEADING>
<P>Funnel plots corresponding to meta-analysis of the primary outcome will be examined to assess the potential for small study effects such as publication bias. If these plots suggest that treatment effects may not be sampled from a symmetric distribution, as assumed by the random effects model, further meta-analyses will be performed using a fixed-effect model.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Sensitivity analysis  </HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses will be performed excluding trials which did not report adequate concealment of allocation.</P>
<P>None of the trials imputed missing data. Although some of the outcomes that we specified were not reported in included trials, we did not contact trial authors as all trials reported over five years ago and most significantly longer. We removed the following text from the 'dealing with missing data' section:</P>

<B>LEEP: </B>For each loop procedure the cervix was injected with 4 ml of 1% lignocaine with 1:100 000 epinephrine 1&#8211;2 mm beneath the cervical surface epithelium at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o&#8217;clock positions. We used a large speculum adapted for smoke evacuation and a 2×2 cm electrode was used for large lesions and 1×1 cm electrode for the smaller lesions. The electrosurgical generator (Surgitron Ellman International, New York, USA) was operated using the cutting mode recommended by the manufacturer.</P>
<P>
<B>Cryotherapy: </B>The PCG-R Portable Cryosurgical Gun (Spembly Medical Ltd, UK) was used for cryotherapy. A large speculum was placed into the vagina and after the lesion was identified by colposcopy an appropriate-sized<BR/>probe to cover lesion and transformation zone was selected. A lubricant (KY jelly, Johnson and Johnson, South Africa) was applied to the probe before treatment of the cervix. The cervix was treated for 2 minutes, thawed and treated again for 2 minutes to allow an ice ball to form across the lesion and transformation zone.</P>

<P>Laser conisation: performed using a CO2 laser (A: Sharplan Model 733A, B: Sharplan model 1050, Laser Industries Ltd) attached to the colposcope. The laser energy was delivered in continuous (A) or pulsatile pulse mode (B) using power densities ranging from 3000&#8211;5500 W/cm². After removal of the tissue a defocused beam coagulated the cervical lesion</P>
<P>Diathermy loop conisation: this was done without simultaneous colposcopic guidance. The excision zone and depth was determined by the colposcopic description in the patients record, whether atypical cytology and/or histology was present in samples from the exocervix, the endocervix, or both, and guided by application of acetic acid solution and Schiller&#8217;s iodine. The size and shape of the diathermy loop (Niko-Med) were chosen among three (wideXdeep: 10X5 mm, 15X7 mm, or 20X9 mm) to excise the lesion in a single sweep. Larger lesions required excision in two or three sections. A Davol model 2000 BP II(A) or 2000(B) (Electro Medical Systems) electrosurgical generator supplied the diathermy power. A combination of cutting and coagulation was used for excision. The power setting was adjusted according to the size of the loop and the cone. Hemostasis was achieved by ball diathermy</P>
