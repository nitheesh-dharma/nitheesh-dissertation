<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-14 16:16:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pneumonia is a major cause of mortality in children under five years of age. Treatment of pneumonia requires the use of an effective antibiotic in adequate doses for an appropriate duration. In most cases, treatment ranges between 7 and 14 days, but this is not based on any empirical evidence. Shorter duration of therapy, if found to be effective, would not only be beneficial in resource-poor settings but also result in improved adherence to therapy and reduced resistance to antibiotics and adverse effects. This review of four studies involving 6177 children found that a short course (three days) of antibiotic therapy is equally as effective as a longer treatment (five days) for non-severe pneumonia. We also found that different durations of either amoxicillin or cotrimoxazole give similar results in terms of clinical cure, failure of the treatment and rate of relapse.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-02-03 14:03:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Gaston-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaston 2002</LINK>). Pneumonia can be caused by organisms such as bacteria and viruses. In children, the organisms which cause pneumonia vary with the age of the child (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 2006</LINK>). Group B streptococcus and gram-negative enteric bacteria are the most common pathogens in neonates (from birth to 20 days after birth), whereas in infants aged between three weeks and three months <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae)</I> is the most common pathogen. In infants older than four months and in preschool-aged children viruses are a frequent cause and <I>S. pneumoniae</I> is the most common bacterial pathogen (<LINK REF="REF-Ostapchuk-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostapchuk 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinianiotis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinianiotis 2005</LINK>). <I>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) </I>and <I>Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae)</I>, including non-typable, are also common causes of childhood pneumonia in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are among the leading causes of mortality in children under five years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Bryce-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryce 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudan 2008</LINK>); they account for nearly two million deaths each year with most of the deaths occurring in low-income countries. Pneumonia is the largest killer, accounting for 19% of all child deaths in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Bryce-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryce 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudan 2008</LINK>). Interventions that affect mortality due to pneumonia are therefore of great importance in an effort to improve child survival.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-02-15 21:55:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Definitions of pneumonia vary widely. Some require evidence of the presence of infiltrates on a chest radiograph, whereas others require certain respiratory signs or symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 2002</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined pneumonia solely on the basis of clinical findings obtained by visual inspection and setting respiratory rate cut-offs (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1981</LINK>). According to the WHO guideline, a respiratory rate of &gt; 50 per minute in infants aged two to 11 months and a respiratory rate of &gt; 40 per minute in children younger than 12 to 59 months with no lower chest in-drawing, suggests non-severe pneumonia; while a respiratory rate of &gt; 50 per minute in infants aged two to 11 months and a respiratory rate of &gt; 40 per minute in children younger than 12 to 59 months plus lower chest in-drawing indicates severe pneumonia. Indicators for severe pneumonia plus convulsions, abnormal sleep and difficulty in waking up, stridor in a calm child and inability to drink, indicate very severe pneumonia. To reduce the number of people dying from pneumonia, the WHO developed standard guidelines for the management of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>). These guidelines were developed using evidence from studies on aetiology, clinical aspects and susceptibility (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>). As <I>S. pneumoniae</I> and <I>H. influenzae</I> are the most common causes of childhood pneumonia in low-income countries, the WHO recommends using oral cotrimoxazole or amoxicillin as first-line drugs for treatment of non-severe CAP at first-level health facilities (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>). These guidelines have effectively reduced death from pneumonia in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Sazawal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sazawal 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-09-14 09:55:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment of CAP requires the use of an effective antibiotic given in adequate doses and for an appropriate duration. Recommendations for antibiotic therapy for CAP are based, in general, on aetiological diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Prober-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prober 2000</LINK>). Identification of the causative organism in routine clinical care is rare and is not usually attempted. Because of these diagnostic problems empirical antibiotic therapy is the commonly accepted practice worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 2002</LINK>). In most cases the duration of treatment ranges between 7 and 14 days, but this is not based on any empirical evidence. Rather this treatment duration seems to be the result of initial treatment studies of tonsillo-pharyngitis, which was treated for 10 to 14 days (<LINK REF="REF-Pichichero-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pichichero 2000</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-02-15 22:39:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Optimum duration of therapy for CAP is especially important in resource-poor settings where there is a high risk of death, poor access to medicines and health care, and limited budgets for medicines (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1995</LINK>). Important aspects of a shorter course of antibiotic therapy, if found to be effective and without an increase in morbidity and mortality, include improved adherence to therapy, reduced antimicrobial resistance and lowered cost.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 22:19:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pneumonia in children under five years of age accounts for the highest number of deaths in low-income countries. This review addressed an important aspect of treatment, which is the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy. Short durations of antibiotic therapy have been found to be effective in upper respiratory tract infections (<LINK REF="REF-Pichichero-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pichichero 2000</LINK>). Evidence for efficacy in acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) is limited. Effective shortened durations of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) would be especially beneficial for low-income countries and resource-poor settings as it would lead to a reduction in the overall cost of treatment, improved compliance and tolerance of treatment and reduced antimicrobial resistance. We found only four studies evaluating the efficacy of short-course versus long-course therapy using the same antibiotic for non-severe CAP in children under five years of age, and these were all from low-income countries such as Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the Philippines. All the included studies evaluated the same durations of short and long courses of therapy, which were three days versus five days. Analysis showed that treatment with an oral antibiotic for either three days or five days was equally efficacious in treating non-severe CAP in children. Three days of treatment failed to show significant differences in clinical cure, treatment failure or relapse rates compared to five days of treatment with the same antibiotic. There was no significant heterogeneity among the included studies but we undertook subgroup analyses to evaluate the impact of the use of different antibiotics in the treatment of non-severe pneumonia. Subgroup analyses also showed that a short course versus a long course of either oral amoxicillin or cotrimoxazole was equally effective in terms of clinical cure, treatment failure and relapse rates.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-09-14 20:51:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These findings are very important but they should be interpreted with caution as they are limited by the small number of studies available on the topic. Although only four studies were included in this analyses, all included studies had a good number of participants contributing to its results. The impact of a short duration of antibiotic therapy on other secondary outcomes, that is, mortality at one month and additional interventions used, could not be assessed in this review due to the non-availability of data.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-02-15 22:49:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) definition of CAP focuses on the clinical findings and respiratory cut-offs. This simplified syndromic diagnosis of childhood CAP poses a challenge in the accurate diagnosis of CAP cases as shown by a study conducted in Pakistan. This study (<LINK REF="REF-Hazir-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazir 2006</LINK>) showed that only 14% of children diagnosed with pneumonia by the WHO criteria had radiological evidence of pneumonia. These findings have also been supported by other community-based studies in Pakistan (<LINK REF="REF-Nizami-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nizami 2005</LINK>). This raises concerns as to the robustness of the clinical criteria being used for pneumonia diagnosis. Also, once diagnosed with non-severe CAP, children are treated with oral cotrimoxazole or amoxicillin and are followed up at home after 48 hours. Identification of the true cause (bacterial or viral) of CAP is limited and in such a scenario treatment of a non-bacterial CAP with inexpensive antibacterial agents therefore significantly increases the risk of development of antimicrobial resistance. This poses a significant public health problem and needs attention in the form of modification of clinical diagnostic criteria and management guidelines.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-02-15 22:21:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no significant differences between three and five days of the same antibiotics for non-severe pneumonia. A recent study from India (<LINK REF="REF-Awasthi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awasthi 2008</LINK>) compared three days of oral amoxicillin with placebo in 1671 children aged 2 to 59 months with non-severe pneumonia who also had a wheeze. The investigators of this trial used WHO criteria and found that placebo treatment was associated with clinical failure (odds ratio (OR) 1.28; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.62) and they concluded that three days of oral antibiotics should be the current treatment standard for patients with non-severe pneumonia in low-income countries.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-09-13 20:44:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Evidence provided in this review suggests that a short-course (three days) of antibiotic therapy is equally as effective as a longer treatment (five days) for non-severe CAP in children under five years of age. No difference was found in terms of clinical cure rates at the end of treatment, rates of treatment failure or relapse rates within seven days of clinical cure, with the different durations of antibiotic therapy. Therefore a shorter course of antibiotic therapy should benefit both the individual, family and the public.</P>

<P>We limited searches to human studies and there were no language or publication restrictions. We also searched the related conference proceedings for relevant abstracts. We contacted organisations and researchers in the field and pharmaceutical companies for information on unpublished and ongoing trials. We also checked the reference lists of all trials identified by the above methods.</P>
