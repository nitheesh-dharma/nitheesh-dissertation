<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-06 12:42:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects thinking and perception. It often develops in early adult-hood and can have a lifelong impact on not only the mental well-being of the sufferer, but their social and general functioning. Worldwide around 15 people per 100,000 are diagnosed with schizophrenia every year. The mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs.</P>
<P>Antipsychotics are usually given as tablets by mouth (orally). However, people with mental illness often have difficulties with accepting medication (compliance). Their illness affects their thinking, which can erode their understanding of their illness and they often do not see the need for treatment. Taking antipsychotics can also have unpleasant side effects. Oral medication requires regular self-administration otherwise effectiveness is reduced and the risk of relapse is high.</P>
<P>A solution to poor compliance is depot medication where medication is given by injection and is slowly released over a period of weeks. For people with schizophrenia it was hoped to be able to maintain care in the community with regular injections administered by community psychiatric nurses. Initial enthusiasm and the favourable results of clinical trials gave rise to the extensive use of depots as a means of long-term treatment. Flupenthixol decanoate is one of the most widely used depot antipsychotics in the UK.</P>
<P>This review looks at the effectiveness of depot flupenthixol decanoate in comparison with no active treatment (placebo), oral antipsychotics and other depot preparations for people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses. An electronic search for relevant trials was carried out in 2013. Fifteen trials with 626 participants could be included. All evidence from these trials was rated by the authors to be <I>low</I> or <I>very low quality.</I> Currently, from the data reported, there is nothing to choose between depot flupenthixol decanoate and other depot or oral antipsychotics. There was some evidence that it would be understandable to offer a standard dose rather than the high dose depot flupenthixol as there is no difference in relapse. Overall, this review highlights the lack of evidence based information available for the review question and the need for large, well-designed and reported randomised clinical trials to address the medical, social, personal and economic effects of flupenthixol decanoate.</P>

<P>We identified relevant trials by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register in March 2009 and then for this update version, a search was run in April 2013. The register is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies and authors of trials for additional information.</P>

<P>Review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. For dichotomous data we estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. We summated normal continuous data using mean difference (MD), and 95% CIs using a fixed-effect model. We presented scale data only for those tools that had attained prespecified levels of quality. Using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) we created 'Summary of findings tables and assessed risk of bias for included studies.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-06 12:42:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review currently includes 15 randomised controlled trials with 626 participants. No trials compared flupenthixol decanoate with placebo.</P>
<P>One small study compared flupenthixol decanoate with an oral antipsychotic (penfluridol). Only two outcomes were reported with this single study, and it demonstrated no clear differences between the two preparations as regards leaving the study early (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 3.00, CI 0.33 to 27.23,<I> very low quality evidence</I>) and requiring anticholinergic medication (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.19, CI 0.77 to 1.83, <I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Ten studies in total compared flupenthixol decanoate with other depot preparations, though not all studies reported on all outcomes of interest. There were no significant differences between depots for outcomes such as relapse at medium term (n = 221, 5 RCTs, RR 1.30, CI 0.87 to 1.93, <I>low quality evidence</I>), and no clinical improvement at short term (n = 36, 1 RCT, RR 0.67, CI 0.36 to 1.23, <I>low quality evidence</I>). There was no difference in numbers of participants leaving the study early at short/medium term (n = 161, 4 RCTs, RR 1.23, CI 0.76 to 1.99, <I>low quality evidence</I>) nor with numbers of people requiring anticholinergic medication at short/medium term (n = 102, 3 RCTs, RR 1.38, CI 0.75 to 2.25, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Three studies in total compared high doses (100 to 200 mg) of flupenthixol decanoate with the standard doses (~40mg) per injection. Two trials found relapse at medium term (n = 18, 1 RCT, RR 1.00, CI 0.27 to 3.69, <I>low quality evidence</I>) to be similar between the groups. However people receiving a high dose had slightly more favourable medium term mental state results on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (n = 18, 1 RCT, MD -10.44, CI -18.70 to -2.18, <I>low quality evidence</I>). There was also no significant difference in the use of anticholinergic medications to deal with side effects at short term (2 RCTs n = 47,<I> </I>RR<I> </I>1.12, CI 0.83 to 1.52 <I>very low quality evidence</I>). One trial comparing a very low dose of flupenthixol decanoate (~6 mg) with a low dose (~9 mg) per injection reported no difference in relapse rates (n = 59, 1 RCT, RR 0.34, CI 0.10 to 1.15, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>

<P>In the current state of evidence, there is nothing to choose between flupenthixol decanoate and other depot antipsychotics.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-05-06 12:42:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When using strict criteria, about one in 10,000 people per year are diagnosed with schizophrenia, with a lifetime prevalence of about 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Jablensky-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablensky 1992</LINK>). The schizophrenic disorders are characterised in general by fundamental and characteristic distortions of thinking and perception, and by inappropriate and blunted affect (International Classification of Diseases, ICD-10, WHO). The illness often runs a chronic course with acute exacerbations and often partial remissions. The risk of death from all causes is 1.6 fold in patients with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1998</LINK>). In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, mental illness and behavioural disorders accounted for 7.4% of all DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), and were attributable to more than 15 million DALYs each; schizophrenia ranked as fifth under this category (accounting for 0.6%) after depression, anxiety, drug-use and alcohol-use disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2012</LINK>). Disabilities experienced by people with schizophrenia are only partly due to recurrent episodes or continuing symptoms. Other factors that play a part are unpleasant side effects of treatment, social adversity and isolation, poverty and homelessness. Continuing prejudice, stigma and social exclusion associated with the diagnosis continue to play a major part (<LINK REF="REF-Sartorius-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sartorius 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thornicroft-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornicroft 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Experiencing a relapse of schizophrenia often lowers a person's level of social functioning and quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Curson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Curson 1985</LINK>). Prevention of such episodes is therefore crucial from a clinical point of view as well as having enormous financial implications. For example, within the UK, a Department of Health burden of disease analysis indicated that schizophrenia accounted for 5.4% of all National Health Service inpatient expenditure, placing it behind only learning disability and stroke in magnitude (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1996</LINK>). The total societal cost of schizophrenia has been estimated at £6.7 billion (in 2004/2005 prices) in England (<LINK REF="REF-Mangalore-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangalore 2007</LINK>). Inpatient care accounted for 56.5% of the total treatment and care costs of schizophrenia, compared with 2.5% for outpatient care and 14.7% for day care (<LINK REF="REF-Knapp-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knapp 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-06 16:15:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia are antipsychotic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Dencker-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dencker 1980</LINK>). Also called neuroleptics, they are generally regarded as highly effective, especially in controlling such symptoms as hallucinations and fixed false beliefs (delusions) (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1986</LINK>). They also seem to reduce the risk of acute relapse. A systematic review suggested that, for those with serious mental illness, stopping antipsychotic drugs resulted in 64% of people relapsing within a year compared with 27% of those who were still on medication within the same time period (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2012</LINK>). Problems with adherence to treatment are common throughout medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1979</LINK>). Those who suffer from long-term illnesses where treatments may have uncomfortable side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1998</LINK>), cognitive impairments (<LINK REF="REF-David-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1994</LINK>) and erosion of insight may be especially prone to be unreliable at taking medication.</P>
<P>Depot antipsychotic injections, developed in the 1960s, mainly consist of an ester of the active drug held in an oily suspension. This is injected intramuscularly and released into the body slowly so may only need to be given every one to six weeks. It was hoped to be able to maintain people in the community with regular injections administered by community psychiatric nurses, sometimes in clinics set up for this purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1994</LINK>). Initial enthusiasm and the favourable results of clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 1973</LINK>) gave rise to the extensive use of depots as a means of long-term maintenance treatment.</P>
<P>Flupentixol is a neuroleptic of the thioxanthene group. It exists in two geometric isomers, the cis(Z) and trans(E) forms of which only the cis(Z)-flupenthixol is pharmacologically active. Flupenthixol decanoate is produced by esterification of cis(Z)-flupentixol with decanoic acid. Depot ampoules/vials for injection have flupenthixol decanoate dissolved in thin vegetable oil.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-05-06 12:42:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Flupenthixol decanoate is usually given intramuscularly every two to four weeks. It is slowly released from the depot site, with a half-life of three to eight days (<LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1980</LINK>). The decanoate ester is then rapidly hydrolysed intracellularly to release the active cis(Z)-flupenthixol, with only traces of decanoate remaining in the bloodstream (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1971</LINK>). The serum T(max) for intramuscular flupenthixol decanoate is three to five days (<LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1980</LINK>). Flupenthixol has no active metabolites (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1978a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1978a</LINK>). Steady state is reached in about three months of administration (<LINK REF="REF-Saikia-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saikia 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Flupenthixol antagonizes dopamine binding primarily at D1, D2, D3 and with less affinity at<SUP> </SUP>D4 receptors; it also affects serotonin binding at 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> and<SUP> </SUP>5-HT<SUB>2C</SUB> receptors as well as noradrenaline binding at 1-adrenergic<SUP> </SUP>receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Glaser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glaser 1998</LINK>). Flupenthixol is a powerful antagonist of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors, though it is no more potent a neuroleptic than other agents (e.g. haloperidol), which are D2 antagonists only (<LINK REF="STD-Ehmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ehmann 1987</LINK>). It blocks prolactin inhibitory factor (PIF), resulting in an increase in pituitary prolactin secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Fielding-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fielding 1978</LINK>). Flupentixol has no affinity for cholinergic muscarine receptors, only slight antihistaminergic properties and no alpha2 adrenoreceptor blocking properties. The pharmacological profile of flupenthixol has definite similarities to atypical antipsychotics and can be described as at least partially atypical (<LINK REF="REF-Arnt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bandelow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandelow 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glaser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glaser 1998</LINK>). Flupenthixol is also said to resemble tricyclic antidepressants in some of its actions, though not in anticholinergic activity (<LINK REF="REF-Kato-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kato 1969</LINK>).

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-05-06 12:42:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antipsychotic drugs are usually given orally (<LINK REF="REF-Aaes_x002d_Jorgenson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaes-Jorgenson 1985</LINK>), but compliance with medication given by this route is likely to be poor and, certainly, is difficult to quantify. Since development in the 1960s, depot antipsychotics have been used in maintenance treatment for people with schizophrenia for whom relapse prevention is indicated. Since the introduction of atypical antipsychotics, there has been a fall in the use of depot medications, as only one atypical antipsychotic medication (risperidone) was available in depot form. But non-adherence to oral antipsychotic medications continues to be a major problem. In the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials for Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study, which ran for 18 months, 74% of patients discontinued antipsychotic medications prematurely (<LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 2005</LINK>). Olanzapine, risperidone and paliperidone in their depot forms (olanzapine pamoate, risperdal consta and paliperidone palmitate respectively) have been available. The NICE Guideline on schizophrenia (March 2009), in its 'promoting recovery' section promotes the use of depot antipsychotics after an acute episode if acceptable to the patient and to avoid covert non-adherence (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-Guideline_x003a_CGS-82-Schizophrenia-_x0028_update_x0029_-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE Guideline:CGS 82 Schizophrenia (update) 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Flupenthixol in its depot form has been extensively used for maintenance and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Individuals are reported to show an improvement in mood when used in maintenance treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Carney-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carney 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 1980</LINK>) and also in treatment of relapses (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1983</LINK>). Flupenthixol decanoate has shown to have better tolerance and less side effects as compared to fluphenazine decanoate (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1983</LINK>). These might be due to the 'partial atypical' properties of flupenthixol and also resembling tricyclic antidepressants in some of its actions. At four-weekly doses, flupenthixol decanoate could not keep psychotic symptoms in check as compared to haloperidol decanoate nor was there any conclusive evidence of anti-depressant properties, and the authors have commented that two-weekly dosing might be more appropriate (<LINK REF="STD-Eberhard-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhard 1986</LINK>). A 12-month prospective comparison of standard dose verus half dose flupenthixol decanoate for maintenance treatment indicated that a dose reduction had increased relapse significantly (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Flupenthixol decanoate is one of the most widely used depots in the UK. It is worth investigating the effects of flupenthixol decanoate in comparison with other antipsychotic medications with regards to clinical and non-clinical outcomes for the benefits of clinicians, patients and managers/policy makers alike.</P>

Where a trial was described as 'double-blind', but it was only implied that the study was randomised, we included these trials in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>) when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then we included these in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, we only used clearly randomised trials and described the results of the sensitivity analysis in the text. We excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week. Randomised cross-over studies were included in this review but we only used data up to the point of the first cross-over because of the instability of the problem behaviours and the likely carry-over effects of all treatments.</P>

For outcome instruments some minimum standards had to be set. They were that the instrument: i. should have its psychometric properties described in a peer-reviewed journal, specially for rating scales (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); ii. should not be written or modified by one of the trialists; iii. should be either a self-report, or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist); and, finally iv. should be a global assessment of an area of functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1998</LINK>).<BR/>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-05-06 12:42:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Data types</HEADING>
<P>Outcomes were assessed using continuous (for example changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (for example, one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such as 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change'), or dichotomous (for example, either 'no important changes or 'important change' in a person's behaviour) measures. Currently RevMan does not support categorical data so we were unable to analyse these.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. When the overall results were significant we calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and the number-needed-to-harm (NNTH) as the inverse of the risk difference. Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
<P>We carried out an intention-to-treat analysis. Data were presented on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis. Those who were lost to follow-up were all assumed to have the negative outcome, with the exception of the outcome of death. For example, for the outcome of relapse, those who were lost to follow-up were all assumed to have relapsed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>The meta-analytic formulae applied by RevMan Analyses (the statistical programme included in RevMan) require a normal distribution of data. The software is robust towards some skew, but to which degree of skewness meta-analytic calculations can still be reliably carried out is unclear. On the other hand, excluding all studies on the basis of estimates of the normal distribution of the data also leads to a bias, because a considerable amount of data may be lost leading to a selection bias. Therefore, we included all studies in the primary analysis. In a sensitivity analysis we excluded potentially skewed data applying the following rules:<BR/>
<BR/>a) When a scale started from the finite number zero the standard deviation (SD), when multiplied by two, was more than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>).<BR/>b) If a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210), the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score.<BR/>c) In large studies (as a cut-off we used 200 participants), skewed data pose less of a problem. In these cases we entered the data in a synthesis.<BR/>d) The rules explained in a) and b) do not apply to change data. The reasons is that when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values, it is difficult to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. This is also the case for change data (endpoint minus baseline). We preferred to use scale endpoint data, which typically cannot have negative values and is easier to interpret from a clinical point of view. Change data are often not ordinal and are very problematic to interpret. If endpoint data were unavailable, we used change data. We combined both endpoint data and change data in the analysis, because there is no principal statistical reason why endpoint and change data should measure different effects (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants were entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and thus were entered into syntheses.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes we estimated a mean difference (MD) between groups based on the fixed-effect model. When standard errors (SEs) instead of standard deviations (SDs) were presented, we converted the former to SDs. If both were missing we estimated SDs from P values or used the average SD of the other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). We did not include any cluster-randomised studies in this review. In future updates of this review, if we include cluster-randomised studies we will use the following methods.</P>
<P>Where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies, we will present data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. We will attempt to contact the first authors of studies to obtain the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) of their clustered data and adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non cluster-randomised study, but adjust for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported, it will be assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia, we have only used data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in section 10 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We had planned not to use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes.There were no meta-analyses with 10 or more studies providing data, therefore no funnel plots were constructed.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-05-06 12:42:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where possible we employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This does seem true to us, however, random-effects does put added weight onto the smaller of the studies - those trials that are most vulnerable to bias. For this reason we favour using fixed-effect models employing random-effects only when investigating heterogeneity.</P>

<P>If data were clearly heterogeneous we checked that data were correctly extracted and entered and that we had made no unit-of-analysis errors. If the high levels of heterogeneity remained we did not undertake a meta-analysis at this point for if there is considerable variation in results, and particularly if there is inconsistency in the direction of effect, it may be misleading to quote an average value for the intervention effect. We would have wanted to explore heterogeneity. We did not pre-specify any characteristics of studies that may be associated with heterogeneity except the quality of trial method. If no clear association could be shown by sorting studies by quality of methods a random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Should another characteristic of the studies be highlighted by the investigation of heterogeneity, perhaps some clinical heterogeneity not hitherto predicted but plausible causes of heterogeneity, these post-hoc reasons will be discussed and the data analysed and presented. However, had the estimate of the effect size have been substantially unaffected by use of a random-effects model, and no other reasons for the heterogeneity were clear, the final data were presented without a meta-analysis.</P>

<P>Fifteen studies with 626 participants met the inclusion criteria. All included studies stated that they were randomised (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We have excluded <LINK REF="STD-Dencker-1980a" TYPE="STUDY">Dencker 1980a</LINK> from this review update, which was included in the original publication. This study was mistakenly included, and it was discovered during the course of this update that it compared flupenthixol palmitate, as opposed to flupenthixol decanoate. We identified one new study from our update search to include in this update (<LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK>). Therefore, there are still 15 included studies.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Participants</HEADING>
<P>All participants were diagnosed with schizophrenia or some other similar psychotic disorder. Four studies included participants with operationalised diagnoses according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III) (<LINK REF="STD-Eberhard-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhard 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Javed-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lundin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martyns-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Martyns 1993</LINK>) and two studies according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) (<LINK REF="STD-Cookson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cookson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK>). Four studies used the Fieghner's criteria to include participants (<LINK REF="STD-Cookson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Cookson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cookson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cookson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1979" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1979</LINK>). One study used the Bleuler's criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1983</LINK>) and one study used Schneider's first rank symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1977</LINK>). Three studies had no clearly operationalised criteria, but the patients were being treated for chronic schizophrenia already (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1982</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Steinert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Steinert 1986</LINK>) used the operational definition of schizophrenia by <LINK REF="REF-Priest-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Priest 1977</LINK>.</P>
<P>Most studies included people of both sexes although three randomised only men (<LINK REF="STD-Cookson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Cookson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martyns-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Martyns 1993</LINK>), and one only women (<LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1979" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1979</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Overall, the trialists used depot antipsychotics in a wide range of doses. Mean doses of flupenthixol decanoate ranged from 6 mg to 200 mg. The frequency of administration ranged from every two weeks to every four weeks. No trial compared the depot formulation with placebo. Only one study compared flupenthixol decanoate with an oral antipsychotic, penfluridol (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 1975</LINK>). Four studies compared different dosages of flupenthixol decanoate (<LINK REF="STD-Cookson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Cookson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cookson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cookson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1979" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1979</LINK>). Ten studies compared depot flupenthixol with other depots - haloperidol decanoate (<LINK REF="STD-Eberhard-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhard 1986</LINK>), fluphenazine decanoate (<LINK REF="STD-Javed-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lundin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1983</LINK>), clopenthixol decanoate (<LINK REF="STD-Martyns-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Martyns 1993</LINK>), pipotiazine palmitate (<LINK REF="STD-Steinert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Steinert 1986</LINK>), and perphenazine enanthate (<LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Mental state</HEADING>
<P>Several scales were used in the trials to measure mental state. If possible we used binary data from these measures, but the validity of dichotomising from these measures, although widely accepted, is nevertheless unclear. Some mental state data were not provided or unusable in many studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cookson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Cookson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Javed-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lundin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martyns-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Martyns 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1979" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Steinert 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1983</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Global outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Though six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Javed-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lundin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martyns-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Martyns 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1983</LINK>) used scales for global assessment, no study provided usable data for this. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Martyns-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Martyns 1993</LINK>) reported on global impression of trialists as regards treatment outcome of clinical improvement. <LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK> provided usable data for global state on a five-point scale from symptom free to worsening which we analysed as 'at least minimally better' and 'at least clearly better'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Four studies provided usable data on adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Javed-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martyns-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Martyns 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1983</LINK>). Six studies indicated the need for the use of anticholinergic medications in the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cookson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Cookson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eberhard-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhard 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1979" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1982</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Not one study evaluated hospital/service outcomes, satisfaction with care and economic outcomes. Trialists used a variety of scales, which are listed below.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">5. Global functioning</HEADING>
<P>1. Clinical Global Impression Scale - CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>A rating instrument commonly used in studies on schizophrenia that enables clinicians to quantify severity of illness and overall clinical improvement during therapy by comparing the conditions of the person standardised against other people with the same diagnosis. The CGI consists of two scales: a state scale and an improvement scale. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores showing decreased severity and/or overall improvement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">5. Mental state</HEADING>
<P>5.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>A brief rating scale used to assess the severity of a range of psychiatric symptoms, including psychotic symptoms. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Each item is defined on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from zero to six or one to seven. Scores can range from zero to 126 with high scores indicating more severe symptoms.</P>
<P>5.2 Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale - CPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Asberg-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asberg 1978</LINK>)<BR/>A four-point scale is used by the participant to rate 40 items, and 25 items are rated using the same scale. Global rating of the illness is an additional item also rated using this scale. Assumed reliability of the rating is scored as zero (very poor), one (fair), two (good) or three (very good).</P>
<P>5.3 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - HDRS (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>)<BR/>This instrument is designed to be used only on patients already diagnosed as suffering from affective disorder of depressive type. It is used for quantifying the results of an interview, and its value depends entirely on the skill of the interviewer in eliciting the necessary information. The scale contains 17 variables measured on either a five- or a three-point rating scale, the latter being used where quantification of the variable is either difficult or impossible. Among the variables are: depressed mood, suicide, work and loss of interest, retardation, agitation, gastro-intestinal symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of insight, and loss of weight. It is useful to have two raters independently scoring a patient at the same interview. The scores of the patient are obtained by summing the scores of the two physicians. High scores indicate greater severity of depressive symptoms.</P>
<P>5.4 Krawiecka Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Krawiecka-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krawiecka 1977</LINK>)<BR/>This mental state scale encompasses both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It is used to evaluate the mental state and behaviour in chronic psychotic people with higher scores indicating greater severity. It is also known as the Manchester Scale.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6. Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>1. Nurses Observational Scale of Inpatients Evaluation - NOSIE (<LINK REF="REF-Honigfeld-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honigfeld 1962</LINK>)<BR/>This 80-item scale allows ratings from zero to four (zero - never present, four - continually present). Ratings are taken from behaviour over the previous three days. The seven headings are social competence, social interest, personal neatness, co-operation, irritability, manifest psychosis and finally, psychotic depression. Scoring ranges from zero to 320.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">7. Adverse effects scales</HEADING>
<P>7.1 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Side Effects Scale - AIMS (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This is a 12-item scale designed to record the occurrence of dyskinetic movements. Ten items of this scale have been used to assess tardive dyskinesia, a long-term drug-induced movement disorder. A five-point scoring system (from zero - none to four - severe) has been used to rate each of the 10 items. This scale may also be helpful in assessing some short-term abnormal movement disorders. A low score indicates low levels of dyskinetic movements.</P>
<P>7.2 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - ESRS (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1980</LINK>)<BR/>This consists of a questionnaire relating to parkinsonian symptoms (nine items), a physician's examination for parkinsonism and dyskinetic movements (eight items), and a clinical global impression of tardive dyskinesia. High scores indicate severe levels of movement disorder.</P>
<P>7.3 Simpson and Angus Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>)<BR/>A standard physical examination which measures parkinsonism. This scale comprises of a 10-item rating scale, each item rated on a five-point scale with zero meaning the complete absence of condition and four meaning the presence of condition in extreme. The total score is obtained by adding the items and dividing by 10.</P>

<P>All studies included in this review stated that they were randomised. Most of the studies gave no information on the process of sequence generation. Only in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1987</LINK>) was allocation to groups on the basis of sealed computer randomisation. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Eberhard-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhard 1986</LINK>) stated that randomisation was in blocks of six, but did not specify exactly how the allocation was undertaken. There is no description of allocation concealment in 12 studies. One study (<LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1979" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1979</LINK>) stated that codes were used for concealment. In the study <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1977</LINK>, the key to allocation concealment was unknown to the raters. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Pinto-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 1979</LINK>) indicated that rating clinicians were unaware of treatment allocation. As poor reporting of randomisation and allocation concealment has consistently been associated with an overestimate of effect, in all but one study was allocation concealment rated as 'unclear' or quality 'B'. The results in these trials are likely to be a 30% to 40% overestimate of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Thirteen studies stated themselves to be 'double blind' but most discussed blinding of assessors and personnel only. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1977</LINK>) did not discuss blinding. <LINK REF="STD-Martyns-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Martyns 1993</LINK>, described blinding as the nurse administering the depot was blind to assessments and the assessment team was blind to the drug administered. Testing of blinding was discussed by only one study (<LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1979" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1979</LINK>) but only for outcome assessors and study personnel. Failing to test double blinding may cast doubt on the quality of trial data. Scale data, which was often measured in the included studies, may be prone to bias when unblinding has taken place.

This gives rise to the possibility of 'within-study publication bias' affecting results of these studies. It is possible that statistically significant differences between groups are more likely to be reported that non-significant differences. Also many of the trials presented their findings in graphs or by P values alone. Graphical presentation alone made it impossible to acquire raw data for synthesis. Requests for raw data from authors have so far failed to obtain the data. It was also common to use P values as a measure of association between intervention and outcomes instead of showing the strength of the association.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Missing outcomes</HEADING>
<P>No study compared flupenthixol decanoate with placebo. This may be a function of the impression that placebo-controlled studies of depot medications would not be ethical. The argument for this would be stronger if well-conducted systematic reviews of the value of oral flupenthixol versus placebo were available. That no study directly reported hospital/service outcomes, participants' overall satisfaction, or economic data is unfortunate. This omission may be, in part, a function of the evolution of schizophrenia trials, with measures of satisfaction and economic outcomes being more prevalent in the closing years of the 20th century.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">COMPARISON 1. FLUPENTHIXOL DECANOATE versus ORAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 1975</LINK>) with a small number of participants (n = 56) fell into this comparison. No relapse or mental state data were reported in this study that compared flupenthixol decanoate with an oral antipsychotic, penfluridol (usually given once a week, compared with flupenthixol decanoate, which is usually given bi-weekly). If it could have been demonstrated that fewer relapses occur when individuals are given depots, this would support the argument that depots improve compliance and prevent covert non-compliance. There are no data to support this within this review. The numbers within this study are small and therefore even a clear difference between treatments would not have shown up.</P>
<P>This study found no significant difference between groups for attrition. It also found no greater need for anticholinergic drugs in the depot flupenthixol decanoate group when compared with oral penfluridol. The use of anticholinergic medication is considered to be a direct reflection of the incidence of extrapyramidal side effects. It is, however, difficult to draw any firm conclusions from these limited data.</P>

<P>Binary measures show no significant difference in relapse rates between flupenthixol decanoate and other depots (haloperidol decanoate,fluphenazine decanoate, pipotiazine palmitate). The results from longer-term studies add heterogeneity to the overall result, but as far as the data go, there is no clear evidence that flupenthixol decanoate is superior or inferior to other preparations. Continuous mental state scores, measuring change on two different scales, and providing data that are displayed despite having a high chance of being skewed, add little.</P>

A trial of 32 (<LINK REF="STD-Eufe-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Eufe 1979</LINK>) participants found improvement in favour of perphenazine enanthate as compared to flupenthixol decanoate over 12 weeks.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 Leaving the study early</HEADING>
<P>Six trials, in which 257 people were randomised to flupenthixol decanoate or other depots had, in total, 26.07% attrition. There was no clear benefit of using flupenthixol decanoate as opposed to other depot antipsychotics in the short, medium or long term.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.4 Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Studies that reported side effects between flupenthixol decanoate versus other depot antipsychotic drugs found a difference in 'general side effects' and general movement disorders in favour of flupenthixol decanoate. It is unfortunate that trialists did not explain what they meant by 'general side effects' explicitly. Flupenthixol decanoate may produce fewer side effects than other depot comparisons, although these data are obtained from two small trials. Having said that, people taking flupenthixol decanoate require anticholinergic drugs as frequently as those on other depots and their incidence of specific movement disorders, tremor and tardive dyskinesia, is also similar. Also, there was no significant difference in anticholinergic side effects of depots.</P>

<P>There was no significant difference in relapse rates for those on a high dose flupenthixol decanoate compared with those allocated to a standard dose. These limited data are encouraging, suggesting that standard doses are as effective in controlling relapse in schizophrenia, but are based on two very small studies (total n = 42).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Patient population</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen of the 15 trials were conducted in Europe, one in Pakistan and one in a prison hospital in Nigeria. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Eberhard-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eberhard 1986</LINK>) was a multi-centre trial, conducted in Europe. Until trials are conducted involving people across the world one cannot be fully sure how the results applicable in a global context.</P>
<P>Trials were conducted in both inpatient (total n = 200) and outpatient settings (total n = 369) though two studies did not mention trial settings. Diagnoses within the included studies were based on both operational criteria (DSM-II, DSM-III, RDC, Schneider's 1st Rank Symptoms, ICD -9, Bleuler's criteria, Feighner's criteria) and unspecified clinical means (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Steinert 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wistedt-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Wistedt 1982</LINK>). Most studies included people of both sexes and ages ranged between 18 to 67 years. The variety of settings and criteria used suggests that participants and diagnoses within this review may well be a fair reflection of circumstances in routine practice.</P>
<P>The duration of illness varied from six months to 14 years. Five trials failed to mention the length of time people had been ill. Duration of illness before entering trials seems relevant in the applicability of the evidence as depot antipsychotics are mainly used in schizophrenia and similar psychotic disorders of some chronicity.</P>
<P>Twenty-eight per cent of those recruited into the flupenthixol decanoate versus other depot antipsychotics trials left the study early. These are impressively high figures and could well be greater than seen in clinical practice due to the rigorous adherence to protocols. Although this improves internal validity, it can decrease external validity i.e. generalisability of results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes of interest</HEADING>
<P>A systematic review is limited by the nature of the studies it includes. Many studies included in this review failed to report on many outcome measures. It is unfortunate that no study reported service outcomes, patient satisfaction, or economic data. Patient care would have gained much from these outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adherence to anti-psychotic medications</HEADING>
<P>Compliance continues to be a major concern in treatments of schizophrenia. The main benefit of depot formulations is that covert non-compliance is eliminated and if relapse does occur under these circumstances then non-compliance can be ruled out. However, those entered into clinical trials are usually the more compliant patients, already biasing the sample. The generalisability of these results into the community, where non-compliance or failure to turn up to depot clinics is common, must limit the applicability of the results.<BR/>

<P>We found it disappointing that most studies failed to report on many outcome measures.

We did not find a single study reporting on even half of the outcome measures. Therefore, evidence is incomplete.</P>
<P>Poor reporting in studies was a problem. Many studies reported mean figures without standard deviations and gave graphs with only P values. Many trials have collected important data such as for Clinical Global Impression which they reported as continuous endpoint and change data.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>No significant advantages are found when comparing flupenthixol decanoate with oral antipsychotics, and also treatment with flupenthixol decanoate did not lead to an increased use of medications to help with side effects of abnormal movements. There is little to choose between flupenthixol decanoate and other depot formulations though flupenthixol decanoate may be better in causing fewer movement disorders.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>If flupenthixol decanoate is more beneficial than placebo, other oral antipsychotics or other depots, this needs to be known clearly. Therapeutic advantage is impossible to determine from the data obtained for this review. Most data in this review relate to the comparison of flupenthixol decanoate and other depot preparations. Very little difference is found between depots for mental state, behaviour and side effects outcomes although some weak evidence was found for slight improvement in global state and fewer movement disorders in those treated with flupenthixol decanoate. Therefore, choice of which depot to use must be based on clinical judgement and the preferences of people with schizophrenia and their carers. Also, the comparison between high dose and standard dose of flupenthixol decanoate shows mild difference in effects but none in side effects. No study compared standard dose of flupenthixol decanoate with low dose.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. For managers/policy makers</HEADING>
<P>If depot formulations, particularly flupenthixol decanoate, do promote compliance and this leads to a reduction in relapses, this would have important implications long term for patients and the services that care for them. However, no data relating to hospital and services outcomes, satisfaction with care and economic outcomes were reported. Managers should expect better data than the research community has provided thus far.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. General</HEADING>
<P>We stress it is important that future studies strictly adhere to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). Following these recommendations would clearly improve the conduct and reporting of clinical trials and much more data would be available to inform practice.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Specific</HEADING>
<P>This review highlighted the need for large, well-designed and reported controlled clinical trials to address the effects of flupenthixol decanoate, in particular when compared with oral antipsychotics and atypical depot antipsychotics. Despite data being sparse, it is difficult to justify the placebo-controlled study of flupenthixol decanoate, but certainly comparisons with oral or other depots could be very informative. Future studies should consider hospital and service outcomes, satisfaction with care and record economic data. Clearly presented dichotomous data, as well as continuous, would greatly inform practice. See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
