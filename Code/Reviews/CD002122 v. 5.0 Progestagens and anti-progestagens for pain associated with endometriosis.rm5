<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-22 23:41:18 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endometriosis is a painful condition where tissue from the lining of the womb (uterus) is found outside the uterus as well. It can cause pain in the abdomen, generally and during periods (menstruation) or sex. Endometriosis can also lead to infertility. Treatments include surgery or drugs to try and shrink the tissue. Progestagens and anti-progestagens are some of the hormonal drugs used for treatment. This systematic review of trials found limited evidence for the effectiveness of these drugs in the reduction of pain from endometriosis. This was due to the limited number of randomised controlled trials comparing each drug.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-22 23:30:25 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory condition defined by the presence of glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. It occurs in 7% to 10% of all women of reproductive age and may present as pain or infertility. The pelvic pain may be in the form of dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia or pelvic pain. Initially a combination of estrogens and progestagens was used to create a pseudopregnancy and alleviate the symptoms associated with endometriosis. Progestagens alone or anti-progestagens have been considered as alternatives because they are inexpensive and may have a better side effect profile than other choices.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-08-09 14:42:33 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>To determine the effectiveness of both the progestagens and anti-progestagens in the treatment of painful symptoms ascribed to the diagnosis of endometriosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-01-18 16:02:43 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>We used the search strategy of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group to identify all publications which described or might have described randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any progestagen or any anti-progestagen in the treatment of symptomatic endometriosis. We updated the review in 2011.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-01-22 23:31:38 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered only RCTs which compared the use of progestagens and anti-progestagens with other interventions, placebo or no treatment for the alleviation of symptomatic endometriosis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-22 23:50:01 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have added six new studies, bringing the total of included studies to 13 in the update of this review. The six newly included studies evaluated progestagens (comparisons with placebo, danazol, oral or subdermal contraceptive, oral contraceptive pill and danazol, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue and other drugs). The remaining studies compared the anti-progestagen gestrinone with danazol, GnRH analogues or itself.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-23 00:58:04 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The progestagen medroxyprogesterone acetate (100 mg daily) appeared to be more effective at reducing all symptoms up to 12 months of follow-up (MD -0.70, 95% CI -8.61 to -5.39; P &lt; 0.00001) compared with placebo. There was evidence of significantly more cases of acne (six versus one) and oedema (11 versus one) in the medroxyprogesterone acetate group compared with placebo. There was no evidence of a difference in objective efficacy between dydrogesterone and placebo.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a benefit with depot administration of progestagens versus other treatments (low dose oral contraceptive or leuprolide acetate) for reduced symptoms. The depot progestagen group experienced significantly more adverse effects.</P>
<P>There was no overall evidence of a benefit of oral progestagens over other medical treatment at six months of follow-up for self-reported efficacy. Amenorrhoea and bleeding were more frequently reported in the progestagen group compared with other treatment groups.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a benefit of anti-progestagens (gestrinone) compared with danazol. GnRH analogue (leuprorelin) was found to significantly improve dysmenorrhoea compared with gestrinone (MD 0.82, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.49; P = 0.02) although it was also associated with increased hot flushes (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to -0.63; P = 0.006).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-22 23:44:27 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory condition defined by the presence of glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. It occurs in 7% to 10% of all women of reproductive age and may present as pain or infertility (<LINK REF="REF-Wheeler-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheeler 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Endometriosis presents either with the problem of infertility (<LINK REF="REF-Haney-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haney 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prentice-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentice 1996</LINK>) or with painful symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 1993</LINK>). The painful symptoms may take the form of dysmenorrhoea (painful periods), dyspareunia (pain during or after sexual intercourse) or pelvic or lower abdominal pain. Typically the pain precedes the onset of menses and lasts for the duration of the cycle. Less commonly patients also present with cyclical pain at other sites, relating to endometriosis at extra-pelvic sites (<LINK REF="REF-Augoulea-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Augoulea 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 1995</LINK>). Although the exact incidence of endometriosis is unknown, endometriosis is a significant problem for the affected individual and the cost of the disease is high both in human and economic terms (<LINK REF="REF-Mathias-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathias 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-22 23:46:29 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The clinical observation of an apparent resolution of symptoms during pregnancy gave rise to the concept of treating patients with a pseudopregnancy regime (<LINK REF="REF-Kistner-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kistner 1959</LINK>). Initially combinations of high dose estrogens and progestagens were used, but this was subsequently replaced by progestagens alone (<LINK REF="REF-Kistner-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kistner 1958</LINK>). More recently anti-progestagens have been developed and they have also been employed in the treatment of endometriosis (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1987a</LINK>). The main side effects of progestagens include irregular menstrual cycles or cessation of menstruation, weight gain and breast tenderness. Cytoproterone acetate is associated with liver toxicity. The main side effects associated with anti-progesterones include breakthrough bleeding, acne, fluid retention, weight gain and other androgenic symptoms.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-01-22 23:51:58 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The precise pathogenesis (mode of development) of endometriosis remains unclear, but it is evident that endometriosis arises by the dissemination of endometrium to ectopic sites (sites other than its normal location within the uterus) and the subsequent establishment of deposits of ectopic endometrium (<LINK REF="REF-Kruitwagen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruitwagen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLaren-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaren 1996</LINK>). The assumption is made that these deposits of ectopic endometrium are responsible for the symptoms of endometriosis. Conventional treatments, therefore, are directed at the removal of all ectopic tissue. Surgical treatments achieve this by destroying or removing the implant, whilst medical therapies induce atrophy within the hormonally dependent ectopic endometrium so that they shrink in size and number.</P>
<P>Medical treatments theoretically have the ability to treat those implants not visible to the naked eye. Traditionally the oral contraceptive pill has been first line treatment for patients with presumed endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2007</LINK>). Progestagens alone, however, can induce decidualisation (an adaption of the uterus to enable implantation of the embryo), atrophy of implants and resolution of symptoms. The progestagens result in the creation of a pseudopregnancy. The clinical observation of apparent resolution of symptoms of endometriosis during pregnancy gave rise to treatment with a medication containing a progestagen (<LINK REF="REF-Moghissi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moghissi 1990</LINK>).<SUP> </SUP>Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues and danazol are also used for the treatment of endometriosis but have a less favourable profile in terms of safety, tolerability and cost (<LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 2008</LINK>). Anti-progestagens are a substance that prevents cells from making or using progesterone. They may also be beneficial in treating endometriosis as they display anti-proliferative effects in the endometrium but serum estradiol levels remain in the early to mid-follicular phase range. For this reason they avoid the bone loss and hypoestrogenism associated with progestagens alone (<LINK REF="REF-Spitz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitz 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-01-22 23:52:37 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Progestagens are readily available, inexpensive and may have a better side effect profile than other choices (such as danazol), and antiprogestagens may have even fewer side effects. This review evaluates the role of both progestagens and anti-progestagens in the treatment of symptomatic endometriosis.</P>

<P>This review considered studies that included women of reproductive years with painful symptoms and a laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis.</P>
<P>We considered painful symptoms associated with endometriosis as follows: cyclical pain associated with menstruation (dysmenorrhoea), or not associated with menstruation; deep dyspareunia (pain during or following sexual intercourse); lower abdominal or pelvic pain of a non-cyclical nature; pain on defecation; and any other painful symptom ascribed to endometriosis that was studied in any trial. We included all studies, whether the duration of symptoms was specified (three or six months) or not.</P>

<P>Depomedroxyprogesterone acetate, cytoproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, gestagen and dienogest were all evaluated in the literature as different progestagens for the treatment of endometriosis. Gestrinone was the only anti-progestagen identified that has been evaluated for the treatment of endometriosis.</P>
<P>The comparisons considered were head-to-head drug comparisons, conservative surgery, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, placebo or no treatment, oral contraceptive or danazol or GNRHa.</P>
<P>We did not consider any trial where the symptom relief was not documented, either through an objective or subjective measure, or if the surgical procedure was not conservative. We also excluded alternative or complementary therapies.</P>
<P>We have not included any trial where the progesterone intrauterine system was used as a treatment for endometriosis as a separate Cochrane Review addresses this question. Similarly we have not included any trial where danazol was used as a treatment as a separate Cochane Review addresses this.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-01-23 00:05:47 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>We performed statistical analyses according to the statistical guidelines for review authors in the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Review Group. We used relative risk as the measure of effect for dichotomous data. For continuous data, we used weighted differences whenever outcomes were measured in a standard way across studies. However, as many different methods exist for assessing pain, we used standardised mean differences when comparing multiple methods. Although different methods give different absolute values, they are conceptually measuring the same parameter. We considered the different methods of measuring pain together, not subjected to separate subgroup analyses. Where there were sufficient data, we calculated a summary statistic for each outcome using a fixed-effect model.</P>

There were seven studies in the last published version from 2000.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Progestagens</HEADING>
<P>We identified eight RCTs that considered the role of progestagens alone in the treatment of endometriosis (<LINK REF="STD-Bergvist-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bergvist 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Harada 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Overton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Razzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Razzi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlaff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schlaff 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strowitzki-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Strowitzki 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercellini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vercellini 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercellini-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vercellini 2002</LINK>). We identified other studies but excluded them because many participants had received operative treatment at the time of study entry, the drug formulation was unknown, or the patients studied were too specific (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). We included one study although a small percentage of patients had received operative treatment at the time of diagnostic laparoscopy (<LINK REF="STD-Telimaa-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Telimaa 1987b</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Overton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Overton 1994</LINK> considered three groups of women with endometriosis who wished to achieve pregnancy but also complained of pain. Patients were randomised to two doses of dydrogesterone (40 mg or 60 mg) once daily or placebo. The endpoints of this study that were relevant to this review were the reduction in pain scores (derived from diary cards) and the reduction in the AFS score at second look laparoscopy (performed within three months of completing treatment). Only 39 out of 62 women completed the study and underwent a second look laparoscopy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Vercellini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vercellini 1996</LINK> compared 150 mg of depot medroxyprogesterone every three months with a 20 µg oral contraceptive pill (OCP) with 50 mg danazol. Both the pill and danazol were taken for three weeks out of four. The primary endpoint was the degree of satisfaction at the end of therapy. A change in severity of symptoms was also measured using a 10 cm visual analogue score and a 0 to 3 point verbal rating scale.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Vercellini-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vercellini 2002</LINK> similarly compared 12.5 mg cytoproterone acetate once daily versus a continuous monophasic OCP once daily (0.02 µg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg desogestrel). The primary endpoint, as in their previous study, was the degree of satisfaction at the end of therapy. A change in severity of symptoms was also measured by a 100 mm visual analogue score and a 0 to 3 point verbal rating scale.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bergvist-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bergvist 2001</LINK> compared 15 mg medroxyprogesterone twice daily versus 200 µg nafarelin intranasally twice daily. Each group also received a placebo nasal spray or placebo tablets. In this way each group took the same number of tablets daily as the those in the active medroxyprogesterone group and the same number of nasal sprays as those in the active nafarelin group. The endpoint relevant to this review was the endometriosis severity score. Of the 48 who participated only 30 competed the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schlaff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schlaff 2006</LINK> compared 104 mg subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone every three months versus 11.25 mg leuprolide intramuscularly (IM) every three months. The primary endpoint was the reduction in five endometriosis symptoms or signs. Of the 274 participants only 190 completed the six months of active treatment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Razzi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Razzi 2007</LINK> compared desogestrel 75 &#956;g daily with ethinylestridiol plus desogestrel daily for six months in 40 women with Stage I to III endometriosis. The primary endpoint was self-reported pain using a visual analogue scale.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Strowitzki-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Strowitzki 2010</LINK> compared 2 mg of dienogest daily with leuprolide acetate 3.75 mg depot (IM four weekly) for six months in 252 women with Stage I to IV endometriosis. The primary endpoint was self-reported pain using a visual analogue scale.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Harada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Harada 2009</LINK> compared 2 mg of dienogest daily with 300 &#956;g of buserelin acetate (intranasally) daily in 271 women with confirmed endometriosis. The primary endpoint was self-reported pain.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Telimaa-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Telimaa 1987b</LINK> compared three groups of participants with mild to moderate endometriosis. They were randomised to either 100 mg medroxprogesterone once daily, 200 mg danazol three times daily or placebo for six months. Participants received identical packets of tablets so that each group took the same number of tablets daily as the active medroxyprogesterone or active danazol group. Twenty-seven per cent of participants did receive a surgical co-intervention at the study entry point but as they were evenly distributed in all three groups they were still included in the review. Change in the American Fertility Score and four-point verbal pain scores at the end of treatment were the relevant endpoint.</P>
<P>No other studies comparing progestagens with surgical therapy were identified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Anti-progestagens</HEADING>
<P>We identified no placebo controlled trial or no therapy trials comparing the anti-progestagen gestrinone. In addition, we identified no studies comparing gestrinone to any progestagen.</P>
<P>We identified two studies that compared gestrinone with danazol (<LINK REF="STD-Bromham-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bromham 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fedele-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fedele 1989</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Fedele-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fedele 1989</LINK> reported on 39 infertile women with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. Patients received either 2.5 mg gestrinone twice weekly or 600 gm danazol per day. If amenorrhoea was not achieved, danazol was increased to 800 mg per day and gestrinone was increased to three times per week. The prevalence of pain symptoms as well as the change in the American Fertility Score at laparoscopy following treatment were considered the relevant endpoints. <LINK REF="STD-Bromham-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bromham 1995</LINK> was a larger study, comparing 269 women who received either 2.5 mg gestrinone twice weekly or 200 mg danazol twice daily. American Fertility Scores at the laparoscopy following treatment and pain scores during treatment were similar endpoints. In this study 69 women withdrew during treatment.</P>
<P>We identified one multi-centre study (<LINK REF="STD-GISG-1996" TYPE="STUDY">GISG 1996</LINK>) comparing 2.5 mg gestrinone twice weekly with 3.75 mg leuprolin depot intramuscular monthly. Both groups also received a placebo pill or injection depending on their allocation. A change in severity of symptoms was measured by a 100 mm visual analogue score and a 0 to 3 point verbal rating scale.</P>
<P>One small study (<LINK REF="STD-Hornstein-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hornstein 1990</LINK>) compared two doses of gestrinone, 1.25 mg versus 2.5 mg twice weekly. A total of six participants in each arm were assessed for a change in the Revised American Fertility Society Score of endometriosis as well as symptom scores.</P>

<P>Both desogestrel and the oral contraceptive showed significant decreases in self-reported pain compared to baseline (P &lt; 0.001). After six months, the mean VAS score for desogestrel alone was 2.5 and for the oral contraceptive it was 2.3. There was no statistical comparison between groups. The authors reported on breakthrough bleeding in 4/20 patients randomised to desogestrel and increased body weight in 3/20 randomised to oral contraceptive.

There appeared to be no difference in both subjective and objective measurements of pain between these two groups. For dysmenorrhoea the OR was 0.72 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.33; P = 0.30). Refer to <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>. Similarly, for objective assessment of the revised American Fertility Society (rAFS) assessment the MD was 1.40 (95% CI -6.76 to 9.56; P = 0.74).

<P>One study compared gestrinone with the GnRH analogue leuprolin IM (<LINK REF="STD-GISG-1996" TYPE="STUDY">GISG 1996</LINK>). There was evidence of a significant benefit in the reduction of dysmenorrhoea at six months (refer to <LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>) for leuprolin (MD 0.82, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.49; P = 0.02); however at 12 months the advantage was with gestrinone (MD -3.0, 95% CI -4.79 to -1.21).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-01-23 01:05:23 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-23 01:03:51 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Of the two trials that compared oral progestagens with placebo, only one identified a benefit for reduction of symptoms in favour of the progestagen (medroxyprogesterone). The remaining trial found no evidence of a difference between progestagen and the placebo group. Progestagens were associated with increased cases of adverse effects that included acne, oedema, headaches and cycle irregularity.</P>
<P>There was no evidence to suggest a benefit in symptoms for depot or oral administration of progestagens compared with other medical treatments. The progestagen groups experienced significantly more cases of adverse effects compared with other medical treatments.</P>
<P>There was no evidence to suggest a benefit in symptom reduction for anti-progestagens when compared with danazol; and a GnRH analogue was found to be superior to an anti-progestagen in one trial.</P>
<P>The 'Summary of findings' table illustrates the summary of the main outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-08-23 11:29:09 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>There are limited studies for each comparison and as such the applicability of the data is limited. </P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-01-23 01:04:35 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>There were 13 trials, including 1551 women. Randomisation and allocation concealment were adequately described in only six of the 13 trials. The quality of the trials was somewhat limited by a lack of blinding; only five trials reported on blinding, and who was blinded, four trials were open label and the remainder lacked clarity. Attrition was generally well described. The majority of the studies reported on a priori outcomes although the original protocols had not been viewed by the review authors.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-01-23 01:05:09 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>The main bias remains the issue of multiple comparisons and small number of trials, making extrapolation difficult. There was a lack of consistency in the outcome measures used, which leads to difficulties in combining data in a suitable meta-analysis and thus makes it difficult to draw clinically relevant conclusions.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-01-23 01:05:23 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The additional studies have indicated that the effectiveness of progestagens and anti-progestagens is inconclusive at the current time. The benefits and harms observed are often limited to single trials and should be interpreted with caution.</P>
</AGREEMENT>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-23 01:07:12 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-23 01:06:17 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Whilst continuous medroxyprogesterone appeared to be effective at reducing symptoms when compared to placebo, it also appeared to have more side effects than placebo. There was no evidence of a benefit of depot or oral progestagens over other treatment. There was no evidence of a benefit of anti-progestagens. Data should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of trials and small sample sizes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-23 01:07:12 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>At the present time there is limited high quality research looking at proven treatments for endometriosis in comparison to progestagens and anti-progestagens. A study design that replicates previous work, particularly oral administration of progestagens, would be desirable to allow combining trials in a systematic way and increasing our numbers of patients treated. In addition, a study that specifically compares medical therapy (with either a progestagen or anti-progestagen alone) versus surgical therapy only would be helpful, particularly since some literature suggests that the endometriotic implants may not necessarily be the cause of the pain and surgery could be avoided.</P>
<P>We identified no trials comparing placebo with gestrinone, but such a trial is unlikely to occur.</P>
<P>In the design of future trials, care should be taken to not obscure any valuable data by including surgical treatment (or other confounders) at the time of diagnosis and entry into the study.</P>
