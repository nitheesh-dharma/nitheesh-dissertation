<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review will not be updated. The last two updates showed no substantive trials and few clinical events were found. It is highly unlikely that any further large scale, adequately powered trials will be conducted in the future. Small trials using only risk factor changes continue to be published but these do not contribute robust evidence to guide policy and practice due to inherent biases in their design. Owing to the development of very strong evidence to support pharmacological prevention of CVDs though use antihypertensives and statins there is much more emphasis on this approach used in conjunction with life-style modification, making the findings from this review of much less relevance to contemporary public health practice. It is possible that new trials of multiple risk factor interventions will be mounted in low and middle income countries in the future and a separate review of their effects would be useful should this occur.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-22 09:15:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In many countries, there is enthusiasm for 'healthy heart programmes' that use counselling and educational methods to encourage people to reduce their risks for developing heart disease. These risk factors include high cholesterol, excessive salt intake, high blood pressure, excess weight, a high-fat diet, smoking, diabetes and a sedentary lifestyle. This review is an update of all relevant randomised trials that have evaluated an intervention that aimed to reduce more than one risk factor (multiple risk factor intervention) in people without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The findings are from 55 trials of between six months and 12 years duration conducted in several countries over the course of four decades. The median duration of follow up was 12 months (with a range of six months to 12 years). Multiple risk factor intervention does result in small reductions in risk factors including blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking. Contrary to expectations, multiple risk factor interventions had little or no impact on the risk of coronary heart disease mortality or morbidity. This could be because these small risk factor changes were not maintained in the long term. Alternatively, the small reductions in risk factors may be caused by biases in some of the studies. The methods of attempting behaviour change in the general population are limited and do not appear to be effective. Different approaches to behaviour change are needed and should be tested empirically before being widely promoted, particularly in developing countries where cardiovascular disease rates are rising. Further trials may be warranted.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-11-26 03:11:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>We found 55 trials (163,471 participants) with a median duration of 12 month follow up. Fourteen trials (139,256 participants) with reported clinical event endpoints, the pooled ORs for total and CHD mortality were 1.00 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.05) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.07), respectively. Total mortality and combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events showed benefits from intervention when confined to trials involving people with hypertension (16 trials) and diabetes (5 trials): OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.89) and OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.83), respectively. Net changes (weighted mean differences) in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (53 trials) and blood cholesterol (50 trials) were -2.71 mmHg (95% CI -3.49 to -1.93), -2.13 mmHg (95% CI -2.67 to -1.58 ) and -0.24 mmol/l (95% CI -0.32 to -0.16), respectively. The OR for reduction in smoking prevalence (20 trials) was 0.87 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.00). Marked heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 85%) for all risk factor analyses was not explained by co-morbidities, allocation concealment, use of antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering drugs, or by age of trial.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-11-26 03:11:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Interventions using counselling and education aimed at behaviour change do not reduce total or CHD mortality or clinical events in general populations but may be effective in reducing mortality in high-risk hypertensive and diabetic populations. Risk factor declines were modest but owing to marked unexplained heterogeneity between trials, the pooled estimates are of dubious validity. Evidence suggests that health promotion interventions have limited use in general populations.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-11-26 03:24:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>As the incidence of cardiovascular disease is largely explained by modifiable risk factors (serum cholesterol and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure and cigarette smoking), reducing risk factors through health promotion focusing on lifestyles is a logical way of preventing disease. Randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of multiple risk factor intervention using counselling and education in addition to, or instead of, pharmacological treatments to modify major cardiovascular risk factors have been carried out in primary care and in the workplace. The findings of these trials have been equivocal; effectiveness in reducing cardiovascular disease incidence appears to be associated with the degree of risk factor control achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Editorial-1982a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Editorial 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Editorial-1982b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Editorial 1982b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Appel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appel 2004</LINK>). Taken with evidence from quasi-experimental studies, such as the North Karelia project (<LINK REF="REF-Puska-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puska 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puska-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puska 1981</LINK>) and the Stanford Heart Disease Prevention Programme (<LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farquhar-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquhar 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fortmann-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortmann 1993</LINK>), it is widely believed that multiple risk factor intervention using counselling and educational methods is both effective and cost-effective and should be expanded. Recently this idea has been extended to people with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey Smith 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sartorelli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sartorelli 2005</LINK>) and hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Pickering-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickering 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Little-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Svetkey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svetkey 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>In many countries multiple risk factor counselling and health education is embodied in guidelines produced by professional groups (<LINK REF="REF-NSF_x002d_CHD-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSF-CHD 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AHA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NSF_x002d_CHD-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSF-CHD 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-European-Task-Force-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">European Task Force 2007</LINK>) and government (<LINK REF="REF-Kickbush-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kickbush 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NSF_x002d_CHD-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSF-CHD 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Muto 2001</LINK>) recommending use of behavioural counselling for stopping smoking tobacco, making healthy food choices and increasing physical activity. </P>
<P>Alongside the guidelines, health services have acted by developing health promotion as a specialty (<LINK REF="REF-Editorial-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Editorial 1984</LINK>) and in the UK extra payments are now made for the routine collection of data on cardiovascular risk factors in primary care, and issuing of primary prevention policy (<LINK REF="REF-NSF_x002d_CHD-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSF-CHD 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Non-systematic reviews have promoted the notion that multiple risk factor intervention is effective (<LINK REF="REF-McCormick-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schoenberger-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoenberger 1990</LINK>). However, a systematic review of the randomised trial evidence involving almost a million person-years of observation, using Cochrane Collaboration methodology, demonstrated no impact of multiple risk factor intervention on coronary heart disease mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1997</LINK>). Since this systematic review was published in 1997 more randomised trials and community evaluations have been published, predominantly with disappointing findings (<LINK REF="REF-Tudor_x002d_Smith-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudor-Smith 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berglund-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berglund 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pickering-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickering 2004</LINK>). A recent non-systematic review has again claimed benefits for multiple risk factor intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Daviglus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daviglus 2006</LINK>). With the rising burden of cardiovascular diseases in developing countries, there has been a strong view that multiple risk factor intervention should be the cornerstone of primary prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vartiainen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vartiainen 2009</LINK>), although it is acknowledged that interpretation of the findings from the randomised trials makes this problematic in poor countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lim-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2007</LINK>). In view of the continued policy importance of multiple risk factor intervention a further update of the review was needed to incorporate several new trials.</P>

<P>For the original review we searched MEDLINE from 1966 to April 1995 using a RCT filter (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>). We checked reference lists of identified papers, sought expert advice and undertook citation searches.</P>
<P>We updated these searches by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (2000 to June 2006) and EMBASE (1998 to June 2006), using a RCT filter for MEDLINE (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>) and EMBASE (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1996</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). Reports of RCTs from MEDLINE and EMBASE are added to CENTRAL on a regular basis; to avoid duplication of effort we did not search earlier years of these databases.</P>
<P>We checked references of identified studies and made searches for additional follow-up papers if the studies published up until 2006 did not provide all of the data required for the review. We applied no language restrictions.</P>

<P>For the searches in 1997 and in 2006, two review authors checked all titles and abstracts obtained through the searches independently to eliminate studies that were definitely not relevant to the review. In the 2001 update, one review author checked the results of searches and eliminated all those definitely not relevant to the review. Two review authors checked the remaining papers independently. For all versions, two review authors obtained and read each paper thought to be of possible relevance to determine whether it fitted the specified inclusion criteria. We discussed disagreements and resolved them with a third review author.</P>
<P>Two review authors performed independent data abstraction using a data extraction form and resolved disagreements by discussion or by consultation with a third review author. We contacted chief investigators to provide additional relevant information where necessary. </P>
<P>We attempted to contact study authors. However, when information was not available from trialists, we assumed missing data to occur at random.</P>
<P>The main aspects of quality which were formally assessed included the adequacy of concealment of randomisation, comparability of baseline characteristics, blinding of outcome assessors and completeness of follow up. It was not possible to include blinding of intervention allocation since this is not possible in lifestyle interventions. </P>
<P>For continuous variables (i.e. blood pressure, blood cholesterol) we used mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to ascertain net changes (i.e. control group minus intervention group differences). We used the longest duration of follow up that was reported in the primary publications. For studies where subsequent follow-up data were published, we did not update data on continuous variables since it was considered likely that long-term findings would reflect attrition bias, effects of co-treatments with drugs and possibly publication bias (publication of positive findings). Similarly, we used smoking levels from the primary publication of the trial and did not use any subsequent published follow-up data in analyses. </P>
<P>We expressed categorical variables (e.g. mortality, clinical event rates and smoking) as odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI. We used fixed-effect models except in instances where there was significant heterogeneity of effects, where we applied a random-effects model. For studies where subsequent follow-up data on mortality and event rates were published, we updated these data in the review. We applied intention-to-treat analysis to these outcomes. </P>
<P>We quantified statistical heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP>statistic which describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We summarised the findings using a fixed-effect model unless there was significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic &gt; 75%) in which case we applied a random-effects model. In case of significant heterogeneity we sought to identify and explain possible causes by exploring the effect of participant, drug treatment, era of study and study design characteristics.</P>
<P>We confined subgroup analysis to co-morbidity (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and obesity and one other co-morbidity (e.g. obesity and diabetes), no co-morbidity), and evidence of prescribed drug treatment (prescribed medication during trial and no prescribed medication or drug treatment not stated).</P>
<P>We used meta-regression methods to examine the effects of age and blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering drug treatments on outcomes. We also examined the effect of level of coronary heart disease risk using the control group incidence rates to determine whether trials recruiting higher-risk participants were more likely to demonstrate beneficial effects.</P>
<P>We confined sensitivity analysis to method of randomisation (cluster, cluster analysed as individual, individual), allocation of concealment (adequate, unclear, inadequate) and age of trial (publication of trial before 2000 and after 2000). We used funnel plots to ascertain publication bias for each outcome.</P>

<P>The updated search (2001 to 2006) resulted in 3926 references, after removal of duplicates. From these we excluded 3844 and obtained 82 full-text papers for further inspection.

Thus in total, including studies already listed as excluded in previous versions of the review, we excluded 128 references, reporting on 117 studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2010-11-24 13:38:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann">
<P>We found a total of 55 trials of multiple risk factor intervention, comprising 61 distinct study groups; a dramatic increase on the 14 trials identified for the original review. The total number of patients recruited amounted to 163,471 with data on clinical endpoint for 139,256 participants. The trials with clinical endpoints comprised approximately 909,500 patient-years of observation and those with risk factor endpoints 321,000 patient-years of observation. The duration of follow up ranged from six months to 12 years; the median follow-up time was one year. Sixteen studies (with 17 arms) recruited patients with hypertension and five trials were of patients with diabetes. </P>
<P>Fourteen trials reported total or coronary heart disease mortality as outcomes and two trials from the original review (the <LINK REF="STD-Swedish-RIS-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish RIS 1994</LINK> study and the <LINK REF="STD-WHLP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHLP 1998</LINK>) reported extended mortality follow up. Only four trials were sufficiently large to have adequate power to show meaningful changes in total or coronary heart disease mortality (<LINK REF="STD-HDFP-trial-1970" TYPE="STUDY">HDFP trial 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRFIT-Study-1982" TYPE="STUDY">MRFIT Study 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gothenberg-Study-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gothenberg Study 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHO-Factories-1986" TYPE="STUDY">WHO Factories 1986</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Rachmani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rachmani 2005</LINK> trial the number of fatal and non-fatal clinical events outnumbered the number of participants recruited to the study. For the purpose of this review, we used the number of participants who experienced one or more events in this analysis. However, most recent trials did not include clinical event endpoints but focused on the following outcomes: blood pressure, serum cholesterol, physical activity, diet, control of diabetes and weight loss. </P>
<P>In general, the trials compared an intervention comprising some form of counselling and education with control groups, which either received usual care or nothing was described. The type and intensity of behavioural intervention used was seldom reported in the older trials. Very few studies reported the theoretical approach used to underpin the intervention. When stated, the Stages of Change model (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DiClemente-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiClemente 1991</LINK>) was the most common approach used. A person-centred and self-directed psychological approach was used by one study (<LINK REF="REF-Meichenbaum-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meichenbaum 1993</LINK>) and another one relied on a combination of social cognitive theory, goal systems theory and social ecological theory (<LINK REF="STD-Toobert-_x0028_MLP_x0029_-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Toobert (MLP) 2005</LINK>). Most education and counselling intervention strategies targeted a combination of risk factors including diet, exercise, weight loss, salt intake, alcohol use, stress management, smoking cessation, adherence to medication or specific clinical regimens, particularly in patients with hypertension or diabetes. </P>
<P>Interventions included workshops, lectures, individual sessions, personal counselling, provision of written material, assignments, shopping tours and cooking sessions. Some studies required family members, partners or both to participate in the intervention. The intervention strategies were commonly provided by a variety of health professionals including physicians, nurses, nutritionists, dieticians, nurses, exercise trainers, cooks, psychotherapists and physiotherapists. The intensity varied and ranged from four to 54 sessions over periods of time ranging from two weeks to three years. </P>
<P>With the exception of two studies recruiting men and women over the age of 60 years (<LINK REF="STD-Applegate-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Applegate 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Pena-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Pena 2001</LINK>), the oldest subjects included in the trials were 75 years of age. The majority of trials randomised only middle-aged adults, although younger adults were recruited by some studies. The mean age in all the trials was 50 years. </P>
<P>Few studies looked at quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Oslo-Diet-Exercise" TYPE="STUDY">Oslo Diet Exercise</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toobert-_x0028_MLP_x0029_-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Toobert (MLP) 2005</LINK>) and only one examined cost-effectiveness of the intervention; in this case a nurse-led intervention for elderly hypertensive patients (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Pena-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Pena 2001</LINK>). </P>

<P>We excluded 116 trials identified as involving multiple risk factor interventions from consideration for the following reasons: no relevant risk factor changes measured and/or reported (n = 159), non-random allocation to intervention and control groups (n = 315), no specific multiple risk factor intervention (n = 6), control group received substantial intervention (n = 210), follow up to at least six months was not reported (n = 12), the mean age of participants was less than 35 (n = 88), over 25% of participants had CHD (n = 110), numbers in groups were not reported (n = 1), baseline or follow-up data were not provided (n = 6), or no comparable control group was identified (n = 6). A large number of older studies were set up in what was then the Soviet Union but it appeared that allocation to intervention and control groups was not random. Attempts to trace the investigators were unsuccessful. Three studies appeared suitable in the latest update but missing data precluded them from inclusion in the review update, as attempts to request data from the original authors were unsuccessful (<LINK REF="STD-Boylan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boylan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kisioglu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kisioglu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elliot-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Elliot 2007</LINK>). </P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2010-11-22 09:56:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the trials examined deserves comment. Very few of the older published trials provided sufficient detail to replicate the intervention used, and in several trials the intervention varied between sites and over time. It is likely that the quality of the intervention, in terms of intensity and frequency, person carrying out activities, and the theoretical framework of behavioural change used, will determine the impact of the intervention. One third of studies (n = 18) used an intention-to-treat analysis on both categorical and continuous variables. Some explained that the last available reported measurement was used for the final endpoint measurement. Of these 18 studies, the loss to follow up ranged from 1% to 42% (median 13%). As such, losses to follow up were a particular problem as changes in risk factors cannot be reliably assessed in an intention-to-treat analysis. </P>
<P>Random allocation methods were not usually reported. In only 13 out of 55 trials we considered the methods used as adequate and in nine they were inadequate. We made specific enquiries of investigators for the original review predominantly to obtain event data but did not make these in this update as most of the new trials had measured clinical events. In the large trials it is unlikely that the allocation method was suspect but was simply inadequately reported. </P>
<P>Blinding of intervention allocation for the participants is not possible in lifestyle interventions and this inevitably raises the possibility of bias. Only 12 out of 55 trials blinded the assessors to treatment allocation. As such outcomes were usually assessed with knowledge of treatment allocation and this too makes biased assessment of some outcomes possible. It seems unlikely that lack of blinding may have had any effect on clinical event outcomes, but it is possible that participants randomised to a control or usual care group might have been more likely to take health preventive activity as they may have felt they were missing potential benefits. Lack of blinding in assessment and or relying on self-reported smoking histories may have resulted in a reporting bias with those allocated to interventions more likely to say they had stopped smoking, as seen in previous studies (<LINK REF="REF-West-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2007</LINK>). Validation of self-reported smoking outcomes using biochemical assay of serum thiocyanate was reported in only three of the older trials and none of the new trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Total (all-cause) mortality</HEADING>
<P>From the 14 studies that reported total mortality, there was no strong evidence of any reduction in the pooled analysis (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05) using a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Follow up of mortality ranged from six months to 12 years.</P>
<P>A significant reduction in all-cause mortality was seen in trials where patients were recruited with either hypertension or diabetes (RR 0.78; 95% 0.68 to 0.89) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) and in those trials where patients were being prescribed either antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs during the trial period (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.96) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) using a fixed-effect model. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Coronary heart disease mortality</HEADING>
<P>Eleven trials reported on coronary heart disease mortality; the pooled OR was 0.99 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.07) using a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Stroke mortality</HEADING>
<P>Six trials reported on stroke mortality (<LINK REF="STD-HDFP-trial-1970" TYPE="STUDY">HDFP trial 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finnish-men-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Finnish men 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gothenberg-Study-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gothenberg Study 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oslo-Diet-Antismoking" TYPE="STUDY">Oslo Diet Antismoking</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swedish-RIS-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish RIS 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rachmani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rachmani 2005</LINK>). Only one of these trials reported a significant reduction in stroke mortality but the pooled relative risk favoured intervention (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>) using a fixed-effect model. This may be explained by better monitoring and adherence of drug treatment as five of the six trials were given drug treatment during the study. </P>
<P>For total and coronary heart disease mortality, funnel plots suggested no evidence of small study bias in trials (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Evidence of significant statistical heterogeneity was not apparent in the pooled RR for total mortality, coronary heart disease mortality or stroke mortality. </P>
<P>Modelling the effects of age using the mean age of study participants and proportion of patients on antihypertensive treatment and cholesterol-lowering drug treatment did not reveal any significant interactions between age, drug treatments and outcome. There was a significant interaction between intervention and level of coronary heart disease risk estimated from control group incidence, indicating that trials recruiting higher-risk participants were more likely to demonstrate beneficial effects. This effect was explained by the inclusion of the two trials which studied hypertensive patients rather than general population or workforce subjects. It is impossible to separate this effect of baseline coronary heart disease risk from the benefits of pharmacological treatment of hypertension. </P>
<P>Allocation concealment had little effect on total mortality although the trials with inadequate allocation concealment reported stronger evidence of an effect on total mortality, however this was driven by the HDFP trial of hypertensives (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fatal and non-fatal clinical events</HEADING>
<P>Nine trials reported on fatal and non-fatal clinical events which required hospital admission (<LINK REF="STD-HDFP-trial-1970" TYPE="STUDY">HDFP trial 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRFIT-Study-1982" TYPE="STUDY">MRFIT Study 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oslo-Diet-Antismoking" TYPE="STUDY">Oslo Diet Antismoking</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finnish-men-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Finnish men 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gothenberg-Study-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gothenberg Study 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHO-Factories-1986" TYPE="STUDY">WHO Factories 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swedish-RIS-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish RIS 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Pena-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Pena 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rachmani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rachmani 2005</LINK>) and four trials reported on stroke events (<LINK REF="STD-Oslo-Diet-Antismoking" TYPE="STUDY">Oslo Diet Antismoking</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gothenberg-Study-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gothenberg Study 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swedish-RIS-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish RIS 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rachmani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rachmani 2005</LINK>). The follow-up period ranged from six months to 11.8 years.</P>
<P>All analyses showed considerable heterogeneity of effect (I<SUP>2</SUP> above 75%) so findings must be viewed with caution. Overall, a reduction in events was observed (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.21</LINK>) using a random-effects model. This effect was explained by inclusion of patients with either hypertension or diabetes in whom the combined event relative risk was 0.71 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.83) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.24" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.24</LINK>). No effect was seen in participants without a co-morbidity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Changes in risk factors</HEADING>
<P>For all analyses of risk factor changes very high levels of heterogeneity of effect were found (I<SUP>2</SUP> between 85% and 97%). Although we applied random-effects, we cannot draw conclusions regarding the consistency of effects on risk factors. We explored this heterogeneity and it could not be attributed fully to the effects of pharmacological treatment or study design effects. There was some evidence of possible regression to the mean effects as risk factor net changes were strongly correlated with the initial level of blood pressure, smoking and blood cholesterol. The sample size weighted correlation coefficients between initial level and magnitude of risk factor reduction for diastolic blood pressure, smoking and blood cholesterol were 0.73 (P = 0.006), 0.63 (P = 0.01) and 0.74 (P = 0.004), respectively. In other words, those studies with the highest baseline diastolic blood pressure, smoking prevalence and blood cholesterol levels demonstrated larger falls in these risk factors at follow up.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Systolic and diastolic blood pressure</HEADING>
<P>For both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 48 trials (53 arms) indicated a significant reduction favouring intervention. The weighted mean difference between intervention and control was -2.71 mm Hg (95% CI -3.49 to -1.93) for systolic blood pressure and -2.13 mm Hg (95% CI -2.67 to -1.58) for diastolic blood pressure using random-effects models (<LINK REF="CMP-001.36" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.36</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.42" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.42</LINK>). In total, 24 trials reported that patients were on medication for high blood pressure. When analysis of outcomes was confined to these trials, strong evidence of reductions in both systolic and diastolic remained. This was also seen when the analysis was confined to trials where no medication was prescribed (<LINK REF="CMP-001.39" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.39</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.46" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.46</LINK>).  </P>
<P>Not all trials reported, or were able to provide data on, blood pressure at follow up. Investigators from the Oslo study stated that there were no changes observed (Hjermann I, personal communication, 1996). Overall, changes in blood pressure were small. For both outcomes there was no evidence of small study bias in the trials as shown by the funnel plots (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). </P>
<P>Both subgroup and sensitivity analysis had no effect in reducing heterogeneity or on the overall but inconsistent findings of a reduction in blood pressure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blood cholesterol</HEADING>
<P>Forty-four trials (50 arms) reported blood cholesterol as an outcome. Blood cholesterol levels showed a small but highly significant fall (weighted mean net difference -0.07 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.08 to -0.06) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.49" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.49</LINK>) using a random-effects model. This is a bigger effect on cholesterol-lowering than previously seen in the 2001 update of this review. Nineteen trials reported that patients were on cholesterol-lowering medication and when analysis was confined to this group the reduction in cholesterol was almost identical to the pooled result and was similar to that seen in those trials in which no cholesterol-lowering drugs were used (<LINK REF="CMP-001.53" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.53</LINK>). Cholesterol levels were lower in the trials in which both antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs were used (-0.18 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.22 to -0.14 mmol/L).  </P>
<P>Trials with inadequate concealment showed a non-significant reduction compared with those with adequate or unclear concealment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.51" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.51</LINK>). <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK> shows no evidence of small study bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Smoking</HEADING>
<P>Twenty studies reported on smoking prevalence. Pooled analysis indicated a non-significant reduction in smoking prevalence (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.28" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.28</LINK>). Most of the studies relied on self-reported smoking status at end of follow up. In the Hypertension Detection &amp; Follow up Program quantitative data were not available but no changes in smoking rates were found (<LINK REF="STD-HDFP-trial-1970" TYPE="STUDY">HDFP trial 1970</LINK>). Smoking rates fell particularly sharply in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial and in the Change of Heart 1999 study. The former used individual smoking advice given by a physician (<LINK REF="STD-MRFIT-Study-1982" TYPE="STUDY">MRFIT Study 1982</LINK>) and in the latter large baseline differences between groups were noted and losses to follow up were high (<LINK REF="STD-Change-of-Heart--1999" TYPE="STUDY">Change of Heart 1999</LINK>). Validation of self-reported smoking rate reductions in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (<LINK REF="STD-MRFIT-Study-1982" TYPE="STUDY">MRFIT Study 1982</LINK>) by comparison with serum thiocyanate levels suggested that the improvement might be overestimated. None of the more recent trials indicated a significant reduction in smoking status. </P>
<P>Subgroup analysis indicated no change in the results in the other studies which had recruited a low number of participants with cardiovascular disease (CVD), where the risk reduction was 15% (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.92) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.33" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.33</LINK>) using a random-effects model. </P>

Studies published before 2000 reported similar effect sizes compared with those published after 2000. Net differences were small: -0.45 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure, -0.49 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure, 0.04 mmol/L in blood cholesterol (RR difference of -0.26 for total clinical events).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomisation</HEADING>
<P>In meta-analysis the weighting given to trials with a cluster design may be over-estimated. Only one trial used a cluster design where analysis was confined to the clusters (<LINK REF="STD-Change-of-Heart--1999" TYPE="STUDY">Change of Heart 1999</LINK>) and no benefits were demonstrated other than a 57% risk reduction in smoking prevalence (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.64) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.29" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.29</LINK>) using a random-effects model. In trials with a cluster design which provided analysis by individual significant benefits were observed in reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and cholesterol (<LINK REF="CMP-001.36" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.36</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.43" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.43</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.50" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.50</LINK>), all using a random-effects model.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-11-22 13:21:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As reported in the earlier review, multiple risk factor interventions comprising counselling, education aimed at behaviour change and drug therapies for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease were ineffective in achieving reductions in total or cardiovascular disease mortality when used in general or workforce populations of middle-aged adults. The pooled effects of intervention were statistically insignificant but a potentially useful benefit of treatment (about a 8% reduction in coronary heart disease mortality) may have been missed despite the very large sample sizes in several of the trials. It is surprising that despite the continued popularity of these interventions no further large-scale randomised studies, powered to detect clinical event endpoints, have been carried out. Any coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality benefits of these multiple risk factor interventions was confined to those trials recruiting people with hypertension and diabetes. Similarly, benefits in stroke mortality were confined to those trials recruiting patients with hypertension and taking drug treatments. Such participants may well be more highly motivated to act on counselling and education interventions and may also benefit because they were more likely to adhere to their drug medications.</P>
<P>Our rationale for focusing on mortality outcomes rather than non-fatal event outcomes is that counting deaths and comparing them by random allocation group is unlikely to be biased, but once attribution of causes of death is involved there is some potential for bias to occur as events were not necessarily assigned causes blind to random allocation group, particularly in the older, large trials. Similar potential biases arise in counting and assigning causes to non-fatal events.</P>
<P>The risk factor changes associated with interventions were modest but are probably optimistic estimates as changes could only be measured in those remaining in the trials. All risk factor change analyses were heterogeneous, making pooled estimates of effect questionable. Habituation to blood pressure measurement and self-reports of smoking will also tend to exaggerate the changes observed. It is, however, not possible to separate participants' level of risk from the use of antihypertensives in the present set of trials, as studies with high-risk participants tended to be the ones which included participants with high levels of antihypertensive drug use. Furthermore, there are many problems in relating trial outcome to a risk measure which is itself dependent on the outcome in meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1995</LINK>). We are cautious in our interpretations of these risk factor changes because, if these effects were real, they would have been reflected in reductions in CHD mortality given the size of some of the trials.  Furthermore, as the average duration of follow up was 12 months, the risk factor changes that were observed are unlikely to be mirrors of the broad secular trends occurring over much longer time periods. Our conclusions are that observed risk factor changes are likely to be over-estimates and are probably, in the main, due to bias in design and effects of pharmacological treatments.</P>
<P>Although we did observe weak evidence of benefits on combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, this was explained by trials which included hypertensives and diabetics, supporting the conclusions based on the mortality findings. Heterogeneity of intervention effects on non-fatal clinical endpoints is probably caused by two factors: the participants included in the trials and the use of pharmacological treatments. Hypertensives, at highest risk, were more likely to benefit from counselling and education, and effective drugs. We stand by our interpretation that these interventions are not beneficial in general populations. These findings suggest that targeting of current health promotion activities to high-risk individuals might be of more value than more general health promotion for everyone.</P>
<P>Our findings are relevant to middle-aged adults who are seen in general practice or occupational health practices. Although our inclusion criteria were focused on trials of primary prevention we found that some studies had recruited participants with some evidence of prior heart attack, stroke or peripheral vascular disease. These trials contribute important data to our analyses so we did not wish to exclude them but decided to reject trials that comprised more than 25% of participants with prior CVD events. These trials did not report findings by prior CVD and even if they had the comparisons would not be by randomisation as none of the trials deliberately set out to randomise patients with prior diseases. However, their inclusion in this review would tend to bias our findings towards finding positive effects of intervention given that these health promotion interventions appear to be more effective in people with established cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Oldridge-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oldridge 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mullen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullen 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although missing data could affect the conclusions of this review, we consider that the proportion of loss at follow up was not that substantial, and its impact on fatal events (primary outcomes) is perhaps lower than that observed for non-fatal events.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The interventions used</HEADING>
<P>The benefits of drug treatments for lowering blood pressure and cholesterol are clear (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey Smith 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Collins-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CTT-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT 2005</LINK>). However, those people at highest risk of disease in both hypertension control (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1995</LINK>) and cholesterol-lowering (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey Smith 1993</LINK>) benefit most. Treatment of low-risk populations may result in small treatment benefits being outweighed by small treatment risks (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-Smith-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey Smith 1994</LINK>), which may have occurred in both the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial and the Finnish businessmen's trial (<LINK REF="STD-MRFIT-Study-1982" TYPE="STUDY">MRFIT Study 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finnish-men-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Finnish men 1985</LINK>). There were strong associations between baseline levels of risk factors and net falls experienced, suggesting that intervention may be more effective in populations with particularly adverse risk-factor profiles. </P>
<P>More intensive interventions might be expected to produce better effects although those used in many of the trials would far exceed what is feasible in routine practice. A meta-analysis of dietary modifications found that increasing intensity of dietary intervention was associated with greater falls in blood cholesterol levels in high-risk participants (<LINK REF="REF-Brunner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunner 1997</LINK>). In the Minnesota Heart Health Programme, a non-randomised community trial of intensive health promotion, both risk-factor and mortality changes showed virtually no difference between intervention and control communities (<LINK REF="REF-Luepker-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luepker 1996</LINK>). The continued enthusiasm for health promotion practices given the failure of these community intervention trials is curious, especially given the huge resources which have been put into them.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Latency of effects</HEADING>
<P>It is possible that benefits cannot be detected in the early stages but emerge over time. Longer-term follow up of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial participants has demonstrated increased divergence between control and intervention group mortality rates (<LINK REF="REF-MRFITRG-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRFITRG 1990</LINK>) which has also been found in the Tromso Family Trial (Professor S. Knutson, personal communication). However, evidence from pharmacological trials suggests benefits from reduction of blood pressure and blood cholesterol are observed within two to four years (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scandinavian-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scandinavian 1994</LINK>). The effects of giving up smoking vary depending on the clinical outcome considered: stroke risk falls rapidly after stopping (<LINK REF="REF-Wannamethee-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wannamethee 1995</LINK>), but coronary heart disease risk may be less reversible (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ben_x002d_Shlomo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ben-Shlomo 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Evidence of benefit</HEADING>
<P>The quasi-experimental North Karelia study has been very influential in supporting multiple risk factor intervention. Examination of the trends in both risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Puska-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puska 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vartiainen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vartiainen 1994</LINK>) and coronary heart disease mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Valkonen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valkonen 1992</LINK>) observed in North Karelia and comparison regions shows similar patterns occurring at the same time, suggesting that the interventions in North Karelia were not instrumental in causing the improvements observed (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 2001</LINK>). Indeed, the North Karelia and similar projects may be viewed as effects, or epiphenomena, of the very high coronary heart disease mortality rates experienced in many countries in the 1960s. </P>
<P>In secondary prevention following myocardial infarction and angina, trials of multiple and single risk factor interventions have suggested substantial benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Oldridge-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oldridge 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mullen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullen 1992</LINK>). It is probable that intervention aimed at lifestyle modification following myocardial infarction is effective because participants are much more likely to change their behaviours.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of randomised controlled trials</HEADING>
<P>The interventions reviewed were essentially individual (49 trials), family (three trials) or work site (three trials) approaches. Randomised controlled trials impose limitations on the nature of interventions that may be tested and are of more value in examining high-risk rather than population and social approaches to prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Context</HEADING>
<P>The majority of included trials (47%) were undertaken in Europe and in the USA (29%) whilst the remaining were undertaken in other countries including Australia, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, Israel and Taiwan. Over the past decades, whilst there has been a decline in deaths from heart disease and stroke in developed countries, especially in Europe and the US, increasing trends are being experienced in developing countries, particularly in India and China (<LINK REF="REF-Callow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callow 2006</LINK>).  The US alone has experienced a decline in deaths from CHD by as much as 60% to 63% during 1965 to 1998 and a decline in cerebrovascular death by 59% to 63% during the same time period. In Europe similar trends have been observed: a decline in deaths from CHD of 30% to 32% and a decline in cerebrovascular death by 55% to 57% between 1965 and 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Levi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levi 2002</LINK>). These declines have been attributed to lowering of risk factor distributions and better treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bejot-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bejot 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ellekjaer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellekjaer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fang 2007</LINK>). Our results must be viewed within the context of the falling trends seen in CHD and stroke deaths. Replication of these multiple risk factor intervention studies in countries where the cardiovascular disease is increasing should be a high research priority.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-11-22 10:23:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of 'health promotion' techniques for one-to-one, work site or family-orientated information and advice on a range of lifestyles (exercise, smoking cessation, diet) given to people at relatively low risk of cardiovascular disease is not particularly effective in terms of reducing the risk of clinical events. The costs of such interventions are high and it seems likely that these resources and techniques may be better used in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease and those with established cardiovascular disease, where evidence of effectiveness is much stronger.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Policy implications</HEADING>
<P>Health protection through national fiscal and legislative changes that aim to reduce smoking, dietary consumption of fats, 'hidden' salt and calories, and increase facilities and opportunities for exercise, should have a higher priority than health promotion interventions applied to general and workforce populations. It is essential that the current concepts and practices of multiple risk factor intervention, primarily through individual risk factor counselling, are not exported to poorer countries as the best policy option for dealing with existing and projected burdens of cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1993</LINK>). Health protection should be promoted as the mainstay of chronic disease prevention in poorer countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Asaria-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asaria 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-11-22 10:24:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is unlikely that any further large-scale multiple risk factor intervention trials will be mounted in high-income countries in the future. It is also unlikely that uncontrolled or quasi-experimental study designs will produce more robust answers to questions about the effectiveness of multiple risk factor intervention by means of individual or family health information and advice. </P>
<P>Research on the effects and costs of health protection (i.e. fiscal and legislative approaches) and primary prevention would be of direct policy relevance, particularly in low and middle-income countries. </P>
<P>Qualitative studies examining how participants perceived and responded to the advice and treatment given in these randomised controlled trials could be very helpful in shaping future interventions.  For example, the availability of foods and better access to recreational and sporting facilities may have a greater impact on dietary and exercise patterns respectively, than health professional advice. The effects of new approaches need to be examined in a wide range of people and in different contexts as it seems likely that the poor, socially excluded, specific ethnic groups and older people may all react in different ways and that interventions offered in developing countries where cardiovascular disease rates are increasing dramatically may be accepted more readily.</P>

<P>This review will not be updated. The last two updates showed no substantive trials and few clinical events were found. It is highly unlikely that any further large scale, adequately powered trials will be conducted in the future. Small trials using only risk factor changes continue to be published but these do not contribute robust evidence to guide policy and practice due to inherent biases in their design. Owing to the development of very strong evidence to support pharmacological prevention of CVDs though use antihypertensives and statins there is much more emphasis on this approach used in conjunction with life-style modification, making the findings from this review of much less relevance to contemporary public health practice. It is possible that new trials of multiple risk factor interventions will be mounted in low and middle income countries in the future and a separate review of their effects would be useful should this occur.</P>
