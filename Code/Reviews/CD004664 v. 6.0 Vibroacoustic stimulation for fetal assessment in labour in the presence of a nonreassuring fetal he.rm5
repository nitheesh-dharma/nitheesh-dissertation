<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-01 14:17:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vibratory and sound stimulation may help to tell how well a baby is during labour when the heart beat is showing possible concerns.</P>
<P>A baby's heart rate is checked during labour to try to identify babies who are having difficulties. However, changes in the baby's heart-rate patterns may not always mean the baby really is having difficulties. When the heart-rate pattern is not reassuring, extra tests may help to indicate which babies need help. Sound and vibratory stimulation (fetal vibroacoustic stimulation) is one such test. For healthy babies it produces a positive response, and absence of this could be a sign that the baby is having difficulty. The review authors found no randomised trials that considered vibroacoustic stimulation for this use. More research would be helpful.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-01 14:18:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P> </P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-10-04 09:28:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Approximately 18% of cardiotocograph (CTG) tracings during labour will be nonreassuring (<LINK REF="REF-East-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2006</LINK>) based on the heart rate, variability and deceleration patterns (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RANZCOG-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">RANZCOG 2007</LINK>). Other tests may be considered to evaluate fetal well-being and potentially reduce unnecessary operative interventions, including fetal scalp blood sampling for pH with acidosis defined as a pH less than 7.20 (<LINK REF="REF-Ingemarsson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingemarsson 1989</LINK>), or lactate estimation with intervention indicated when values exceed 4.8 mmol/L (<LINK REF="REF-East-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1999</LINK>), the use of fetal pulse oximetry (nonreassuring values less than 30%, (<LINK REF="REF-East-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-East-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2008</LINK>), fetal scalp stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Rathore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rathore 2011</LINK>), or electrocardiographic waveform analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Amer_x002d_Wahlin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amer-Wahlin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2012</LINK>). These tests are not without limitations, however. For example, fetal scalp blood sampling is an invasive procedure that requires dilation of the cervix, rupture of the membranes, and access to the fetal presenting part. An inadequate blood sample may be obtained due to inaccessibility of the presenting part or an inexperienced operator (<LINK REF="REF-Westgren-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westgren 1998</LINK>). A fetal oximetry sensor may only be applied following rupture of the amniotic membranes and at minimum 2 cm cervical dilatation (<LINK REF="REF-East-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2008</LINK>). A simple, non-invasive test that does not encounter these limitations would therefore be ideal. Vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) may be one such test and has been proposed as a tool in the assessment of fetal well-being in the presence of a nonreassuring CTG during the first and second stages of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-04 09:25:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fetal VAS is a non-invasive technique that is inexpensive and requires minimal operator expertise. A device such as an artificial larynx or a commercially available acoustic stimulator is placed on the maternal abdomen, over the region of the fetal head (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1990</LINK>). Sound is emitted at a predetermined level for several seconds.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-11-01 14:17:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The stimulus is expected to induce a startle reflex in the fetus, with subsequent fetal movement and fetal heart rate (FHR) acceleration (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 1991</LINK>). This may align with the neurological response of prominent pupillary dilatation following use of VAS (<LINK REF="REF-Cajal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cajal 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>There may be differing responses to VAS depending on the duration, intensity and the device used to produce the stimulus (<LINK REF="REF-Pietrantoni-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pietrantoni 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Polzin-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polzin 1988</LINK>); gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Gagnon-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagnon 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoh 2009</LINK>); maternal administration of magnesium sulphate which is associated with decreased FHR variability and reactivity, resulting in a greater incidence of nonreactivity to VAS (<LINK REF="REF-Sherer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherer 1994</LINK>); or steroid use, which has also been found to induce a transient, but profound suppression of fetal limb movements, affecting fetal response to VAS (<LINK REF="REF-Rotmensch-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotmensch 1999</LINK>).There is no standard protocol defining its optimal use. The VAS technique used varied widely from sound frequencies ranging from 20 to 9000 Hz, sound pressure levels from 82 to 120 dB, duration of stimulus from one to 10 seconds, and number of stimuli from one to seven (<LINK REF="REF-Richards-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is hypothesised that a FHR acceleration or transient tachycardia recorded following VAS provides reassurance of fetal well-being, obviating the need for further intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Perez_x002d_Delboy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez-Delboy 2002</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Antenatal fetal vibroacoustic stimulation</HEADING>
<P>A Cochrane systematic review of VAS during the antenatal period (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2001</LINK>) reported that VAS reduced the incidence of nonreassuring CTG and shortened testing time. Only one trial included a comparison of palpable fetal movement following VAS or a mock test and whether fetal movements following the test were accompanied by reactivity of the FHR (<LINK REF="STD-Marden-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marden 1997</LINK>). They reported a significant increase in fetal movements following VAS and no difference in the number of non-reactive CTGs. The recording of fetal movement and use of mock testing may therefore be important considerations in future research. The review authors highlighted a number of areas where the randomised controlled trials did not evaluate important issues such as safety and perinatal outcome following VAS. They concluded that there was insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to recommend the routine antenatal use of VAS in the assessment of fetal well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Testing prenatal habituation to a vibroacoustic stimulus may play a role in evaluating the performance of the fetal central nervous system and therefore may be predictive of subsequent development after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez_x002d_Gonzalez-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez-Gonzalez 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leader-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leader 1984</LINK>). This possibility is supported further in so far as deficits in central nervous system volume and function restrict the response to VAS in the anencephalic fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Park-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2010</LINK>). The use of VAS in conjunction with an abnormal biophysical profile or in high-risk pregnancies may provide reassurance of fetal well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Annunziata-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annunziata 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papdopoulos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papdopoulos 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sood-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sood 2007</LINK>). </P>
<P>Some researchers have raised safety concerns of the stress induced by VAS, such as passage of urine (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmer 1993</LINK>), FHR deceleration (<LINK REF="REF-Ingemarsson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingemarsson 1989</LINK>), or potential cochlear damage from increased intrauterine sound levels (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2001</LINK>). The risk of hearing impairment has been considered from a number of angles, including its implausibility given the decibel level changes in utero from the stimulus (<LINK REF="REF-Arulkumaran-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arulkumaran 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arulkumaran-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arulkumaran 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1990</LINK>); long-term follow-up of infants exposed to VAS antenatally, with no evidence of auditory nerve and brain stem evoked responses at two days of age (<LINK REF="REF-Ohel-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohel 1987</LINK>); or of hearing impairment or neurological damage at 18 months and three years (<LINK REF="REF-Ratcliffe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratcliffe 2000</LINK>) or four years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Nyman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyman 1992</LINK>). A further study examined 28 fetuses of hearing-impaired women, those who had previously had a baby with hearing impairment and three fetuses with congenital rubella. A negative response to VAS correctly predicted the three fetuses who were later identified as being hearing impaired, while those fetuses with a normal response to VAS had normal hearing when tested both after birth and at three years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 1992</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Intrapartum fetal vibroacoustic stimulation</HEADING>
<P>Studies of VAS during labour, preceded by either no FHR monitoring or normal FHR patterns, have noted FHR accelerations following VAS, compared to either mock or no stimulus (<LINK REF="STD-Anyaegbunam-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Anyaegbunam 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marden-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marden 1997</LINK>). One study suggested that the combination of VAS and assessment of the amniotic fluid index during the latent phase of labour was a good predictor of the fetus's ability to withstand labour (<LINK REF="STD-Phelan-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Phelan 1989</LINK>). Others have addressed some safety concerns. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Zimmer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmer 1996</LINK> reported that, in women with single, term pregnancies, in early labour at cervical dilatation less than 4 cm, having intact membranes and a reassuring CTG, there was no difference in the rate of meconium-stained liquor when the membranes subsequently ruptured within an hour of either a real or mock stimulus. <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1993</LINK> allocated women undergoing elective caesarean section to fetal VAS or no stimulus prior to uterine incision, and reported no difference in maternal venous, umbilical arterial or venous catecholamine or renin levels for the two groups.</P>
<P>A systematic review of observational studies where VAS was followed by fetal scalp pH estimation reported likelihood ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for a positive test result, i.e. where no FHR acceleration following stimulus predicted the presence of fetal acidaemia, of 5.06 (CI 2.69 to 9.50) and a negative test result, i.e. where FHR acceleration predicted no acidaemia, of 0.32 (CI 0.19 to 0.55) (<LINK REF="REF-Skupski-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skupski 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skupski-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skupski 2002b</LINK>). Having determined this degree of diagnostic accuracy, the authors suggested VAS was an appropriate test to evaluate fetal well-being in the presence of a nonreassuring CTG, with a recommendation that fetal scalp pH be estimated when the stimulus failed to elicit acceleration of the FHR (<LINK REF="REF-Skupski-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skupski 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skupski-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skupski 2002b</LINK>). That systematic review was designed to examine the diagnostic accuracy of VAS, rather than to examine results from unpublished studies or randomised controlled trials for correlation between VAS and maternal/fetal outcomes, including mode of birth (including operative birth for fetal concerns), other forms of assessment of fetal well-being (including oxygen saturation or scalp pH/lactate values) or to evaluate the potential safety concerns. It therefore does not provide sufficient evidence on which to base practice.</P>
<P>Further studies not included in the <LINK REF="REF-Skupski-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skupski 2002a</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Skupski-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skupski 2002b</LINK> reviews have evaluated fetal scalp pH following VAS, with most reporting a scalp pH greater than 7.20 following a positive FHR response to VAS and scalp pH less than 7.20 when there had been a negative result following VAS (<LINK REF="REF-Edersheim-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edersheim 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Polzin-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polzin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1986</LINK>). There were some false negatives, where a positive result to VAS was followed by a pH greater than 7.20 (<LINK REF="REF-Ingemarsson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingemarsson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irion-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irion 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2001</LINK>). The duration and intensity of the stimulus are likely to have contributed to these findings. Studies that did not observe false negative results used a three-second stimulus (<LINK REF="REF-Edersheim-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edersheim 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1986</LINK>) whereas those with false negatives used a five-second stimulus (<LINK REF="REF-Ingemarsson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingemarsson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irion-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irion 1996</LINK>). Different intensity of sound from different models of artificial larynx may also contribute to the occurrence of false negatives: <LINK REF="REF-Polzin-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polzin 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2001</LINK>, who both reported false negatives, used different vibroacoustic stimulators to those used in the other studies cited. This possibility is supported by studies that examined the FHR response to scalp stimulation during fetal scalp blood sampling. Many fetuses exhibit an acceleration of their heart rate following such an intense stimulus, although the pH may be less than 7.20 (<LINK REF="REF-Ingemarsson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingemarsson 1989</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-11-01 14:18:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fetal VAS is a simple, non-invasive technique that has the potential to provide reassurance of fetal well-being. Because of its simplicity and non-invasiveness, VAS has been proposed as a tool to assess fetal well-being in the presence of a nonreassuring CTG during the first and second stages of labour. Such an inexpensive test may be particularly useful in primary care when more sophisticated devices and/or interventions are not readily available (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1998</LINK>). Since VAS is used and is perceived as convenient, quick, and effective, it is important that scientific research supports the use of VAS as a safe test of fetal well-being. This review will assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of VAS used to assess fetal well-being in labour in the presence of a nonreassuring CTG.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-11-01 14:19:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intrapartum fetal vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) in the assessment of fetal well-being, compared with mock or no stimulation for women with a singleton pregnancy exhibiting a nonreassuring cardiotocographic (CTG) trace, considering the following hypotheses.<BR/>(i) Compared with mock or no stimulation, VAS may reduce the number of tests performed to confirm the presence or absence of fetal acidaemia.<BR/>(ii) Compared with mock or no stimulation, VAS may reduce the number of tests performed to evaluate fetal well-being without increasing the rate of fetal or neonatal acidaemia.<BR/>(iii) Compared with mock or no stimulation, VAS may reduce the number of operative deliveries (caesarean section, vacuum, forceps) performed for the indication of nonreassuring status.<BR/>(iv) Compared with mock or no stimulation, VAS may reduce the number of operative deliveries (caesarean section, vacuum, forceps) performed for the indication of nonreassuring status without increasing the rate of fetal or neonatal acidaemia.<BR/>(v) Compared with mock or no stimulation, VAS may reduce the overall number of operative deliveries (caesarean section, vacuum, forceps).</P>
<P>A secondary objective of the review is to determine whether the effectiveness and safety of intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation is influenced by the following:<BR/>(i) stage of labour;<BR/>(ii) gestation: 26 to 31 weeks six days, or 32 to 36 weeks six days, or at least 37 weeks;<BR/>(iii) duration of stimulus: less than five seconds or at least five seconds;<BR/>(iv) maternal administration of magnesium sulphate or steroids.</P>

<P>All published and unpublished individually- or cluster-randomised trials that compared maternal and fetal/neonatal/infant outcomes when VAS was used to evaluate fetal status in the presence of a nonreassuring CTG, compared with mock or no stimulation. Mock stimulation is achieved by placing the vibroacoustic device against the maternal abdomen in the same manner as for a stimulus, but without activating the stimulus. It is important to distinguish mock from no stimulation to facilitate 'blinding' of the women to treatment allocation, which may in turn influence their report of fetal movement. Cross-over study designs are unlikely to be relevant for this intervention and were therefore unlikely to be identified. We planned not to include results only available in published abstracts.</P>

<P>The need for simple, non-invasive evaluation of fetal well-being once a nonreassuring cardiotocographic trace (CTG) has been recorded in labour is important in attempts to reserve intervention, such as operative birth, for those fetuses truly warranting it. Current methods, including fetal scalp blood sampling, fetal electrocardiograph and fetal pulse oximetry, while offering additional and important information, are invasive, cumbersome, sometimes of uncertain benefit and not always available or widely utilised (<LINK REF="REF-Amer_x002d_Wahlin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amer-Wahlin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-East-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-East-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ingemarsson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingemarsson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Westgren-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westgren 1998</LINK>).

Following from this evaluation, randomised controlled trials could address its safety and efficacy in the assessment of fetal well-being when the fetus has demonstrated a nonreassuring heart-rate pattern during labour.</P>

<P>There are currently no randomised controlled trials that address the safety and efficacy of fetal vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) following demonstration of a nonreassuring cardiotocograph (CTG) during labour. Although VAS is a simple, non-invasive test of fetal well-being, there is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to show whether VAS is effective in the evaluation of fetal well-being during labour.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-10-04 09:33:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Well conducted randomised controlled trials addressing the safety and effectiveness of VAS during labour are required before intrapartum VAS can be considered to have been adequately evaluated. Outcomes of interest could include those listed in this review. The primary outcome may be long-term neurodevelopmental disability: however, at least in the term fetus population, it is an adverse outcome of such low prevalence that any change would be difficult to power without a prohibitively large sample size. An outcome of clinical relevance may be as simple as the number of additional tests performed to assess fetal well-being following identification of a nonreassuring CTG, through to operative delivery rates.</P>

<P>Women at least 37 weeks' gestation with cephalic presentation of a singleton fetus, no heavy meconium, full cervical dilatation and a reassuring CTG were entered into a prospective randomised observational trial. The study group (n = 316) had an artificial larynx activated for 5 seconds above the maternal symphysis. Controls (n = 316) did not have the instrument activated. An investigator blinded to group allocation assessed the fetal heart rate tracing in the 5 minutes following the stimulus for (i) acceleration, (ii) acceleration followed by deceleration and (iii) no response. There were no differences in umbilical arterial pH or Apgar score at 5 minutes. There were more fetal heart rate accelerations and accelerations followed by decelerations in the study group than the control group (77.2% versus 12.5%, P &lt; 0.05). Within the 3 groups of fetal heart rate response following the stimulus in the study group, there were no significant differences in fetal growth restriction, umbilical arterial pH or Apgar score less than 7 at 5 minutes. There were more cases of nuchal cord in the subgroup of cases with fetal heart rate acceleration followed by deceleration, than in the other 2 fetal heart rate response groups.</P>

<P>All published and unpublished randomised trials that compare maternal and fetal/neonatal/infant outcomes when vibroacoustic stimulation is used to evaluate fetal status in the presence of a non-reassuring cardiotocographic, compared with mock or no stimulation. Mock stimulation would be achieved by placing the vibroacoustic device against the maternal abdomen in the same manner as for a stimulus, but without activating the stimulus. It is important to distinguish mock from no stimulation to facilitate 'blinding' of the women to treatment allocation, which may in turn influence their report of fetal movement.</P>

<P>Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL and MEDLINE (1966 to present), the list of hand searched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the 'Search strategies for identification of studies' section within the editorial information about the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group</P>
<P>We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2004), and EMBASE (January 1966 to May 2004) using the following:</P>
<P>(randomised controlled trial* OR randomized controlled trial* OR controlled clinical trial OR clinical trial OR single blind OR double blind OR placebo* OR random* OR comparative study OR prospective stud*) AND (vibroacoustic OR stimul* OR acoustic) AND (fetal OR fetus OR foetal OR foetus) AND (labour OR labor OR intrapartum).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Searching other resources  </HEADING>
<P>We also performed a manual search of the references of all retrieved articles. We sought unpublished trials and abstracts submitted to major international congresses and contacted expert informants.</P>
<P>We did not apply any language restrictions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis  </HEADING>
<P>We used the standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). Two review authors (CE East and N Henshall) assessed the trials under consideration for appropriateness of inclusion and methodological quality. Any differences of opinion would have been resolved by discussion with a third review author (LR Leader): there were no differences of opinion requiring resolution. We did not undertake blinding of trial authorship and results.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of trial quality</HEADING>
<P>Four major sources of potential bias and methods or avoidance of these biases were to be considered when assessing trial quality: (1) selection bias - allocation concealment; (2) performance bias - blinding of intervention; (3) attrition bias - completeness of follow up; (4) detection bias - blinding of outcome assessment. The quality assessment was based on a systematic assessment of the opportunity for each of these biases to arise.</P>
<P>A quality rating for allocation concealment was to be assigned to each trial, using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>): (A) adequate; (B) unclear; (C) inadequate; or (D) not used. We planned to assign a quality rating of (A) yes; (B) cannot tell; or (C) no, to the other quality components (blinding of intervention, completeness of follow up and blinding of outcome assessment).</P>
<P>Trials from the review with a 'B', 'C' or 'D' rating for allocation concealment would have been excluded. We made an <I>a priori</I> decision to also exclude trials where outcome data were unavailable for more than 20% of participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data management and analysis</HEADING>
<P>We developed data extraction forms that included information regarding study location, methods, participant characteristics at baseline, details of the intervention and control group management and outcome. Two independent review authors would have extracted the data and disagreements would have been resolved by discussion. We would have sought missing data from investigators of individual trials as necessary in order to perform analyses on an intention-to-treat basis. We planned to undertake double data entry.</P>
<P>We planned to report mean differences (and 95% confidence intervals) for continuous variables. For categorical outcomes, we intended to report the relative risk and risk difference (and 95% confidence intervals). For the meta-analysis, where possible, we planned to report weighted mean differences (and 95% confidence intervals) for continuous variables, and the relative risk and risk difference (and 95% confidence intervals) for categorical outcomes. We intended to calculate the number needed to treat where appropriate.</P>
<P>We did not assess heterogeneity since there were no studies to include in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We planned to undertake a priori subgroup analyses, as data permitted, as follows:<BR/>(i) stage of labour;<BR/>(ii) gestation: 26 to 31 weeks six days, 32 to 36 weeks six days, at least 37 weeks;<BR/>(iii) duration of stimulus: less than five seconds or at least five seconds;<BR/>(iv) maternal administration of magnesium sulphate or steroids.</P>
