Thanks for the edits and RoB corrections Emma. I have accepted changes and made a few extra edits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC July 9th. Thanks for your excellent suggestions to improve the text Emma. I have accepted most of them. Time in hospital is only a primary outcome for the in-patient studies so I have taken this out for the ED comparison. The double dummy design has been checked for all studies and Additional table and tables of included studies updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am happy with this now. Brian saw the update in May so we could send it to him alongside progressing the update I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC June 27th Numbers corrected for Volumatic versus other types in text to match Analysis 4.1 numbers (rather than the totals in Table 1)! Also a short sentence added to changing practice to reflect the fact that current guidelines recommend MDI/spacer delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma J notes 7/5/13: 'Ref not linked' message for Jadad 1996; also the following headings are not activated - should they be?: 'measures of treatment effect', 'unit of analysis issues', 'dealing with missing data', 'assessment of reporting biases', 'subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC responses to changes from Emma 2 May 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most changes have been accepted. However I stand by the implications for research. Single treatment studies have no place, but multiple treatments have been used in those with more sere exacerbations ( eg Turner an included study).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do no think William Griffiths should be on the author line so have amended him in acknowledgements. I think Jac Crilly wants to come off as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma notes for Chris (as author)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;inconsistency in use of chi2 and I2 - would be better to replace with I2 in the results and in the methods (mark as change from protocol)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;discussion - &amp;quot;The studies included in this review used dosage ratios varying from 1:1 to 1:13 (lower dose in the spacer)&amp;quot; I'm not sure what the ratio is? Is it between dose used in spacer and nebuliser? or different doses tested out in the studies?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC March 7th. Text checked through but now needs to incorporate SoF table! Following Edits by Emma, children SoF moved up, minutes reported in whole numbers, and decided not to downgrade duration in ED following Emma's suggestion. Also modified the Forest plots by turning off totals and showing a random effects model for outcomes with considerable heterogeneity! Comparison 4 time in ER updated to minutes rather than hours too. (April 23rd).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC FEb 28th 2013 Yasmin added and dichotomous data on responders. Discrepancies in Continuous data reported so not reliable without author confirmation!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;22 August numbers in each type of trial added. RoB might need an update here (with the help of ST4 doctors). Changed ED duration to minutes to be easier for readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direk added to treatment failure outcome as shown in Figure 1 (done). CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need to check NUMBERS of children again!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August 2011 email to Jamaree Direk to ask about sequence generation and allocation concealment. I need to add his data on treatment failure 19 v 16 too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 2011 Imported 10 references for potential inclusion! Alves belongs to Chong Neto. Ferres now has data from Jeronimo so include this time. Parente no contact (from last time around). Three references for Direkwatanachai! Two studies to incorporate. There were 24 references in the search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three new excluded studies, Fayaz not randomised, Hart not acute and Kashmiri infants under two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferres details added to included studies table and to single study outcomes only for admission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cols=&quot;0&quot; rows=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;41&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;48&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;and final PEF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cols=&quot;0&quot; rows=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;68.8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;41&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;64.9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;8.6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;48&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;8th July 2011 data entry by CJC:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direk also added to included studies, admissions 1/68 and 2/77, but pulse rate change not added as raw data not provided for % change!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cols=&quot;0&quot; rows=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;-4.84&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.73&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;68&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;-5.64&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.38&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;77&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;and Spo2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cols=&quot;0&quot; rows=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;0.68&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.07&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;68&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;0.75&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.94&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;77&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;also added from Table 4 in the paper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steroid use added from table 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cols=&quot;0&quot; rows=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;53&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;68&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;55&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;77&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tremor added from Table 5 (large proportion of missing patients here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cols=&quot;0&quot; rows=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;43&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;52&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results section needs revision with new total numbers etc!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 2011 Rodrigo 1993 FEV1 data improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 2009 Dhuper added from full text article. PhD thesis awaits response from author and Brazilian fenoterol abstract will have to await publication for now. Risk of Bias and Single study numbers need to be cleared (done and Table updated too). Also number of abstracts and excluded studies from latest search need entering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;September 1st 2008. Osmond reference added and minor changes made following comments from BR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 24 2008. Toby has sorted risk of bias tables and two new studies added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;15 Feb 06&lt;br&gt;Toby has brought the references up to date as suggested by peer reviewer, likewise the following changes.&lt;br&gt;Powell reference added.&lt;br&gt;Volumatic removed from the abstract methods. &amp;quot;In view of the recent discontinuation of Volumatic spacers in the UK, results from studies using different types of spacer have been compared as a sensitivity analysis. No significant differences were found between the results from trials using Volumatic (188 adults and 364 children) and those using other types of spacer (433 adults and 907 children). Hospital admission in children is unaltered when studies using Volumatic spacers are excluded, but for adults the confidence interval for admission is wider as less data is available, relative risk 1.45 (95% CI: 0.6 to 3.53).&amp;quot; Removed from abstract.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Nebulisers require a power source and need regular maintenance, and are more expensive in the community setting.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The studies using salbutamol all used the racemic form of the drug.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Studies on children with a mean age of two years or more were included, as it is difficult to diagnose asthma under this age.&amp;quot; Participants explained.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Implications for research&lt;br&gt;(1) Further studies are required to confirm whether these findings, largely from hospital emergency departments, can be replicated in the community setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) Further studies in children and adults with more severe asthma are required to confirm whether spacers are as efficacious as nebulisers in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) In order to avoid confounding due to differences in the dose of drug delivered to the airways, future studies should use multiple treatments at short intervals titrated against individual patient response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4) Implementation of change from nebulizers to spacers needs further work.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;IMPLEMENTATION OF CHANGE IN PRACTICE&lt;br&gt;Implementing research findings is not an easy process, and Powell 2001found that successfully changing hospital practice from nebulisers to spacers required a structured strategy to overcome the &amp;quot;nebuliser culture&amp;quot; both in hospital medical and nursing staff, as well as parents and families of children with asthma.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby could you submit this and send the final version to Brian and Jac?&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;17 Jan 06&lt;br&gt;Thanks for tidying this up Brian. B2 changed as suggested and FEV1.&lt;br&gt;I have uploaded this to Archie.&lt;br&gt;Toby could we see if Brian Lipworth is interested in Peer Reviewing this and possibly Prof Andy Bush at the Brompton who did the first Peer Review for us?&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;Chris (and Toby)&lt;br&gt;1) Very minor edits in red;&lt;br&gt;2) I accepted the ones you left for me (thanks);&lt;br&gt;3) Department of Emergency Medicine now 9instead of Division);&lt;br&gt;4) I standardized (or standardised) the way you were writing effect measures (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.44, 1.46) vs (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.44, 1.46);&lt;br&gt;5) I also standardized citing references (Smith 1998; Jones 2001; Cates 2000) vs (Smith 1998;Jones 2001;Cates 2000);&lt;br&gt;6) I wondered about replacing beta-2-agonists with B2-agonists (see abstract) and sub-scripted FEV1 term. Not sure what people are doing, but it looks nicer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian&lt;br&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;13/1/06 Duarte Table of studies corrected. Discussion updated. New section on spacer type included. Holding chamber changed to spacer in most of text .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11/1/06 FEV1 and Pulse data from Chong-neto calculated and added. Results section updated for multiple treamtents. In-patient awaited. Vivek details incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4/1/06 Email sent to Chong-neto for mean and SD of FEV1 and pulse rate. Abstract and text updated. Start at pulse rate next time in results section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3/1/2006&lt;br&gt;Burrows contacted. This is an in-patient study so will need to liaise with Jac. What's new section completed. Vivek email re spacer type. Results will need futher amendment. Chong-neto 2005 added to what's new and admissions data and table of spacers. Results and Conclusions need a re-write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;2006 Update&lt;br&gt;For the 2006 update of this review 4 new trials have been added: Burrows 2005 including 29 paediatric in-patients, Hussein 2002 including 60 children given a single treatment, Rao 2002 including 50 adults given multiple treatments and Vivek 2003 including 120 patients aged 10-50 (and therefore classified as adult) given multiple treatments.&lt;br&gt;An additional table has been added with details of the holding chambers used in each study, and new comparisons added according to type of chamber. This has been done because Volumatic spacers are no longer being manufactured.&lt;br&gt;The conclusions of the review are unchanged.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=====================================================&lt;br&gt;9/12/05&lt;br&gt;Data from Vivek added but questions pending for table of included studies. Vilarinho and Shaikh and Deerojanawong added as excluded study. Hussein 2002 added as single study and results in table of studies and admissions on MetaView. Rao 2002 added to included studies. Hospital admission, ad and poor treatment, final FEV1, 30 min fev1 all get new data. Excel spreadsheet to enter this data. Results section will need to be amended! Heterogeneity high in 30 min result (Turner rise and SD much smaller than other studies?) Pulse rate and Resp rate likewise. (New stats for differences between adults and children)? Letters sent to RAo and Hussein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;1/11/05&lt;br&gt;Additional Table with details of spacers used. Comparison 4 split to show separate data for Volumatic *** THIS NEEDS COMMENT IN TEXT***&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;4/4/05&lt;br&gt;Ploin reference in French added by Toby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=================================&lt;br&gt;1/11/2001 the corrected data has been received from Dr Leversha and entered into the review. This is now ready for Paul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12/10 ANSWERS TO BRIANS POINTS IN CAPS.&lt;br&gt;08/10/01&lt;br&gt;Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still think the focus on the time in the ED is rather overblown. The results originate from only 1 study with a small sample; moreover, what is clinically &amp;quot;signiciant&amp;quot; here?&lt;br&gt;In &amp;quot;search&amp;quot; see addition in CAPS; ALTERED RESULTS IN ABSTRACT TO REFLECT THIS - THANKS. DOMINIQUE PLOIN DID HIS RCT TO TRY TO SAVE TIME IN HIS PEDIATRIC ED SO THIS DOES MATTER TO SOME AT LEAST&lt;br&gt;discussion: Careful with tense which mostly is past, but sometimes you've used present tense. Other changes in CAPs.&lt;br&gt;Acknowledgements - switched &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reviewers&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;Your format for the meta-views differs for dichotomous and continuous variables. For example, &amp;quot;nebulizer better&amp;quot; is on the right side for hospital admissions, yet it is on the left for PFTs. Shouldn't we try to be consistent here? THIS IS THE NEW POLICY.&lt;br&gt;Some of the graphs could have better choices of &amp;quot;scales&amp;quot; they look better with higher scales. DONE THANKS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;20/9/2001&lt;br&gt;Mandelberg 2000 added as an excluded study as median age in less than 2 years. i HAVE GONE OUT ON A LIMB HERE AND CHANGED THE BINARY SUMMARY STATS TO RELATIVE RISKS IN ORDER TO AID INTERPRETATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OF THE RESULTS............! ALSO ALL THE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN REMOVED AGAIN. text now needs to be matche up to Meta-view.&lt;br&gt;13/9/2001&lt;br&gt;Additional action needed: Mention the split to admission and poor outcomes. Valencia reports tachycardia in 21.9% of spacer group and 36.8% of nebuliser group in line with the WMD for the other studies in children. Respiratory Rate has been changed to default to Random model due to heterogeneity but pooled across adults and children.&lt;br&gt;24/7/01 Valencia data still needs to be added by CJC. THIS HAS NOW BEEN DONE INCLUDING POOR RESPONSE AS EXTRA OUTCOME WITH ADMISSIONS (SIMILAR TO THE BATRA STUDY) NEED TO CHECK BATRA RESPIRATORY DATA AS IT LOOKS LIKE % CHANGE. in fact it is not but resp rates were very high at first assessment.&lt;br&gt;28/6/2001&lt;br&gt;Leversha admission data included and added with characteristics. Other data entered using confidence intervals from table 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;19/3/2001&lt;br&gt;Ivan Solarte trial should be included (BR agreed). chapman excluded (under 2), wildhaber (chronic), Rubilar (under 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;14/10/99&lt;br&gt;All the lung function data in this review is back to negative!!!! Also the sentence about negative outcomes is restored&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8_99 Checklist&lt;br&gt;Authors contributions - NO&lt;br&gt;Synopsis - OK&lt;br&gt;Abstract background - OK&lt;br&gt;Metaview labels - reversed for FEV1, and data now real for FEV1&lt;br&gt;Links have been checked to references. Where are the other references?&lt;br&gt;Found from the April update and added as well as updating the discussion.&lt;br&gt;Now only the new studies to enter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;30/8/99&lt;br&gt;Rodrigo 99 study added and data included in final FEV, PEF and tremor. Dose ratio of 2.5 to one in this study, supported by regression analysis.&lt;br&gt;31/8/99&lt;br&gt;Batra study added with admission data, pulse and respiratory rate. WMD in pulse in children now appears to be -8&lt;br&gt;1/9/99 Robertson study added. Single dose. Authors comment that multiple actuations, new spacer and 1to 4 dose ratio may have compromised the spacer response.&lt;br&gt;Mandelberg study excluded as no separate asthma data.&lt;br&gt;9/99&lt;br&gt;Maldano included and mentioned in the text. No SD so not in Metaview. Synopsis and abstract background added. Results altered slightly for WMD of pulse and OR of admission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;4/2/2003 CJC&lt;br&gt;Copy editing checked and passed on to Toby for the next issue of the Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References updated for included and excluded studies (refs added for Dewar and Morley)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included and excluded studies also updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Two Comparisons tidied up but work to do on the third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third Outcome data all re-entered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new section amended and reviewers' contributions. &amp;quot; One open trial in children has been added for the 2003 update (Duarte 2002) including a further 196 children studied in an emergency room setting in Brazil.&lt;br&gt;In addition the 2003 update has expanded the review to include trials on in-patients and 5 new trials have been added including 184 children and 28 adults (Ba 1989, Coker 1995, Dewar 1999, Morley 1988 and Parkin 1995). The results of the in-patient trials have not been pooled, but are in keeping with the findings in the emergency room and community setting, that holding chambers can be as effective as nebulisers for delivery of beta-agonists in acute asthma.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Last search date Nov 2002 added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact reviewer details added for JAC and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis - altered to include in-patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract - &amp;quot;Main results&lt;br&gt;This review has been updated in 2003 and has now analysed 1076 children and 444 adults included in 22 trials from emergency room and community settings. In addition, five trials on in-patients with acute asthma (184 children and 28 adults) have been added to the review. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In children length of stay in the emergency department was significantly shorter when the holding chamber was used, with a weighted mean difference of -0.47 hours, 95% confidence interval -0.58 to -0.37 hours. Adults' length of stay in the emergency department was similar for the two delivery methods. Peak flow and forced expiratory volume were also similar for the two delivery methods. Pulse rate was lower for holding chamber in children, weighted mean difference -7.6% baseline (95% confidence interval -9.9 to -5.3). &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;TEXT OF REVIEW&lt;br&gt;Criteria for considering studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Types of participants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults and children (but not infants) with an acute exacerbation of asthma presenting for medical assistance in the community setting or hospital emergency department. Studies describing patients who had already been admitted to hospital have been included in this update. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of studies&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;All studies used commercially available holding chambers (Aerochamber, Babyhaler, InspirEase,Nebuhaler and Volumatic), except for the most recent study from Brazil (Duarte 2002), in which home-made spacers were used in the form of a 500ml mineral water plastic bottle coated with detergent to avoid electrostatic charge.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;112 abstracts were originally identified from the database and 44 were selected for possible inclusion in the review. For the 2003 update 148 abstracts were identified and 43 selected for possible inclusion. One abstract was identified from the references in the included studies (Hodder 1988). The full text of each paper was obtained and translated when necessary (two from Spanish and one from Portuguese). Papers were excluded for the following reasons: studies on non-acute asthma, different drugs delivered and no separate data for asthma patients (see table of excluded studies). A total of 12 papers were initially included for this review and ten further papers have now been added (Williams 1996; Batra 1997; Raimondi 1997; Robertson 1998; Rodrigo 1998; Rodriguez 1999; Valencia 1999; Leversha 2000; Ploin 2000;Duarte 2002). There are now 1076 children and 444 adults in the included trials in emergency departments and the community. In addition five trials have been included in the 2003 update, incorporating 184 children and 28 adults studied after hospital admission (Ba 1989;Coker 1995;Dewar 1999;Morley 1988;Parkin 1995).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Time spent in the Emergency Department originally showed significant heterogeneity when the results from adults and children were pooled, (Chi squared = 8.2, df = 2, p &amp;lt; 0.02). This heterogeneity could not be explained on the basis of methodological quality, since the result was based on trials that were all of high methodological quality. However, no significant heterogeneity was demonstrated when adults and children were analysed separately. The results for adults and children have therefore been shown in separate sub-groups in the analyses. Duration in the ED in children was significantly shorter with the holding chamber (WMD = -0.47 hours; 95% CI: -0.58 to -0.37 hours). This finding is based on two studies (Chou 1995;Duarte 2002) containing 348 participants, however, they were not double dummy studies which may have a bearing on the heterogeneity and these results should be interpreted with caution. In adults the duration of the ED visit was similar in both groups (WMD = 0.02 hours; 95% CI: -0.4 to 0.44 hours). Results in children and adults are based on a fixed-effect model but are not significantly altered when a random-effects model is used. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pulse rate after treatment was significantly lower when a chamber was used in children (WMD -7.59% baseline; 95% CI: -9.94 to -5.24%). In adults no significant difference was found between methods (WMD -8.2% baseline; 95% CI: -3.92 to 2.27% baseline). These results were similar for fixed and random effects models.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;CLINICAL PRACTICE&lt;br&gt;Nebulisers are commonly used to deliver beta-agonists in acute asthma in the community and in hospital emergency departments. Although holding chambers have also been advocated for use in these circumstances, published guidelines give few details about how they should be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this review supports the equivalence of wet nebuliser and holding chamber administration of beta-agonists in the treatment of acute asthma. A recent before and after study from an Emergency Department in Cincinnati (Newman 2002) assessed the consequences of changing the treatment algorithm from nebulised albuterol (salbutamol) to administration to MDI/spacer as the primary mode of delivery. Admission rates did not rise following the change in delivery method and duration of stay in the Emergency Department fell significantly from 175 minutes to 164 minutes. There were also reductions in charges but these did not reach significance. Lower relapse rates following the change to MDI/spacer delivery were confounded by other changes, such as an asthma bag containing a spacer, peak-flow meter, instructional handout and canister of inhaled corticosteroid given to the patients. This makes data on relapse rates difficult to interpret, although significant reductions were seen following the combined interventions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have not put all the minor changes to this review in the notes but the main changes are as above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;18_2_3&lt;br&gt;Edited by BHR&lt;br&gt;Added intramural and extramural funding from Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis - changed to: In adults, no important differences&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract Data - added: Results are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI).&lt;br&gt;Abstract results- changed 95% confidence intervals to 95% CI.&lt;br&gt;Abstract results- changed to: In children, length of stay in the emergency&amp;#8230;&lt;br&gt;Abstract results- changed to: Length of stay in the emergency department for adults&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: added periods where missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;Participants - you use the term &amp;quot;acute exacerbation of asthma&amp;quot;.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-04 17:57:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>When someone is having an asthma attack is it as safe and effective to use a spacer instead of a nebuliser?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>During an asthma attack, the airways (tubes in the lungs) narrow making breathing difficult. The initial response to an asthma attack is to treat with a drug that can open up the airways and make breathing easier. These drugs are called bronchodilators and in this review we are looking specifically at a class of bronchodilators called beta-agonists (for example salbutamol). These drugs can be taken straight from an inhaler, but during an asthma attack they are easier to take using either a spacer or a nebuliser. A spacer is a hollow chamber. A puff of drug from an inhaler is added to the chamber and then the person breathes in and out normally (also described as tidal breathing), from a mouthpiece on the chamber. A nebuliser is a machine with a mask that goes over the person's mouth and nose and through which a constant stream of drug and air (or oxygen) is breathed in and out normally.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We found 39 clinical trials involving 1897 children and 729 adults. Thirty-three of the trials were conducted in an emergency room (or emergency department) and community settings (such as a GP's surgery), and six trials were on inpatients (people in hospital) with acute asthma (207 children and 28 adults). Overall we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate.</P>
<P>
<B>What do the studies tell us?</B>
</P>
<P>Taking beta-agonists through either a spacer or a nebuliser in the emergency department did not make a difference to the number of adults being admitted to hospital, whilst in children we can be fairly confident that nebulisers are not better than spacers at preventing admissions.</P>
<P>In children, the length of stay in the emergency department was significantly shorter when the spacer was used instead of a nebuliser. The average stay in the emergency department for children given nebulised treatment was 103 minutes. Children given treatment via spacers spent an average of 33 minutes less.</P>
<P>In adults, the length of stay in the emergency department was similar for the two delivery methods. However the adult studies were conducted slightly differently which may have made it more difficult to show a difference in the length of stay in the emergency department. Because all the adult studies used a so-called "double-dummy" design, the adults received a spacer AND a nebuliser (either beta-agonist in a spacer and a dummy nebuliser or vice versa) which meant both groups of people were in the emergency department for as long as it took to take both treatments.</P>
<P>Lung function tests were also similar for the two delivery methods in both adults and children. Pulse rate was lower in children taking beta-agonists through a spacer (mean difference -5% baseline), and there was a lower risk of developing tremor.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>Metered-dose inhalers with a spacer can perform at least as well as wet nebulisation in delivering beta&#8322;-agonists in children with acute asthma, but we are less certain about the results in adults.</P>
<P>The review is current as of February 2013.</P>

<P>In acute asthma inhaled beta&#8322;-agonists are often administered by nebuliser to relieve bronchospasm, but some have argued that metered-dose inhalers with a holding chamber (spacer) can be equally effective.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-30 15:06:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This review includes a total of 1897 children and 729 adults in 39 trials. Thirty-three trials were conducted in the emergency room and equivalent community settings, and six trials were on inpatients with acute asthma (207 children and 28 adults). The method of delivery of beta&#8322;-agonist did not show a significant difference in hospital admission rates. In adults, the risk ratio (RR) of admission for spacer versus nebuliser was 0.94 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.43). The risk ratio for children was 0.71 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.08, moderate quality evidence). In children, length of stay in the emergency department was significantly shorter when the spacer was used. The mean duration in the emergency department for children given nebulised treatment was 103 minutes, and for children given treatment via spacers 33 minutes less (95% CI -43 to -24 minutes, moderate quality evidence). Length of stay in the emergency department for adults was similar for the two delivery methods. Peak flow and forced expiratory volume were also similar for the two delivery methods. Pulse rate was lower for spacer in children, mean difference -5% baseline (95% CI -8% to -2%, moderate quality evidence), as was the risk of developing tremor (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.95, moderate quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-30 15:06:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Nebuliser delivery produced outcomes that were not significantly better than metered-dose inhalers delivered by spacer in adults or children, in trials where treatments were repeated and titrated to the response of the participant. Spacers may have some advantages compared to nebulisers for children with acute asthma. The studies excluded people with life-threatening asthma; therefore, the results of this meta-analysis should not be extrapolated to this patient population.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition and intervention</HEADING>
<P>Exacerbations of asthma are common and account for a considerable number of physician encounters, both in hospital and in primary care. In exacerbations the airways become narrowed due to mucosal oedema, hypersecretion and bronchospasm. Depending on the severity of the attack, treatment with inhaled beta&#8322;-agonists is often required in addition to other agents such as corticosteroids. The use of beta&#8322;-agonists is intended to relieve the bronchospasm. This is accomplished most effectively when the drug is delivered to the peripheral airways. This is made more difficult in acute asthma since the narrowed airways and faster respiratory rate result in increased drug deposition in the throat and large airways. Consequently, it is less effective and may cause more side effects.</P>
<P>Two different delivery methods have been employed to overcome this problem: wet nebulisations and metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) with a holding chamber (spacer). Nebulisation creates a mist of beta&#8322;-agonist diluted in saline which is inhaled through a mask by tidal breathing. Nebulisation can be accomplished with room air or supplemental oxygen, and requires a supply of compressed gas or a power source. More recently, beta&#8322;-agonists delivered via MDIs through a spacer have been used in acute asthma. The drug is released into the spacer by pressing the MDI after it has been shaken and inserted into the spacer (also called 'actuation'). The drug in the spacer is then emptied by the person using either tidal breathing (normal breathing in and out) or a single deep breath.</P>

<P>Whilst nebulisers have historically been used in exacerbations of asthma, a meta-analysis of trials in adults with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suggested that metered-dose inhalers with a spacer are as effective (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>).There has been considerable controversy regarding the merits of each delivery method, but current guidelines have now moved towards the use of spacers in acute asthma, particularly in children (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2011</LINK>). In addition, cost and infection control considerations may be important additional determinants of which system is employed. For example, in the community the cost of nebulisers exceeds a spacer and MDI. In hospital emergency departments, the cost calculations are more complex since disposable nebuliser masks are often driven by piped oxygen; costs may depend on whether or not all patients are sent home with a new spacer. Nebulisers also represent a potential source of cross-infection, and require regular maintenance. As a result of these controversies, this systematic review has been updated to assess all the available evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing the two delivery methods in adults and children with acute asthma.</P>

<P>Heterogeneity was originally measured using the Chi²<SUP> </SUP>test and latterly the I² statistics for more recent updates. Where heterogeneity was found, we explored sources of heterogeneity and pooled results using a random-effects model, or did not pool across subgroups.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-09-04 18:05:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>We calculated a weighted treatment effect across trials using the Cochrane statistical package, Review Manager (RevMan; initially version 4, now 5.2). Results are expressed as risk ratios (RR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and a 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We used a fixed-effect model for continuous outcomes, but also checked results using a random-effects model.</P>
<P>We have now separated the results for adults and children in each outcome, in view of the significant heterogeneity identified in the pooled analyses. Furthermore it can be argued that adults and children may differ in their ability to use the devices, their degree of airways reversibility and in their sensitivity to side effects from inhaled beta&#8322;-agonists.</P>
<P>We have not pooled the single-treatment trials because of concerns over confounding due to uncertainty about the relative dose delivered and the wide range of dose-ratios used (from 1:1 to 1:13, with the larger doses administered via nebuliser).</P>

<P>We performed sensitivity analyses on the basis of methodological quality. The results were originally re-analysed using only studies of the lowest risk of bias. Sensitivity analyses were performed to check on the effect of estimating standard deviations and the data re-analysed without any estimated results. In addition, we generated a funnel plot of hospital admissions to check for publication bias. In view of the temporary discontinuation of Volumatic spacers in some countries, we also separated the trials that used Volumatic from other types of spacer in an additional post hoc subgroup analysis.</P>

<P>There are now 1203 children (in 15 trials) and 613 adults (in 10 trials) who were randomised to spacer or nebuliser using multiple-treatment protocols.

The single pre-hospital study comparing nebulisation to metered-dose inhaler (MDI) (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1995</LINK>) was excluded, as there was no randomisation.

<P>Overall, the methodological quality of the included studies was variable, with sequence generation and allocation concealment not described in many studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Many studies did not comment on withdrawals and dropouts, and also did not report whether intention-to-treat analysis was employed, but in short-term trials of acute treatment we would not expect large numbers of dropouts. The hospital admission rate reported in one study has been amended using an intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Colacone-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Colacone 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general the sample size of many individual studies was small, (range 18 to 196 participants in the emergency-room studies, and 28 to 61 for inpatients). Whilst eight of the 13 studies in adults used a double-blind, double-dummy design (<LINK REF="STD-Colacone-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Colacone 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dhuper-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dhuper 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Idris-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Idris 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salzman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Salzman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1988</LINK>) only six of the 26 studies in children were double-blind (<LINK REF="STD-Ba-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ba 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chong_x002d_Neto-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chong-Neto 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kerem 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leversha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leversha 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ploin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ploin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1998</LINK>); see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Spacer versus nebuliser multiple treatments</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Primary outcome: Hospital admission</HEADING>
<P>Hospital admission rates did not differ significantly on the basis of delivery method in adults (risk ratio (RR) 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.43, 9 trials, n = 582; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) or in children (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.08, 9 trials, n = 757; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). No significant heterogeneity was observed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Subgroup analysis by type of spacer</HEADING>
<P>In the light of the decision to temporarily withdraw Volumatic spacers from the UK market in 2005, we carried out a post hoc sensitivity analysis according to whether Volumatic spacers were used in each study. The type of spacer used is documented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and this shows that the majority of adults and children studied used other types of spacer. No significant differences were found between the results from trials using Volumatic (166 adults and 163 children) and those using other types of spacer (366 adults and 515 children). There were no significant differences between the results for Volumatic and other spacer types in either adults or children (see <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). No studies included a direct comparison between Volumatic and other types of spacer.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Secondary outcome: Treatment failure</HEADING>
<P>Three studies in children did not report admissions but did report data on poor outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Batra-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Batra 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leversha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leversha 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yasmin-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yasmin 2012</LINK>). When these are pooled together with the data on hospital admissions, the risk ratio in children of admission or poor outcome is not significantly different between spacer and nebuliser (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.33, 12 trials, n = 937; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). The definition of treatment failure varied across studies, and we included these data post hoc.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Secondary outcome: Time spent in emergency department</HEADING>
<P>Time spent in the emergency department (ED) showed significant heterogeneity when the results from adults and children were pooled in the original version of this review, (Chi² = 8.2, df = 2, P &lt; 0.02). However, no significant heterogeneity was demonstrated when adults and children were analysed separately at that time. The results for adults and children have therefore been shown in separate subgroups in the analyses in <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>.</P>
<P>Duration in the ED in children was significantly shorter with the spacer (mean difference (MD) -33 minutes; 95% CI -43 to -24 minutes, I² = 66%, 3 studies, n = 398; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). This finding is based on three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chou-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chou 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duarte-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duarte 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sannier-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sannier 2007</LINK>), containing 396 participants, in which the median duration in ED on nebulised treatment was 103 minutes. The studies in children were open-label and did not use a double-dummy design, whereas the studies in adults were double-dummy so adults would have received both nebuliser and spacer. This is likely to have had a bearing on these results as nebulisation is much more time-consuming than use of MDI and spacer (<LINK REF="STD-Duarte-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duarte 2002</LINK>). In adults the duration of the ED visit was similar in both groups (MD 2 minutes; 95% CI -23 to 27 minutes; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Results in children and adults are shown using a random-effects model.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Secondary outcome: Lung function</HEADING>
<P>No significant differences were demonstrated between the two delivery methods in terms of peak flow and forced expiratory volume (FEV&#8321;) at 30 minutes and at the end of the study in either adults or children. More specifically, in the four studies in adults that included analysis of changes in lung function in the most severely affected participants (e.g. FEV&#8321; &lt; 30% predicted), there was no statistically significant difference between the two delivery methods (MD -1.6% predicted; 95% CI -7.69 to 4.49%). The only study (<LINK REF="STD-Maldano_x002d_Alanis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maldano-Alanis 1997</LINK>) which found a significant difference in FEV&#8321; between the nebuliser and spacer groups used a low dose of salbutamol via the spacer (200 mcg), and showed a significant decline in FEV&#8321; in this group three to six hours after the treatment was administered. This trial could not be included in the analysis as no standard deviations were reported and the authors did not respond to requests for further information. <LINK REF="STD-Maldano_x002d_Alanis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maldano-Alanis 1997</LINK> did not contribute to the primary outcome of hospital admission.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Secondary outcome: Pulse rate</HEADING>
<P>Pulse rate after treatment (expressed as % change from baseline), was significantly lower when a spacer was used in children (MD -5.41 %; 95% CI -8.34 to -2.48, I² = 53%, random-effects). In adults, no significant difference was found between methods (MD -1.23 %; 95% CI -4.06 to 1.60, random-effects). These results were similar for fixed- and random-effects models. There was a significant difference between the pulse changes in adults and children (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 4.03, df = 1 (P = 0.04), I² = 75.2%, random-effects, see <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Secondary outcome: Oxygen saturation</HEADING>
<P>There were no data available in adults for the outcome oxygen saturation. Oxygen saturation in children was not significantly different between groups at the end of the studies (MD -0.19%; 95% CI -0.61% to 0.24%, 6 studies, 476 children; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Duarte-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duarte 2002</LINK>), however, reported that 25% of children treated with oxygen-driven nebuliser suffered desaturation at some point during treatment compared to 9% of those treated with MDI and spacer (P = 0.006).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Secondary outcome: Adverse events (tremor)</HEADING>
<P>Development of tremor was more common with nebuliser treatment in the four studies that reported this in children (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.95, random-effects), but the test for interaction between adults and children was not significant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Other secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>No significant differences were demonstrated between the two delivery methods for the other measured outcomes: change in respiratory rate and the number of participants given steroids.</P>
<P>We have made no attempt to combine the findings for symptom score as the scales used were highly variable and the standard deviation of results were rarely reported.</P>

<P>We did not pool results from single-treatment studies because of concern over confounding by the variable amounts of beta&#8322;-agonists delivered to the airways from the different delivery methods.</P>
<P>Blood gas results were reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kerem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kerem 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1995</LINK>). The participant numbers were small but both show less deterioration in gases with a spacer. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1995</LINK>) also measured lung function 15 minutes after the start of treatment and found a significantly greater rise in peak expiratory flow (PEF) at this time with the spacer (MD 10.1% predicted; 95% CI 15.7 to 4.4%); this study is of low methodological quality, so this information should be interpreted with caution. More recently, <LINK REF="STD-Hussein-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hussein 2002</LINK> reported similar changes in oxygen saturation in a single-treatment study in 60 children. The author has not responded to a request for further details.</P>

<P>Individual patient data have been provided by the authors of <LINK REF="STD-Burrows-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Burrows 2004</LINK> on children who were aged two years or more and these have been incorporated into the 2013 update.</P>
<P>
<I>Primary outcome: Duration of hospital admission</I>
</P>
<P>The primary outcome of duration of admission was available from four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Burrows-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Burrows 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dewar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dewar 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morley-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parkin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Parkin 1995</LINK>) but the results in <LINK REF="STD-Dewar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dewar 1999</LINK> were skewed and presented as medians so are not suitable for combination with the other two studies in children. The duration of admission did not show a significant difference between delivery methods in a single study in adults (MD -0.60 days; 95% CI -3.23 to 2.03) or in the two studies in children (MD 0.33 days; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.76), see <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<I>Secondary outcomes: Respiratory rate, heart rate and oxygen saturation</I>
</P>
<P>It was possible to combine the data provided by <LINK REF="STD-Burrows-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Burrows 2004</LINK> with the results from <LINK REF="STD-Dewar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dewar 1999</LINK> for three of the secondary outcomes (including 76 children).</P>
<P>There were no significant differences found in these children between spacers and nebulisers in respiratory rate (MD -0.91; 95% CI -3.20 to 1.38, <LINK REF="CMP-003.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.9</LINK>), heart rate (MD 1.06; 95% CI -5.48 to 7.61, <LINK REF="CMP-003.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.10</LINK>) or oxygen saturation at discharge (MD 0.12; 95% CI -0.42 to 0.66, <LINK REF="CMP-003.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.11</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results from the individual studies have been outlined below.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ba-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ba 1989</LINK> was a single-dose comparison in children, and did not measure the primary outcome (time to discharge). The design was double-blind with double dummy. Continuous intravenous aminophylline was given to all children in both groups. There was a significant difference between groups in baseline lung function, spacer baseline FEV&#8321; 38.2 (SD 7.9)% predicted and nebuliser 49.8 (SD 14)% predicted. Results are only presented as change from baseline, and this will favour the spacer group. There was no significant difference in FEV&#8321; between groups over three hours, and the significant advantage for the spacer in change in forced vital capacity (FVC) is probably due to baseline difference. The paper reported significantly more children treated with spacer increased their pulse rate at 10 minutes compared to the nebuliser group, but this data could not be used as the number of participants with increased pulse reported in the spacer group (17) was greater than the group total (14).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Coker-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coker 1995</LINK> was a single-dose comparison in children, and did not measure the primary outcome (time to discharge). There was no blinding and participants were allocated by alternation. No co-interventions were reported and no significant differences in respiratory score or PEF were found between groups over six hours.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dewar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dewar 1999</LINK> compared multiple treatments in children, given up to one-hourly by each delivery method. Allocation was concealed with sequential pre-sealed envelopes and all children received oral steroids on admission and repeated on subsequent mornings for three to five days according to their recovery. No blinding was reported. Data for duration of stay were noted to be skewed by small numbers of lengthy inpatient stays so medians were used which did not show a significant difference between groups, (36.5 hours for the spacer group and 40 hours for the nebuliser group). Although readmission rates were lower in the spacer group, this group were also given a written asthma plan and this may have confounded the results for readmission and symptoms after discharge. Children requiring immediate intravenous treatment were excluded from the study, and five children were withdrawn due to deterioration requiring intravenous treatment (three in the spacer group and two in the nebuliser group). The authors calculated a significant cost benefit for the spacer group in terms of drug costs, GBP 5.43 per participant in the spacer group and GBP 20.25 in the nebuliser group (P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Morley-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 1988</LINK> was the only inpatient study in adults, and used multiple treatments. Allocation was by alternation and no blinding was described. Intravenous aminophylline and methylprednisolone were given at standard doses. Mean duration of hospitalisation was not significantly different between groups, 5.8 days in the spacer group and 6.4 days in the nebuliser group, mean difference of -0.6 days (95% CI -3.2 to 2.0). No significant differences were found in lung function between groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Parkin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Parkin 1995</LINK> compared multiple treatments in younger children (aged one to five years), but gave both salbutamol and ipratropium by spacer or nebuliser. The research nurse only was blinded and all children received intravenous or oral steroids. There was no significant difference in hours to discharge (spacer 53 hours and nebuliser 46 hours), hours to the change of treatments to four-hourly intervals or total number of inhaled doses received. Nine participants in the spacer group crossed over to nebuliser treatment, but their results were analysed by original group assignment (intention-to-treat analysis).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Burrows-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Burrows 2004</LINK> studied 29 children aged one to six years old with moderate to severe asthma according to British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, who were hospitalised between September 2003 and February 2004. No significant differences were reported in any outcomes except for cost (which was GBP 7.68 per participant in the nebuliser group and GBP 5.96 per participant in the spacer group). The length of stay was 16.5 hours in the nebuliser group and 26.5 hours in the MDI and spacer group, with change in respiratory rate of -5.4 and -6.3, change in pulse of 2.9 and 4.6, and change in oxygen saturation of 0.53 and 1.07 for nebuliser and spacer, respectively. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Burrows-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Burrows 2004</LINK> have provided individual patient data for the children aged 2 years or more from this study and this has been added to duration of hospital admission from <LINK REF="STD-Parkin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Parkin 1995</LINK>. There was no significant difference in duration of admission (MD 0.33 days; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.76) and shown in <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>. Similarly the individual patient data from this study have been combined with results from <LINK REF="STD-Dewar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dewar 1999</LINK> as outlined in the secondary outcomes above.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-04 09:31:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Overall, we found no significant advantage of wet nebuliser over metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer administration of beta&#8322;-agonists in the treatment of acute asthma when treatments are repeated and titrated to the response of the participant for our primary outcome of hospital admissions. Thus the major take-home message from this review is that nebulisers have not been shown to be superior to spacers in preventing hospital admissions. Importantly we found that children had shorter emergency department (ED) visits when short-acting beta&#8322;-agonists were administered via spacer rather than nebuliser. The entire confidence interval indicated a patient-important benefit - we think parents would be happy to spend between 23 to 43 minutes less in the ED if their child was having an asthma attack, potentially saving health services time and money. It is not possible to say whether there is a time benefit in adults; this may be partly because all the adult trials contributing to this outcome were double-blind and double-dummy. Since both groups received both nebuliser and spacer this may have confounded any possible time saving from using the spacer. In addition hypoxia was reduced, and pulse rates and risk of tremor were lowered compared to participants receiving the same beta&#8322;-agonist via wet nebulisation.</P>
<P>In clinical practice the dose of beta&#8322;-agonist delivered to the airways varies depending on the type of nebuliser or spacer used and the characteristics of the individual's airways at that time (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1997</LINK>). Uncertainty over the dose of beta&#8322;-agonists required through any delivery method was overcome in many of the studies (613 adults and 1203 children) by repeating treatments at short intervals. For example, one respule (via nebuliser) or four to six puffs (via spacer) every 10 to 30 minutes until the person responded to treatment (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for a list of trials using multiple treatments). This approach reduced confounding by different dosages of drug delivered.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-11-04 09:32:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>People with life-threatening asthma exacerbations were excluded from the studies (for example those who were considered for ventilation). We do not know how this patient group would respond to treatment using spacers, or indeed whether they would be able to use a spacer under these circumstances.</P>
<P>Only two small studies were carried out in a community setting (<LINK REF="STD-Chong_x002d_Neto-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chong-Neto 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrone-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Morrone 1990</LINK>) and this review did not compare people being randomised to receive either nebuliser or spacer at home for delivery of beta&#8322;-agonists when their symptoms get worse. While we do not have evidence in these populations, it is logical to conclude that provided people are proficient at using their spacer (or can clearly instruct their child to use their spacer correctly) there is no advantage in buying an expensive home nebuliser when a spacer is cheaper and more portable. However, our confidence in this statement is low as the evidence in this review comes form an ED setting where treatment can be supervised by health professionals.</P>
<P>Few authors reported specifically on numbers of people presenting who were excluded from each study, and intention-to-treat analysis was not usually reported. Thus it is not entirely clear how these results apply to all people who present with an exacerbation.</P>
<P>Analysis of the data regarding lung function tests in many papers was complicated by a lack of standardised reporting. In addition, data regarding standard deviation related to the changes that were measured were not always reported. Peak flow and forced expiratory volume (FEV&#8321;) were the most commonly reported measurements and these were both included in the outcome tables. These concerns are not enough to overturn our confidence in the patient-important outcome of reduced time in the ED in children.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-04 10:56:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Sequence generation and allocation concealment were unclear in many of the included studies, and only eight studies in adults and six studies in children used a double-bind (double-dummy) design (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Performance and assessment bias might therefore have reduced the size of true differences between the two delivery methods.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Use of oral or parenteral steroids</HEADING>
<P>Successful response to beta&#8322;-agonists does not diminish the necessity to consider oral steroids in acute attacks of asthma. A previous meta-analysis demonstrated that steroids clearly reduce relapses when given to patients following discharge, and reduce hospitalisation when used early in the course of emergency treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Dosage of beta&#8322; agonist</HEADING>
<P>The studies included in this review used nominal dosage ratios between nebuliser and spacer that varied from 1:1 to 1:13 (lower dose in the spacer). One of the included studies plotted a log dose-response curve (<LINK REF="STD-Colacone-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Colacone 1993</LINK>); the equivalent dose ratio found in this study was 1:6 with the lower dose in the spacer. In adults, no additional benefit was found using six puffs of salbutamol (100 mcg each) given at 10-minute intervals through a Volumatic spacer, when compared with four puffs at 10-minute intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 1996</LINK>). A comparison in children between doses of 0.5 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg given at 20-minute intervals via nebuliser showed significantly greater improvement in lung function at the higher dose (<LINK REF="REF-Schuh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuh 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Experimental evidence suggests that the beta&#8322;-agonist should be released (actuated) into the spacer in individual puffs that can be inhaled by tidal breathing or single breaths (<LINK REF="REF-Gleeson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleeson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1984</LINK>). Some of the early studies mentioned difficulty with the valve movement with some spacers; however, this did not appear to be a problem in more recent studies. Some children may co-operate more with either spacer or nebuliser, so this may be an important factor in the choice of delivery method.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Type of spacer</HEADING>
<P>Two studies compared different types of spacer; <LINK REF="STD-Chong_x002d_Neto-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chong-Neto 2005</LINK> studied 10 children with aerochamber and 10 with a home-made spacer constructed from a 500 mL mineral water bottle. The study failed to identify differences between the types of spacer other than lower pulse rates with the Aerochamber than with the home-made spacer. <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1996</LINK> included 20 children treated with an Aerochamber and 22 children treated with an ACE spacer (both around 150 mL) and found no significant differences between the groups in respiratory rate and lung function.</P>
<P>Overall comparisons between types of spacer are confounded by all the other differences between the designs of each trial. In view of the discontinuation of Volumatic spacers in the UK in 2005, additional details to allow identification of type of spacer used have been added in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. This indicates that the findings of this review for the primary outcome of hospital admission are unchanged in children when trials using Volumatic spacers are excluded, but the confidence intervals widen for adults as fewer data contribute to the outcome. We found no significant subgroup differences for any outcome between the trials using Volumatic or other spacers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Cost of treatment</HEADING>
<P>Cost considerations may dictate which delivery system is used in different settings. In many parts of the world nebulisation is not available in peripheral hospitals and clinics for economic reasons (<LINK REF="STD-Rao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 2002</LINK>). Several recent studies have now included a calculation of costs of drug treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Burrows-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Burrows 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chong_x002d_Neto-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chong-Neto 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dewar-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dewar 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dhuper-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dhuper 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duarte-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duarte 2002</LINK>) and found a cost advantage for spacer delivery.</P>
<P>Total costs in a hospital setting are more complex to calculate; however, when patients return to the community the cost of a home nebuliser and respules is considerably more than an MDI and spacer (and the nebuliser requires regular maintenance). A before-after ED study (<LINK REF="STD-Newman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Newman 2002</LINK>) assessed the consequences of changing the acute asthma treatment algorithm from nebulised to MDI/spacer albuterol (salbutamol). Admission rates did not rise following the change in delivery method and duration of stay in the ED fell significantly from 175 minutes to 164 minutes. There were also reductions in charges that did not reach significance. Lower relapse rates following the change to MDI/spacer delivery were confounded by other changes, such as an asthma bag containing a spacer, peak-flow meter, instructional handout and canister of inhaled corticosteroid given to the patients at discharge. This makes data on relapse rates difficult to interpret, although significant reductions were seen following the combined interventions. As expected, the total dose of albuterol given to patients was lower with MDI/spacer delivery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Changing Practice</HEADING>
<P>Current guidelines recommend MDI/spacer delivery of beta&#8322;-agonists in acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2012</LINK>). However, implementing research findings is not an easy process, and <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2001</LINK> found that successfully changing hospital practice from nebulisers to spacers required a structured strategy to overcome the 'nebuliser culture' both in hospital medical and nursing staff, as well as parents and families of children with asthma. <LINK REF="REF-Osmond-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osmond 2007</LINK> carried out a survey of the use of nebulisers and spacers in Canadian paediatric EDs, and found that 21% of emergency physicians used MDI and spacer; the largest perceived barriers amongst non-users included safety and costs, and the lack of a physician champion for change.</P>

<OL>
<LI>For adults seen and assessed for acute asthma, this review found no significant differences between the two delivery methods. Consequently, the choice of delivery method should reflect patient preference, practice situations and formal economic evaluation</LI>
<LI>In children, no outcomes were significantly worse with the spacers, and the available evidence suggests that in most cases nebulisers could be replaced with spacers to deliver beta&#8322;-agonists in acute asthma. Moreover, other observed benefits (time spent in emergency department, oxygenation and side effects) may favour the groups treated with metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and spacer.</LI>
<LI>The experimental method adopted in many of the studies was to give repeated treatments at short intervals (e.g. one respule via a nebuliser or four puffs of a MDI via a spacer every 10 to 15 minutes). The number of treatments required was adjusted to the individual patient's response, overcoming the uncertainty of dosage delivery from different devices. Tidal breathing is easier for adults and children using a spacer for acute asthma, but each puff should be inhaled from the spacer before the next puff is delivered into the spacer. Current evidence is therefore based upon titrated treatment regimens and this should be considered when implementing any change in practice.</LI>
<LI>The studies excluded people with life-threatening asthma; therefore, the results of this meta-analysis should not be extrapolated to this patient population.</LI>

<LI>Further studies are required to confirm whether these findings, largely from hospital emergency departments, can be replicated in the community setting.</LI>

<P>Outcomes were evaluated 20 minutes after each treatment and oxygen saturation after the third dose. Change in oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate and wheeze were measured. Those who did not show signs of improvement were withdrawn and treated in the inpatient department. Adverse events of tremor, palpitations and vomiting were reported.</P>

<P>Number of admissions to hospital in each group were not reported in the paper, and we did not assume that those who were described as having poor responses to treatment were necessarily admitted. Due to discrepancies in the data reported in Table II in the paper, we have not been able to incorporate data on SaO&#8322;, heart rate and respiratory rate. Clarification from the Journal Editor has been sought, but no reply has been received.</P>
