<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Little evidence that burns patients benefit from hyperbaric oxygen therapy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Burns are very common, sometimes fatal, and have a high impact on the wellbeing of those affected. Recovery is often slow and complicated by infection and scarring. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a treatment designed to increase the supply of oxygen to the burnt area and improve healing. HBOT involves people breathing pure oxygen in a specially designed chamber (such as those used for deep sea divers suffering pressure problems after resurfacing). The review found only two randomised trials, with only a limited number of patients. There was no consistent benefit from HBOT, but one trial did suggest an improvement in healing time. Overall, there is little evidence to support or refute the use of HBOT for burns patients. More research is needed.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-07-15 10:33:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) consists of intermittently administering 100% oxygen at pressures greater than 1 atmosphere in a pressure vessel. This technology has been used to treat a variety of disease states and has been described as helping patients who have sustained burns.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the evidence for the benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for the treatment of thermal burns.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-07-15 10:33:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register; CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2); MEDLINE; PubMed; EMBASE; ISI Web of Science and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S); DORCTHIM (Database of Randomised Controlled Trials in Hyperbaric Medicine: from inception to 2009); reference lists of relevant articles and Internet sources for published and unpublished trials. The latest search was carried out in June 2009.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials that compared the effect of HBOT with no HBOT (no treatment or sham).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data using standardised forms. Each trial was assessed for internal validity with differences resolved by discussion. Data were extracted and entered into RevMan 4.2.3. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-07 10:54:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Blackhall">
<P>Five randomised controlled trials were identified, of which two satisfied the inclusion criteria. The trials were of poor methodological quality. As a result, it was difficult to have confidence in the individual results and it was not appropriate to pool the data.</P>
<P>One trial reported no difference in mortality, number of surgeries or length of stay between the control and HBOT groups once these variables were adjusted for the patients' condition. The second trial reported mean healing times that were shorter in patients exposed to HBOT (mean: 19.7 days versus 43.8 days). No further eligible trials were found when the search was updated in June 2009.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This systematic review has not found sufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of HBOT for the management of thermal burns. Evidence from the two randomised controlled trials is insufficient to provide clear guidelines for practice. Further research is needed to better define the role of HBOT in the treatment of thermal burns.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-15 10:33:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-06-11 12:51:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Thermal burns remain an important source of morbidity and mortality. Every year, approximately two million people are burned, 80,000 are hospitalised, and 6,500 die in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Brigham-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brigham 1996</LINK>). Globally there were 238,000 fire-related deaths in 2000, with low and middle-income countries bearing 95% of the global burden. Mortality per 100,000 population is 1.3 in North America but 5.5 in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Burns are a complex and evolving injury, with both local and systemic consequences - the latter manifesting once the burn area is greater than about 20% of the body surface area (BSA) (<LINK REF="REF-Sheridan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheridan 2002</LINK>). Locally, the burn wound tends to extend in the acute phase of the injury secondary to microvascular changes, profound activation of white cells and platelets, and the development of oedema. Many small vessels are directly coagulated by the application of heat, while others will thrombose late and develop tissue dehydration (<LINK REF="REF-Boykin-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boykin 1980</LINK>). The systemic response to burning is characterised by interstitial oedema in distant organs, secondary to a combination of wound-released mediators and hypoproteinaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Demling-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demling 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Youn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Youn 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Burns are a difficult treatment challenge and ideally the province of specialised units with high-volume workloads. Such units do not exist in most parts of the world. Early treatment can positively influence mortality rate. It involves appropriate fluid resuscitation, usually involving attainment of resuscitation targets using consensus formulas for initial fluid administration (<LINK REF="REF-Sheridan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheridan 2002</LINK>), together with topical agents to control pain, limit direct fluid losses and slow bacterial growth. Over the past two decades, early closure of full-thickness wounds has improved the outcome from extensive burns through the prevention of wound colonisation and infection (<LINK REF="REF-Sheridan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheridan 2002</LINK>). Temporary skin substitutes are widely employed on a similar rationale when formal closure is not an option.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-06-11 12:51:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is an adjunctive therapy that has been proposed to improve outcome in thermal burns. HBOT is the therapeutic administration of 100% oxygen at environmental pressures greater than 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA). Administration involves placing the patient in an airtight vessel, increasing the pressure within that vessel, and administering 100% oxygen for respiration. In this way, it is possible to deliver a greatly increased partial pressure of oxygen to the tissues. Typically, treatments involve pressurisation to between 1.5 and 3.0 ATA, for periods between 60 and 120 minutes once or more daily.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-07-15 10:33:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Since 1965 it has been suggested that HBOT might improve the outcome following thermal burns (<LINK REF="REF-Wada-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wada 1965</LINK>). HBOT has been shown to reduce oedema and preserve microcirculation in a number of injury models, including burns, through vasoconstriction with enhanced oxygen delivery, a direct osmotic effect and the inactivation of white cell adhesion (<LINK REF="REF-Hills-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hills 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nylander-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nylander 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thom-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 1994</LINK>). HBOT also exerts beneficial effects on infections in hypoxic tissues through a variety of mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Knighton-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knighton 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite nearly 40 years of interest in the delivery of HBOT in these patients, little clinical evidence of effectiveness exists. An experimental model of burn injury suggested some reduction in hyperaemia, exudate and wound size, but no overall improvement in healing (<LINK REF="REF-Niezgoda-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niezgoda 1982</LINK>), while small, non-random, comparative trials have reported lower mortality and shorter hospital stays following HBOT in significantly burnt individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Cianci-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cianci 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grossman-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grossman 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niu-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niu 1987</LINK>). On the other hand, a comparative study of 72 matched patients suggested more renal failure and sepsis (although fewer grafts) in the HBOT group (<LINK REF="REF-Waisbren-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waisbren 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>HBOT is associated with some risk of adverse effects, including damage to the ears, sinuses and lungs from the effects of pressure, temporary worsening of short-sightedness, claustrophobia and oxygen poisoning. Although serious adverse events are rare, HBOT cannot be regarded as an entirely benign intervention.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Brannen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brannen 1997</LINK>, 125 acutely burned patients (range of body surface area burnt not given), with or without inhalation injury and admitted within 24 hours of injury were randomised to either routine burn management or routine burn management with the addition of HBOT. The routine burn management employed was not specified. HBOT consisted of 100% oxygen at 2 ATA for 90 minutes twice a day for at least ten treatments and a maximum of one treatment per percent total body surface area. The primary outcome variable was length of stay. Mortality, acute fluid requirements and the number of operations required was also reported.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1974</LINK>, 16 patients with thermal burns to between ten and 50% of the total body surface area and admitted within 24 hours of injury were randomised to either routine burn management and HBOT or routine burn management with sham HBOT. Routine management included administration of Ringer's lactate solution titrated against central venous pressure and urine output (colloids after 24 hours as indicated), daily dressing with silver sulphadiazine cream, vitamin-B complex, vitamin C, alpha-tocopherol and antibiotics (unspecified). HBOT in the intervention arm consisted of 100% oxygen at 2 ATA for 90 minutes every eight hours for 24 hours, then every 12 hours until healed. The controls were placed in the same chamber at equivalent times and compressed rapidly to a trivial pressure breathing air to simulate HBOT. This trial reported mortality, mean time to healing, acute fluid requirements and the number of grafts required.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-07-15 15:03:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Data from the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brannen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brannen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1974</LINK>) comparing routine burn management versus HBOT or sham HBOT could not be pooled, and thus, are described individually.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brannen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brannen 1997</LINK> reported no difference in length of stay (reported as a regression against age, %BSA, presence of inhalational injury and number of operations - actual length of stay in each group not reported), mortality (seven patients (11%) in each group), or number of surgeries (again only reported after regression) between the control and HBOT groups, once these outcomes were adjusted for the patient's condition.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hart-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1974</LINK> reported that mean healing times were significantly shorter in patients exposed to HBOT (mean: 19.7 days versus 43.8 days, P &lt; 0.001) and that fluid requirements were also smaller in the HBOT group (mean: 2.2 ml/kg versus 3.4 ml/kg, no statistical analysis reported). No standard deviations or errors were recorded. One of two grafts required in the sham group did not succeed, while three of three required in the HBOT group succeeded: relative risk (RR) for failed graft without HBOT 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5 to 8.0.</P>
<P>Adverse events reported by <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1974</LINK> indicated three patients in the HBOT group experienced sinus barotrauma and one patient in the control group had transient viraemia during the course of therapy.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-07-15 15:03:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>This systematic review did not find evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of HBOT for the management of thermal burns. Important methodological problems existed with both studies and there were also potentially important methodological differences between the studies. In addition, the two trials were published 23 years apart and we presume the comparator therapy to be significantly different. As a result, it was difficult to ascribe sufficient validity to either the individual results or any attempt to pool results across the studies.</P>
<P>The two trials involved a modest total of only 141 patients, of which 125 were in the <LINK REF="STD-Brannen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brannen 1997</LINK> trial. The <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1974</LINK> trial was particularly constrained by a lack of power to detect useful clinical differences, and the finding that HBOT was no more effective than placebo in regards to length of stay, mortality or number of surgeries may have been erroneous for this reason alone. Furthermore, the sample sizes of these studies may have precluded any definitive statement on safety or frequency of adverse events.</P>
<P>Allocation concealment was not described in either study, while neither the method of randomisation or blinding was described by <LINK REF="STD-Brannen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brannen 1997</LINK>. As a result, the potential for selection bias was considered high, and particularly so considering entry into one trial was dependent on the availability of HBOT facilities at the time of presentation (<LINK REF="STD-Brannen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brannen 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mean healing times were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1974</LINK> and showed promising results, with times being shorter in patients exposed to HBOT. However, no definition of 'healing' was given, nor was a description given as to the extent of wound size and depth at presentation. Acute fluid requirements and other outcomes such as successful skin-grafting were reported 'better' in those receiving HBOT, but no formal analysis was made. Neither trial measured long-term outcomes. In an accompanying analysis of a series of 191 patients treated at their facility (138 with HBOT), <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1974</LINK> reported that the overall death rate for those treated with HBOT was 9% (less than predicted on the basis of a national series rate), and that 92/138 patients also survived to undergo autografting, with an average of 1.35 grafts per patient.</P>
<P>We had planned to perform subgroup analyses with respect to age, oxygen dose (treatment profile and number of treatments) and comparator therapy. However, the paucity of eligible trials did not permit this approach. Patient inclusion criteria were not standard (<LINK REF="STD-Hart-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1974</LINK> did not report burn size or depth), nor was the dose of oxygen administered.<BR/>
<BR/>There are a few major adverse effects of HBOT (pulmonary barotrauma, drug reactions, injuries or death related to chamber fire), and while these are all rare enough not to expect to see them in the trials included in this review, they should be included in consideration of any benefit of this therapy.</P>
<P>In practice it is likely that a beneficial effect strong enough to be clearly identified in clinical trials would overwhelm the consideration of such rare events. There are, however, a number of more minor complications that may occur commonly and <LINK REF="STD-Hart-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1974</LINK> reported three individuals as experiencing sinus barotrauma requiring symptomatic therapy. There is no indication that these individuals were withdrawn from treatment.</P>
<P>While HBOT is advocated as an adjunctive treatment for thermal burns in some centres, there are surprisingly few comparative reports that support its use. Given the substantial cost associated with these treatments, the routine use HBOT for thermal burns cannot be justified by the findings of this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-07-15 15:04:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Although there are some promising results from two small RCTs, there is insufficient evidence from this review to support the routine use of HBOT for patients with thermal burns.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the routine use in some centres, there is a case for further randomised trials of high methodological rigour in order to define the true extent of benefit from the administration of HBOT to patients with thermal burns. Specifically, more information is required on the subset of burn severity or size most likely to benefit from this therapy and the oxygen dose most appropriate. Any future trials would need to consider in particular;<BR/>
