<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-25 10:30:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tooth decay (dental caries) is a common problem around the world. It can cost a lot of money to treat and causes infection, pain and the loss of teeth. Tooth decay can be controlled by what are known as 'non-operative' methods which include cleaning plaque from teeth thoroughly, advising a healthy diet and using fluoride to prevent the decay getting worse. If the decay progresses these 'non-operative' techniques may need to be combined with 'operative' management which involves filling and restoring teeth where the holes caused by decay prevent cleaning. The fillings will improve the appearance of the teeth and allow the patient to clean them.  </P>
<P>Traditionally dentists have removed all of the decay with a dental drill or instruments before a filling is placed. However, removal of all the decay has some disadvantages, including damage to the nerve of the tooth, toothache and possibly weakening of the tooth structure. This method is known as one step complete caries removal. </P>
<P>Despite the large number of fillings and restorations placed worldwide on a daily basis, dentists remain uncertain as to which is the best 'operative management' strategy for tooth decay. This review has been carried out by researchers from the Cochrane Oral Health Group to assess the most effective ways of treating and managing tooth decay (dental caries) when operative methods are used in first and permanent teeth.</P>
<P>The most recent search of relevant studies for this review was carried out on 12<SUP>th</SUP> December 2012. Eight studies with 934 patients (1372 teeth) were included.</P>
<P>Three alternative operative caries management interventions were assessed by comparing them with the traditional treatment of removing all the decay in one go (complete caries removal). These interventions were.</P>
<P>- Stepwise excavation - this technique removes caries in stages over two visits some months apart, allowing the dental pulp time to repair itself and lay down dentine.<BR/>- Partial caries removal - the dentist removes part of the dentinal caries and seals what is left into the tooth permanently.<BR/>- No dentinal caries removal - no dentinal caries is removed before sealing or restoring.</P>
<P>It was found that when the complete caries removal technique was compared with stepwise excavation, the pulp or nerve of the tooth would have been exposed in 347 of every 1000 teeth treated with complete caries removal, whereas when the stepwise excavation technique was used, this would have occurred in only 154 teeth per 1000. </P>
<P>When the partial caries removal technique was used, it was found that the pulp or nerve would have been exposed in 50 teeth out of 1000 treated. However, when the complete caries removal technique was used this figure would have been 219 teeth per 1000 treated.</P>
<P>There was less nerve damage when part of, or all of the decay, was left behind, for both baby and adult teeth. There was no difference in the number of teeth with toothache with any of the techniques. One of the no dentinal caries removal techniques needed fewer replacement fillings, although there was no difference found when comparing any of the rest of the techniques to complete caries removal.</P>
<P>In the included studies, the fillings were mostly placed by specialist dentists and the teeth were followed up for a relatively short time (1 year). More studies are needed to help answer further questions. Future studies should be carried out by non-specialist dentists to check whether the results would be similar. These studies should follow the patients for a longer time, and check if there are any differences in toothache, further decay and filling replacements. They should also check which techniques patients prefer and if there is a long term difference in cost.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-23 15:50:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The management of dental caries has traditionally involved removal of all soft demineralised dentine before a filling is placed. However, the benefits of complete caries removal have been questioned because of concerns about the possible adverse effects of removing all soft dentine from the tooth. Three groups of studies have also challenged the doctrine of complete caries removal by sealing caries into teeth using three different techniques. The first technique removes caries in stages over two visits some months apart, allowing the dental pulp time to lay down reparative dentine (the stepwise excavation technique). The second removes part of the dentinal caries and seals the residual caries into the tooth permanently (partial caries removal) and the third technique removes no dentinal caries prior to sealing or restoring (no dentinal caries removal). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-11-21 17:57:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of stepwise, partial or no dentinal caries removal compared with complete caries removal for the management of dentinal caries in previously unrestored primary and permanent teeth.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-01-24 22:15:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 12 December 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 11), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 12 December 2012) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 12 December 2012). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-02-23 15:50:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Parallel group and split-mouth randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing stepwise, partial or no dentinal caries removal with complete caries removal, in unrestored primary and permanent teeth were included.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-02-23 15:50:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three review authors extracted data independently and in triplicate and assessed risk of bias. Trial authors were contacted where possible for information. We used standard methodological procedures exacted by The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-25 10:07:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this updated review, four new trials were included bringing the total to eight trials with 934 participants and 1372 teeth. There were three comparisons: stepwise caries removal compared to complete one stage caries removal (four trials); partial caries removal compared to complete caries removal (three trials) and no dentinal caries removal compared to complete caries removal (two trials). (One three-arm trial compared complete caries removal to both stepwise and partial caries removal.) Four studies investigated primary teeth, three permanent teeth and one included both. All of the trials were assessed at high risk of bias, although the new trials showed evidence of attempts to minimise bias.</P>
<P>Stepwise caries removal resulted in a 56% reduction in incidence of pulp exposure (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.60, P &lt; 0.00001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) compared to complete caries removal based on moderate quality evidence, with no heterogeneity. In these four studies, the mean incidence of pulp exposure was 34.7% in the complete caries removal group and 15.4% in the stepwise groups. There was also moderate quality evidence of no difference in the outcome of signs and symptoms of pulp disease (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.58, P = 0.50, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
<P>Partial caries removal reduced incidence of pulp exposure by 77% compared to complete caries removal (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.69, P = 0.009, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%), also based on moderate quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity. In these two studies the mean incidence of pulp exposure was 21.9% in the complete caries removal groups and 5% in the partial caries removal groups. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there was a difference in signs and symptoms of pulp disease (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.60, P = 0.15, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low quality evidence), or restoration failure (one study showing no difference and another study showing no failures in either group, very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>No dentinal caries removal was compared to complete caries removal in two very different studies. There was some moderate evidence of no difference between these techniques for the outcome of signs and symptoms of pulp disease and reduced risk of restoration failure favouring no dentinal caries removal, from one study, and no instances of pulp disease or restoration failure in either group from a second quasi-randomised study. Meta-analysis of these two studies was not performed due to substantial clinical differences between the studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-21 08:46:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Stepwise and partial excavation reduced the incidence of pulp exposure in symptomless, vital, carious primary as well as permanent teeth. Therefore these techniques show clinical advantage over complete caries removal in the management of dentinal caries. There was no evidence of a difference in signs or symptoms of pulpal disease between stepwise excavation, and complete caries removal, and insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there was a difference in signs and symptoms of pulp disease between partial caries removal and complete caries removal. When partial caries removal was carried out there was also insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is a difference in risk of restoration failure. The no dentinal caries removal studies investigating permanent teeth had a similar result with no difference in restoration failure. The other no dentinal caries removal study, which investigated primary teeth, showed a statistically significant difference in restoration failure favouring the intervention.</P>
<P>Due to the short term follow-up in most of the included studies and the high risk of bias, further high quality, long term clinical trials are still required to assess the most effective intervention. However, it should be noted that in studies of this nature, complete elimination of risk of bias may not necessarily be possible. Future research should also investigate patient centred outcomes.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-25 10:09:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-23 15:59:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-02-23 15:58:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental caries is one of the most commonly occurring diseases worldwide and its treatment has high cost implications both in monetary and biological (dental pain/infection and tooth loss) terms. Non-operative measures (plaque and diet control, fluoride application) are considered important treatments to control caries progression. However, operative dentistry (placement of restorations) has a role to play in facilitating plaque control and in restoring tooth form and function. Cavitated lesions that cannot be cleaned are restored to allow the patient to clean effectively.</P>
<P>This operative treatment of dental caries traditionally has involved complete removal of the caries before placing a restoration. This tissue is heavily infected with bacteria and is removed using a slow speed bur or hand excavating instruments (<LINK REF="REF-Kidd-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kidd 1998</LINK>). Histologically and clinically, dentinal caries has been characterised as having two distinct layers: the outer zone (stains with caries detector dyes) where the dentine is highly demineralised, the collagen denatured and heavily infected with bacteria (often referred to as the infected zone), and the inner zone (does not stain with a caries detector dye) where the dentine is demineralised but the collagen intact and minimally infected (often referred to as the caries affected zone) (<LINK REF="REF-Fusayama-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fusayama 1972</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditionally all remnants of caries were removed during cavity preparation (<LINK REF="REF-Black-GV-1908" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black GV 1908</LINK>). However, contemporary cavity preparation clears caries from the periphery of the cavity and only removes the outer caries infected zone pulpally.This type of treatment has been accepted and practiced for generations by dentists. However, there are a number of consequences associated with such restorative intervention.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Entry to the restorative cycle: Whilst caries removal and restoration give the short term benefit of removing the infected, soft demineralised dentine and restoring tooth form, they cannot be regarded as a definitive solution as the majority of restorations placed by dentists are replacement restorations (<LINK REF="REF-Elderton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elderton 1990</LINK>). Individual teeth often undergo re-restoration a number of times due to restorative material failure, new caries adjacent to the restoration and tooth structure failure as a result of weakening.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Reduction in remaining dentine thickness (RDT): When a cavity is prepared and a restoration is replaced, the cavity becomes larger and the RDT between the floor of the cavity and the dental pulp often becomes thinner. The RDT has been shown to be the most critical variable in cavity preparation which has an impact on pulpal health (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Pulpal exposure: At its most extreme, caries removal in dentine lesions can lead to exposure of vital pulp tissue. Traditionally, such exposures in symptomless teeth have been managed by placement of a direct pulp cap or with a pulpotomy. These techniques can achieve good success rates when they are used to treat pulps exposed through dental trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Cvek-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cvek 1978</LINK>). However, following carious exposures (where there is infected dentine and the pulp is more likely to be compromised) outcomes are poor (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Hiyasat-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Hiyasat 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barthel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barthel 2000</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Dentine is a vital tissue, and local anaesthetic (LA) is required for conventional cavity preparation, as it often involves removal of non-necrotic dentine. Studies involving children have found less reported discomfort and pain when softened demineralised dentine was removed with hand excavation without LA than when LA and burs were used (<LINK REF="REF-Rahimtoola-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahimtoola 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Bochove-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Bochove 2006</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>More conservative approaches often known as minimal intervention techniques for the management of caries have been adopted and are becoming more widely accepted in efforts to address and reduce the adverse consequences of restorative treatment. The interpretation of what minimal intervention means varies, but often consists of what would be regarded as complete caries removal. It is uncertain whether the traditional approach to caries removal is necessary and this dogma has been challenged by a number of procedures and studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kidd-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kidd 2004</LINK>) where partial or no caries removal was carried out (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2008</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-02-23 15:59:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a lack of standardisation in the terminology describing the various degrees of caries removal, but those that move away from complete caries removal can be broadly grouped as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Stepwise excavation: Partial caries removal is carried out and provisionally restored, followed a few weeks later by removal of the provisional restoration and any soft caries. A definitive restoration then being placed (<LINK REF="REF-Bj_x00f8_rndal-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjørndal 1997</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Partial caries removal and placement of a definitive restoration (<LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 1999</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>No dentinal caries removal and use of a restorative material to seal caries into the tooth (<LINK REF="REF-Handelman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handelman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mertz-Fairhurst 1998</LINK>). This group has a more diverse range of procedures which includes placement of traditional fissure sealants in the pits and fissures and novel techniques such as preformed metal crowns (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>) and those sealing proximal lesions using resin sealants (<LINK REF="REF-Martignon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martignon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paris-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paris 2007</LINK>).</LI>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-02-23 15:59:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sealing infected demineralised dentine into a cavity with a restoration that provides a good peripheral seal, deprives the microorganisms of substrate from the oral cavity. The bacteria reduce in numbers (<LINK REF="REF-Handelman-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handelman 1976</LINK>) and the caries process arrests. Not only do the bacteria reduce in numbers, but the microbial diversity becomes less complex. Only those microorganisms capable of breaking down pulpal tissue fluid glycoproteins are able to survive (<LINK REF="REF-Paddick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paddick 2005</LINK>). A number of other clinical studies discussed by <LINK REF="REF-Fejerskov-and-Kidd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fejerskov and Kidd 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2008</LINK> have investigated and provided evidence to support this theory.</P>
<P>The progressive reduction in the number of organisms and a change to a less cariogenic microflora within sealed carious dentine, leads to a gradual reduction in lesion activity and hence lesion progression. This allows time for the pulp-dentine complex to lay down tertiary dentine and peri-tubular dentine leading to tubular sclerosis and reduces the permeability of the remaining dentine. This reduction in pulpal exudate further depletes the nutrient source for the bacteria. In stepwise excavation the provisional restoration is removed after a period of time to allow further caries removal. The tertiary dentine which has now had time to form provides further protection of the dental pulp and reduces the risk of pulpal exposure. Avoidance of carious pulpal exposures is critical to the long term outcome of the tooth, as management of such exposures using a direct pulp capping technique is associated with a poor prognosis for maintaining a vital pulp (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Hiyasat-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Hiyasat 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barthel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barthel 2000</LINK>). Extirpation of the damaged pulp and root canal treatment would then be required.</P>
<P>Partial caries or no dentinal caries removal techniques also have the potential to reduce cavity size and hence preserve tooth structure. However, a consequence of such techniques is that the restoration does not have a sound foundation. The impact of this upon restoration longevity is still debated, although it may not be such an important issue in the long term for primary teeth as they exfoliate.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-02-23 15:59:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the high prevalence of dental caries and the large number of restorations placed worldwide on a daily basis, clinicians remain uncertain as to which is the best operative caries management strategy: complete, partial or no dentinal caries removal. At the present time there is considerable variation in clinical practice and teaching. Therefore there is a need to systematically review the literature on stepwise, partial, no dentinal or complete caries removal prior to definitive restoration. A review of this literature was published in 2006. Since publication, further evidence has become available and there is a need to update the results.</P>
<P>This is an update of the Cochrane review originally entitled Complete or ultraconservative removal of decayed tissue in unfilled teeth previously published in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Ricketts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricketts 2006</LINK>). It has been re-titled to encompass all studies which remove varying amounts of caries, including those that do not remove any dentinal caries.</P>

<P>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies was conducted by three review authors (DR, NI and TL) using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. One of the included studies was conducted by an author of this review (NI). For this study the other two review authors (DR and TL) assessed the risk of bias. Seven domains were assessed for each included study: sequence generation, allocation concealment, masking of participants and personnel, masking of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and 'other bias'. Within each domain, a description of what happened, as reported in the study, was recorded along with a judgement of either 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias. An overall risk of bias assessment was also made.</P>

<P>The units of randomisation and analysis in the included trials would ideally all have been at the level of the individual. When split-mouth studies were included and each individual trial participant had one tooth randomised to intervention and another randomised to control, analyses took into account the paired nature of the data. In trials where the unit of randomisation was the tooth and the number of teeth included in the trial was not more than twice the number of participants, the data were treated as if the unit of randomisation was the individual. It was recognised that the resulting 95% confidence intervals produced would appear narrower (i.e. the estimate will seem to be more precise) than they should be, and would therefore be interpreted accordingly.</P>

<P>What authors termed partial caries removal at the first stage of the stepwise excavation technique varied between studies. <LINK REF="STD-Magnusson-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Magnusson 1977</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK> removed caries until the operator determined that there was a significant risk of pulpal exposure with further excavation, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK> appears to be more conservative and described only "removal of the superficial necrotic and demineralized dentin with complete excavation of the peripheral demineralized dentin, avoiding excavation close to the pulp". In both of the studies investigating partial caries removal, with no re-entry (<LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 1999</LINK>), only the enamel-dentine junction was cleared of caries, and superficial necrotic dentine was removed from the pulpal and axial walls of the cavity. In the two studies that did not make any attempt to remove dentinal caries, one was in permanent teeth and involved bevelling the enamel at the entrance of pits and fissures prior to restoration with composite resin (<LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK>). The second study investigated primary teeth and restoration was with a preformed metal crown using the Hall Technique (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the control group of the Innes study, dentists were asked to carry out their routine management of carious lesions; 76% reported complete caries removal and 24% partial caries removal. The data presented in this review were for the complete caries removal control group and were obtained from personal communication with the first author.</P>
<P>The restorative materials varied throughout the included studies: the provisional restorative materials used in the stepwise excavation technique were zinc oxide-eugenol (<LINK REF="STD-Leksell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leksell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magnusson-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Magnusson 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK>) and glass ionomer (<LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK>), whereas the definitive restorations provided for the other techniques were composite (<LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 1999</LINK>) and preformed metal crowns (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Characteristics of the outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcomes were: exposure of the dental pulp during caries removal, signs or symptoms of pulpal disease, progression of caries and restoration failure. Five studies measured exposure of the dental pulp during caries removal (<LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leksell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leksell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magnusson-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Magnusson 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK>). Seven studies reported signs or symptoms of pulpal disease at 1 year follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magnusson-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Magnusson 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 1999</LINK>). None of the studies reported upon progression of caries. Restoration failure was presented in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leksell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leksell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 1999</LINK>) with this being the major focus for two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 1999</LINK>). The study by Innes reported outcome data at 2 years (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>) and 5-year data are available (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>). To improve consistency with the other studies, the author provided 1 year follow-up data, including results of the exposure of dental pulp during caries removal.</P>
<P>For the secondary outcomes of health economic measures, oral health related quality of life, patient/carer and dentist perceptions of treatment, and patient discomfort during treatment, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>) reported on perceptions of treatment and patient discomfort.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>Reporting on sequence generation varied between the studies. Two studies provided no information on the method of sequence generation and were assessed at unclear risk of selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Leksell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leksell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 1999</LINK>). Allocation was based on date of birth in <LINK REF="STD-Magnusson-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Magnusson 1977</LINK>, so this quasi-randomised study was assessed at high risk of bias. Four studies were assessed at low risk of selection bias based on the reported method of sequence generation: paper based "randomised treatment assignment sheet" (<LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK>) to computerised sequence generation (<LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK>, teeth were allocated to treatment by the investigator drawing lots. However, in this study randomisation was carried out in one stage for both the control and intervention groups. At this stage the intervention group was divided into two subgroups, stepwise and partial caries removal. This meant that when the operator was partially removing caries, it was known whether there would be a subsequent appointment to remove further caries (the stepwise group). The authors commented that this may have introduced bias because the operator knew there was to be a second caries removal stage, and this might have affected the extent of caries excavation they were carrying out. The authors point out there should have been a second randomisation, following the initial caries removal to divide the group into two, and decide which teeth would be allocated to stepwise or partial caries removal. <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK> was therefore assessed as having a high risk of selection bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Masking of participants and personnel (performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>Steps were taken in three studies to mask participants to which procedures they had received, or which tooth had received which treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 1999</LINK>) by using the same dental material for both the intervention and control groups, and standardising the number of surgical stages for each procedure from the patient perspective. These studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias for masking of participants due to the steps taken in the study design and management which reduced the potential risk of bias.</P>
<P>In the remaining five included studies, masking of participants was not reported and these were assessed as at high risk of performance bias. For two studies, patients could not be masked as different materials were used for the intervention and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK>). In the remaining three studies, patients had to attend one or two appointments depending on whether they had received the control or intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Leksell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leksell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magnusson-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Magnusson 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>As with most dental restorative intervention studies, masking of the operator was not possible in any of the studies included in this review; the intervention and control procedures involved different treatment protocols. All the included studies were therefore assessed as being at high risk of performance bias with regards to masking of personnel providing the trial interventions.</P>

<P>Where radiographs and microbiology were used to assess outcome measures, the outcome assessors were masked to the intervention. However, where partial caries removal was compared to complete caries removal, the radiologists may have been able to determine which intervention group the tooth was in, which may have introduced an element of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Although the authors of this review acknowledge that the included studies would be classified at high risk of bias based on the assessments above, this has to be taken in the context of the pragmatic nature of dental clinical trials. To design and conduct a study free of all biases would however be impossible for the primary outcome of exposure of the dental pulp, as the outcome assessor would know the allocated caries removal technique after cavity preparation was completed, by virtue of the status of the remaining dentine. Whilst the overall risk of bias of the included studies may be regarded as high, the four new studies included in this update (<LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK>) have demonstrated improved methodologies in an attempt to address these shortcomings.</P>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Magnusson-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Magnusson 1977</LINK> study, pulp necrosis was reported as occurring in three teeth in the complete caries removal arm and one in the stepwise excavation arm.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-23 16:24:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review compares different caries removal techniques with complete caries removal. Eight trials met the inclusion criteria, 934 patients with 1372 teeth were recruited into the trials and outcome data for 1191 teeth were available for analysis. The trials were divided into three different comparisons, according to the extent of caries removal. Three primary outcomes were reported, with none of the trials providing data for the progression of caries at 1 year.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1: Stepwise excavation versus complete caries removal</HEADING>
<P>Four trials reported stepwise excavation versus complete caries removal. The analyses show that there was a 56% reduction in risk of exposure of the dental pulp during stepwise excavation when compared with complete caries removal risk ratio (RR) 0.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.60, P &lt; 0.00001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). This is a large effect based on moderate quality evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference in signs or symptoms of pulpal disease when comparing stepwise excavation to complete caries removal. However, in the three studies included (<LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leksell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leksell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK>), once exposure had occurred, the teeth were excluded from the study. As these teeth were not evaluated at follow-up, the effect estimate may be biased towards the control which had a greater incidence of exposure of the dental pulp. This may have resulted in an underestimation of the potential benefit of the intervention.</P>
<P>The studies in this review demonstrate that partial caries removal and sealing into the tooth (first stage stepwise) leads to the systematic and progressive arrest of the carious lesion. This allows time for pulp dentine complex reactions, reducing the risk of pulpal exposure when cavities are re-entered at the second visit of stepwise to remove the remaining demineralised tissue. Indeed, with increasing evidence from studies presenting microbiological data and the randomised controlled trials in this systematic review, some clinicians and researchers question whether re-entry is required in the stepwise excavation procedure. With this in mind, when the first stage of stepwise excavation caries removal was carried out there was only four (1.3%) exposures of the dental pulp compared to 43 (14.3%) exposures at second stage of stepwise.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2: Partial caries removal versus complete caries removal</HEADING>
<P>Comparison 2 included three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 1999</LINK>) which compared partial caries removal to complete caries removal. Partial caries removal resulted in a 77% reduction in the risk of exposure of the dental pulp during caries removal when compared with complete caries removal (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.69, P = 0.009, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). This large effect is also based on moderate quality evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>All three trials reported signs and symptoms of pulpal disease, and two provided data for meta-analysis, which showed no evidence of a difference (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.60; P = 0.15, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). The small sample size was reflected in the wide confidence intervals, with <LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK> reporting one case of pulpal necrosis in the complete removal group (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference with regards to restoration failure. In <LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK> there was one restoration failure in the complete caries removal group and there were no restoration failures in either group in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 1999</LINK> (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: No dentinal caries removal versus complete caries removal</HEADING>
<P>Comparison 3 included two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK>) which compared no dentinal caries removal with complete caries removal. Exposure of the dental pulp during caries removal was not possible in the intervention groups where no dentinal caries removal was carried out. However, it is interesting to note that no exposures of the dental pulp occurred in the control groups of these studies either. This result might be expected in the <LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK> study as the included teeth had caries radiographically confined to the outer half of dentine. However in the <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK> study, almost half (42%) of the included teeth demonstrated caries radiographically into the inner half of dentine and some exposures would therefore have been expected in the control group. There are at least two possible explanations for this lack of pulp exposures during caries removal.  Firstly, the participating dentists may have modified their management due to their very involvement in a clinical trial, the so called 'Hawthorne effect' (<LINK REF="REF-Fernald-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernald 2012</LINK>). Secondly, although these dentists were assumed to be representative of general practitioners, they volunteered to take part in this trial of a highly conservative approach to caries removal and may have had a general tendency to avoid radical caries removal where there was a risk of exposing the dental pulp.<I> </I>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK> reported 3% restoration failure rate in the intervention group, whereas the control group reached 37%. However, the restorations placed in the control group in this study of primary teeth were mainly multi-surface glass ionomer restorations, which have been shown to have poor survival clinically (<LINK REF="REF-Chadwick-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadwick 2007</LINK>). This failure rate in the control arm was much higher than has been reported from secondary care/specialist practice studies of complete caries removal and restoration. This pragmatic trial presents results achieved in a primary care setting where the majority of dental care is usually provided. <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK> was the only trial that reported on any of the secondary outcomes, namely patient, carer and dentists perceptions of treatment and patient discomfort (assessed by the dentist). In this study the intervention group was preferred by the patient, carer and dentist, and resulted in less discomfort during treatment (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review only considers the 1-year follow-up data, however, the 5-year data of this trial, have recently been published (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>) and also show low restoration failure rates in the intervention group (Hall crowns) (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Completeness</HEADING>
<P>Although eight studies have been included in this review, there are only a small number available for each intervention group. There were no data available for the primary outcome of progression of caries, and only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>) reported upon any of the secondary outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Applicability</HEADING>
<P>Seven of the studies were carried out in a secondary care environment by specialist dentists, even though the majority of dental treatment is provided in primary care. This poses two questions: are the patients treated in primary care similar to those seen in secondary care, and is the care provided and outcomes achieved in both settings comparable. Some issues related to these questions may include aspects of cost, time allocation, appointments required, funding source (e.g. dental insurance company). Therefore, clinicians will need to assess whether the findings are applicable to the patients in their clinical setting.</P>
<P>Most of the included studies investigated teeth in children and adolescents. Therefore the applicability to patients of all ages has to be considered. Only two of the included studies involved older patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Early work in this field concentrated on occlusal caries where a good seal could readily be obtained to sound enamel, but there was skepticism as to whether the techniques could be applied to approximal lesions. More recent research has included approximal lesions in addition to occlusal lesions (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 1999</LINK>) and one study has looked almost exclusively at approximal lesions (<LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK>). Unfortunately, subgroup analyses based on surface could not be carried out as the studies did not always report the outcomes separately.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-02-23 16:25:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of evidence provided from a number of the studies included in this review is poor due to their high risk of bias. Ideally in a clinical trial the patient, the operator and the assessor should all be masked as to any treatment/intervention. However, this conventional masking was not always possible in these studies. The operator knew whether caries removal was partial or complete and certainly knew whether an exposure was present. The operator was often the assessor and it must be assumed that this also precluded conventional masking. However, a primary outcome was symptoms of pulpitis or pulp necrosis and it seems unlikely that this would have been affected by a lack of assessor masking. In the <LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK> studies, different restorative materials were used in the intervention and control groups, therefore masking was not possible.</P>
<P>The more recent studies have improved methodologies, with respect to sequence generation, allocation concealment and attempts to mask patients to the treatment received. Using the same restorative materials and re-entering the teeth where complete caries removal had taken place, <LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK> may have ensured patients did not know which treatment arm was being carried out. As re-entry took place in <LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK>, in order to take a microbiological sample, the patients may also have been unaware of which treatment was being carried out.</P>
<P>Although eight studies have been included, they have explored three alternative strategies resulting in a small number of studies in individual analyses. In addition to this, a number of the studies had small sample sizes resulting in wide confidence intervals and lower level of certitude.</P>
<P>One of the sources of heterogeneity within the studies was the depth of the lesions. Variation in lesion depth may have an impact on whether the pulp is exposed during caries removal. The depth of the lesions in the studies varied in radiographic extent, from <LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK> where all lesions were confined to the outer half of dentine to <LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Orhan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Orhan 2010</LINK> where all lesions were over 75% of the way through dentine. Only <LINK REF="STD-Bj_x00f8_rndal-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bjørndal 2010</LINK> included teeth with pre-treatment pain and there were no radiographic signs of periapical or periradicular pathology in any of the studies. The medicaments and materials used in the studies varied widely from zinc oxide-eugenol through standard restorative materials to preformed metal crowns. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions about the respective benefits of the various materials used in the intervention groups.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-02-23 16:25:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results from the included studies should be interpreted in light of the fact that a number of the studies suffer from a high risk of bias and had a short follow-up period. Whilst bearing this in mind the current evidence demonstrates that in symptomless, vital, carious primary or permanent teeth, stepwise and partial excavation reduced the risk of pulp exposure. Therefore these techniques show clinical advantage over complete caries removal in the management of dentinal caries. Whilst there is insufficient evidence to determine whether it is necessary to re-enter and excavate further in the stepwise excavation technique, the studies that did not re-enter, reported no adverse consequences (<LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ribeiro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ribeiro 1999</LINK>). In primary teeth, the use of Hall Technique crowns would make re-entry difficult and the study by <LINK REF="STD-Innes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Innes 2007</LINK> demonstrated that this may not be necessary: the restoration having adequate inherent retention in the longer term.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-23 16:25:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found no evidence that incomplete caries removal is harmful. In fact, the reverse is true as complete caries removal is more likely to result in carious exposure of the pulp. The need to re-enter the cavity and excavate further in the stepwise excavation technique must continue to be questioned and should be a priority in future research. This could be investigated by high quality, well conducted randomised controlled trials involving long term follow-up of symptoms of pulpitis and pulp necrosis, radiographic evidence of caries progression, microbiological evidence of caries progression or arrest and longevity of restorations. This review only included trials investigating stepwise, partial or no dentinal caries removal versus complete caries removal; future reviews should consider trials which compare these different techniques.</P>
<P>It should be noted that the only long term clinical trial in permanent teeth (<LINK REF="STD-Mertz_x002d_Fairhurst-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz-Fairhurst 1987</LINK>) involved occlusal caries where caries had only extended to half way through dentine. There is a need to apply the methodology to deeper lesions, lesions affecting multiple tooth surfaces, lesions in compromised teeth that have had a history of restoration and re-restoration and to permanent as well as primary teeth. A major difficulty in this work will be finding stable populations and it will be essential that such studies include multiple practitioners from primary care.</P>
<P>There is also scope for investigation of bonding of materials to soft, wet and infected dentine.</P>
<P>Future research should also investigate patient centred outcomes including oral health related quality of life and patient perception of treatment. Health economic measures should be used to determine the cost of treatment and patient willingness to pay.</P>
