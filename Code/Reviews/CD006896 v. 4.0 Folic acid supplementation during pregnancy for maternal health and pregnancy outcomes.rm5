<P>Folate is a naturally occurring vitamin while folic aid is the synthetic replacement of folate used in most supplements and in fortified foods. Folate is essential as its deficiency can be caused by poor dietary intake, genetic factors or the interaction between genetic factors and the environment. Women with sickle cell disease and those women in areas where malaria is endemic have a greater need for folate and in these areas anaemia can be a major health problem during pregnancy. Women need more folate in pregnancy to meet their need for extra blood and to meet the growing baby's need for blood. Without adequate folate intake in a mother's diet, she can become anaemic and this can contribute to her baby being small, anaemic and born too early (preterm birth). Folic acid supplementation taken before conception can reduce the chance of the baby having neural tube defects. This review looked to see if taking folic acid supplements during pregnancy could reduce the chance of the baby being born too early and of low birthweight and to see its impact on the mother&#8217;s blood (hematological values), folate levels and on pregnancy complications.</P>
<P>The review authors found 31 trials (involving 17,771 women) that looked at the impact of providing folic acid supplementation during pregnancy. The data showed that taking folate during pregnancy was not associated with reducing the chance of preterm births, stillbirths, neonatal deaths, low birthweight babies, pre-delivery anaemia in the mother or low pre-delivery red cell folate, although pre-delivery serum levels were improved. The review also did not show any impact of folate supplementation on improving mean birthweight and the mother&#8217;s mean haemoglobin levels during pregnancy compared with taking a placebo. However, the review showed some benefit in indicators of folate status in the mother. The evidence provided so far from these trials did not find conclusive results for any overall benefit of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy.</P>
<P>Most of the studies were conducted over 30 to 45 years ago.</P>

<P>Thirty-one trials involving 17,771 women are included in this review. This review found that folic acid supplementation has no impact on pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.38; three studies, 2959 participants), and stillbirths/neonatal deaths (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.85; three studies, 3110 participants). However, improvements were seen in the mean birthweight (mean difference (MD) 135.75, 95% CI 47.85 to 223.68). On the other hand, the review found no impact on improving pre-delivery anaemia (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.10; eight studies, 4149 participants; random-effects), mean pre-delivery haemoglobin level (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.19; 12 studies, 1806 participants), mean pre-delivery serum folate levels (standardised mean difference (SMD) 2.03, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.27; eight studies, 1250 participants; random-effects), and mean pre-delivery red cell folate levels (SMD 1.59, 95% CI -0.07 to 3.26; four studies, 427 participants; random-effects). However, a significant reduction was seen in the incidence of megaloblastic anaemia (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.38, four studies, 3839 participants).</P>

<P>Folate is a generic term for both the endogenous form of the vitamin occurring naturally in food and the synthetic form found in supplements and fortified foods (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1995</LINK>). It should be noted, however, that folate is a naturally occurring vitamin while folic aid is the synthetic replacement of folate used in most supplements and in fortified foods. Humans are fully dependent on dietary sources or dietary supplements and microorganisms in their intestinal tract for their folate supply. Folate derivatives are essential for the synthesis of nucleic acid, amino acids, cell division, tissue growth, and DNA methylation (<LINK REF="REF-Krishnaswamy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnaswamy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholl 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inadequate folate intake leads to a decrease in serum folate concentration, resulting in a decrease in erythrocyte (red blood cell) folate concentration, a rise in homocysteine (Hcy) concentration, and megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow and other tissues with rapidly dividing cells (<LINK REF="REF-Dietary-Ref-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietary Ref 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willoughby-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willoughby 1968</LINK>). During pregnancy, fetal growth causes an increase in the total number of rapidly dividing cells, which leads to increased requirements for folate (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1995</LINK>). With inadequate folic acid intake, concentrations of folate in maternal serum, plasma, and red blood cells decrease from the fifth month of pregnancy onwards (<LINK REF="REF-A_x00e7_kurt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Açkurt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bates-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 1986</LINK>). If inadequate folate intake is sustained during pregnancy, megaloblastic anaemia (a blood disorder characterised by anaemia, with red blood cells that are larger than normal and cell contents that are not completely developed) occurs (<LINK REF="REF-Willoughby-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willoughby 1968</LINK>). Folate concentrations continue to decrease for several weeks after pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Bruinse-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruinse 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1983</LINK>), and by the second to third month postpartum, a third of all mothers can have subnormal concentrations of folate in serum and red blood cells (<LINK REF="REF-A_x00e7_kurt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Açkurt 1995</LINK>). Possible causes for the decline in blood folate during pregnancy include increased folate demand for growth of the fetus due to an increase in the number of rapidly dividing cells (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1995</LINK>) and growth of uteroplacental organs, decreased folate absorption, low folate intake, hormonal influence on folate metabolism as a physiologic response to pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Chanarin-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chanarin 1969</LINK>), and dilution of folate due to blood volume expansion (<LINK REF="REF-Bruinse-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruinse 1995</LINK>). Folate demands may be further increased in women with sickle cell disease and women living in areas where malaria is endemic (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 1988</LINK>); in these areas, anaemia in pregnancy is a major health problem. Increased folate catabolism and urinary folate excretion (<LINK REF="REF-Fleming-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Landon-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landon 1971</LINK>) may also contribute to increased folate needs in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Caudill-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caudill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gregory-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregory 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McPartlin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McPartlin 1993</LINK>), but the findings are controversial. As a consequence of folate deficiency, Hcy accumulates in the serum and is found to be associated with an increased risk in cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Refsum-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Refsum 2008</LINK>), late pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Makedos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makedos 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patrick-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tamura-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamura 2006</LINK>), and neural tube defects around the time of conception (<LINK REF="REF-De-Benoist-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Benoist 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recommended folate intake for pregnant women is 400 µg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Food-and-Nutrition-Board-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Food and Nutrition Board 1970</LINK>). It was revised in 1999 after evaluating its bioavailability from food and synthetic folate, and the recommendation was increased to 450 µg (600 DFEs/day (dietary folate equivalent)) (<LINK REF="REF-Institute-of-Medicine-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Institute of Medicine 2000</LINK>). It should be noted that as per NICE guidelines, this amount of folic acid when supplemented to pregnant women (and those intending to become pregnant), before conception and throughout the first 12 weeks, reduces the risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). However, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine have suggested that an increased folate intake might delay the diagnosis of vitamin B-12 deficiency by correcting the anaemia, or even exacerbate its neurologic and neuropsychiatric effects (<LINK REF="REF-Food-and-Nutrition-Board-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Food and Nutrition Board 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herbert-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbert 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rush-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1994</LINK>). Further research is still needed in this area.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-02-08 11:05:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The relationship between pregnancy outcome and maternal blood folate concentrations, folate intake and hyperhomocysteinaemia cannot be ignored (<LINK REF="REF-Smits-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smits 2001</LINK>). Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is regulated by folate status (<LINK REF="REF-Selhub-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selhub 1993</LINK>), and hyperhomocysteinaemia is linked to vaso-occlusive disease (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1995</LINK>). Impaired placental perfusion due to hyperhomocysteinaemia is implicated in having a negative effect on pregnancy outcome, as are inadequate folate intake and low serum folate concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Scholl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholl 2000</LINK>). Folate has long been used as a supplement in combination with iron during pregnancy, largely on the basis of haematological benefits (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 1968</LINK>), although deficiency has also been associated with pregnancy complications and congenital malformations (<LINK REF="REF-Scholl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholl 2000</LINK>). Periconceptional supplementation with folic acid, three months before and early in pregnancy is recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Czeizel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czeizel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MRC-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 1991</LINK>), and has been shown to reduce the risk of neural tube defects by almost three-quarters (<LINK REF="REF-De_x002d_Regil-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">De-Regil 2010</LINK>). Although still unproven, folic acid supplementation has also been suggested to help prevent other fetal malformations such as congenital heart defects (<LINK REF="REF-Botto-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botto 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Czeizel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czeizel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Czeizel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czeizel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1995</LINK>), urinary tract anomalies (<LINK REF="REF-Li-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1995</LINK>), limb defects (<LINK REF="REF-Czeizel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czeizel 1993</LINK>), oro-facial clefts (<LINK REF="REF-Czeizel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czeizel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1995</LINK>), and pyloric stenosis (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it produced comparable groups. We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>

<LI>low risk of bias (where it was clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<P>We noted levels of attrition for included studies. We also planned to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis. For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-02-08 11:09:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We used fixed-effect Mantel-Hanzel meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged to be sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of  T² and I².</P>

<P>Not all included studies mentioned the baseline haemoglobin levels of participants and since duration and start of folic acid supplementation in women during pregnancy varied, we, therefore, did not carry out these subgroup analyses. However, subgroup analyses were carried out on studies in which iron was additionally provided with folic acid. We also performed subgroup analyses on the dosage of folic acid.</P>
<P>We also reported the outcomes based on how the outcome was defined in the individual study.</P>
<P>We assessed subgroup differences by the interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We reported the results of subgroup analyses quoting the &#967;² statistic and the P value, and the interaction test I² value.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">a. Clinical measures of untoward events during pregnancy and of pregnancy outcome</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Preterm birth</HEADING>
<P>None of the included studies reported preterm birth in accordance with our definition of the outcome. We found two studies, of which one defined it as birth of a baby between 36 to 38 weeks, and another defined it as birth before 38 weeks of pregnancy. We pooled them both to look for an association with folic acid supplementation in pregnancy. Our analysis showed that administration of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy has no impact on reducing preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.38; three studies, 2959 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>)).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Stillbirths/neonatal deaths</HEADING>
<P>None of the included studies reported perinatal mortality. However, three studies reported stillbirth and neonatal mortality as a composite outcome, hence we pooled them to obtain data for perinatal mortality. Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy did not show any impact on reducing stillbirths/neonatal deaths (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.85; three studies, 3110 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>)).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Birthweight</HEADING>
<P>Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy did not show any impact on reducing low birthweight (less than 2500 g) (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.04; four studies, 3113 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>)).</P>
<P>We also attempted to look at the impact of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy on mean birthweight (g) of newborns and found no association (mean difference (MD) 104.96 g, 95% CI -0.25.50 g to 235.41 g; five studies, 774 participants; random-effects, T² = 21694.29, I² = 90% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>)). All the studies pooled for this outcome compared folic acid + iron versus iron alone.</P>
<P>The standard errors for <LINK REF="STD-Trigg-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Trigg 1976</LINK> were very small as compared to the other trials for being plausible, therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis after removing this study. Heterogeneity was reduced from 90% to 50% (MD 135.76, 95% CI 47.85 to 223.68; four studies, 625 participants; random-effects, T² = 4841.10, I² = 50% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>)</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">b. Haematological and biochemical parameters</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pre-delivery anaemia</HEADING>
<P>The included studies used different definitions of anaemia. Eight studies reported pre-delivery anaemia as an outcome, but only two studies used our definition of anaemia. We included all studies reporting anaemia but pooled them separately according to the definition of anaemia used. Folic acid supplementation did not show any impact on reducing pre-delivery anaemia (any cut-off point) (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.10; eight studies, 4149 participants; random-effects, T² = 0.51, I² = 90% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>)). When studies were separately pooled according to the definition described in the earlier section of this review, we found that supplementation had no impact on reducing anaemia (haemoglobin less than 10 g/dL) (average RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.42; two studies, 2448 participants; random-effects, T² = 1.86, I² = 97% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>)).</P>
<P>We also looked at the impact of folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on mean pre-delivery haemoglobin level, and found no difference in the mean haemoglobin concentration among those in the intervention arm compared with those in the placebo arm (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.19; 12 studies, 1806 participants; random-effects, T² = 0.12, I² = 95% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>)). All the studies pooled for this outcome compared folic acid + iron versus iron alone.</P>
<P>With regard to subgroup analysis based on dosage of folic acid supplementation, we found no differences on improving haemoglobin concentrations and the interaction test was insignificant (Chi² = 1.18, df = 1 (P = 0.28), I² = 15.1%). <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pre-delivery serum folate</HEADING>
<P>Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy showed a reduction in the incidence of low pre-delivery serum folate by 62% (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.59; two studies, 696 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>)).</P>
<P>We found non-significantly higher mean pre-delivery serum folate levels among those in the folic acid supplementation arm compared with those in the placebo arm (standardised mean difference (SMD) 2.03, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.27; eight studies, 1250 participants; random-effects, T² = 2.96, I² = 98% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>)). All the studies pooled for this outcome compared folic acid + iron versus iron alone.</P>
<P>For subgroup analysis based on dosage of folic acid supplementation, we found significant improvements in mean serum folate concentration when the dose was less than 400 &#956;g (SMD 3.70, 95% CI: 0.28 to 7.11, four studies n = 253, random effects, I² = 99%), however, no impact was seen of folic acid &gt; 400 &#956;g (SMD 0.68, 95% CI: -0.75 to 2.10, four studies n = 997, random effects, I² = 98%) <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>. The interaction test for the overall estimate was not significant (Chi² P value = 0.11, I² = 61%) suggesting no difference between groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pre-delivery red cell folate</HEADING>
<P>None of the included studies reported data for pre-delivery red cell folate deficiency status. However, mean red cell folate levels were reported in four studies. Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy did not show any impact on reducing mean pre-delivery red cell folate levels (SMD 1.59, 95% CI -0.07 to 3.26; four studies, 427 participants; random-effects, T² = 2.79, I² = 97% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>)). All the studies pooled for this outcome compared folic acid + iron versus iron alone.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Megaloblastic anaemia</HEADING>
<P>Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy significantly reduced the incidence of megaloblastic anaemia by 79% (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.38; four studies, 3839 women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>)).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-25 11:41:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From our meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials on folic acid supplementation, we found no evidence of an effect of supplements on preterm birth, stillbirth/neonatal death, mean birthweight/low birthweight, low pre-delivery haemoglobin and serum red cell folate. However, we found a risk reduction on low pre-delivery serum folate and megaloblastic anaemia.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-11-28 11:18:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>First, all the included studies were conducted over 30 to 45 years ago, and we found poor subjective and objective compliance with random allocation, adequate concealment and blinding. Bias and confounding thus seem to be the likely explanation for our findings.</P>
<P>Second, for combining studies, it is important that the outcome measures are comparable. Of note, trials included in this analysis reported outcomes quite differently from each other. This could have resulted in higher risk of bias due to selective reporting in these trials. However, we pooled them separately, wherever possible, to minimise this bias.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-02-08 11:24:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We undertook a systematic, thorough search of the literature to identify all studies meeting the inclusion criteria and we are confident that the included trials met the set criteria. Study selection and data extraction were carried out in duplicate and independently and we reached consensus by discussing any discrepancies. A protocol was published for this review. All the analyses were specified a priori, with the exception of a post hoc analysis of the different cut-off values for biochemistry markers.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-02-08 11:24:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Previous observational studies have suggested that higher folate status in pregnancy is associated with higher birthweight, higher placental weight, and prolonged gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neggers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neggers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tamura-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamura 1992</LINK>). Preconception folic acid supplementation has also shown effects on decreasing preterm births (<LINK REF="REF-Bukowski-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bukowski 2009</LINK>). However, the findings from this review are inconclusive.</P>
<P>A review on folic acid supplementation during pregnancy by Charles et al (<LINK REF="REF-Charles-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charles 2005b</LINK>) that included results from large randomised controlled trials found no conclusive evidence of benefit for folic acid supplementation in pregnant women. An earlier version of this Cochrane review also reached the same conclusion (<LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 1997</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-02-08 11:24:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our meta-analysis of folic acid supplementation in pregnancy included 31 studies and provided non-conclusive evidence of folic acid supplementation for pregnant women on pregnancy outcomes except for improvement in mean birthweight. A reduction in the risk of megaloblastic anaemia and improvement in folate levels, however, has been noted with folic acid supplementation against supplementation with placebo but the limitation to this finding is the few number of studies reporting the outcome.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-08 11:25:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More well-designed, large scale randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the benefit of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy. Researchers of future trials should also make efforts to describe the participants in more detail before enrolment and should undertake long-term follow-up of the participants and their children in order to study the long-term effects of folic acid supplementation. Bias should also be reduced by adequate randomisation and allocation concealment of the assignment of intervention by achieving blinding of the participants, providers and the outcome assessors and by minimising loss to follow-up of the participants, in order to produce trials of adequate methodological quality.</P>

Therefore the actual total daily dose may be up to 5.1 mg of folic acid</P>
