<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Piracetam was one of the first drugs used for dementia and comes from the class of drugs called nootropics, whose putative actions are still poorly defined. Most of the trials of piracetam were undertaken many years ago and did not use methods which would be currently considered standard. Some of the studies suggested there may be some benefit from piracetam but overall the evidence is not consistent or positive enough to support its use for dementia or cognitive impairment. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-01-03 16:35:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Piracetam is a drug that may enhance memory and other intellectual functions, but its usefulness in treating dementia is uncertain. It is, however, commonly prescribed for cognitive impairment and dementia in several countries of continental Europe.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical efficacy of piracetam for features of dementia (classified into the major subtypes: vascular, Alzheimer's disease or mixed vascular and Alzheimer's disease, or unclassified dementia) or cognitive impairment not fulfilling diagnostic criteria for dementia.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-01-03 16:35:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched <A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois">ALOIS</A> - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group&#8217;s Specialized Register on 4 December 2011 using the terms: piracetam, nootropic, "2-Oxo-1-pyrrolidine", Lucetam, Nootropil, Breinox. We identified another review by employees and consultants of the manufacturing company, UCB Pharma (Waegemans 2002) which included data from unpublished studies not made available to Cochrane review authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-09-27 07:07:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All unconfounded, randomized, double-blind trials in which treatment with piracetam was administered for more than a day and compared with placebo in people with dementia of Alzheimer type, vascular dementia, or mixed vascular and Alzheimer's disease, or unclassified dementia, or cognitive impairment not fulfilling diagnostic criteria for dementia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-10-18 16:40:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data from studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. We used Intention-to-treat analysis where feasible and pooled studies if appropriate. We planned to perform sensitivity analyses to determine if studies performing poorly on quality criteria affected results. The pharmaceutical company marketing piracetam did not release the results of several unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-18 16:40:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were 24 included studies with 11959 participants in total. Many studies were of cross-over design and first-phase data were unavailable, or could not be extracted. Global impression of change (GIC) was the only outcome for which pooling of data was possible, involving only four studies. There was evidence of heterogeneity in the results, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test = 19.17 (df = 3, P &lt; 0.001). The odds ratio (OR) for improvement in the piracetam group compared with placebo was 3.43 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.32 to 5.07). Using a fixed-effect model, the OR for improvement with piracetam compared with placebo was 3.55 (95% CI 2.45 to 5.16). This estimate was derived from completers rather than from an intention-to-treat analysis as relevant data could not be extracted from the reports.</P>
<P>In the limited data available, no significant differences were found between treatment and placebo groups for cognition (immediate memory, visuospatial, Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), delayed memory or speech) for dependency, or for depression.</P>
<P>The large volume of unpublished and untraceable data not available to the review authors raises the possibility of publication bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Published evidence does not support the use of piracetam in the treatment of people with dementia or cognitive impairment. Although effects were found on global impression of change, no benefit was shown by any of the more specific measures of cognitive function.</P>
<P>The evidence indicates a need for further evaluation of piracetam.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-10-03 15:42:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Piracetam is a drug that may enhance memory and other intellectual functions through mechanisms which are ill-understood and still debated.</P>
<P>Piracetam (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide) was the first of the "nootropic" drugs, so-called because of postulated effects in protecting higher brain function against external traumatic factors such as hypoxia, electroconvulsive therapy or barbiturate poisoning. It is a cyclic derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that can cross the blood-brain barrier and is selectively concentrated in brain cortex (<LINK REF="STD-Vernon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vernon 1991</LINK>). Even at high doses it has no sedative, stimulant, locomotor or autonomic effects. Since its first clinical use in 1972, three different but complementary actions have been claimed for the drug. At low dosage, piracetam might produce cognitive enhancement by increasing oxygen and glucose utilization through adenosine triphosphate (ATP) energy pathways. At higher dosage, it opposes platelet aggregation and has rheological and antithrombotic effects. Central and peripheral microcirculation is supported by increased deformability of red blood cells and by reduced adherence of damaged red blood cells to endothelial cells.</P>
<P>Although not yet known in detail, it appears that one of piracetam's mechanisms of action may be through muscarinic cholinergic activity, although other neurotransmitters may be involved. There are reports of an effect of piracetam on dopamine metabolism. Piracetam appears to be well tolerated in low doses (up to 10 g daily) and does not interact with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, analgesics, antidepressants, antihypertensives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Beneficial effects of piracetam on learning and memory have been demonstrated in several animal studies including some on older animals. There have been reports of facilitation of memory retention over time (24 hours), failure of which is one of the early features of Alzheimer's disease. Similar findings have been reported with healthy volunteers. The usefulness of piracetam for patients with Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia or unspecified dementia is still controversial. Studies have produced mixed results, particularly in small trials, but results from larger trials have been more encouraging.</P>
<P>In spite of the uncertainties about its efficacy for dementia, either unclassified or in one of the major subtypes (Alzheimer's disease, vascular or mixed), piracetam is frequently prescribed for cognitive impairment in several continental European countries</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-10-18 16:41:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>To determine the clinical efficacy of piracetam for the features of dementia or cognitive impairment, either classified according to the major subtypes of dementia: vascular, Alzheimer's disease, mixed vascular and Alzheimer's disease, unclassified dementia, or cognitive impairment not fulfilling the criteria for dementia.</P>
<P>The null hypotheses to be tested were that, for any of the primary outcomes (listed below), piracetam had no effect different to that of placebo.</P>
<P>These hypotheses were first be tested for all patients with dementia, and then separately for those with Alzheimer's disease and for those with vascular dementia. We also considered the following subgroup analyses.</P>

<P>We analyzed all unconfounded, double-blind, controlled trials, specified as randomized, in which treatment with piracetam was administered for more than a day and compared with placebo in patients with dementia, either unclassified or according to the major subtypes of dementia: vascular, Alzheimer's disease, or mixed vascular and Alzheimer's disease. We also analyzed those studies in which treatment was administered to participants with cognitive impairment not fulfilling the criteria for dementia. We excluded trials in which the allocation to treatment or control was not randomized, or in which treatment allocation was not concealed. Prior knowledge of treatment allocation may lead to biased patient allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In studies where a cross-over design was used, we only analyzed data from the first treatment period, as period and order effects cannot be reliably excluded. Studies could include a titration period prior to the randomization phase of the study. However, we did not use data from any non-randomized titration periods to assess safety or efficacy.</P>

<P>In addition, the pharmaceutical company responsible for marketing most of the piracetam worldwide, UCB SA (Pharma Sector), had provided a comprehensive list of abstracts, which included many unpublished studies in 1997. Unpublished, double-blind placebo-controlled studies were reviewed when possible, although no data have been made available. <BR/>
<BR/>In 2002, a systematic review <LINK REF="REF-Waegemans-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waegemans 2002</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>) was published. The authors of this review were employees or consultants of UCB SA (Pharma Sector). The review included the following unpublished or unobtainable reports: Bjurwill 1973 (Internal report); Feruglio 1973 (Internal report); Bjurwill 1974 (Internal Report); Fenyvesi 1975 (Internal report); Sourander 1975 (Internal report); Parrisius 1977 (untraceable citation); Stegink 1973 (internal report); Branconnier 1980 (Boston State Hospital report); Caro Mendivil 1983 (Internal report); Welbel 1981 (conference report). Regrettably, UCB SA (Pharma Sector) has not responded to requests to make the data from these studies available to the Cochrane reviewers. Reports of some other studies believed to exist, on the basis of the list of references provided by UCB Pharma in 1997, were not cited in the company's review and have so far proved impossible to retrieve (Binder 1987; Braadbaart 1974; Braadbaart 1977; Delwaide 1974; Dencker 1974; Dogan 1976; Hronek 1979; Nijdam 1974).</P>

<P>The original search was performed in 1997. Irrelevant citations were discarded by a single review author (LF), based on the title of the publication and its abstract. If we considered that an article could possibly be relevant, we retrieved it for further assessment.</P>
<P>Two review authors (LF and JGE) independently reviewed the trials for inclusion in the review from the culled citation list. We resolved disagreements by discussion and any persisting differences were adjudicated by a third review author (JB).</P>
<P>In November 2000, staff at the CDCIG editorial office repeated the search but no new studies were identified for inclusion. Two further duplicate publications of the <LINK REF="STD-Israel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Israel 1994</LINK> study were identified and 14 other new studies were identified and were added to the exclusion list. These studies were rated by a single review author (JGE). The search was repeated in September 2003 and revealed 11 new references, including a systematic review <LINK REF="REF-Waegemans-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waegemans 2002</LINK>. At the time of writing this update, we added 11 of these references to the exclusion list. The search done on 11 May 2005 found no new references. The search done on 17 December 2007 found one new study for consideration; we excluded this study (<LINK REF="STD-Szalma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Szalma 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The search performed on 12 February 2010 identified nine new studies, of which we included one (<LINK REF="STD-UCB-Pharma-2007" TYPE="STUDY">UCB Pharma 2007</LINK>) and excluded eight. The pre-publication search performed 4 December 2011 identified 5 new studies of which all were excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Inclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>Category A (adequate): the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) some form of centralized randomized scheme, such as having to provide details of an enrolled participant to an office by phone to receive the treatment group allocation; (ii) some form of randomization scheme controlled by a pharmacy; (iii) numbered or coded containers, such as in a pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administrated sequentially to enrolled participants; (iv) an on-site or coded computer system, given that the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant; or (v) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes; (vi) other combinations of described elements of the process that provides assurance of adequate concealment.</P>
<P>Category B (intermediate): the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) use of a "list" or "table" to allocate assignments; (ii) use of "envelopes" or "sealed envelopes"; (iii) stating the study as "randomized" without further detail.</P>
<P>Category C (inadequate): the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) alternation; (ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of week, or any other such approach; (iii) any allocation procedure that is entirely transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random numbers or assignments (iv) does not mention random allocation.</P>
<P>Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment may be associated with bias. We included trials if they conformed to categories A or B, and we excluded those falling into category C.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The same two review authors (LF and JGE) assessed the methodological quality of each trial. We rated the quality of the methodology of each selected trial for blinding and loss before analysis, as described by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>The same two review authors (LF and JGE) independently extracted data and we cross-checked the results. We discussed any discrepancies.</P>
<P>We sought data on every patient for each outcome measure. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, we sought the data irrespective of compliance, whether or not the participant was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up.</P>
<P>Studies may have included a titration period prior to the randomization phase of the study. We did not use data from these non-randomized titration periods to assess safety or efficacy since participants were usually not randomized, nor were treatment or dose allocations concealed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>For continuous or ordinal variables (such as psychometric test scores, clinical global impression scales, functional and quality of life scales), we considered the main outcomes of interest were the final assessment scores (corrected for baseline) and the changes in score from baseline (i.e. pre-randomization or at randomization) to the final assessment. If ordinal scale data appeared to be approximately normally distributed, or if the analysis that the investigators performed suggested parametric tests were appropriate, then we treated the outcome measures as continuous data. The baseline assessment score is the latest available score, no longer than two months, prior to the randomization. We grouped outcome measures in "domains" and such domains consisted of more than one scale. For this reason, we used standardized mean differences (SMD) in the meta-analysis of continuous variables.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes such as global impression of improvement, institutionalization and death, the endpoint itself was of interest and we used the Peto method of the 'typical odds ratio' (OR).</P>
<P>We used a standard Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to test for heterogeneity of the treatment effect between the trials. If a test of heterogeneity was negative, then we calculated a weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials, the 'typical odds ratio' (i.e. the odds of an unfavorable outcome amongst treatment-allocated patients to the corresponding odds amongst controls) using Peto's log-rank test adapted for ordinal data (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 1990</LINK>). If, however, there was evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials, then we only pooled homogeneous results, or used a random-effects model (in which case the confidence intervals will be broader than those of a fixed-effect model).</P>
<P>Additional hypotheses to be tested were that piracetam has no differential effect, when compared with placebo, for certain subgroups of patients.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2011-10-18 16:40:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this revision of the review we have restricted our criteria for inclusion by restricting such status to those studies that were both of acceptable quality and reported usable data. We have reviewed 80 studies covering a publication time span of 33 years, from 1972 until the present. There are 24 included studies with 11959 participants in total.</P>
<P>During that time period, piracetam has been available in many countries in Europe, for other than investigational reasons. The type and methods of the trials often reflect the period of time in which the trials were performed. Many of the studies performed were short-term, cross-over studies, a research practice popular at one time but one that is far from ideal, especially for chronic progressive conditions such as cognitive impairment and dementia. There was no evidence presented about the appropriate time for wash-out for these studies nor the power of the studies to detect a period effect. For many of these studies, possibly useful data from the first period could not be extracted.</P>
<P>Over the period of time during which these studies were performed, considerable progress has been made in the classification of dementia and cognitive impairment, and in defining subtypes of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Few of the eligible studies incorporated what would be currently acceptable diagnostic criteria. Of the included studies, only one defined the participants by a combination of DSM and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria; four of the studies used DSM criteria; three studies used NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, and one study used ICD criteria. It was often difficult to determine through what diagnostic filters participants had become accessible to investigators and therefore, the generalizability of the studies is difficult to evaluate. The range of cognitive impairments experienced by the participants ranged from minimal subjective complaints to the last stages of severe dementia in institutionalized individuals.</P>
<P>The reporting of the studies was also variable in quality and reflects reporting standards accepted at that time. Unfortunately, this often prevented the extraction of data from the studies as differences from baseline were rarely reported in continuous variables. If means were reported, the variance was rarely indicated and the more usual means of reporting included a rough estimate of probability that the event was due to chance. The large variation in diagnostic criteria and the types of patients included in the study and the paucity of data obtained, made it impossible to analyze the subtypes of cognitive impairment or dementia separately.</P>
<P>There was a wide range of instruments employed to measure various aspects of cognition not only across the studies but within individual studies. This created great problems with the multiple comparisons within studies. The requirement that the instruments should be sensitive to change received little emphasis. There was little evidence that the investigators had decided on the primary outcome measure a priori. This emphasizes the need for any interpretation of these data to be extremely conservative, as no statistical allowance has been made for multiple comparisons.</P>
<P>The dose of piracetam varied from 2.4 g/day to 9 g/day. The drug appeared to be well tolerated in all studies. The relative brevity of treatment should be emphasized; only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Croisile-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Croisile 1993</LINK>), observed treated patients for longer than six months. In view of the chronic nature of the complaints of cognitive impairment and dementia, and the near certainty that treatment would be required for an extended length of time, it would have been expected that this treatment should be studied for at least six months with data preferably available for a full year.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2011-10-18 16:40:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All included studies met at least Category B of the criterion of randomization. Some of the studies claimed to have been randomized had disproportionate group sizes, but this was assumed to be due to chance. Those studies that did not use the word 'randomization' in the allocation of participants, we assumed not to be randomized and we excluded them. In accordance with the criteria of <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>, we assessed all the included studies for blinding and withdrawals.</P>
<P>Only two of the included studies, (<LINK REF="STD-Israel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Israel 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vencovsky-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Vencovsky 1980</LINK>), reported a significant number of withdrawals. The usefulness of this measure of quality has been debated because many studies fail to report withdrawals, and only report the participants included in the analysis. This may well have been the case here as most studies did not report a single withdrawal. We did not include any of the data from these two studies in the meta-analysis because of the inability to extract data, and therefore, there was no need to perform a sensitivity analysis by repeating the analysis with the exclusion of these studies.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-10-18 16:40:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of the 24 included studies, only eight (total number of participants 526) yielded data. Global Impression of Change was the only outcome for which there were sufficient data for pooling, and only for four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hermann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hermann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kretschmar-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Kretschmar 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macchione-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Macchione 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trabant-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Trabant 1977</LINK>). The participants in <LINK REF="STD-Hermann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hermann 1987</LINK> were diagnosed as having "organic brain syndrome" and those in <LINK REF="STD-Kretschmar-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Kretschmar 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Macchione-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Macchione 1976</LINK> as having "psycho-organic syndromes". The average age of participants in the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hermann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hermann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kretschmar-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Kretschmar 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macchione-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Macchione 1976</LINK>) ranged from 73.2 to 75 years. All three studies reported a significant benefit from piracetam. <LINK REF="STD-Trabant-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Trabant 1977</LINK>, the smallest of the four studies, enrolled participants with "cerebrovascular insufficiency" with an average age of only 59 years. This study resulted in a non-significant difference favoring the control group. There was evidence of heterogeneity in the results from the four studies, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test = 19.17 (df = 3, P &lt; 0.001). Overall, the Peto OR for improvement in the piracetam group compared with the placebo group was 3.43 (95% CI 2.32 to 5.07, P &lt; 0.00001) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). This estimate was calculated on the basis of completers' data rather than intention-to-treat which could not be extracted from the reports.</P>
<P>The evidence of effects on cognition and other measures, was inconclusive. In the limited data available, no significant differences were found between treatment and placebo groups for cognition (immediate memory, visuospatial, MMSE, delayed memory or speech) for dependency, or for depression.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-10-18 16:40:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Despite widespread use of piracetam, the evidence for its efficacy is poor in quality and quantity. Many of the studies have been performed on participants who were not classified with the use of standardized criteria. The participants have been treated for short periods of time - the vast majority were studied for three months or less. The use of objective, standardized cognitive scales that are sensitive to change was another serious omission in this body of evidence. Many studies evaluated multiple outcome measures, and made no adjustment for multiple comparisons. Often, the reports did not include the data from which the comment "no significant differences between groups" was made.</P>
<P>Of the outcomes assessed in this review, only impression of global change provided sufficient data for inclusion in a meta-analysis, and for this only four trials could be included. This finding is comparable with that of <LINK REF="REF-Waegemans-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waegemans 2002</LINK>, as was the overall beneficial effect apparently associated with piracetam. There was significant heterogeneity between studies and the relevance of the diagnostic categories used by the investigators to modern concepts of dementia and cognitive impairment is uncertain. The findings must be viewed as tentative since, in addition to the paucity of data available for meta-analysis, the considerable amounts of unpublished and untraceable data not available to the review authors raises the possibility of publication bias.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-10-18 16:40:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The limited evidence of benefit in short-term studies on subjective global impression involving participants with clinical features suggestive of dementia or cognitive impairment is sufficient to justify further research and a full publication of all the past studies.</P>
<P>The potential use of this drug could be further evaluated by the following methods.</P>
<OL>
<LI>An individual patient data (IPD) review would yield valuable information about the size of effects over time as well as within particular diagnostic groups. The large volume of currently unpublished and inaccessible data should be made available for such a review.</LI>
<LI>Pending a full analysis of all unpublished data there may be a need for further randomized trials of piracetam in patients with the diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer type or vascular dementia made by currently accepted diagnostic criteria - ICD 10, or DSM IV, or NINCDS-ADRDA. Trials of piracetam should last at least six months and preferably longer. Global cognitive instruments which are sensitive to change, e.g. ADAS (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale), should be used as primary outcome measures as well as the Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGIC). Effects of piracetam on levels of dependency and caregiver quality of life should also be incorporated in such studies.</LI>
