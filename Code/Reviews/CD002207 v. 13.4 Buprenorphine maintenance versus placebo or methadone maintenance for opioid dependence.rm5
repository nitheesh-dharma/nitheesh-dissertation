<P>
<B>Background</B> </P>
<P>Methadone is widely used as a replacement for illicit opioid use such as heroin in medically-supported opioid substitution maintenance programmes. Two other drugs have been used to help reduce illicit opioid use, specifically buprenorphine and LAAM (levo-alpha-acetylmethadol). LAAM is not used in current clinical practice. Buprenorphine is currently used and can reduce illicit opioid use compared with placebo, although it is less effective than methadone. Buprenorphine is an opioid drug that is not as potent as heroin and methadone, although the effects of buprenorphine may last longer. Buprenorphine can be taken once every two days. The trials include different formulations of buprenorphine: sublingual solution, sublingual tablets, combined buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet and an implant.</P>
<P> <B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The review of trials found that buprenorphine at high doses (16 mg) can reduce illicit opioid use effectively compared with placebo, and buprenorphine at any dose studied retains people in treatment better than placebo.</P>
<P>Buprenorphine appears to be less effective than methadone in retaining people in treatment, if prescribed in a flexible dose regimen or at a fixed and low dose (2 - 6 mg per day). Buprenorphine prescribed at fixed doses (above 7 mg per day) was not different from methadone prescribed at fixed doses (40 mg or more per day) in retaining people in treatment or in suppression of illicit opioid use.</P>

<P>We include 31 trials (5430 participants), the quality of evidence varied from high to moderate quality.</P>
<P>There is high quality of evidence that buprenorphine was superior to placebo medication in retention of participants in treatment at all doses examined. Specifically, buprenorphine retained participants better than placebo: at low doses (2 - 6 mg), 5 studies, 1131 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.88; at medium doses (7 - 15 mg), 4 studies, 887 participants, RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.87; and at high doses (&#8805; 16 mg), 5 studies, 1001 participants, RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.15 to 2.90. However, there is moderate quality of evidence that only high-dose buprenorphine (&#8805; 16 mg) was more effective than placebo in suppressing illicit opioid use measured by urinanalysis in the trials, 3 studies, 729 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.17; 95% CI -1.85 to -0.49, Notably, low-dose, (2 studies, 487 participants, SMD 0.10; 95% CI -0.80 to 1.01), and medium-dose, (2 studies, 463 participants, SMD -0.08; 95% CI -0.78 to 0.62) buprenorphine did not suppress illicit opioid use measured by urinanalysis better than placebo.</P>
<P>There is high quality of evidence that buprenorphine in flexible doses adjusted to participant need,was less effective than methadone in retaining participants, 5 studies, 788 participants, RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95. For those retained in treatment, no difference was observed in suppression of opioid use as measured by urinalysis, 8 studies, 1027 participants, SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.23 to 0.02 or self report, 4 studies, 501 participants, SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.07, with moderate quality of evidence.</P>
<P>Consistent with the results in the flexible-dose studies, in low fixed-dose studies, methadone (&#8804; 40 mg) was more likely to retain participants than low-dose buprenorphine (2 - 6 mg), (3 studies, 253 participants, RR 0.67; 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.87). However, we found contrary results at medium dose and high dose: there was no difference between medium-dose buprenorphine (7 - 15 mg) and medium-dose methadone (40 - 85 mg) in retention, (7 studies, 780 participants, RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.10) or in suppression of illicit opioid use as measured by urines, (4 studies, 476 participants, SMD 0.25; 95% CI -0.08 to 0.58) or self report of illicit opioid use, (2 studies, 174 participants, SMD -0.82; 95% CI -1.83 to 0.19). Similarly, there was no difference between high-dose buprenorphine (&#8805; 16 mg) and high-dose methadone (&#8805; 85 mg) in retention (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.20 to 3.16) or suppression of self-reported heroin use (SMD -0.73; 95% CI -1.08 to -0.37) (1 study, 134 participants).</P>
<P>Few studies reported adverse events ; two studies compared adverse events statistically, finding no difference between methadone and buprenorphine, except for a single result indicating more sedation among those using methadone.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-07 14:53:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Buprenorphine is an effective medication in the maintenance treatment of heroin dependence, retaining people in treatment at any dose above 2 mg, and suppressing illicit opioid use (at doses 16 mg or greater) based on placebo-controlled trials.</P>
<P>However, compared to methadone, buprenorphine retains fewer people when doses are flexibly delivered and at low fixed doses. If fixed medium or high doses are used, buprenorphine and methadone appear no different in effectiveness (retention in treatment and suppression of illicit opioid use); however, fixed doses are rarely used in clinical practice so the flexible dose results are more relevant to patient care. Methadone is superior to buprenorphine in retaining people in treatment, and methadone equally suppresses illicit opioid use.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-01-07 14:57:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Opioids are a class of compounds that elicit analgesic effect by binding to opioid receptors within the central and peripheral nervous system. Opioids include natural opiates such as opium (from the poppy) and morphine, and natural derivatives or synthetic compounds such as heroin (diacetylmorphine), oxycodone, buprenorphine and methadone.</P>
<P>Opioids produce euphoria and have been associated with recreational use. They are generally consumed by injection or inhalation of the fumes produced by heating. Regular use of opioids can lead to opioid dependence. Opioid dependence is a medical diagnosis that involves the inability to cease using opioids. The DSM-IV criteria for dependence (cited here as the studies predominantly use DSM-IV, whereas DSM-V was released in 2013) require three or more of the following features:</P>
<OL>
<LI>A strong desire or sense of compulsion to take the drug;</LI>
<LI>Difficulties in controlling drug-taking behaviour in terms of its onset, termination, or levels of use;</LI>
<LI>A physiological withdrawal state when drug use is stopped or reduced, as evidenced by: the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance; or use of the same (or a closely related) substance with the intention of relieving or avoiding withdrawal symptoms;</LI>
<LI>Evidence of tolerance, such that increased doses of the drug are required in order to achieve effects originally produced by lower doses;</LI>
<LI>Progressive neglect of alternative pleasures or interests because of drug use, increased amount of time necessary to obtain or take the drug or to recover from its effects;</LI>
<LI>Persisting with drug use despite clear evidence of overtly harmful consequences, such as harm to the liver, depressive mood states or impairment of cognitive functioning.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The illegality of opioids such as heroin precludes the accurate assessment of how many people use these drugs, but recent estimates suggest there are between 15 and 39 million problem opioid users worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Degenhardt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Degenhardt 2012</LINK>), and although the prevalence of opioid dependence is low (0.6 - 0.8% of the global population; <LINK REF="REF-UNODC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODC 2012</LINK>), the burden to the individual and the community is significant. Illicit opioid dependence is a significant public health problem with heroin use associated with the spread of infectious disease (e.g., HIV, hepatitis B and C) and overdose deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Degenhardt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Degenhardt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathers 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-07 14:57:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dole and Nyswander defined opioid dependence as a "physiological disease characterised by a permanent metabolic deficiency" which was best managed by administering the opioid-dependent person "a sufficient amount of drug to stabilise the metabolic deficiency" (<LINK REF="REF-Dole-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dole 1965</LINK>). In the early 1960s they introduced orally-administered maintenance doses of the synthetic opioid drug methadone as a treatment for opioid dependence. Maintenance treatment is designed to be an ongoing treatment. The substitution of legal opioids in known doses and purity provides an opportunity to stabilise the person by eliminating withdrawal, craving, participation in obtaining illegal opioids and use of needles.</P>
<P>Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been one of the main forms of treatment for opioid dependence. As described elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Faggiano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faggiano 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2009</LINK>), maintenance treatment with oral methadone appears to be an effective and accepted intervention for illicit opioid (heroin) dependence, and it is widely used in some countries. Yet MMT has a number of negative characteristics which potentially influence its effectiveness and which have led to an interest in alternative pharmacotherapies and methods of treatment delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1998</LINK>). The negative aspects of methadone are set out below.</P>
<P>One negative aspect of methadone is its potential to produce and/or maintain dependence on opioids, such that people experience withdrawal if a daily dose is missed, and detoxification can be a lengthy and difficult process which can discourage people from attempting withdrawal (of course, withdrawal from heroin and other opioids have similar problems). Additionally, because methadone is a full opioid agonist, there is no ceiling to the level of respiratory depression or sedation which methadone can induce, and methadone overdose can therefore be fatal (<LINK REF="REF-Drummer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummer 1992</LINK>). Although it is a long-acting opioid, in some countries and settings, the inconvenience of daily dosing and clinic visits may be unattractive to clients, and restrictions imposed by the daily dosing schedule on clients' general lifestyle and on opportunities to sustain employment may also limit its acceptance to heroin users. The provision of takeaway doses of methadone results in problems of diversion of the drug for illicit use by those not in treatment, although the extent of this problem varies across countries. Finally, heroin users have developed their own 'lore' regarding methadone's negative effects, although their views may not always be accurate or favourable. Thus, despite its many advantages, methadone maintenance appears to have limited suitability for some people. In some countries there may be restrictions on the use of methadone as far as doses and duration are concerned, and this may impair adequate clinical practice. These factors may restrict the ability of methadone to attract certain users into treatment, and the examination of alternative medications to broaden the range of pharmacotherapies has been the focus of research over recent years (e.g., <LINK REF="REF-Ling-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-01-07 14:57:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are a number of alternatives to methadone as a maintenance agent in the management of opioid dependence, as all opioids show cross-tolerance. The most promising of these involve pharmacotherapies which treat people with a pharmaceutical-grade opioid which has a long duration of action. These include the opiate partial agonist buprenorphine, the full agonist levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>) and sustained released morphine sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2007</LINK>). LAAM is no longer used in clinical practice. In addition, heroin-assisted treatment has been used in the management of opioid dependence, most notably in Switzerland (<LINK REF="REF-Perneger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perneger 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review focuses on the role of buprenorphine as a maintenance therapy in the management of opioid dependence. Buprenorphine is a potent synthetic opioid analgesic initially used for the management of acute pain. Pharmacologically, buprenorphine causes morphine-like subjective effects and produces cross-tolerance to other opioids.</P>
<P>Unlike methadone and heroin (which are full agonists), buprenorphine is a partial agonist and exerts weaker opioid effects at opioid receptor sites. This partial agonist action appears to make buprenorphine safer in overdose. Other benefits of buprenorphine may include an easier withdrawal phase and, because of the longer duration of action, the option of alternate-day dosing.</P>
<P>It was during the initial development of buprenorphine as an analgesic in the 1970s that its potential utility as a substitution agent in the treatment of opioid dependence was recognised. Early work (<LINK REF="REF-Jasinski-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jasinski 1978</LINK>) using buprenorphine administered by the subcutaneous route, characterised it as an opioid with low physical dependence liability with a minimal withdrawal syndrome. Subsequently, others (<LINK REF="REF-Fudala-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fudala 1990</LINK>) provided evidence that buprenorphine does produce a mild to moderate mu-agonist withdrawal syndrome. It was thought that at doses somewhat greater than those used for analgesia it could be used in the treatment of opioid dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Jasinski-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jasinski 1978</LINK>). Since that time a substantial international research effort has addressed the efficacy of buprenorphine maintenance therapy in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-01-07 14:59:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical trials conducted in the USA. showed buprenorphine to be superior to placebo medication, but when buprenorphine and methadone maintenance were compared in a series of impressive studies using fixed doses of the drugs, the results were mixed. Some of the fixed-dose studies showed no difference in efficacy, whereas others showed superiority for methadone, and yet others showed the reverse pattern. The investigators in these fixed-dose studies frequently concluded that the doses of buprenorphine or methadone chosen were too low, or that poor induction regimens led to poor retention and affected trial results. A series of variable- (or flexible-) dose studies have been conducted and shown essentially equivalent results for the two drugs. In these flexible-dose studies, dose is adjusted to individual need rather than participants being randomly assigned to a set and unchanging dose, as in the fixed-dose studies.</P>
<P>Given the mixed results of the early studies, it is important to attempt a systematic integration of the literature. Of particular importance is separately assessing the fixed- and flexible-dose studies and considering the results in the light of the differing doses and other individual trial features. Additionally, this review separately summarises the available placebo-controlled trial results.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review, incorporating additional studies, which was first published in 2002 and updated in 2008.</P>

<P>The two review authors who selected a study for inclusion then independently extracted the data for that study. Each review author assessed the same number of studies. We used a standardised checklist or data extraction, with a third review author acting as arbiter in cases of disagreement, and unresolved disagreements on inclusion, study quality or extraction being referred to the editor. Where required, we sought missing or clarifying information by contacting study authors. We handled multi-arm studies (e.g., <LINK REF="STD-Fudala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fudala 2003</LINK>) by combining relevant groups and avoiding double-counting of participants. Measurement scales were compatible across studies for the main outcomes, with dichotomous data or means and standard deviations being used in all cases.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-01-07 15:13:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the new studies included in this updated version and reassessed the studies already included in the existing review, using the criteria and the method indicated in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>
<I>).</I>
</P>
<P>The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews is a two-part tool, addressing six specific domains (namely randomisation sequence generation, randomisation allocation concealment, blinding of participants and assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other potential biases). The first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement, in terms of 'low', 'high' or 'unclear', relating to the risk of bias for that entry. To make these judgements we used the criteria indicated by Chapter 8 of the<I> Cochrane Handbook</I> and their applicability to the addiction field. </P>
<P>For this updated review, we considered the following domains to be relevant: sequence generation, allocation concealment (avoidance of selection bias), blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessor (performance and detection bias) and incomplete outcome data (attrition bias). See <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK> for a detailed description of the criteria used. As sequence generation and allocation concealment were adequately described in only a minority of trials (leaving it unclear whether the process was or was not adequate), it was not possible to meaningfully analyse trials by stratifying on these randomisation variables. To address the better-reported blinded/unblinded status, we report where possible the open-label (unblinded) studies separately from the blinded comparisons. Where incomplete data were reported (especially in the case of urine analysis of ongoing drug use), we wrote to the authors of the study seeking those data and included them where available.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-01-07 15:13:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We calculated a standardised effect size for each study, based on the outcome measure reported. As the retention-in-treatment data are a dichotomous outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). We estimated a standardised mean difference for continuous outcomes (urine results, self-reported heroin use, and criminal activity). Urine data were provided in reports (or by authors in response to our request) in the form of the average number of positive urines and a standard deviation, by treatment group.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-01-07 15:13:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The urine data are presented as a continuous outcome measure but are based on data requested directly from authors. This was necessary as urine results in the literature are routinely reported as the percentage of urine samples collected per treatment group that were positive or negative for a given drug (e.g., heroin) across the study period. These 'count data' are not compatible with the analysable data fields in Review Manager 5 (RevMan) (i.e., continuous, dichotomous, individual patient data). Based on advice provided by Cochrane statisticians, we asked the study authors to calculate the number of positive urines for each participant in each treatment group and derive a mean number of positive urines with a standard deviation, allowing for analysis of urine results as continuous data. These additional data were not available for four studies at the time of writing this review, and urine results are therefore not presented for these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kosten-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kosten 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neri-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Neri 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oliveto-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveto 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pani 2000,</LINK>).</P>

<I>
<B>Characteristics of the participants</B>
</I>
<BR/>The majority of participants in these studies were male, consistent with the profile of heroin-dependant users generally. They tended to be approximately 30 years of age, with different previous treatment histories and prevalence of use of other drugs, again consistent with what is known about heroin users presenting for treatment. The number of participants in these studies varied between 40 in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kakko-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kakko 2003</LINK>) up to 736 in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Ling-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1998</LINK>. The largest comparative trial of methadone versus buprenorphine included was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Mattick-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mattick 2003</LINK>, with 405 participants. Many of the studies had quite small numbers of participants in each individual treatment group. The characteristics of the participants and the inclusion and exclusion criteria were well described in all of the studies.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Duration of intervention</B>
</I>
<BR/>The interventions ranged in duration from 2 weeks through to 52 weeks. By and large, the interventions used clinically relevant doses of medication, although as noted earlier a number of the studies used predetermined fixed doses of medication (i.e., not tailored to individual treatment preference or need) and this created some limitations in terms of generalisability to day-to-day clinical practice, where flexible dosing is used.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Characteristics of the intervention and types of comparisons</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Twenty studies involved comparisons of methadone and buprenorphine. The remaining eleven studies compared buprenorphine with placebo, where placebo was defined as either true placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Fudala-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fudala 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kakko-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kakko 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kakko-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kakko 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krook-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Krook 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ling-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schottenfeld-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schottenfeld 2008</LINK>) or a 1 mg dose of buprenorphine (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmadi-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmadi 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ahmadi-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmadi 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ahmadi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmadi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ling-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1998</LINK>). Because of the use of 1 mg buprenorphine as a placebo dose, it is possible that we have underestimated the effect of buprenorphine at active doses. However, the approach is conservative and unlikely to bias results in favour of buprenorphine.</P>
<P>The studies selected for this review had two distinct dosing approaches. Eleven studies used flexible dosing (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristensen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kristensen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lintzeris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lintzeris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magura-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Magura 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattick-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mattick 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neri-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Neri 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petitjean-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Petitjean 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soyka-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Soyka 2008a</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Strain-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strain-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1994b</LINK>) where dose is titrated according to participant preference within a broad upper and lower dose limit. The remaining studies used fixed-dosing schedules where participants were randomised to receive a fixed dose or a dose with a narrow dose range, without dose adjustment after stabilisation.</P>
<P>As most of the studies with fixed-dosing schedules had more than one dose comparison, we have broadly classified the treatment groups as 'low dose', 'medium dose' and 'high dose' for the respective pharmacotherapy. These categories are arbitrary, driven by the doses used in the studies, and they do not reflect dose equivalence between methadone and buprenorphine. In the case of methadone, dose ranges up to 40 mg were classified as low dose, between 40 mg and 85 mg as medium dose, and more than 85 mg as high dose.

<LI>buprenorphine (low-dose, medium-dose and high-dose) versus placebo medication.</LI>

<P>Again, we used 1 mg of buprenorphine as a placebo dose, as it has been defined in this way by others (<LINK REF="STD-Ling-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1998</LINK>) who refer to this dose as being "adopted to serve essentially as a placebo".</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK> is classified as a flexible-dose study and we did not include the 20 mg methadone fixed-dose group from that study in the analyses as we did not choose to compare a low-dose fixed methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) dose with a flexible buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT) dose. Specific study doses are provided in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>The number of positive urines in each treatment group used to derive the mean number of positive urines with a standard deviation was not available for four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kosten-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kosten 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neri-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Neri 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oliveto-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Oliveto 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pani 2000</LINK>), and urine results are therefore not presented for these studies.</P>
<P>The reader should be aware that some of the studies used an aqueous ethanol-based buprenorphine solution which has been reported by some to have a higher bioavailability than the marketed tablet. As the literature on dose equivalence of the solution and the tablet was sparse, and the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and dosing practices within trials were not well-articulated, we used the doses as defined by the study authors rather than trying to estimate the dose equivalence per study. It is also noted that intra- and inter-individual differences in metabolism, effects of pregnancy, and concurrent illicit drug use will all affect blood levels of medications. This approach seemed reasonable as no blood levels of the medication were given in the studies.</P>

<P>We considered empirically testing these four studies separately but they involve different dosing regimens. To be consistent with the analysis in this review where studies were grouped by dosage (both the dose size and whether they are flexible or fixed), we did not combine the buprenorphine-naloxone studies. The results from all four studies that use the combination formula showed results favouring the buprenorphine-naloxone combination.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison 01: Flexible-dose buprenorphine versus flexible-dose methadone:</HEADING>
<P>As noted earlier, the flexible-dose studies probably provide the best estimate of the likely impact of methadone and buprenorphine in day-to-day clinical practice, as they mirror clinical practice in terms of dose adjustments and in terms of the doses employed in the studies. The 11 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristensen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kristensen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lintzeris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lintzeris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magura-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Magura 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattick-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mattick 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neri-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Neri 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petitjean-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Petitjean 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soyka-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Soyka 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strain-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strain-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1994b</LINK>); 1391 participants included in the analysis, showed results in favour of methadone: risk ratio (RR) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.95. The Chi test for heterogeneity was significant (I<SUP> </SUP>= 56%, P = 0.01). Because of differences in methodology potentially creating heterogeneity among the 11 flexible-dose studies, we conducted separate meta-analyses of the double-blind studies and open-label studies. The results of these separate analyses indicated that in the double-blind studies (five studies, 788 participants) there was a lower rate of retention for participants treated with buprenorphine: RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, with very little heterogeneity (I = 19.0%, P = 0.29). However, very high heterogeneity was observed among open-label studies (six studies, 603 participants; I = 73%, P &lt; 0.005).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-08 12:34:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Buprenorphine is an effective medication for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, as it is superior to placebo in retaining people in treatment based on all the 14 placebo-controlled comparisons. However, based on objective urinanalysis results, buprenorphine is only superior to placebo in suppression of heroin use at high doses (defined here as 16 mg or more) but not at low or medium doses (defined here as 15 mg or less).</P>
<P>Before discussing the results of the buprenorphine and methadone comparisons, we remind the reader that we have distinguished between the fixed-dose studies and flexible-dose studies, as the former do not relate to clinical reality, where doses are in fact titrated by the clinician in response to individual need. The flexible-dose studies are more clinically relevant and deserve more attention in consideration of the meta-analytic review findings. The results of the meta-analyses here clearly indicate that methadone is better able to retain participants than buprenorphine in flexible-dosing approaches (at least in the double-blind efficacy trials). Turning to reduction in heroin use, within the flexible-dose studies, there was no evidence of any difference between methadone and buprenorphine in their ability to suppress heroin use (self-reported or urinanalysis results).</P>
<P>One explanation which has been advanced by authors in some of the studies included here for the poorer retention in buprenorphine treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Fischer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fischer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petitjean-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Petitjean 2001</LINK>) is that they inducted participants too slowly onto buprenorphine, and that this was the cause of the poorer retention in that medication group. It is possible that retention is affected by too-slow induction, and given the apparent relative safety of buprenorphine it may be possible to induct people to higher doses at a more rapid rate and to overcome the problem of slightly poorer retention for buprenorphine compared with methadone. However, there are a number of other possible explanations for the poorer retention on buprenorphine than methadone. In particular, it may well be that buprenorphine, being a partial agonist, does not retain people because it does not have a full opioid effect and is less satisfying to those allocated to it. Another possibility is that people in the initial stages of dosing who have recently ingested heroin suffer a mild withdrawal syndrome by virtue of buprenorphine (a partial agonist) displacing heroin (a full agonist) from opioid receptors in the central nervous system, and this mild withdrawal may lead to leaving treatment. A further possibility is that buprenorphine is simply easier to withdraw from and, on that basis, those using it are more at liberty to leave treatment without the severe withdrawal syndrome that can accompany methadone withdrawal. These factors may all act together to cause buprenorphine to have a slightly poorer outcome for retention than methadone. Future research should be undertaken to address this particular issue.</P>
<P>Turning to other outcomes, the results from two trials suggest there is no difference between methadone and buprenorphine for reducing criminal activity. There is evidence from other literature showing criminal activity is decreased in those who are in methadone treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Lind-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lind 2005</LINK>). The majority of the studies that reported mortality data reported no deaths, and the two studies that reported deaths were among the controls (<LINK REF="STD-Kakko-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kakko 2003</LINK>) or not related to study medication (<LINK REF="STD-Ling-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1998</LINK>). Other research suggests that mortality is decreased among those in opioid substitution treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Soyka-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soyka 2011</LINK>), although methadone dosing in the first two weeks of induction is associated with heightened risk of death from methadone overdose (<LINK REF="REF-Clausen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clausen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Degenhardt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Degenhardt 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Degenhardt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Degenhardt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of studies did not compare adverse events statistically, although those that did found only one difference between methadone and buprenorphine with one study reporting more sedation among participants on methadone (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-01-08 12:34:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence is reasonably complete with regard to the effectiveness of buprenorphine relative to placebo, and buprenorphine relative to methadone, in maintenance for the important outcomes of retention and illicit opioid use. More data on the impacts on criminal activity, mortality and adverse events would be desirable. However, it may not be possible to generate such data from randomised trials, especially for impacts on crime and mortality, as randomised controlled trials are typically too short in duration to show differential effects in these domains.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-01-08 12:34:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The clinical trials represented in this review are of reasonable quality, and whilst many of them did not fully explain how randomisation was concealed, they appear to have used doses which are clinically relevant and to have treated participants for significant periods of time. Moreover, despite the tendency of randomised studies to include selected populations, characteristics of drug users enrolled in the studies included in this review appear to be heterogeneous enough to allow generalisability of the results across different clinical and cultural settings. Based on the nature of the trials, it would appear the external validity or generalisability of the results is quite good, particularly from those trials which have used large sample sizes and adequate doses.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-01-08 12:34:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>To overcome bias at the study level, we have used: (a) predetermined main outcomes; (b) the main outcomes being independent of the study reporting; (c) including all the reported main outcomes from the studies; and (d) additional data from the authors (which was generally provided).</P>
<P>At the review level, to reduce our risks of bias, we (a) used predetermined study inclusion criteria; (b) employed wide-ranging and thorough searches of the literature; (c) relied on independent coding of the data, with separate resolution of disagreements; and (d) subjected the review to repeated independent refereeing and comment through Cochrane Collaboration methods. For example, as mentioned above, we addressed the potential problem of selective outcome reporting by contacting the authors of the studies to obtain results for main outcome variables. We note that we have reported data for retention for all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1995a</LINK>), where retention was reported by dose change and not by remaining in the treatment condition. There is no evidence of selective reporting for the retention measure. The data for urine results were included, after we asked authors to provide such data and there was good compliance with this request, so that measured outcomes were provided to us and included in the review.</P>
<P>We have also included in the review an indication of which studies contributed data to the outcomes, for the interested reader (see Figures and Tables, Data Analysis, and elsewhere in text).</P>

<P>The implications of this review are clear for clinical practice. Despite the results showing that buprenorphine (especially at high doses) is an effective maintenance therapy for heroin dependence when compared with placebo, methadone maintenance treatment at flexible doses is better able to retain people in treatment. Both treatments suppress heroin use. Buprenorphine should be supported as a medication to use in substitution maintenance treatment, where higher doses of methadone cannot be administered or methadone is not tolerated, or simply to provide patient and clinician choice. Given buprenorphine's different pharmacological properties, it may have advantages in some settings and under some policies where its relative safety and alternate-day administration are useful clinically compared to methadone.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-01-08 12:35:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There does not appear to be any need for further randomised control trials of the relative efficacy of methadone compared with buprenorphine. There does appear to be a need to undertake studies which will clarify factors responsible for retention in the first few weeks or months of treatment in buprenorphine versus methadone. One way of addressing this issue would be to compare a standard induction as used in some of the trials reported herein with a rapid induction onto buprenorphine, with the potential to have a further comparison of induction onto methadone. Problems in the methods of induction onto buprenorphine within the trials analysed might partly explain the inferiority of buprenorphine shown in this review. It would be ideal if such a trial were to be conducted under double-blind conditions, particularly in terms of the rapid versus standard induction onto buprenorphine. Other outcome measures could be included in future studies, such as self-reported drug use, criminal activity, physical health, and psychological health, which were too infrequently and irregularly reported in the literature analysed in the current review.</P>
<P>There is enough research evidence to show that buprenorphine in low, medium or high doses is more effective than placebo in retaining people in treatment, and in reducing heroin use at high doses. Future trials involving placebo (or indeed short-term maintenance where people are terminated from treatment after a few weeks of intervention) should consider the ethical implications of providing substandard (i.e., placebo or short-term treatment), given the strength of the available evidence.</P>
