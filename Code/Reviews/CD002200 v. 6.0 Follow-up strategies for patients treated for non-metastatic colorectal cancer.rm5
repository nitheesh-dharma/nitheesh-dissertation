<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Colorectal cancer affects about 1 in 20 people in developed countries. Most patients (about two thirds) have curable disease. Follow-up after curative treatment usually means visits to the doctor as well as having some tests. Many people believe that follow-up saves lives, but we are not sure how often the patient should see the doctor and what tests they should have, and when.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is it important?</B>
</P>
<P>Follow-up is expensive, it can make patients anxious around the time of their visit, and can be inconvenient. Tests are expensive and can have side effects. If tests find that cancer has come back in a person who feels well, but treatment cannot cure them, finding the recurrent cancer may not have helped that person or their family.</P>
<P>
<B>We asked...</B>
</P>
<P>We asked if follow-up (i.e. tests and doctor visits) after colorectal cancer has been treated curatively is helpful. We looked at all different kinds of follow-up: some versus none; more tests versus fewer tests; and follow-up done by surgeons, general practitioners (GPs), or nurses.</P>
<P>
<B>We found...</B>
</P>
<P>We found 15 studies, including 5403 participants. We found that follow-up did not improve overall survival (high-quality evidence), colorectal cancer-specific survival (moderate-quality evidence), or relapse-free survival (moderate-quality evidence). If patients have follow-up, they are much more likely to have surgery if the cancer is detected again (high-quality evidence). With follow-up, more asymptomatic "silent" cancer relapses are likely to be found at planned visits (moderate-quality evidence). Harms from tests were not common, but only two studies reported them (moderate-quality evidence). We found very little data on quality of life or costs.</P>
<P>
<B>This means...</B>
</P>
<P>The information we have now suggests that there is little benefit from intensifying follow-up, but there is also little evidence about quality of life, harms, and costs. We do not know what is the best way to follow patients treated for non-metastatic colorectal cancer, or if we should at all. We know little about the costs of follow-up in this setting. However, we found four ongoing trials (which will enrol a further 4801 participants); they will look at quality of life, harms, and costs, and may reveal a better understanding of what is the best follow-up programme. Consumer needs and concerns with respect to the value of follow-up require further research.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:19:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is common clinical practice to follow patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) for several years following their curative surgery or adjuvant therapy, or both. Despite this widespread practice, there is considerable controversy about how often patients should be seen, what tests should be performed, and whether these varying strategies have any significant impact on patient outcomes. This is the second update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002 and first updated in 2007.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-10-18 21:04:00 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura E  Prescott">
<P>To assess the effects of intensive follow-up for patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer treated with curative intent.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-11-03 12:16:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, we searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to May 20th, 2016), Embase (1974 to May 20th, 2016), CINAHL (1981 to May 20th, 2016), and Science Citation Index (1900 to May 20th, 2016). We also searched reference lists of articles, and handsearched the Proceedings of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (2011 to 2014). In addition, we searched the following trials registries (May 20th, 2016): ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We further contacted study authors. No language or publication restrictions were applied to the search strategies.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-03 11:40:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We studied 5403 participants enrolled in 15 studies. (We included two new studies in this second update.) Although the studies varied in setting (general practitioner (GP)-led, nurse-led, or surgeon-led) and "intensity" of follow-up, there was very little inconsistency in the results.</P>
<P>Overall survival: we found no evidence of a statistical effect with intensive follow-up (hazard ratio (HR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.02; I² = 4%; P = 0.41; high-quality evidence). There were 1098 deaths among 4786 participants enrolled in 12 studies.</P>
<P>Colorectal cancer-specific survival: this did not differ with intensive follow-up (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; I² = 0%; P = 0.45; moderate-quality evidence). There were 432 colorectal cancer deaths among 3769 participants enrolled in seven studies.</P>
<P>Relapse-free survival: we found no statistical evidence of effect with intensive follow-up (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.18; I² = 5%; P = 0.39; moderate-quality evidence). There were 1416 relapses among 5253 participants enrolled in 14 studies.</P>
<P>Salvage surgery with curative intent: this was more frequent with intensive follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.98, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.56; I² = 31%; P = 0.14; high-quality evidence). There were 457 episodes of salvage surgery in 5157 participants enrolled in 13 studies.</P>
<P>Interval (symptomatic) recurrences: these were less frequent with intensive follow-up (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.86; I² = 66%; P = 0.007; moderate-quality evidence). Three hundred and seventy-six interval recurrences were reported in 3933 participants enrolled in seven studies.</P>
<P>Intensive follow-up did not appear to affect quality of life, anxiety, nor depression (reported in three studies).</P>
<P>Harms from colonoscopies did not differ with intensive follow-up (RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.11 to 40.17; moderate-quality evidence). In two studies, there were seven colonoscopic complications in 2112 colonoscopies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-03 11:40:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of our review suggest that there is no overall survival benefit for intensifying the follow-up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. Although more participants were treated with salvage surgery with curative intent in the intensive follow-up group, this was not associated with improved survival. Harms related to intensive follow-up and salvage therapy were not well reported.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-13 05:41:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-03 11:40:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a commonly diagnosed malignancy affecting about one person in 20 in most westernised countries (<LINK REF="REF-DevCan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">DevCan 2005</LINK>). Approximately two-thirds of patients will present with potentially curable disease (by surgery plus or minus adjuvant therapies). Of these, 50% to 60% will relapse with metastatic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Cutsem-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Cutsem 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoo 2006</LINK>). Surgeons, oncologists, and other health professionals caring for CRC patients have pursued a number of strategies to try to improve clinical outcomes. These have included population screening, better diagnostic testing, improved surgical and anaesthetic techniques, and more widespread utilisation of effective adjuvant therapies.</P>
<P>After definitive treatment is completed, clinician attention turns to follow-up strategies designed to detect recurrence at a stage when further curative procedures can be used. Follow-up strategies have also been developed in order to detect new curable metachronous (i.e. occurring at different times) primary tumours. There is overlap between these two strategies; this current review focuses on the former issue of strategies designed to detect curable recurrences of the original cancer. These include recurrences that are localised in either the lung, liver, abdomen, or pelvis and can be completely resected or ablated with curative intent.</P>
<P>Following patients after definitive treatment for cancer has become a traditional component of medical care (<LINK REF="REF-Edelman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelman 1997</LINK>). It is likely that clinicians follow patients after curative treatment for CRC at least in part to provide positive feedback on their management but also to assess the toxicities of treatment and to provide more accurate outcome data (<LINK REF="REF-Audisio-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audisio 1996</LINK>). Patients and their clinicians develop relationships during treatment and follow-up that can make it hard to discharge patients and return responsibility for care back to their primary physician in the community (<LINK REF="REF-Audisio-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audisio 2000</LINK>). As a result, a practising clinician can accumulate a large number of follow-up patients, and the surveillance of this cohort consumes significant resources.</P>
<P>The opportunity cost of the resources involved is considerable, limiting the care that the clinician can provide for other individuals. Few clinicians restrict CRC follow-up visits to clinical examination only, and the temptation to order routine investigations is often reinforced by patients who desire tests to "prove" that their disease is under control (<LINK REF="REF-Audisio-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audisio 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kievit-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kievit 2000</LINK>). Clinicians justify this approach by claiming that recurrences are being detected earlier than would otherwise occur and that patient outcomes are improved as a result (<LINK REF="REF-Kievit-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kievit 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-03 13:57:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Follow-up programmes in colorectal cancer should be based on the anatomic and temporal patterns of recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Audisio-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audisio 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edelman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelman 1997</LINK>). The most important phase of follow-up is the first two to three years after primary resection, as during this time, the majority of recurrences will become apparent (<LINK REF="REF-B_x00f6_hm-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Böhm 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ovaska-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ovaska 1989</LINK>). The liver is the most common site of metastases from colorectal cancer. A small proportion of these patients (10% to 20%) will have liver metastases that are distributed within the liver in such a fashion that makes them amenable to surgical resection or ablation (<LINK REF="REF-Alberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alberts 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muratore-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muratore 2007</LINK>). Published series' of patients undergoing such surgical interventions (with significant numbers of long-term survivors) encourage this approach (<LINK REF="REF-Choti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanas 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pawlik-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pawlik 2005</LINK>). A number of strategies have been proposed to detect liver metastases at an early stage in order to identify such patients; these include the monitoring of blood tests (liver function, level of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)), and routine imaging of the liver and lung (<LINK REF="REF-Fleischer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleischer 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sugarbaker-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugarbaker 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>The psychological outcomes of follow-up programmes for patients with cancer can be positive or negative. Positive outcomes include reassurance and support. The negative outcomes include false reassurance, increased anxiety, fear and disappointment associated with early detection of an incurable recurrence, morbidity and mortality associated with procedures performed as a result of abnormal results, and distress caused by false-positive results. Appropriate quality of life measurements could provide information about these outcomes.</P>
<P>Follow-up can be comprised of clinic visits, examinations, and tests (blood tests and endoscopic and radiological examinations). Intensive follow-up may consist of an increased frequency of clinic visits, tests, and examinations in comparison with none or fewer clinic visits, tests, and examinations.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-06 02:49:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Follow-up programmes in colorectal cancer are thought to increase the early detection of recurrence at a stage when further curative procedures can be used, as well as new curable metachronous primary tumours, thereby, improving survival outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-GILDA-1998" TYPE="STUDY">GILDA 1998</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-11-13 05:41:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whether systematic follow-up can alter long-term clinical outcomes for CRC remains controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Pfister-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfister 2004</LINK>). Whilst some commentators have concluded that follow-up is worthwhile (<LINK REF="REF-Gerdes-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerdes 1990</LINK>), others have questioned its effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Kievit-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kievit 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McArdle-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McArdle 2000</LINK>). The variation in follow-up programmes, in terms of timing and frequency of clinician visits and the investigations undertaken by clinicians, is considerable (<LINK REF="REF-Collopy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collopy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vernava-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vernava 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Virgo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virgo 1995</LINK>). Routine follow-up has the potential to create psychological harm in patients, and any such disadvantages need to be outweighed by improved clinical outcomes (such as overall survival) that matter to patients. Data from follow-up studies in other cancers (e.g. breast cancer and overall survival) is not encouraging in this regard (<LINK REF="REF-Rojas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials exploring questions relating to the effectiveness of follow-up strategies in CRC patients treated with curative intent.</P>

<P>Two authors (BEH and GMJ) checked the titles and abstracts identified from the databases. The authors obtained the full text of all studies of possible relevance for independent assessment, decided which trials met the inclusion criteria, and graded their methodological quality. Discussion between the review authors resolved any disagreement. We contacted authors of primary studies for clarification where necessary. The reported outcomes were not used as criteria for including studies. We included studies irrespective of their publication status. We documented the selection process using <LINK REF="REF-Covidence" TYPE="REFERENCE">Covidence</LINK> and presented the details of the search in a PRISMA diagram. Reasons for exclusion are presented in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table.

<P>Two review authors (BEH and GMJ) independently performed data extraction; we contacted the authors of trials to provide missing data where possible. We entered data into a previously piloted data form then into <LINK REF="REF-Covidence" TYPE="REFERENCE">Covidence</LINK>. One author (BEH) entered data into RevMan, which a second author (AS) checked. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. We extracted the following data when available:</P>
<OL>
<LI>number of participants;</LI>
<LI>the age and status of the participants;</LI>
<LI>inclusion and exclusion criteria;</LI>
<LI>setting;</LI>
<LI>treatment regimen;</LI>
<LI>follow-up details; and</LI>
<LI>survival, adverse events, and quality of life indices.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We collected data that were sufficient to populate a table of characteristics of included studies. For studies where only a subset of the participants recruited were eligible for inclusion, we included them if they reported data for that subgroup separately. Where a study had more than one study arm, such as <LINK REF="STD-FACS-2014" TYPE="STUDY">FACS 2014</LINK>, we combined those intervention study arms that met the inclusion criteria and compared them with the control arm; this ensured we did not double-count data. When subgroup analysis was performed for <LINK REF="STD-FACS-2014" TYPE="STUDY">FACS 2014</LINK>, we combined the two arms that had carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) measured and the two arms in which computerised tomography (CT) was used. We compared the magnitude and direction of effects reported by studies with how they were presented in the review.</P>
<P>In order to report time-to-event data, we used the RevMan, <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>, calculator and a spreadsheet developed by Matthew Sydes, <LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK>, to derive observed (O) and log-rank expected events (E) (O-E) and variance. <LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK> presents 11 methods for calculating a hazard ratio (HR) or associated statistics, or both, from published time-to-event-analyses into a practical, less statistical guide. The methods we used to do so were dependent on the available information in the texts, and we report them as follows.</P>

<P>Where possible, we conducted time-to-event analyses for overall survival, colorectal cancer-specific survival, and relapse-free survival. We expressed the results as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) when the relevant information was available in the text or could be derived. Where necessary, we derived the HR using the RevMan calculator and calculated associated statistics using an Excel spreadsheet developed by Matthew Sydes (Cancer Division of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinical Trials Unit) in collaboration with the Meta-analysis Group of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, London (<LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK>). We reported relative risks (RR) and 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We interpreted a statistically non-significant result (P value larger than 0.05) as a finding of uncertainty unless the confidence intervals were sufficiently narrow to rule out a potentially important magnitude of effect. We defined confidence intervals between 0.75 and 1.25 as excluding clinically meaningful benefits or harms.</P>

We were informed on 20 April 2015 that because of personnel changes, the authors were unable to retrieve the data, which meant we were not able to report overall survival data for this study. Because they plotted two curves for each study arm, it was not possible to extract data for use in time-to-event analysis. We were in contact with the study authors for <LINK REF="STD-GILDA-1998" TYPE="STUDY">GILDA 1998</LINK> on 18 February 2016, who kindly provided us with unpublished data, which we were able to include for the outcomes 'Interval recurrences' and 'Salvage surgery' (<LINK REF="REF-Fossati-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fossati 2015</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-11-21 21:12:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of our review suggest that there is no overall survival benefit for intensifying the follow-up of participants after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. The analyses did not show a significant difference in the incidence of recurrence between the participants in the intensively followed groups and the control groups. However, significantly more surgical procedures for recurrence were performed in the experimental arms of the trials. Recurrences in the more intensively followed groups may have been detected earlier allowing for effective salvage treatments, but this did not lead to better overall survival.</P>
<P>Each trial follow-up strategy combined a number of different components, including frequency of visits, type of clinical assessment, types and frequency of tests, and the setting in which follow-up was conducted. No trial compared the addition of one specific intervention, and the feasibility of comparing strategies with a variety of components and varying complexity becomes problematic. The use of liver imaging does not appear to be associated with improved survival. A specific variation across the studies was the intensity of follow-up. For example, the follow-up intensity in the intensively followed group in <LINK REF="STD-Ohlsson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlsson 1995</LINK> was similar to the intensity of follow-up in the control groups of other studies in the review (<LINK REF="STD-M_x00e4_kel_x00e4_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mäkelä 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pietra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pietra 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoemaker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schoemaker 1998</LINK>). Therefore, it was not possible to extract from these data a precise indication of the optimal combinations of frequency, type, and setting for follow-up investigations for these participants. Our findings were robust to sensitivity analysis when excluding

<P>Most recurrences (about 90%) occur within the initial 36 months after initial therapy for colorectal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Ryuk-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryuk 2014</LINK>), so to detect recurrences, follow-up duration should be at least 36 months for colorectal cancer. Patients with rectal cancer should have longer follow-up because liver and lung recurrences may be delayed. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy may further delay recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Sadahiro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadahiro 2003</LINK>). For the outcomes included in this study, median follow-up duration was greater than 48 months for more than 90% of the participants studied.</P>
<P>This updated version of the review has substantially altered our conclusions: where we previously reported that "there was evidence that an overall survival benefit at five years exists for patients undergoing more intensive follow up" (<LINK REF="REF-Jeffery-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeffery 2007</LINK>), this update does not confirm these findings. In this update of the review, we were able to include data on an additional 3322 participants enrolled in seven more studies (<LINK REF="STD-Augestad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Augestad 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FACS-2014" TYPE="STUDY">FACS 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GILDA-1998" TYPE="STUDY">GILDA 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sobhani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sobhani 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strand-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treasure-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Treasure 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>).

One of the six newly included studies was at high risk of bias; two assessed the intervention of setting (general practitioner (GP) or nurse versus surgeon). One study evaluated the utility of PET/CT (positron emission tomography&#8211;computed tomography); and one other large study, which contributed 212/1098 (19%) of the events for the survival outcome, was set in hospitals that used modern investigations and multidisciplinary teams to manage recurrences (<LINK REF="STD-FACS-2014" TYPE="STUDY">FACS 2014</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-11-13 05:29:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence we report is directly relevant to the study question.</P>
<P>The studies have been accrued over a prolonged time period, during which time there have been significant changes in cancer staging procedures, operative techniques (surgical metastasectomy or ablation of liver metastases), postoperative care, adjuvant therapies, and the investigations available to detect recurrence. Systemic adjuvant therapies and effective palliative chemotherapy drugs are now widely utilised, with significant prolongation of survival rates. All of these factors question the validity of applying the results of early studies to the modern surgical and oncological setting. A sensitivity analysis excluding studies that commenced accrual before 1996 did not however reveal any effect of study age on the outcome of overall survival (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.28). The lack of benefit from intensive follow-up persisted despite the inclusion of modern studies that used modern surgical techniques for resection of liver metastases, <LINK REF="STD-FACS-2014" TYPE="STUDY">FACS 2014</LINK>, and more sensitive investigations to detect recurrence, such as PET scanning, <LINK REF="STD-Sobhani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sobhani 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>The argument for intensive follow-up has been up to now based on observational data that reports improved survival after hepatic metastasectomy. We did not find an improvement in overall survival with the use of liver imaging (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21).</P>
<P>The identified studies are sufficient to address our objectives; future updates of this review are likely to address those outcomes that we can not yet address in detail, when subsequent publications detail quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-GILDA-1998" TYPE="STUDY">GILDA 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00995202" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00995202</LINK>), costs (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00995202" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00995202</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00199654" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00199654</LINK>), and the effects of the addition of PET scanning into follow-up for these participants (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00199654" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00199654</LINK>; NCT00624260 (reference under <LINK REF="STD-Sobhani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sobhani 2008</LINK>)).</P>
<P>We were unable to obtain data for overall survival for the <LINK REF="STD-Secco-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Secco 2002</LINK> study (despite contacting the authors) because of personnel changes at the institution concerned. The <LINK REF="STD-COLOFOL" TYPE="STUDY">COLOFOL</LINK> study is still ongoing.</P>
<P>The studies included the relevant participant population. The interventions assessed were very inclusive, addressing a variety of "doses" or intensities of follow-up, ranging from no follow-up to intense follow-up, and evaluated multiple investigations including the use of CT and PET scanning.</P>
<P>No study addressed any potential psychological harms, anxiety, or distress that may be associated with follow-up after treatment for colorectal cancer.</P>
<P>The studies included in this review did not well report the potential harms (physical, psychological) and costs of follow-up strategies. Two studies reported harms related to colonoscopy (<LINK REF="STD-Schoemaker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schoemaker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>). The rate of perforation (3/2112 or 0.14%) was consistent with other published series (<LINK REF="REF-Araghizadeh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Araghizadeh 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bowles-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowles 2004</LINK>). None of the study reports included specific details of any harms (mortality or morbidity) resulting from investigation or treatment of recurrences. These outcomes should be available in order to fully assess any net benefit or harm of follow-up.</P>
<P>Some researchers have investigated the psychological effects of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Augestad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Augestad 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kjeldsen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kjeldsen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stiggelbout-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiggelbout 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wattchow-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wattchow 2006</LINK>). These studies have reported mixed effects on quality of life measures, but no study has found a deterioration in quality of life. Some form of follow-up appeared superior to virtually no follow-up in terms of quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Kjeldsen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kjeldsen 1997</LINK>). Different settings for follow-up (GP- versus surgeon-led) did not appear to affect anxiety or depression; both groups had a high and similar level of participant satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-Wattchow-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wattchow 2006</LINK>). Ongoing studies will address the effects of intensifying follow-up on quality of life in this population (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00995202" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00995202</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further research is required into the value that participants place on follow-up after their curative surgery. Any survival benefit (or lack of benefit) of follow-up would have to be considered along with the views of participants so that follow-up programmes are accessible, acceptable, and address all participants' needs and concerns.</P>
<P>Little useful data are available from the studies in this review on the cost-effectiveness of follow-up in this group of patients treated for non-metastatic colorectal cancer. It appears that GP-led follow-up is cheaper than surgeon-led follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Augestad-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Augestad 2013</LINK>); risk-adapted follow-up is cheaper for those with better prognosis disease (<LINK REF="STD-Secco-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Secco 2002</LINK>), and although the cost of intensive follow-up is higher, it makes the cost per resectable recurrence lower (<LINK REF="STD-Rodr_x00ed_guez_x002d_Moranta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rodríguez-Moranta 2006</LINK>). Without a better understanding of which of the specific follow-up interventions is responsible for the improvement in outcomes, it is not possible to even speculate on the potential cost-effectiveness of any one approach. Investigators have previously tried to project the costs of a single intervention such as serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing (<LINK REF="REF-Audisio-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audisio 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moertel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moertel 1993</LINK>), and the reported costs have appeared prohibitively large. In contrast, an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis based on five randomised controlled trials has reported costs of intensive follow-up, which appear acceptable in the setting of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Renehan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renehan 2004</LINK>), although the authors do acknowledge a number of limitations of their study. An ongoing study will address the issue of costs so that the relative cost-effectiveness of follow-up can be viewed from an economic perspective as well as a clinical one (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00995202" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00995202</LINK>).</P>

There was evidence of precision (with &gt; 300 events (457) and optimum information size met). While there was some evidence of non-significant inconsistency (I² = 31%; P = 0.14), we felt the variation in the intensity of follow-up across the studies and the prolonged time period for accrual (which allowed for varied surgical techniques and degrees of surgical aggression) explained this because of clinical heterogeneity between the studies, so we did not downgrade for this.

<P>We found five published systematic reviews relevant to our question.

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Pita_x002d_Fern_x00e1_ndez-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pita-Fernández 2014</LINK> included 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with 4055 participants. Their search was limited to four bibliographic databases (search date: June 2014). They reported that overall survival increased with intensive follow-up (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.86) (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). They included data relating to the <LINK REF="STD-GILDA-1998" TYPE="STUDY">GILDA 1998</LINK> study from an earlier paper with 14 months' median follow-up, published while the trial was still accruing participants (<LINK REF="REF-Grossman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grossman 2004</LINK>).

It appears that the data for overall survival reported for <LINK REF="STD-Secco-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Secco 2002</LINK> may have been derived from the actuarial survival at five years (reported as percentages).

<LINK REF="REF-Augestad-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Augestad 2014</LINK> searched PubMed and reference lists of published studies (no search date given). They reported no quantitative meta-analysis for the five studies they included.

<LINK REF="REF-Baca-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baca 2011</LINK> searched PubMed and reference lists (search date: June 2000 to June 2010).

They included both randomised (n = 5) and non-randomised (n = 11) studies. They concluded that recent literature is inconclusive with respect to the benefit of surveillance for colorectal cancer after curative treatment. The difference in our findings was likely to relate to our more recent search and inclusion of 10 more RCTs.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Renehan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renehan 2002</LINK> included five RCTs and 1342 participants. Their search was systematic (search date: April 2001).

<LI>We have deleted the multiple post hoc subgroup analyses we performed in the earlier version of the review (clinic visits and tests versus no clinic visits and tests, more clinic visits versus fewer clinic visits, more tests versus fewer tests, community versus hospital, liver imaging versus no liver imaging, time to recurrence with intensive follow-up versus time to recurrence with less intensive follow-up).These were included in previous versions of the review, but we now recognise that large numbers of undirected sub-group analyses may lead to spurious explanations of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2016</LINK>). In response to a reviewer suggestion, we included post hoc subgroup analysis of follow-up "dose" and the use of different settings (specialist versus GP- or nurse-led follow-up).</LI>
<LI>We used a random-effects model for meta-analysis based on reviewer input.</LI>
<LI>In response to reviewer input, we performed sensitivity analysis by excluding one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ohlsson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlsson 1995</LINK>), where the intensity of follow-up in the intensive arm was comparable with the intensity of follow-up in the control arm of other studies.</LI>

<P>Quote (page 1128): "Nine patients (3.8 per cent with Stage A s were excluded from the study because our previous reports demonstrated a low rate of recurrences in these cases. Other exclusion criteria were the presence of liver metastases (4 patients), even though these had been removed in apparently radical fashion during surgery on the primary, and the presence of severe illness that precluded intense follow-up or treatment of recurrent disease (10 patients). The remaining 207 patients were enrolled in this study..."</P>
<P>Exclusions: the exclusions were not reported by study arm. It is not clear from the report whether these exclusions occurred before randomisation. This means that the study potentially excluded 37/239 (15%) of those randomised.

<P>Quote: "During the study period, 270 patients were included.

<P>Quote (page 8): "Eighteen patients withdrew from the study (standard, 8; intensive, 10). Three patients from each group were lost to follow-up at intervals ranging from 9 to 54 months because they moved to another state.

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Quote (page 8): "A Data Monitoring Sub-Committee (DMSC) composed of Working Party members not entering patients into the trial was asked to review the data after the first 100 patients had been randomised, which occurred in January 1988, and again after 200 patients had been randomised in February 1993. At this point it was recommended by the Data Monitoring Committee that the trial be stopped since it was very unlikely that any clinically important advantage would be demonstrated for patients undergoing second-look surgery."</P>
<P>Comment: early stopping occurred; this was recommended by the trial monitoring committee, and was unlikely to have introduced bias.</P>
