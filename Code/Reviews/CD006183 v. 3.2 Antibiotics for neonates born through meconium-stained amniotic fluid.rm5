<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>ln about 1 out of every 10 pregnancies, babies are exposed to meconium during delivery. Meconium is the baby's first stool. If the baby passes stool before birth, stool containing amniotic fluid can enter the baby's lungs and may cause breathing difficulty while putting the baby at risk for infection and inflammation in the lungs and body.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Infection/inflammation of the lungs can lead to difficulty breathing, reduced oxygen levels, and pneumonia. Antibiotics have been used to prevent infection in babies exposed to meconium during delivery.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the medical literature for eligible studies through June 2016. We found four studies that compared antibiotics versus placebo for reducing infection among babies born with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Two studies were of good quality, and two studies were missing some details regarding study methods. These four studies included 695 babies, who were given various antibiotics or were placed in the control group (no antibiotics). Researchers evaluated several different antibiotic types and treatment lengths. Overall, we found no differences in rate of infection or death between the two groups. We graded the evidence as low quality owing to a poor quality study design and the small number of included babies.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>We are uncertain as to whether antibiotics have an important effect on infection in babies exposed to meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Our results are imprecise, and more studies are needed to determine the role of antibiotics in this situation.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-30 23:21:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Approximately 1 in 10 pregnancies is affected by meconium passage at delivery, which can result in meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). MAS can cause respiratory complications and, very rarely, death. Antibiotics have been prescribed for neonates exposed to meconium in amniotic fluid, with the intention of preventing infection due to potential bacterial contaminants.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-05-30 23:28:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted this review to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for:</P>
<P>1. prevention of infection, morbidity, and mortality among infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) who are asymptomatic at birth; and</P>
<P>2. prevention of infection, morbidity, and mortality among infants born through MSAF who have signs and symptoms compatible with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-06-03 13:59:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed a literature search using the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to July 2016); Embase (1980 to July 2016); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to July 2016); and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 7) in the Cochrane Library. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles<B>.</B>

</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-06-02 20:20:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared antibiotics administered via any route versus placebo or no treatment for prevention of infection among neonates exposed to MSAF, or who developed MAS. We excluded cohort, case control, and any other non-randomised studies and applied no language restrictions. We included studies of term and preterm infants, and we included studies examining use of any antibacterial antibiotics. We included studies that reported on any outcomes of interest.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-06-03 14:01:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of included trials by reviewing information provided in study reports and obtained by personal communication with study authors. We extracted data on relevant outcomes, estimated effect size, and reported values as risk ratios (RRs), risk differences (RDs), and mean differences (MDs), as appropriate. We conducted subgroup analyses for treatment of MAS and for prophylaxis (asymptomatic neonates exposed to meconium).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-03 14:02:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four randomised controlled studies including a total of 695 participants were eligible for inclusion. Three studies evaluated neonates with MAS, and one study assessed asymptomatic neonates exposed to meconium in amniotic fluid. These studies exhibited varying degrees of methodological rigour: Two studies were at low risk of bias, and two were at unclear risk. We graded evidence derived from these studies as low quality. We downgraded overall evidence owing to the large number of participants lost to follow-up in one trial, the small sample sizes of all trials, and unclear methodological details provided for two trials.</P>
<P>The primary outcome was risk of early- and late-onset neonatal sepsis. Antibiotics did not decrease the risk of sepsis in neonates with a diagnosis of MAS (RR 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 8.96; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; 445 participants, three studies; I = 0%) nor in asymptomatic neonates exposed to meconium in amniotic fluid (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.34; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.04; 250 participants, one study; I = 0%). Results show no significant differences in mortality or duration of stay in hospital between groups given antibiotics and control groups of symptomatic and asymptomatic neonates. One study in asymptomatic neonates reported a significant reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation for the control group compared with the antibiotic group (MD 0.26, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.37; 250 participants, one study; I = 0%).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-06-03 14:03:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Upon review of available evidence, we found no differences in infection rates following antibiotic treatment among neonates born through meconium-stained fluid and those with meconium aspiration syndrome. The overall quality of evidence is low owing to the small number of included studies. Well-controlled studies of adequate power are needed.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-06-03 14:08:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is a problem that is commonly encountered in neonates. Meconium is the viscous green material found in the foetal gastrointestinal tract from approximately the tenth week of gestation. Meconium is composed of a mixture of bile, bile acids, mucus, pancreatic secretions, and cellular debris (<LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 1993</LINK>). Approximately 10% to 15% of pregnancies are complicated by passage of meconium around the time of delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 1993</LINK>). An adverse intrauterine environment that compromises foetal well-being can lead to meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) (<LINK REF="REF-Ahanya-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahanya 2005</LINK>). 'Meconium aspiration syndrome' is defined as respiratory distress with compatible chest roentgenographic findings in an infant born through MSAF whose symptoms cannot be otherwise explained (<LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 1990</LINK>). Despite current interventions such as intubation with tracheal suction, it is estimated that 5% to 12% of infants born through MSAF develop MAS (<LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 2000</LINK>). An estimated 25,000 to 30,000 cases and 1000 deaths related to MAS are reported annually in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Gelfand-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelfand 2004</LINK>). MAS accounts for roughly 2% of all perinatal deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 1998</LINK>). Clinical features of MAS include tachypnoea, retractions, grunting, and/or cyanosis with or without radiological features of aspiration pneumonia. Radiological features of MAS consist of areas of atelectasis and consolidation, along with regions of hyperexpansion. Histologically, researchers have observed a significant inflammatory reaction with a diffuse pulmonary infiltrate of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1996</LINK>). Although initially sterile, meconium can become colonised secondarily by bacteria following rupture of membranes in utero (<LINK REF="REF-Florman-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Florman 1969</LINK>) or during neonatal interventions such as endotracheal intubation.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-06-07 17:24:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotics target bacteria and are prescribed to treat infection or, at times, to prevent infection. Penicillin prevents cross-linking during the formation of peptidoglycan. Normal healthy human cells do not make or need peptidoglycan, a polymer that makes penicillin selective to bacteria. Loss of peptidoglycan makes the bacterial call wall weak, causing it to burst. Antibiotics are among the treatments most frequently used in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (<LINK REF="REF-Warrier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warrier 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-06-02 20:41:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Proposed explanations for widespread use of antibiotics in patients with MAS include difficulty differentiating aspiration pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia radiologically (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2004</LINK>); the possibility of meconium-induced inhibition of phagocytic activity and respiratory burst response by alveolar macrophages, rendering infants with MAS susceptible to pulmonary infection (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2005</LINK>); in vitro enhancement of bacterial growth in the presence of meconium in amniotic fluid (<LINK REF="REF-Florman-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Florman 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lembet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lembet 2003</LINK>); in vivo inflammatory response aggravated by the combination of meconium and bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Speer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speer 1998</LINK>); the likelihood of foetal bacterial infection causing in utero meconium passage (<LINK REF="REF-Blot-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blot 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bortolucci-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bortolucci 1990</LINK>); and apprehension about complications associated with untreated bacterial pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 1992</LINK>). Several study authors have reported increased rates of chorioamnionitis associated with MSAF (<LINK REF="REF-Mazor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rao-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Romero-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Usta-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Usta 1995</LINK>), although it is unclear whether chorioamnionitis is a cause or a secondary effect of meconium passage. In a retrospective study of 215 well term babies born through MSAF (88 of whom required tracheal meconium aspiration at birth), researchers noted no significant differences in the incidence of culture-positive sepsis (1 (1.1%) vs 2 (1.6%); P &gt; 0.05) when comparing 127 control infants not requiring tracheal suctioning of meconium passage (<LINK REF="STD-Krishnan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnan 1995</LINK>). Administration of intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy or cefazolin infusion into the amniotic cavity during amnioinfusion in mothers with MSAF has not been beneficial in reducing neonatal sepsis (<LINK REF="STD-Adair-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Adair 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1999</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-06-02 20:38:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Widespread use of antibiotics in neonates is a matter of some concern (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2004</LINK>). Excessive use of antibiotics in neonatal units can lead to emergence of resistant bacterial strains (<LINK REF="REF-Tom_x002d_Revzon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tom-Revzon 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Fanos-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanos 1999</LINK> reported nephrotoxicity in newborns even after brief periods of antibacterial treatment. <LINK REF="REF-McCracken-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCracken 1986</LINK> observed ototoxicity in neonates following aminoglycoside treatment.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-03 15:18:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinicians have used various antibiotics and antibiotic regimens to treat neonates exposed to meconium during delivery. We identified four randomised controlled trials that enrolled 695 individuals to evaluate effectiveness of antibiotics in reducing infection following meconium exposure or diagnosis of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Upon review of available evidence, we identified no differences in risk of infection (confirmed sepsis) among neonates receiving antibiotics (3/224) and controls (2/221) following MAS diagnosis. Evidence does not allow us to corroborate differences in the incidence of confirmed sepsis among asymptomatic neonates receiving antibiotics. Data show that in symptomatic neonates, antibiotics significantly lowered the duration of oxygen therapy, but in asymptomatic neonates, antibiotics were significantly associated with increased duration of oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and respiratory distress. Given these inconsistent findings and the small numbers of neonates enrolled in these studies, we cannot present conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of antibiotics in preventing infection following meconium exposure.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-06-03 15:18:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All four included trials consistently reported no significant improvement in infection reduction with antibiotic treatment or prophylaxis despite use of different antibiotics and treatment durations. Studies were of mixed quality, included small sample sizes, and differed marginally in types of antibiotics and duration of therapy examined. Differences in antibiotic type and in treatment timelines (three to seven days) created heterogeneity in the intervention arms of included studies.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-06-03 15:19:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All four trials compared antibiotics versus no treatment and did not include a placebo control. The lack of placebo control may have resulted in biased reporting; however, each study objectively defined criteria for sepsis. Limitations of this review include that the methodological quality of some included studies was poor, and that none of these studies included a placebo arm and full blinding of treating clinicians. Types of outcome measures reported showed some inconsistency, with only one trial evaluating the duration of mechanical ventilation, and with various measures of respiratory morbidity used across studies. We downgraded evidence owing to imprecision related to small sample sizes and unclear methodological features in some trials.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-06-03 15:25:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When interpreting the results of this review, one must consider the overall low event rate for sepsis in both intervention and control arms of all four trials. Variation in study design, including the addition of post hoc outcomes, could present a potential source of bias. After searching the literature, the review authors believed that relevant clinical outcomes should be added, but outcomes evaluated post hoc did not influence overall recommendations provided in this review. Although dogma suggests that meconium (comprising mostly water) is sterile, this paradigm is shifting, as several studies have identified bacterial contaminants in meconium samples (<LINK REF="REF-Jim_x00e9_nez-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jimnez 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mshvildadze-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mshvildadze 2010</LINK>). Further investigation into the variable degree of bacterial colonisation observed in meconium and characterisation of organisms as pathogenic or non-pathogenic may allow clinicians to better predict which neonates are at greatest risk for infection.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-06-03 15:22:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High-quality multi-centre placebo-controlled trials should evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of antibiotics used to reduce infection among neonates exposed to meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Such trials should provide long-term follow-up to evaluate neurodevelopmental and adverse effects of antibiotic exposure during the immediate neonatal period. Given the low event rate, this would require multi-centre collaboration. This review highlights variation in antibiotic choices and regimens. An international uniform approach to treatment of neonates exposed to meconium-stained amniotic fluid would address evident heterogeneity among interventions identified in this review.</P>
