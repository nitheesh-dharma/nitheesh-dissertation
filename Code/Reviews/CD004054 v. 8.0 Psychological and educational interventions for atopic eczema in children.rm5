<TITLE>Psychological and educational interventions for atopic eczema in children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-23 03:14:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Atopic eczema is an itchy, inflammatory skin condition, which affects the quality of life of children with eczema and their parents or carers. It affects large and increasing numbers of children worldwide. Psychological and educational approaches have been used to complement medication in managing eczema, for example, by using simple psychological techniques to manage itching and scratching or sleep disturbance. Educational interventions, provided to individuals and groups by nurses or teams of specialists in hospital or community settings, have been used to help parents and children to understand the condition and their role in managing it successfully. However, the effect of these approaches has not been systematically measured.</P>
<P>We included 10 studies in this review: 5 were in the original review, and 5 were newly incorporated in this update.</P>
<P>Nine studies were educational and predominantly parent-focused (total number of participants n = 2003), and the tenth was a child-centred psychological intervention (n = 44).</P>
<P>The main finding of this review is that there is currently only limited research evidence about the effect of educational and psychological approaches when used alongside medicines for the treatment of childhood eczema. Included studies provided a range of interventions, from a single 15-minute consultation to a comprehensive series of sessions delivered to groups of parents over a period of 12 hours. Details of the interventions used and the educational theory base are generally poorly described. Outcome measures varied between studies.</P>
<P>Although it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions from this review, several studies using educational interventions demonstrated improvements in eczema severity and quality of life for both children and families. In particular, two studies showed promise. One large study (n = 992) using a multi-disciplinary group education intervention in a hospital setting showed modest improvements in disease severity and quality of life. The single study using psychological approaches indicated that relaxation methods reduced the severity of eczema when compared to discussion only.</P>
<P>There is a need for further research into this subject, and priority should be given to comparing the relative cost effectiveness of health professionals educating parents either in teams or by nurses alone. There is also a need for comparison with stand-alone self-help. The most appropriate timeframe for evaluating the effect of interventions should be considered.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-12-20 11:45:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Doney">
<P>We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE (from 1946<I>)</I>, EMBASE (from 1974), OpenGrey, and PsycINFO (from 1806). We also searched six trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-12-20 11:47:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three authors independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. A lack of comparable data prevented data synthesis, and we were unable to conduct meta-analysis because there were insufficient data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-23 03:07:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 10 RCTs, of which 5 were new to this update; all interventions were adjuncts to conventional therapy and were delivered in primary- and secondary-care settings. There were 2003 participants in the 9 educational interventions and 44 participants in the 1 psychological study. Some included studies had methodological weaknesses; for example, we judged four studies to have high risk of detection bias, attrition bias, or other bias. Our primary outcomes were participant-rated global assessment, reduction in disease severity (reported as objective SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis)), and improvement in sleep and quality of life. No study reported participant-rated global assessment or improvement of sleep.</P>
<P>The largest and most robust study (n = 992) demonstrated significant reduction in disease severity and improvement in quality of life, in both nurse- and dermatologist-led intervention groups. It provided six standardised, age-appropriate group education sessions. Statistically significant improvements in objective severity using the SCORAD clinical tool were recorded for all intervention groups when compared with controls. Improvements in objective severity (intervention minus no intervention) by age group were as follows: age 3 months to 7 years = 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 6.8; age 8 to 12 years = 6.7, 95% CI 2.1 to 11.2; and age 13 to 18 years = 9.9, 95% CI 4.3 to 15.5. In three of five studies, which could not be combined because of their heterogeneity, the objective SCORAD measure was statistically significantly better in the intervention group compared with the usual care groups. However, in all of the above studies, the confidence interval limits do not exceed the minimum clinically important difference of 8.2 for objective SCORAD.</P>
<P>The largest study measured quality of life using the German 'Quality of life in parents of children with atopic dermatitis' questionnaire, a validated tool with five subscales. Parents of children under seven years had significantly better improvements in the intervention group on all five subscales. Parents of children aged 8 to 12 years experienced significantly better improvements in the intervention group on 3 of the 5 subscales.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-23 03:11:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update has incorporated five new RCTs using educational interventions as an adjunct to conventional treatment for children with atopic eczema. We did not identify any further studies using psychological interventions. The inclusion of new studies has not substantially altered the conclusions from the original review. The educational studies in both the original review and this update lack detail about intervention design and do not use a complex interventions framework. Few use an explicit theoretical base, and the components of each intervention are not sufficiently well described to allow replication. A relative lack of rigorously designed trials provides limited evidence of the effectiveness of educational and psychological interventions in helping to manage the condition of atopic eczema in children. However, there is some evidence from included paediatric studies using different educational intervention delivery models (multiprofessional eczema interventions and nurse-led clinics) that these may lead to improvements in disease severity and quality of life. Educational and psychological interventions require further development using a complex interventions framework. Comparative evaluation is needed to examine their impact on eczema severity, quality of life, psychological distress, and cost-effectiveness. There is also a need for comparison of educational interventions with stand-alone psychosocial self-help.  </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition, clinical features, and epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Atopic eczema (or atopic dermatitis) is an itchy, inflammatory skin disease, often involving skin creases (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2005</LINK>). The condition may be acute with redness, scaling, oozing, and vesicles, or it may be chronic with associated skin thickening, altered pigmentation, and exaggerated surface markings. Itching is a major symptom that can develop into a cycle of scratching, causing skin damage and in turn more itching (the itch-scratch cycle). Atopic eczema is now the most common inflammatory skin disease of childhood, affecting large and increasing numbers of children worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Asher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asher 2006</LINK>). Whilst the number of adults with atopic eczema is smaller (1% to 2%), their disease is frequently more chronic and severe (<LINK REF="REF-Herd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herd 1996</LINK>). Approximately 70% of cases start in children under the age of 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Hanifin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanifin 2007</LINK>). Evidence suggests that the prevalence of atopic eczema has increased two- to threefold over the last 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Schram-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schram 2010</LINK>). The reasons for this are not entirely clear but are likely to be environmental, as significant differences in prevalence between populations of the same ethnic background have frequently been found, for instance between urban and rural areas (<LINK REF="REF-Schram-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schram 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>Nevertheless, genetic factors are important in the development of eczema, as has been repeatedly shown in association with carriage of filaggrin (FLG) loss-of-function mutations (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>); FLG is a gene that has a pivotal role in skin barrier function. Filaggrin forms part of the cornified cell envelope (the 'mortar' of the 'brick-and mortar' structure of the epidermis). Reduced expression or complete lack of FLG therefore leads to an impaired skin barrier. Approximately 40% of children with moderate to severe eczema carry at least one FLG mutation, which predisposes to early onset eczema, disease severity, and chronicity. However, as a significant proportion of children with eczema do not carry a FLG mutation, other genetic factors are likely to play a role, too (<LINK REF="REF-Paternoster-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paternoster 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The current hypothesis is that where people carry a skin barrier gene mutation, such as a loss-of-function mutation in the filaggrin gene, the skin barrier is impaired, leading to an increase in transepidermal water loss (water loss across the superficial skin) and therefore skin dryness (<LINK REF="REF-Flohr-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flohr 2010</LINK>). Probably in interaction with environmental factors, such as water hardness and frequent use of protease-containing detergents and soaps, the integrity of the skin barrier is gradually broken down further, and this may lead to the typical immunological changes seen in eczematous skin (<LINK REF="REF-Cork-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cork 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNally-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNally 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherriff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherriff 2002</LINK>). Animal work suggests that environmental allergens, such as house dust mites, but also food protein, can make contact with the immune system via antigen-presenting cells in the superficial epidermis, leading to sensitisation. This can make existing eczema worse and may also be an important precursor of food and respiratory allergies (<LINK REF="REF-Fallon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fallon 2009</LINK>). This would explain why FLG mutations are only associated with asthma in the presence of eczema or allergic sensitisation (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Oord-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Oord 2009</LINK>). However, prospective studies are required to examine the exact sequence of events.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>Measurement of the impact of skin disease on quality of life and emotional well-being is important for our understanding and management of skin conditions as psychosocial factors play an important role in the itch-scratch cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Verhoeven-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhoeven 2008</LINK>). Several studies suggest that atopic eczema has a greater detrimental impact on quality of life than other skin diseases, such as acne and psoriasis (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis_x002d_Jones-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis-Jones 1995</LINK>); therefore, it is desirable to measure the impact on quality of life as a potential outcome of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis_x002d_Jones-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis-Jones 1995</LINK>). It is notable that whilst detrimental impact on quality of life is common, non-adherence to treatment regimens continues to be problematic, with parents reporting dissatisfaction with the 'trial and error' approach to treatment often experienced in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Santer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santer 2012</LINK>). The relationship between the severity of atopic eczema in children and adolescents and quality of life has been established (<LINK REF="REF-Ben_x002d_Gashir-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ben-Gashir 2004</LINK>). Problematic symptoms, such as itching, can adversely affect quality of life. Itch leads to scratching, which may have a significant detrimental impact on a child's sleep, quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis_x002d_Jones-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis-Jones 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1997</LINK>), and family life (<LINK REF="REF-Elliott-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1991</LINK>). Because of the various impacts of atopic eczema, it is necessary to measure changes in disease severity as a key outcome measure. Also, since caregivers, especially parents, are often required to assist with treatments, their ability and confidence are relevant outcomes to measure. Given that children and adolescents with atopic eczema require special clothing, bedding, frequent applications of greasy ointments, and may need to avoid activities such as swimming (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 1995</LINK>), treatment adherence becomes a relevant outcome to measure. There is also a substantial economic cost to the family (<LINK REF="REF-Kemp-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemp 2003</LINK>) and the health service (<LINK REF="REF-Verboom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verboom 2002</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-23 03:30:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Educational and psychological interventions, where available, are invariably provided in conjunction with conventional therapy. Such interventions may be directed towards the parent or child, with parents tending to be the primary focus of the educational approaches and children the main target of psychological interventions. A child's ability to participate effectively in an educational or psychological intervention will depend on the suitability of the activity for their age and developmental stage. Educational interventions are often used in supporting people with long-term conditions to optimise care. A recent example of this in the dermatology field is the Eczema Education Programme. This is one of the largest parental eczema education programmes in Europe and has been subject to extensive evaluation in a non-controlled trial (<LINK REF="REF-Ersser-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ersser 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2013</LINK>). An example of a psychological (primarily behavioural) intervention is habit reversal, identified as a method of eliminating nervous habits and tics, whereby an alternative or competing behaviour is adopted in place of the undesirable behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Miltenberger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miltenberger 1998</LINK>). Other types of psychological intervention might include cognitive behavioural therapy, counselling, and arousal reduction techniques, such as relaxation and mindfulness.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">a) Psychological interventions</HEADING>
<P>The main types of psychological intervention available are summarised briefly below. All of these approaches can be delivered either in an individual or group format, although more in-depth psychological therapy tends to be provided on a one-to-one basis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Psychological techniques using arousal reduction techniques</HEADING>
<P>These are essentially all very similar relaxation techniques, which may include the following.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Progressive relaxation: a technique that relies on tensing different muscles in the body and then releasing that tension. This enables an individual to recognise areas of tension and to consciously learn to release that tension.</LI>
<LI>Autogenic training: a systematic form of relaxation involving increasing awareness of the body.</LI>
<LI>Guided imagery or 'visualisation': learning to use imagery associated with relaxation or calmness and attempting to induce the related feeling in one's own body.</LI>
<LI>Biofeedback: here a person learns how to recognise and manage physiological responses through feedback usually facilitated by the use of instrumentation.</LI>
<LI>Hypnotherapy: involves creating a state whereby an individual is suggestible. It is often used to create a feeling of relaxation and is consequently included here.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Behavioural interventions</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Behaviour therapy involves the application of behavioural theory to modify behaviours.</LI>
<LI>Habit reversal is a form of behavioural intervention used to modify unhelpful scratching.</LI>
<LI>Other forms of behavioural intervention may include caregiver training programmes whereby carers are trained in the use of contingency management systems (for example, through the systematic use of charts to record and reward progress).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Psychological therapies focused on internal processes</HEADING>
<P>There are a number of therapies that might broadly be referred to as 'talking therapies', and these are generally associated with raising insight and may or may not involve the use of specific techniques to change internal psychological processes, external behaviour, and coping styles.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cognitive behavioural therapy takes a biopsychosocial perspective that involves the promotion of an empiricist approach, i.e. assisting an individual in understanding the links between their thoughts, thinking processes, and behaviours. As well as drawing on cognitive theories, it also draws on behavioural theories and techniques. It is problem-focused and may use a range of techniques to raise awareness of - and so to change specific thoughts - cognitive processes, feelings, or behaviour and to enhance coping strategies.</LI>
<LI>Counselling: usually non-directive, non-judgemental, empathetic, and supportive approaches, which enable an individual to cope more effectively with their problems or inner states.</LI>
<LI>Family therapy: views the family, rather than the individual member, as the unit requiring assistance. Types of family therapy all involve encouraging family members to talk to one another, examining inflexibilities, family rules and beliefs, focusing on relationships within the family and those between the family and external agencies, e.g. health, education, occupation, and social services.</LI>
<LI>Psychodynamic approaches place emphasis on unconscious motives and drives. The aim of the therapy is the recognition of unhelpful defences and the linkage of these to underlying conflicts. This may include focusing on the past and making use of the relationship between the patient and the therapist to understand the origin and maintenance of distress.</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">b) Educational Interventions</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2002</LINK> defines educational interventions as, 'any intervention targeted at children (or their caregivers) designed to teach one or more management strategies related to prevention, management, or the use of social skills'. We included these interventions, which can use 'any instructional strategy or combination of strategies (problem solving, role-playing, videotapes, computer-assisted instruction, booklets, etc) and be presented either individually or in group sessions' (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2002</LINK>), in this review.</P>
<P>Dermatological educational and psychological behaviour-change techniques may be combined to support secondary prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Gieler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gieler 2000</LINK>). Educational interventions are focused on the process of acquiring new knowledge or skills through teaching and learning activities. An approach where information-giving and formal teaching leads the recipients to become more accurately informed about their condition means they are better prepared to understand the need for medical interventions and effective disease management. The content of educational interventions may include information on the disease, treatment instructions, management, and prevention strategies, and may be delivered in hospital or community settings. There is growing awareness that education, in the form of imparting knowledge alone, will not lead to improved outcome. In recent years, there has been increased use of self-efficacy-based interventions that build knowledge, skills, and confidence (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1997</LINK>) to enable people to self-manage long-term conditions as effectively as possible (<LINK REF="REF-Ersser-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ersser 2011</LINK>). Motivation and intention to change are important factors in educational interventions, and it is well recognised that intention to change does not necessarily lead to health behaviour change (<LINK REF="REF-Webb-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webb 2006</LINK>). Therefore, it is important to plan some follow up from such interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-23 03:32:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Educational interventions have been used in the management of long-term conditions in adults with positive outcomes. However, it is evident that interventions based solely on education are unlikely to bring about health behaviour change. Whilst the 'active ingredients' of successful interventions remain unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Coster-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coster 2009</LINK>), they are likely to include the participant's motivation; shared decision-making; development of problem-solving skills; goal setting and agreeing action plans (<LINK REF="REF-Coulter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulter 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Health-Foundation-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Foundation 2011</LINK>); and ensuring that people have sufficient knowledge, skills, and confidence to self-manage as effectively as possible (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1997</LINK>). A range of theories can be applied to the development of educational interventions in health care. Of particular importance is the relationship between intention and actual behaviour change. The theory of planned behaviour, the theory of reasoned action, and self-regulation theory have been successfully integrated into interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Webb-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webb 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many existing educational programmes for long-term conditions are based on Social Learning Theory (SLT) (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1997</LINK>). A core concept of SLT is self-efficacy, that is, the belief that a person has that they are able to successfully initiate and complete actions needed to achieve a specific outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Ersser-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ersser 2011</LINK>). To be able to self-manage as effectively as possible, people need to have sufficient knowledge, skills, and confidence; attributes that can be developed through the application of self-efficacy theory-based educational interventions. This approach has been applied with promising results in adult psoriasis (<LINK REF="REF-Ersser-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ersser 2011</LINK>). In childhood eczema, any such intervention would primarily be aimed at the parent or carer.</P>
<P>Techniques such as habit reversal work on the premise that scratching has become unconscious and generalised beyond the experience of itch. It therefore aims to bring into conscious awareness the repetitive scratching by use of a recording technique, which may in itself reduce the urge to scratch. In addition, habit reversal teaches how to use alternative less damaging behaviours where the itch persists. Some of the other simple psychological techniques, such as relaxation, may simply work by reducing arousal and stress that may heighten the perception of itch. More complex psychological interventions may be necessary where there are secondary gains or unhelpful coping responses contributing to the presentation.</P>
<P>All the educational and psychological interventions reviewed have been used as adjuncts to conventional eczema treatments, including topical and systemic therapies.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-12-20 13:47:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Since atopic eczema affects significant numbers of children and can be disabling for whole families, psychological support and education of the parent or carer are essential components of disease management. Little is known however of the measurable effects of such interventions. In the original version of this review, <LINK REF="REF-Ersser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ersser 2007</LINK> found only limited evidence to support psychological or educational interventions. However, management strategies to reduce scratching behaviours that exacerbate eczema are incorporating psychological interventions, and treatment guidelines are beginning to recommend them (<LINK REF="REF-Giannini-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giannini 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ring-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ring 2012</LINK>). Despite the fact that parents are the primary carers for children with atopic eczema, very limited attention has been given to the psychological support of parents (by educational or psychological intervention). As such, the caregiver's ability to manage their child's eczema is an important outcome; therefore, the educational or psychological support given to parents is relevant to this review. However, it is recognised that psychological support to both caregiver and child are important. The general case for psychosocial interventions to improve clinical outcomes in organic disease is established (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2002</LINK>) and also in related areas, such as asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Guevara-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guevara 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The literature refers to a range of psychological interventions that have been used in atopic eczema, such as behavioural management (<LINK REF="REF-Bridgett-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridgett 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bridgett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridgett 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nor_x00e9_n-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norén 1989</LINK>), relaxation therapy (<LINK REF="REF-de-L-Horne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">de L Horne 1999</LINK>), and cognitive behavioural therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Ehlers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehlers 1995</LINK>). Clinical observations suggest that behavioural techniques can be a useful adjunct to topical therapy, and breaking the itch-scratch cycle is argued to be a primary clinical aim (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00e4_germark-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hägermark 1995</LINK>). However, evaluative research has been limited (<LINK REF="REF-Bridgett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridgett 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ersser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ersser 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson_x002d_Dent-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson-Dent 1999</LINK>), especially with children.</P>
<P>Educational interventions have also been used to bring about behavioural change through patient education or patient teaching for those with eczema (<LINK REF="STD-Niebel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Niebel 2000</LINK>). These educational interventions are important since chronic disease management requires a degree of self management (or caregiver or parental support) and therefore educational and behavioural change (<LINK REF="REF-Holman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holman 2000</LINK>). A limited number of evaluative studies have examined the impact of parental education on the management of atopic eczema in children.</P>

<P>Outcome measures for eczema interventions have recently been addressed by the HOME (Harmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema) initiative, following a Delphi exercise. The core outcomes that all eczema-related RCTs should report on are as follows: clinical signs, symptoms, long-term control of flares, and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitt 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The following outcomes, influenced by the HOME work, were of interest to us as measured by participant, carer, clinician, or other trial outcome observer, or any combination. Specifically, we were concerned with a clinically significant response in the following outcomes.</P>

<LI>Reduction in disease severity as measured by a trained assessor (Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) is 8.7 points for the SCORAD, 8.2 for the objective SCORAD, 6.6 for the EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index), and 3.4 for the POEM (Patient Orientated Eczema Measure)) (<LINK REF="REF-Schram-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schram 2012</LINK>).</LI>

<P>We addressed the following four areas since there is reported evidence that these are associated with biased estimates of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>):<BR/>a) randomisation (method of generation and concealment of allocation);<BR/>b) blinding of observers (blinding of participants was not possible because of the nature of the intervention);<BR/>c) loss to follow up (presence of dropouts and withdrawals and the analysis of these); and<BR/>d) other bias.</P>
<P>The quality assessment included an evaluation of the following components for each included study. Each component was categorised as low risk, unclear risk, or high risk on the data extraction form as advised by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Criteria for judgement of adequacy are as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Randomisation: Adequate studies used a randomised sequence from a computer-generated procedure or shuffled envelopes. Unclear studies provided insufficient information, and we excluded those employing alternations.</LI>
<LI>Concealment of allocation sequences: In adequate studies, the assignment could not be foreseen (allocation concealment). Low risk included techniques such as the use of a third party or use of opaque sealed envelopes. High-risk techniques included those such as having an open list or in accordance with days of the week.</LI>
<LI>Blinding: In adequate studies, this took place after allocation assignment and ensured the outcome assessor, participants, and clinicians were unaware of any allocation sequence. In our case, determining adequacy did not relate to all three areas of blinding as this was not practical for our included studies. We addressed this issue in the methodological quality assessment section.</LI>
<LI>Loss to follow up: when more than 80% of participants were followed up and then were analysed in the groups to which they were originally randomised (intention-to-treat). We also included as low risk those studies in which intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was undertaken but with minimal missing outcome data. We specified inadequate loss to follow up when there was no ITT analysis or substantial missing data, as well as less than 80% follow up.</LI>

<P>If data synthesis were possible, we planned to calculate a weighted treatment effect across trials using a random-effects model. For dichotomous outcomes, our planned treatment effect measure was the odds ratio, and for continuous data, our planned treatment effect measure was the weighted mean difference.

The study by Kupfer was based on data from <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK> that had already been included in the original review, so we added it as a subsidiary reference to <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK>. It is important to mention that all studies used conventional topical treatments in combination with either educational or psychological interventions. It was unlikely that we would find a study whereby psychological or educational interventions were assessed in isolation from conventional therapy; this was evident throughout the review.</P>

The other examined psychological or complementary intervention techniques (hypnotherapy and biofeedback) to improve the quality of life of children with atopic eczema (<LINK REF="STD-Sokel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sokel 1993</LINK>). The nine RCTs focusing on parental education used a variety of intervention formats. Parents of children with atopic eczema were given multiple training sessions in five of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Niebel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Niebel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuttelaar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schuttelaar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2008</LINK>), but only one training session in the other four (<LINK REF="STD-Chinn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chinn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grillo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grillo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2008</LINK>).

The delivery of the educational interventions varied in relation to their timing and duration of the various elements of delivery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The main outcome data from the included studies used across more than one study was that of severity, for which different measures were used. SCORAD was used in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Grillo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grillo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niebel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Niebel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuttelaar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schuttelaar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2002</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK>. Despite this, the difference in intervention delivery (whether nurse-led or multi-disciplinary-led) and the form in which the data were available for each study meant the scope for synthesis was limited. It was thought that little additional information would be gained by drawing together the data from the <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK> studies. Two within-study comparisons were theoretically possible for two of the included studies having two or more intervention groups. One compared different methods of relaxation-biofeedback and hypnotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Sokel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sokel 1993</LINK>), and the other compared different types of educational delivery: direct and video-mediated (<LINK REF="STD-Niebel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Niebel 2000</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Sokel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sokel 1993</LINK> study used a newly developed, but unvalidated, severity measure in the comparison of the different intervention groups for three parameters of disease severity; this preceded the availability of SCORAD.</P>
<P>Several studies employed quality of life measures, predominately the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) +/- the Infant Dermatitis Quality of Life Index (IDQOL) (<LINK REF="STD-Chinn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chinn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grillo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grillo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuttelaar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schuttelaar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2008</LINK>), and <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK> used a generic quality of life instrument. Again, differences in intervention delivery and the form in which the data were available for each study meant the scope for synthesis was limited.</P>
<P>None of the included studies addressed the following of our prespecified outcomes: participant global assessment; improvement of sleep as a separate measure, although there is an item within the SCORAD severity measure embracing sleep impact; reduction of medication usage; and enhancement of caregiver ability to manage atopic eczema in the child.</P>
<P>The included studies did not report adverse effects.</P>

<LI>Of the six excluded studies, three involved adults: <LINK REF="STD-Bae-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bae 2012</LINK> indicated in the abstract both child and adult involvement; however, the mean age was 23.5; the youngest participant was 12; and all data were presented collectively.

<LI>Two RCTs designed to educate the parents of children with atopic eczema (<LINK REF="STD-Broberg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Broberg 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kardorff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kardorff 2003</LINK>) had originally been deemed suitable for inclusion. In one paper (<LINK REF="STD-Broberg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Broberg 1990</LINK>), missing data were derived from data figures and graphs, but after subsequent enquiry with the author, we excluded the paper because of inadequate randomisation. Translation of the <LINK REF="STD-Kardorff-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kardorff 2003</LINK> paper and further correspondence with the author also provided evidence to exclude this RCT since adequate randomisation of the participants had not occurred (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1999</LINK>). In each case, alternation was used; the participants were alternately allocated to the two study groups in order of their attendance at clinic: one into the control group, then experimental, then control, and so on. This is despite Broberg stating in the abstract that the participants were 'randomly assigned' and were 'divided into two random groups'; subsequent evidence demonstrated that this claim was inaccurate.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Randomisation</HEADING>
<P>According to the published papers, all 10 of the included studies randomly allocated the participants to either control or experimental groups. Six studies used computer software to generate random sequences (<LINK REF="STD-Chinn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chinn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grillo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grillo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuttelaar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schuttelaar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK>), so we judged these as at low risk of bias.

<P>Although data were available of a similar generic type (e.g. severity, quality of life data), there were insufficient comparative data on the specific measures used (e.g. severity data from the use of SCORAD). Consequently, we did not undertake the planned assessments of heterogeneity and the subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

<P>Follow-up data on objective SCORAD were available from <LINK REF="STD-Grillo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grillo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuttelaar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schuttelaar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2008</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK>, either directly from the paper or by contact with the authors, and are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. In the interpretation of the forest plot, it should be borne in mind that follow-up time for the presented results varied from 1 month (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>) up to 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Schuttelaar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schuttelaar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK>). The nature of the interventions also varied, as described below.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Grillo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grillo 2006</LINK> evaluated an intensive parental and child education programme, taking the form of a two-hour workshop. As illustrated in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, scores at follow-up were significantly better in the intervention group, with a mean difference of -16.7. Additionally, the analyses presented in the paper that take into account baseline data demonstrate statistically significant improvements (P &lt; 0.005) in the intervention group relative to the control group at both 1 month and 3 months. However, as a cautionary caveat, the lower 95% confidence limit for the group difference is 6.35, which is less than the minimum clinically important difference of 8.2 for objective SCORAD.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK> evaluated the effect of a nurse-led eczema workshop as their intervention in comparison to usual care at a dermatologist-led clinic. Severity of atopic eczema, measured by the SCORAD, was the primary study outcome. <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> illustrates that the difference in objective SCORAD at follow-up was statistically significant and in favour of the intervention. Once again, the 95% confidence interval does not exclude the minimum clinically important difference of 8.2.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schuttelaar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schuttelaar 2010</LINK> evaluated nurse practitioner care as their intervention in comparison to usual care with a dermatologist as the control. It was hypothesised that nurse practitioner care would be beneficial because the consultation time was greater and the care was more structured. <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> illustrates that the mean group difference of -3.1 on the objective SCORAD at 12-month follow up was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2008</LINK> evaluated an intervention comprising a parental and child education programme involving an individual session at the initial study visit and further availability for advice throughout the study from a specialist atopic dermatitis educator. <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> shows that the mean group difference of 1.37 on objective SCORAD at follow-up was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK> also evaluated an intervention comprising an educational programme, involving group training at six sessions once a week for two hours from a multiprofessional team. For younger children (3 months to 7 years), the intervention was directed at parents; for the intermediate age range (8 to 12 years), the intervention was directed at both parents and children; and for older children (13 to 18 years), the intervention was directed at the children themselves. <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> illustrates the effect of the intervention combined over all the age groups on objective SCORAD at 12-month follow up.

However, both the confidence interval limits of 2.46 and 6.14 are less than the minimum clinically important difference of 8.2 for objective SCORAD.</P>
<P>As the study was a large and robust study, we have also reported the effects for objective SCORAD broken down by age that were presented in the paper. We obtained these by comparing the 12-month follow-up data controlling for baseline measurements by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Sokel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sokel 1993</LINK>, the dermatologist assessed severity with 'a scoring sheet showing the front and back of the body divided into 20 zones of approximately equal area'. A score of 0 to 3 was given for each zone in respect of erythema (redness), surface damage, and lichenification (thickening); the total maximum score being 60.</P>
<P>There are two sets of results:</P>
<OL>
<LI>percentage body coverage (area); and</LI>
<LI>mean severity score.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We summarised the latter in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>For body coverage, the paper states a key result as 'no significant difference in the percentage body area covered for either erythema, lichenification or surface damage'. Children in the combined hypnotherapy and biofeedback groups showed a statistically significant difference in the severity of surface damage and lichenification compared to the control group at visit 3 (20 weeks) (P = 0.04 and P = 0.02, respectively). We found no significant differences in erythema. Recalculated P values are marginally different to those reported in the paper; however, this is unlikely to be clinically significant (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Niebel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Niebel 2000</LINK> evaluated the effects of two interventions: direct parent education and video education of parents compared to dermatological standard treatment as the control. They used the <LINK REF="REF-Hanifin-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanifin 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rajka-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajka 1989</LINK>, and SCORAD (summary scores only) methods to evaluate severity, measured pre-intervention and at follow-up after four months, and we summarised their results in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. When controlling for pre-intervention measures by analysis of covariance, there were statistically significant improvements in the direct parent education and video education groups relative to the control group on all severity criteria except pruritus measured by the <LINK REF="REF-Rajka-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajka 1989</LINK> method.</P>
<P>For the <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2002</LINK> study, the difference between the severity score (SCORAD) for each study group was not significant (P = 0.43); limited statistical details are given, with only the mean decrease in score per group being specified other than the P value. Because of the weaknesses in results reporting, we have not tabulated the results.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2008</LINK> study measured body surface area with eczema at baseline but not at follow-up. Pruritus intensity and its effect on the child's mood and feeding was measured using a McGill pain questionnaire adapted by <LINK REF="REF-Yosipovitch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yosipovitch 2002</LINK>. At follow-up during the 24-month period (precise time of follow-up not reported), references to itch by participants from the intervention group reduced from daily to weekly (P = 0.023).

<P>In the assessment of a single nurse consultation on quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Chinn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chinn 2002</LINK>), the parent participants completed the CDLQI, the IDQOL, and the FDI. We summarised the results in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. No significant differences between control and intervention groups were found between baseline and follow-up at 4 and 12 weeks on the CDQOL and IDQOL measures (P &gt; 0.05). However, the group difference for the change in FDI score at 4 weeks was of borderline significance (P = 0.06) in favour of the intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Chinn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chinn 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Staab-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2002</LINK> used the generic 'Daily life' measure to measure quality of life experienced by the mothers of children with eczema; it was stated that there was 'significant improvement in the psychic and somatic well-being, daily life, joy of life and satisfaction with medical treatment sub-scales', although no data are given, nor are the 'P' values reported. The validated disease-specific quality of life questionnaire showed an improvement in the intervention group regarding a subsection of the questionnaire relating to confidence in the medical treatment group compared to the control group (P = 0.016).</P>
<P>The multicentred study by <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK> also used a validated parental quality of life (of children aged less then 13 years) as a key outcome measure. They used a 26-item German tool 'Quality of life of parents of children with atopic dermatitis' (<LINK REF="REF-Von-Rueden-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Rueden 1999</LINK>), which has five subscales:</P>
<OL>
<LI>psychosomatic well-being;</LI>
<LI>effects on social life;</LI>
<LI>confidence in medical treatment;</LI>
<LI>emotional coping; and</LI>
<LI>disease acceptance.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Summary results for the primary outcomes reflect the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of parental quality of life at baseline and 12 months, comparing intervention minus no intervention, with adjustment for baseline scores. We gave details of the intervention minus no intervention estimates and 95% confidence intervals in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. Parents of children with eczema aged under seven years had significantly better improvements in the intervention group on all five quality of life subscales. Parents of children aged 8 to 12 years experienced significantly better improvements in the intervention group on 3 of the 5 subscales; the changes in psychosomatic well-being and effects on social life were not statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Grillo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grillo 2006</LINK> used three extensively validated measures of quality of life: IDQOL for children aged &lt; 4 years, CDLQI for children aged 4 to 16 years, and the Dermatology Family Impact (DFI) questionnaire. We summarised the results in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. There was no statistically significant difference between groups at either week 4 or week 12 for the IDQOL and the DFI. For the CDLQI, the group difference at week 4 was not statistically significant, but at week 12 it was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Weber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2008</LINK> used the CDLQI and DFI to evaluate the impact of attending a series of educational support groups. There was no significant difference in CDLQI between groups at baseline (P = 0.86). The intervention group showed a significant improvement relative to the control group at follow-up (P &lt; 0.01). Specifically, there was evidence of improvement in the quality of life, i.e. leisure (P = 0.04) and personal relationship (P = 0.02) domains in the intervention group relative to the control group. There were no group differences in the DFI scores following the intervention.</P>

<P>The data for this review were limited, comprising 10 studies.

The <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2008</LINK> study used a senior medical student for intervention delivery, and it is unclear who delivered the intervention in the <LINK REF="STD-Grillo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grillo 2006</LINK> study. Only one study of psychological interventions met the inclusion criteria; this had two relaxation intervention groups: biofeedback and hypnotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Sokel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sokel 1993</LINK>). All interventions were provided as an adjunct to conventional topical therapy. Only a limited range of the psychological interventions available were employed. The included studies addressed two of our primary outcome measures: reduction in disease severity and quality of life, but they did not address the other two: participant-rated global assessment and improvement in sleep. The included studies addressed only one of our secondary measures: improvement in treatment adherence. It was surprising not to find the use of sleep improvement as an outcome measure, given the reporting in the literature of sleep disruption as a significant consequence of childhood atopic eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 2000</LINK>). We could not synthesise data from these studies because of the following factors: the heterogeneous nature of the outcome measures used, a lack of adequate data (both in quality and accessibility), and methodological weaknesses in study design. The evidence available to date is therefore derived from individual studies.</P>
<P>For parental educational interventions, four studies reported statistically significant improvements in clinical severity in the intervention groups compared to the control (<LINK REF="STD-Grillo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grillo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niebel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Niebel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Schuttelaar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schuttelaar 2010</LINK> study reported significant improvements in SCORAD, in both control (dermatologist) and intervention (nurse) groups. However, quality of reporting was variable, with <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK> providing limited information, and <LINK REF="STD-Niebel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Niebel 2000</LINK> omitting SCORAD data for the parental education group. The difference in SCORAD found between comparison groups was not significant in the <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2002</LINK> study. One multicentre study found significant impact on SCORAD (<LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK>). However, we support <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2006</LINK> observation that it remains unclear whether the degree of the final differences observed between groups could be accounted for by the differential use of appropriate treatments (individual therapy remained the responsibility of the participants' doctors). The quality of reporting of SCORAD scores varied in the included studies.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK> study found statistically significant improvements in parental quality of life in all 5 subscales for their affected child within the '7 years and under' age group and in 3 of these subscales for the '8 to 12 years' age group.</P>
<P>We found no differences in quality of life outcomes at 4 and 12 weeks in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Chinn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chinn 2002</LINK>. One multicentre study found significant impact on SCORAD (<LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The single psychological study (<LINK REF="STD-Sokel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sokel 1993</LINK>) identified significant differences in two of three elements of the multi-dimensional clinical severity score (surface damage and lichenification) between the intervention groups (biofeedback and hypnotherapy) and the control group (discussion only) (<LINK REF="STD-Sokel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sokel 1993</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-23 04:34:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>We identified no studies that could not be subsequently located. A small number of studies met the inclusion criteria, employing a limited range of the potential psychological and educational interventions available. These included educational interventions: parental (and child), education (nurse- or multi-disciplinary-led), nurse-led individually, or with groups of participants. They also included the use of technology to support education (video or not), relaxation-based psychological interventions, or complementary interventions (hypnotherapy and biofeedback). Although we identified a number of relevant studies in terms of the type of intervention, design, and disease outcome measures used, because the population was made up of adults, we therefore recorded them as excluded studies, albeit ones of clinical and methodological relevance.</P>

<P>Although the majority of these studies used validated outcome measures, exceptions included <LINK REF="STD-Sokel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sokel 1993</LINK>, which used a non-validated severity measure, and <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2002</LINK>, which used an untitled disease-specific parental quality of life measure and the Trier Scales of Coping (<LINK REF="STD-Staab-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2002</LINK>), which are used widely in German studies. <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK> reported simply asking participants about changes in treatment adherence.</P>
<P>Furthermore, although most of the included studies focused on parental education, there were few parentally-focused outcomes, other than the use of a parental or a family quality of life measure in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Grillo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grillo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuttelaar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schuttelaar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2008</LINK>). It may also be speculated that the clinical outcomes used to measure the impact of the parentally directed interventions (that directly related to the child, e.g. clinical severity) may not have been a sufficiently sensitive measure of effectiveness. The issue of studies being underpowered is highlighted in the <LINK REF="STD-Chinn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chinn 2002</LINK> study; the estimation of sample size was unable to detect a significant change in primary care participants. There were reporting problems with some of the individual studies, with key quantitative results not being reported. For example, the <LINK REF="STD-Niebel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Niebel 2000</LINK> study did not present SCORAD summary scores for the parental education group.</P>
<P>Educational interventions are by their nature complex and, as such, may interact in a complex way with the organisation of health services, which are influenced by socioeconomic and cultural factors. By way of illustration, variations may exist in the availability of specialist dermatology care and the staff to deliver these. Furthermore, the education and scope of practice of health professionals and the distribution and delivery of services across primary and secondary care vary within and between countries. In addition, educational and psychological interventions represent a highly heterogeneous grouping of interventions due to the wide range of methods employed and ways of utilising and delivering them. The range of psychological interventions that could be potentially employed is high, each with different theoretical underpinnings. This is reflected in the intervention summary earlier in the review. Interestingly, no included studies used 'theoretically based' interventions drawing on, for example, behavioural modification or self-efficacy theory.</P>
<P>The capacity of an outcome measure to detect a clinically significant change in a person remains unclear for the primary outcome measures used in the included studies. The most renowned severity measure of atopic eczema is SCORAD. This measure has been validated several times on the basis of establishing good inter-rater judgements and recognising the need for prior training (<LINK REF="REF-Kunz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pucci-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pucci 2005</LINK>), but it has yet to be assessed against global measures so that it can be correlated with a participant-perceived measure of change. A systematic review of named outcome measures for atopic eczema found that SCORAD, POEM (Patient Orientated Eczema Measure), and EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) were the only adequately validated scores (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitt 2007</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adult and child studies compared</HEADING>
<P>A search of the literature on educational and psychological interventions for adults with eczema using the databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2000 to 2013 revealed relatively few studies in this area. However, it is useful to briefly compare child studies to relevant adult studies because of methodological insights that may be gained from their discussion and comparison. This may help others when planning future robust studies in children. Nine of the included paediatric studies focused on educational interventions, involving either nurse-led or multi-disciplinary interventions, directed either at individual parents or groups and located in out-patient or primary care practices as described (<LINK REF="STD-Chinn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chinn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grillo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Grillo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niebel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Niebel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuttelaar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schuttelaar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaw-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shaw 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four key adult educational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coenraads-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coenraads 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gradwell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gradwell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jaspers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaspers 2000</LINK>) involved individual contact (<LINK REF="REF-Gradwell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gradwell 2002</LINK>), group education (<LINK REF="REF-Coenraads-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coenraads 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jaspers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaspers 2000</LINK>), and the use of online video-based education versus the provision of an educational pamphlet (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2011</LINK>). Two studies highlighted improvements in clinical severity and improved self-care ability (<LINK REF="REF-Coenraads-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coenraads 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jaspers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaspers 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2011</LINK> demonstrated that knowledge of eczema and disease severity were both significantly improved in the video group when compared with the pamphlet group. There was also further evidence of a reduced need for consultations (<LINK REF="REF-Jaspers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaspers 2000</LINK>). Standardised outcome measures used included the use of severity measures similar to those used in child studies, such as SCORAD (<LINK REF="REF-Coenraads-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coenraads 2001</LINK>), and quality of life measures including DLQI (<LINK REF="REF-Gradwell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gradwell 2002</LINK>) and the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) (<LINK REF="REF-Jaspers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaspers 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2011</LINK> used the Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM).</P>
<P>The adult studies give a clearer indication of effectiveness than those for the child studies. This would appear to be due to the improved design and clarity about the stages of the research process and in reporting of results, not due to the nature of the interventions. The rigorously designed adult studies by <LINK REF="REF-Gradwell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gradwell 2002</LINK> (educational intervention) and <LINK REF="REF-Ehlers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehlers 1995</LINK> (psychological intervention), in terms of the use of robust outcome measures and controls, may provide useful pointers toward effective study design for child intervention studies. These studies also highlight the need to give consideration to the scope for combining educational and psychological approaches (based on relaxation and habit reversal) in the management of atopic eczema in children.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-23 04:46:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-12-23 04:43:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review draws on evidence from 10 trials. It is interesting that the studies focused on interventions directed at the parent rather than the child, particularly when 'atopic schools' offering multi-disciplinary therapeutic patient education, involving both parents and children, are becoming more common (<LINK REF="REF-Barbarot-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbarot 2013</LINK>). Based on the <LINK REF="STD-Chinn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chinn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niebel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Niebel 2000</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Schuttelaar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Schuttelaar 2010</LINK> studies, there is limited evidence that parental education delivered by nurses who are caring for children with atopic eczema may improve the clinical severity of the atopic eczema when used as an adjunct to conventional treatment. Details of the precise nature of educational activity within nurse-led clinics are limited; consideration needs to be given to this issue and its reporting. Evidence from the robust GADIS (German Atopic Dermatitis Intervention Study) multicentre study (<LINK REF="STD-Staab-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2006</LINK>) of multi-disciplinary intervention using an eczema school curriculum indicates that children and their parental carers may benefit from structured education, albeit using a complex intervention. There appear, in consequence, to be two main service delivery models - nurse-led and multi-disciplinary - in operation; however, we have no comparative evaluation of their relative effectiveness, either clinically or in terms of cost. Furthermore, reliable conclusions cannot be drawn on the effectiveness of psychological and complementary approaches, namely biofeedback and hypnotherapy, from one satisfactory but small study.</P>
<P>Since the management of atopic eczema requires an adaptation in health and illness behaviour and effective actions by the carer, it is logical to develop and evaluate both psychological and educational strategies as an adjunct to conventional therapy. It is surprising that despite the wide range of psychological interventions available, few have been subject to application, and there has been little robust evaluation. Educational interventions directed towards parents also appear to be worthy of development and robust testing, with attention given to finding both effective and resource-efficient models. Current case-based indications of good practice in prominent dermatology departments reveal recognition of the potential of such approaches (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Lawton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawton 2005</LINK>). Educational interventions require careful consideration of both the content of learning and of the most effective process, including who is best placed to teach affected people, at what frequency and duration, and whether or not educational technology should be employed. Nine of the 10 RCTs focused on parental education and used a variety of intervention formats.</P>
<P>An important issue for consideration is the scope and limits of the application and effectiveness of psychological interventions that have been used with adults could be used with children and their parents. The adult studies provide some additional, useful and relevant information on both interventions and their evaluation, which was not found within the child studies under review. For example, although based on small studies, there are indications that the habit reversal technique used in conjunction with conventional treatment may improve atopic eczema outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Melin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melin 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nor_x00e9_n-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norén 1989</LINK>). However, its application to children will depend on the child's developmental stage. Similarly, <LINK REF="REF-Ehlers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehlers 1995</LINK> showed that although a combined approach (patient education and cognitive-behavioural treatment) led to a significantly larger improvement in atopic dermatitis than intensive patient education or conventional dermatological treatment, such treatment will be limited to some older children of the appropriate developmental stage. In contrast, those educational studies that have sought to improve effective health behaviour through adult education have direct applicability to parental carers of children with atopic eczema. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Gradwell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gradwell 2002</LINK> showed that a single 20-minute appointment with a nurse to demonstrate the use of therapies (as well as the standard consultant appointment and follow-up) was useful in improving the participants' understanding of the treatments. Therefore, there may be some limited scope to explore psychological interventions as an additional therapy for children of the appropriate developmental stage. There may also be opportunities to apply the interventions used to teach adults with atopic eczema to the parents of children with atopic eczema.</P>
<P>This review suggests that there is scope for both multi-disciplinary teams and suitably qualified individual clinicians, such as nurses, as well as psychologists, to deliver educational interventions in conjunction with conventional therapy. In some countries, such as the UK, nurse-led clinics provide an opportunity for focused intervention. In countries such as Germany, the eczema school multi-disciplinary model is more established. There is scope to debate the relative merits of these different service delivery models that employ suitably qualified professionals to deliver both psychological and educational interventions. There is also scope to study how educational activity can most effectively be integrated with the resource efficient provision of conventional dermatological therapy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-12-23 04:46:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A relatively small number of studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria, and of these, we assessed only three as at low risk of bias. As such, there are significant opportunities to improve research design to evaluate psychological and educational interventions for children with atopic eczema and the reporting standards of such studies.</P>
<P>It is important that in the development of future trials, those people who will actually use the intervention are involved at an early stage (<LINK REF="REF-Medical-Research-Council-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medical Research Council 2008</LINK>). Interventions should have a robust and explicit theoretical base (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>), and consideration should be given to duration and frequency.</P>
<P>The Harmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) initiative concluded that the core outcomes that all eczema-related RCTs should report on are clinical signs, symptoms, long-term control of flares, and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitt 2012</LINK>). At the HOME III meeting (<LINK REF="REF-HOME-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">HOME 2013</LINK>), it was agreed that EASI should be the instrument for measuring signs of eczema. It is advised that self-efficacy measures are incorporated particularly as this is likely to be a key mediator in changing the health behaviour of parents caring for children with eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Ersser-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ersser 2013</LINK>). Quality of life, for both the child and their family, and sleep are also important measures (<LINK REF="REF-HOME-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">HOME 2013</LINK>). Consideration needs to be given to clinically meaningful time frames for applying selected outcome measures to assess sustained change.</P>
<P>Useful information to inform the design of more robust trials may be obtained from this review of existing studies examining the delivery of psychological and educational interventions to the parents of children with atopic eczema and those adult studies discussed above. These include ensuring the following:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the use of (and reporting of) adequate methods of random allocation and allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>the use of validated outcome measures (for validity and reliability, for use with the appropriate populations under study); and</LI>
<LI>the pursuit of loss to follow up is addressed within the study design.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In addition, given the nature of the interventions and outcomes examined in this review, there is scope to consider a wider range of research designs other than RCTs within any subsequent reviews, since these may help us to better understand the behavioural nature and effects of educational and psychological interventions.</P>
<P>In conclusion, there is significant scope to undertake intervention development and then design robust trials to evaluate theoretically based psychological and educational interventions, which may enhance the management of atopic eczema in children.</P>
