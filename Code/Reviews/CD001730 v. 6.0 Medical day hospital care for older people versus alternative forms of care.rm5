<P>Day hospitals are one way of delivering healthcare to older people. They are out-patient facilities which older patients attend for a full or near full day and receive multidisciplinary health care &#8216;under one roof.&#8217; Sixteen trials involving 3689 participants were included in this review and compared day hospitals with other comprehensive services (including inpatient and outpatient services), home based care and no comprehensive services. Attendance at a day hospital offers benefits compared to providing no treatment which include reducing the risk of needing more help with daily activities such as washing or dressing. Furthermore, patients are less likely to suffer one of the following: dying, being institutionalised or becoming more dependent on others. There is no apparent benefit when day hospitals are compared with other comprehensive services or home care. The economic value of day hospitals when compared with other health care services remains unclear.</P>

<P>Sixteen trials (3689 participants) compared day hospitals with comprehensive care (five trials), domiciliary care (seven trials) or no comprehensive care (four trials). Overall there was low quality evidence from these trials for the following results.</P>
<P>For the outcome of death, there was no strong evidence for or against day hospitals compared to other treatments overall (odds ratio (OR) 1.05; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.28; P = 0.66), or to comprehensive care (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.82; P = 0.22), domiciliary care (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.55; P = 0.89), or no comprehensive care (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.22; P = 0.43).</P>
<P>For the outcome of death or deterioration in activities of daily living (ADL), there was no strong evidence for day hospital attendance compared to other treatments (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.49; P = 0.70), or to comprehensive care (OR 1.18; 95% CI 0.63 to 2.18; P = 0.61), domiciliary care (OR 1.41; 95% CI 0.82 to 2.42; P = 0.21) or no comprehensive care (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.05; P = 0.09).</P>
<P>For the outcome of death or poor outcome (institutional care, dependency, deterioration in physical function), there was no strong evidence for day hospitals compared to other treatments (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.15; P = 0.49), or compared to comprehensive care (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.40; P = 0.74) or domiciliary care (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.74; P = 0.75). However, compared with no comprehensive care there was a difference in favour of day hospitals (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99; P = 0.04).</P>
<P>For the outcome of death or institutional care, there was no strong evidence for day hospitals compared to other treatments overall (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; P = 0.28), or to comprehensive care (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.44; P = 0.99), domiciliary care (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.57 to1.92; P = 0. 88) or no comprehensive care (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.00; P = 0.05).</P>
<P>For the outcome of deterioration in ADL, there was no strong evidence that day hospital attendance had a different effect than other treatments overall (OR 1.11; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.80; P = 0.67) or compared with comprehensive care (OR 1.21; 0.58 to 2.52; P = 0.61), or domiciliary care (OR 1.59; 95% CI 0.87 to 2.90; P = 0.13). However, day hospital patients showed a reduced odds of deterioration compared with those receiving no comprehensive care (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.97; P = 0.04) and significant subgroup differences (P = 0.04).</P>
<P>For the outcome of requiring institutional care, there was no strong evidence for day hospitals compared to other treatments (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.21; P = 0.35), or to comprehensive care (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.19; P = 0.49), domiciliary care (OR 1.49; 95% CI 0.53 to 4.25; P = 0.45), or no comprehensive care (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.20; P = 0.14).</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-06-08 08:46:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Julia Worswick">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-05 06:16:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The first geriatric day hospital was opened in the UK in 1952 (<LINK REF="REF-Farndale-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farndale 1961</LINK>). Day hospitals developed rapidly in the United Kingdom in the 1960's as an important component of care provision for older people designed to complement in-patient services (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2005</LINK>). The model has since been widely applied in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the USA and several European countries.</P>
<P>Geriatric day hospitals provide multi-disciplinary rehabilitation in an outpatient setting and operate in a pivotal position between hospital and home-based services (<LINK REF="REF-Ames-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ames 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Black-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petermans-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petermans 2011</LINK>). They provide specialist services for older people, which can include examinations and consultations, all concentrated in one location (<LINK REF="STD-Bussche-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bussche 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there is considerable descriptive literature on day hospital care (<LINK REF="REF-RCP-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 1994</LINK>), concern has been expressed that evidence for effectiveness is equivocal (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 1986</LINK>) and that day hospital care is expensive (<LINK REF="REF-NAO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAO 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Concern is often expressed about the most appropriate health and social services required to address the needs of an aging population. In the UK, for example, the largest population increase is seen in the over 85 age group. A range of different services models, of which the day hospital is one, may be appropriate to address these needs. This review sets out to examine the effectiveness and resource implications of geriatric medical day hospital attendance for older people and to compare it with other models of healthcare delivery for an older population. This is an updated Cochrane review first published in <LINK REF="REF-Forster-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 1999a</LINK>.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-05-24 14:35:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Geriatric day hospitals are not usually specific to one condition. However, many will provide rehabilitation services appropriate to conditions such as stroke that are likely to be seen in an older population.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-06-02 04:20:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Geriatric day hospitals are out-patient healthcare facilities for older people living in the community. They provide multi-professional treatment on a full or part time basis (<LINK REF="REF-Beynon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beynon 2009</LINK>).They serve several functions, including assessment, rehabilitation, and medical, nursing, maintenance, social and respite care (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 1980</LINK>). Rehabilitation and maintenance comprise the main work of the day hospital: 42% and 23% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-RCP-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 1994</LINK>), with rehabilitation regarded as the most important function (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 1980</LINK>). The specific features and services offered by individual geriatric day hospitals are subject to considerable variation. However, they usually include a combination of medical assessment with support from nurses and allied health professionals, often including physiotherapists and occupational therapists. There is no consensus on what types of healthcare professionals should make up the multi-disciplinary teams (<LINK REF="REF-Petermans-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petermans 2011</LINK>). Additional services such as chiropody, social work, exercise classes and assistance with bathing and hair washing are offered by some hospitals.<BR/>
</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-05-29 21:33:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Geriatric day hospitals offer a multidisciplinary approach to assessment and rehabilitation, with provision of a variety of services in one location. As a result of assessment and treatment occurring 'under one roof,&#8217; the health requirements of older people should be identified and responded to in an appropriate and timely manner. The day hospital can provide out-patient delivery of a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) which has a robust evidence base for inpatient setting use (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2011</LINK>). A CGA addresses medical, physical, psychological and social needs, and includes the formation of a plan of care and rehabilitation, with a clear method of implementation. Day hospital staff have specific skills, knowledge and experience related to working with older people. Furthermore, the day hospital environment has the advantage of providing social interaction between patients, a factor which domiciliary services and usual care cannot provide. These factors could result in better outcomes for patients through the provision of effective rehabilitation and other healthcare delivery for an older population.</P>

<P>Between 1985 and 2010 the proportion of the world's population that is aged over 65 years grew by approximately a quarter from 6.0% (291 million) to 7.6% (524 million), and is expected to increase to 13% by 2035, exceeding a billion people globally (<LINK REF="REF-UN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN 2011</LINK>). As a result of this increase, providing health care that meets the diverse needs of an older population and is cost effective and efficient will be ever more important. Day hospitals are one way of delivering multidisciplinary rehabilitation to older people in an outpatient setting. This review is necessary to assess the effectiveness of day hospitals across a number of health, cost and resource outcomes.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-01-02 05:55:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary question was whether older patients attending a geriatric medical day hospital would experience better outcomes (in terms of death, dependency or institutionalisation) than those receiving alternative forms of care.</P>
<P>Secondary questions concerned the impact of day hospital care on patient satisfaction and subjective health outcomes, carer distress and resource use and costs.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2015-05-28 20:17:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included studies that were of a prospective, controlled design in which there was random assignment of participants to alternative treatment groups (one of which involved day hospital care), not as part of a complex multi-service intervention. Studies which utilised &#8216;quasi&#8217; randomisation procedures (for example allocation to groups based on date of birth) were also included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2015-05-28 20:19:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included patients receiving medical care (mean/median age of &gt;60 years for individual studies). We are aware that day hospital descriptive studies have indicated that day hospital attendance is determined more by needs than age and that younger patients do attend day hospitals. Our pre-specified participant criterion of age 60 years and over was chosen to pragmatically capture this clinical practice. Studies which were specific to psychiatric patients were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-28 20:22:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We defined a day hospital as an out-patient facility where older patients attend for a full or near full day and receive multidisciplinary rehabilitation in a healthcare setting. This is consistent with previous definitions (<LINK REF="REF-Siu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siu 1994</LINK>) and excluded trials evaluating social day centres, or other types of day hospitals such as psychiatric day hospitals for patients with dementia or psychiatric conditions. We excluded studies on day hospitals that only provided services for single, specific conditions (for example, arthritis). We wanted to assess the effects of providing typical general assessment and rehabilitation services relevant to older people. The inclusion of disease-specific trials would risk incorporating the effects of very specific therapies for specific conditions, which were not the focus of this review.</P>
<P>We anticipated considerable heterogeneity, particularly in the control services, and so pre-specified key subgroup comparisons prior to reviewing the trials.</P>
<P>1) Day hospital care versus comprehensive care - where control patients had access to a range of geriatric medical services (both inpatient and outpatient).<BR/>2) Day hospital care versus domiciliary care - where control patients were provided an approximately equivalent rehabilitation program within their own home or social day centre.<BR/>3) Day hospital care versus no comprehensive care - where control patients did not routinely have access to outpatient rehabilitation services.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2015-05-29 20:44:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We wished to identify outcomes which reflected a previous definition of the purpose of day hospital care: to facilitate and prolong independent living for older people in the community (<LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 1987</LINK>). Effective day hospital care would thus be expected to reduce death, to maintain older people in their own home and to reduce admissions to hospital. The following outcomes were therefore selected, all of which were recorded at the end of scheduled follow up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison groups</HEADING>
<P>Attendance at a day hospital was evaluated against various comparison treatments which were grouped together in the following sub-categories:</P>
<P>1) In five studies the comparison treatment was comprehensive care comprising a range of inpatient, outpatient and domiciliary geriatric medical services (<LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eagle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Eagle 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hedrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hedrick 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pitkala-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pitkala 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tucker-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Tucker 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>2) In seven trials the comparison treatment was domiciliary therapy. This was provided in the patient's home (<LINK REF="STD-Crotty-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Crotty 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gladman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gladman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roderick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Roderick 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vetter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vetter 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1992</LINK>) or day centre (<LINK REF="STD-Burch-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Burch 1999</LINK>). Three of these trials recruited stroke patients only (<LINK REF="STD-Gladman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gladman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roderick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Roderick 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1992</LINK>) and a fourth was a pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Vetter-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Vetter 1989</LINK>). In the Nottingham trial patients were randomly allocated to domiciliary rehabilitation or hospital-based rehabilitation in three strata according to discharge ward: health care of older people, general medical unit or stroke unit (<LINK REF="STD-Gladman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gladman 1993</LINK>). Hospital-based rehabilitation was provided during day hospital attendance for patients in the older people care stratum and only patients in this stratum have been included in our analysis.</P>
<P>3) Four trials compared day hospital attendance against a control group in which patients were eligible for, but not referred to, existing services (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masud--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Masud 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weissert-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Weissert 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodford-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Woodford 1962</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Masud--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Masud 2006</LINK> the control arm received information leaflets on falls prevention and usual care from the primary care service until outcome data was completed, after which time control participants were offered access to the day hospital intervention.</P>
<P>We initially allocated <LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hui-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 1995</LINK> into their own individual sub-categories according to their comparison group; day hospital versus inpatient care (<LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1985</LINK>) and day hospital versus medical outpatient care (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 1995</LINK>). However, in order to streamline the analysis, these two trials were incorporated into the above categorisation schemes prior to data analysis. The <LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1985</LINK> trial investigated a day hospital service designed to facilitate early hospital discharge. The service offered to the comparison group was equivalent to comprehensive care and the trial was re-categorised accordingly. The Hong Kong trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 1995</LINK>) recruited stroke patients admitted to the same ward and randomised to receive rehabilitation care led by a neurology team or by a geriatrician team. After discharge, patients assigned to a neurologist were followed up at a medical outpatient clinic and the geriatrician patients by day hospital attendance. There were no differences in length of inpatient stay or dependency at discharge and the main treatment difference at final follow up assessment was the type of supporting aftercare: day hospital or medical outpatients. Further discussion with the trialists indicated that this comparison group could best be categorised as 'no comprehensive care'.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessments of the quality of the body of evidence</HEADING>
<P>Using the GRADE approach we judged the quality of the body of evidence to be low for the patient outcomes of death, death or institutional care, death or deterioration in ADL, death or poor outcome, and deterioration in ADL (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-20" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 20</LINK>). For each outcome the body of evidence was from randomised controlled trials but we reduced the quality rating because of a high likelihood of bias in the included studies and imprecision in the effect estimates (wide CIs).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-30 19:35:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The majority of included studies have compared day hospital care with other services. Only four trials employed a comparison group of patients who received neither comprehensive care nor domiciliary rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Masud--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Masud 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodford-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Woodford 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weissert-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Weissert 1980</LINK>). The results from this group were the most favourable to day hospital care, but these four trials are now quite old. Overall the quality of the evidence was low, therefore further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</P>
<P>For the outcome of death, there was no difference between day hospitals and other services, including when day hospitals were compared with any of the subcategories individually. For the combined outcome of death or institutional care there was no significant difference between the day hospital and all other services. For the combined outcome of death or deterioration in ADL, there was no significant difference between the day hospital and other services although there was a trend in favour of the day hospital compared with no comprehensive care. For the combined outcome of death or poor outcome, there was a significant difference in favour of the day hospital when compared with no comprehensive services. For the outcome of deterioration in ADL, there was a significant difference between attending day hospital and no comprehensive care. However, there was no difference between the day hospital and other services.</P>
<P>When considering resource implications among those requiring institutional care, there was no difference at the end of follow up between day hospital and other services. There was a slight reduction in hospital bed use overall for day hospital patients and particularly when day hospitals were compared with domiciliary services; however, whilst a summary statistic was not possible for hospital bed use or cost, individual studies suggest that day hospitals are predominantly as expensive or more expensive than others services.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-06-05 08:53:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Julia Worswick">
<P>The day hospital trials included in this systematic review have predominantly employed a pragmatic design and have attempted to address broad questions of overall day hospital effectiveness. This review included 16 studies with 3689 participants, although within the analyses of specific outcomes these numbers were reduced as each study only contributed data for some comparisons. It is unfortunate that data was not available, or in a suitable format, to undertake statistical analyses for the patient outcomes of activities of daily living, subjective health status, patient satisfaction or carer distress, or for the resource outcome of cost. It also proved impossible to determine a summary statistic for disability because, although included as an outcome measure in 11 trials, different measurement instruments were used and variance data were not available. The outcome of death was reported by all studies, however other adverse events and effects were not reported consistently by all studies, thus compromising the overall completeness of findings.</P>
<P>We have based the systematic review on a broad comparison of day hospital care versus alternative services. We wanted to be able to generalise to a range of scenarios and not defined populations. As we anticipated considerable variations in the comparison services, these were identified and categorised prior to data collection and analysis. We have ensured that the treatment schedules described matched our pre-determined definition of day hospital care. Thus, whilst the study by Weissert and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Weissert-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Weissert 1980</LINK>) refers to &#8216;day care&#8217; services, the intervention provided fitted our definition of day hospital care and was therefore included. A lack of consensus in terminology related to day hospitals has also been noted elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Petermans-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petermans 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The applicability of the findings from this review to various regions will depend on current health care provision and populations. As comprehensive care, in one form or another, is likely to be available to many older patients who require rehabilitation, the relevance of some comparisons may be limited in certain countries and populations; specifically the findings from the comparison between day hospitals and no comprehensive care (which was favourable for the day hospital on the combined measure of death or poor outcome, with a trend in favour of the day hospital for the combined measure of death or institutional care). This review found little evidence that day hospitals were better than alternative types of comprehensive service. However, the diversity in the content of alternative services and the populations being served (studies originated from seven different counties) means the external validity of this finding may be compromised. Furthermore, 10 of the studies were at least 20 years old and the types of health service and the populations being served may not reflect current practice or requirements. Services may need to be considered on a case by case basis regarding their applicability against current health provision.</P>
<P>Two main limitations of our review lie in the multinational settings of the studies and in the forty year time span of study publication, during which time health and social care policies inevitably changed. It is disappointing that there have been only four further evaluations of the effectiveness of day hospital care since this review was first published (<LINK REF="REF-Forster-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 1999a</LINK>). Nonetheless, the data presented here probably represent the best evidence currently available upon which to base a judgment of day hospital effectiveness.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-06-05 09:03:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Julia Worswick">
<P>There are limitations due to the lack of statistical power resulting from small, heterogeneous trials. As a result there is a danger of both false-positive and false-negative results being generated. Furthermore, the data was from a series of studies performed by researchers operating independently and the studies were therefore not functionally equivalent. This resulted in significant heterogeneity through variations in participants and in the interventions employed in the various day hospitals and comparison treatments. Participants and interventions likely differed in ways that impacted the results. Consequently, we cannot assume a common effect size (<LINK REF="REF-Borenstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borenstein 2009</LINK>). A frequently encountered issue with pragmatic rehabilitation trials is that the methods to record subject characteristics, which might influence prognosis and treatment processes, are poorly developed. Considerable detail was recorded in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Hedrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hedrick 1993</LINK>) trial; it is important that any future trials also address this issue. Data were missing for a number of outcomes which could theoretically alter the scale and direction of the results. All of our conclusions must be qualified by this condition.</P>
<P>It is possible that biases have resulted in the overestimation or underestimation of the effects of the intervention. All studies were at a high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel; this is typical of such an intervention and effective blinding would be challenging to implement in view of ethical considerations which require participants to have prior knowledge of potential interventions. However, a lack of blinding of outcome assessment was also problematic and only half the studies were considered to have a low risk in this domain. Contamination can result in the underestimation of treatment effects and whilst not all studies were judged to be of high risk, contamination and deviation from the protocol (switching between interventions) did feature in some studies comparing day hospitals with other comprehensive services and domiciliary care. In addition, the risk of selective reporting was often unclear. Only the three studies which were reported in the last eight years had available protocols against which their reports could be assessed to determine if all outcomes had been reported. Finally, half of the studies were considered to have a low risk of bias for the domain of incomplete outcome data. This should be considered positive, taking into account the nature of the intervention and participants, post intervention follow up periods, and the age of the studies where attrition was less frequently reported.</P>

<P>The search strategy was extensive, taking into account multiple databases and sources, and this is reflected in the large number of titles identified. Two authors extracted all data, discussions were undertaken to achieve consensus, and a third person was utilised where disagreements remained. As a result, we are confident in the quality of the review. It was unfortunate, however, that we could not quantitatively combine data for a number of outcomes, due to the diversity of measures used (for example, ADL, subjective health status, patient satisfaction, carer distress, bed use and resource use).</P>
<P>Publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>) remains a possibility in any review process. However, our search strategy was extensive and included contacting the authors of papers relating to day hospital care around the world.</P>

<P>Another systematic review drew similar conclusions to our review (<LINK REF="REF-Petermans-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petermans 2011</LINK>). They found that geriatric day hospitals were better for patients undergoing assessment and intervention than no comprehensive care. However, they found little benefit when compared to treatment in a geriatric ward or other geriatric services. They also found few studies reporting on the outcome of patient satisfaction. The authors did not include meta-analysis and they did not report on any cost-benefit outcomes; their conclusions were drawn from various sources including RCTs and cohort studies. Another systematic review, with meta-analysis, found that comprehensive geriatric assessments linking geriatric evaluation with long term management are effective in improving survival and function in older people (<LINK REF="REF-Stuck-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuck 1993</LINK>).</P>

<P>Any conclusions are limited by the relatively small amount of data available and the low quality of the data contributing to a number of important outcomes. Day hospital care appears to be an effective outpatient service for older people, but no more effective (at least for the outcomes examined in this review), and possibly more expensive, than other forms of comprehensive care. These findings do not support the closure of day hospital services but do support the exploration of alternative systems for delivering an equivalent or superior form of comprehensive care. Our findings support the view that day hospital attendance needs to be carefully monitored (<LINK REF="REF-George-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1989</LINK>) and the staff and facilities used as flexibly and efficiently as possible (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>The findings are limited by the relatively small amount of data available and overall low quality of the evidence; further research is likely to impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect. Further randomised trials are justifiable and should focus on comparing services which aim to provide an equivalent intervention to day hospital care (e.g. domiciliary care). Given the diversity of patients attending day hospitals and the corresponding diversity of day hospital interventions employed, future trials should be large, multi-centre trials or should examine more focused questions. Outcomes should include subjective health status and carer well being. There is concern that commonly used measures of disability lack sensitivity to change in the outpatient setting of a day hospital due to their ceiling effect (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1994</LINK>). Future trials should incorporate measures of instrumental activities of daily living as a more relevant and potentially more sensitive outcome. Furthermore, future trials should incorporate adequate methods of randomisation and allocation concealment, and undertake blinded outcome assessment where possible, as well as ensuring that methods are adequately reported.</P>

Quote: "...by calling a centralised office where closed lists ... were kept" , the sample was stratified by sex (2 groups), disability (3 groups), age and day hospital catchment area. Minimum 2x3x2x5 = 60 groups. There were 5 day hospitals so potentially 60 groups. The approach to stratification is not described but is likely to be a permuted-block design, with small block size and therefore allocation could have been predicted for some of the patients</P>
