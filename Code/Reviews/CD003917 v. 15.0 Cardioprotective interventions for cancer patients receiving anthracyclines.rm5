<P>Summary of most important changes in results of this second update when compared to the first update of this review:</P>
<P>We identified a new randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the use of amifostine (no eligible data on amifostine were available before). Also, we identified a new RCT on the use of dexrazoxane and long-term follow-up data of an already included RCT on dexrazoxane. Finally, we identified a new ongoing trial (on enalapril maleate) and two new trials awaiting assessment (on telmirsartan and the combination of hydroprednisone and gluthatione).</P>
<P>Again, only for dexrazoxane pooling of results was possible and for the occurrence of cardiotoxicity, response rate and survival the conclusions did not change. More information on adverse effects became available including secondary malignant disease.</P>

<P>New studies found and included or excluded: 01/04/07</P>
<P>Conclusions changed: 10/07/07</P>
<P>Summary of most important changes in results of the update when compared to the original review:<BR/>as opposed to the original review, there was no evidence for a lesser tumour response rate with the use of dexrazoxane. For adverse effects now pooling of results was possible: only for one adverse effect (abnormal white blood cell count at nadir) a difference in favour of the control group was identified.<BR/>
<BR/>The search for eligible studies was updated to April 2007 using an updated search strategy and including eight new possible cardioprotective agents. And as opposed to the original review, for the update we searched in ongoing trials databases.<BR/>
<BR/>Instead of pooling results when three or more randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were available, we now pooled results of two or more RCTs. Instead of focusing only on the primary outcome (heart failure) when assessing the quality of included studies, we now assessed the quality criteria blinding of the outcome assessor and completeness of follow-up for all outcomes separately. Prior cardiac dysfunction was added as a baseline characteristic. Sex, age per treatment group, anthracycline peak dose, anthracycline infusion duration, cumulative anthracycline doses in the intervention and control groups, and a description of other chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy in the study protocol were added to the table of included studies.<BR/>
<BR/>Five new RCTs were included: one addressing L-carnitine, one addressing carvedilol and three additional ones addressing dexrazoxane. We also identified six ongoing studies and seven studies awaiting assessment evaluating different cardioprotective agents; characteristics of these trials are provided.<BR/>
<BR/>Again, only for dexrazoxane pooling of results was possible and for the occurrence of cardiotoxicity and survival the conclusions did not change. As opposed to the original review, now there was no evidence for a lesser tumour response rate with the use of dexrazoxane. For adverse effects now pooling of results was possible: only for one adverse effect (abnormal white blood cell count at nadir) a difference in favour of the control group was identified.<BR/>
<BR/>We conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high, it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines. However, for each individual patient clinicians should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects.<BR/>

<TITLE>Drugs to prevent heart damage in cancer patients receiving anthracyclines</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-04-27 12:25:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anthracyclines are among the most effective chemotherapy treatments available for various types of cancer. However, there is a risk of damage to the heart (cardiotoxicity) depending on the cumulative dose. Certain drugs might prevent this damage, but for many of these drugs, the review authors found no high quality evidence about whether they were effective in protecting the heart and they were unable to draw conclusions. For dexrazoxane, the review authors found 10 studies enrolling over 1600 patients. These studies provided evidence that dexrazoxane prevented heart damage without interfering with the anti-tumour effects of anthracycline treatment. Patients who got dexrazoxane with their anthracycline treatment had about one third of the risk of heart failure compared to patients who got anthracyclines without dexrazoxane. Dexrazoxane had no effect on survival. We can't be sure about whether it had any undesirable side effects.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Anthracyclines are among the most effective chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of numerous malignancies. Unfortunately, their use is limited by a dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. In an effort to prevent this cardiotoxicity, different cardioprotective agents have been studied. </P>

<P>We identified RCTs for the eight cardioprotective agents N-acetylcysteine, phenethylamines, coenzyme Q10, a combination of vitamins E and C and N-acetylcysteine, L-carnitine, carvedilol, amifostine and dexrazoxane (mostly for adults with advanced breast cancer). All studies had methodological limitations and for the first seven agents there were too few studies to allow pooling of results. None of the individual studies showed a cardioprotective effect. The 10 included studies on dexrazoxane enrolled 1619 patients. The meta-analysis for dexrazoxane showed a statistically significant benefit in favour of dexrazoxane for the occurrence of heart failure (risk ratio (RR) 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.41). No evidence was found for a difference in response rate or survival between the dexrazoxane and control groups. The results for adverse effects were ambiguous. No significant difference in the occurrence of secondary malignancies was identified.</P>

<P>No definitive conclusions can be made about the efficacy of cardioprotective agents for which pooling of results was impossible. Dexrazoxane prevents heart damage and no evidence for a difference in response rate or survival between the dexrazoxane and control groups was identified. The evidence available did not allow us to reach any definite conclusions about adverse effects. We conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high, it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines. However, clinicians should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects for each individual patient.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-04-27 12:32:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-04-23 12:29:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anthracyclines, that is doxorubicin, epirubicin and daunorubicin, are among the most effective drugs used in chemotherapy for cancer patients. They are widely used to treat solid tumours and leukaemia in both adults and children. Their use is, however, limited because they often cause damage to the heart, especially if the patient is given a high dose (<LINK REF="REF-Bonadonna-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonadonna 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lefrak-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefrak 1973</LINK>).</P>
<P>We do not understand exactly how anthracyclines cause heart damage. It may be because of lipid peroxidation and the generation of free radicals by anthracycline-iron complexes. The heart is particularly vulnerable to injury from free radicals because it has a lower level of protective enzymes such as superoxide dismutase than other tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Keizer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keizer 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 1998</LINK>). The damage to heart cells may eventually lead to irreversible heart failure.</P>
<P>Heart damage after anthracycline therapy can be divided into early and late cardiotoxicity. Early cardiotoxicity refers to heart damage that develops during anthracycline therapy or in the first year after completion; late cardiotoxicity refers to heart damage that only becomes evident at least one year after the completion of anthracycline therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Shan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shan 1996</LINK>). The risk of developing heart failure remains a lifelong threat, especially to children who have a long life-expectancy after successful treatment for cancer.</P>
<P>Heart damage can occur as either subclinical or clinical cardiotoxicity. The term subclinical cardiotoxicity is used to describe various cardiac abnormalities, diagnosed with different diagnostic methods in patients without symptoms. Clinical cardiotoxicity is defined on the basis of symptoms of clinical heart failure that are confirmed by an abnormal diagnostic test. In the end stage of clinical heart failure, heart transplantation is the only remaining treatment option.</P>
<P>There is a wide variation in the reported frequency of both clinical and subclinical cardiotoxicity after anthracycline therapy. In children, the prevalence of subclinical heart failure at a median of 6.4 years after treatment has been reported to be more than 57% (<LINK REF="REF-Kremer-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremer 2002a</LINK>) and the incidence of clinical heart failure is as high as 16% 0.9 to 4.8 years after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kremer-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremer 2002b</LINK>). Part of this variation can be explained by the type of anthracycline used, the total anthracycline dose and the peak anthracycline dose. Some of the variation may be explained by different definitions of heart failure and different ways of assessing it. Further variation may be explained by additional risk factors for developing heart damage such as radiation therapy involving the heart region; type of tumour; exposure to cyclophosphamide, iphosphamide or amsacrine; female sex; age (children and elderly people have a higher risk); and existing heart disease.</P>
<P>Clinicians face a clinical dilemma as they balance the efficacy of longer duration of therapy against the cardiotoxicity associated with higher cumulative doses of anthracyclines. In an effort to prevent or reduce this cardiotoxicity, extensive research has been devoted to the identification of methods or drugs capable of ameliorating the toxicity. Several less cardiotoxic anthracycline analogs have been developed, including liposomal anthracyclines (<LINK REF="REF-Batist-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Batist 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muggia-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muggia 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muggia-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muggia 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2010</LINK>), and the cumulative and peak doses of anthracycline therapy have been reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Legha-1982a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legha 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipshultz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipshultz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Von-Hoff-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Hoff 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2009</LINK>). Despite these efforts, cardiotoxicity remains a problem.</P>
<P>A different approach to reducing anthracycline-induced heart damage is the use of cardioprotective agents, of which dexrazoxane (Cardioxane, ICRF-187; Zinecard, ADR-529) is the most widely investigated drug (<LINK REF="STD-Swain-1997a_x0028_088001_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1997a(088001)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wexler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wexler 1996</LINK>). Other drugs like L-carnitine, probucol, coenzyme Q10, n-acetylcysteine, vitamin E, digoxin, enalapril, phenethylamines, deferoxamine, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), superoxide dismutase and monohydroxyethylrutoside are less well investigated; however cardioprotective effects have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-De-Leonardis-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Leonardis 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elihu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elihu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garbrecht-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garbrecht 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guthrie-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guthrie 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iarussi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Iarussi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kawasaki-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawasaki 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Legha-1982b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legha 1982b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silber-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silber 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singal-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singal 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unverferth-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Unverferth 1983a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Acker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Acker 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>An important question regarding any cardioprotective intervention during anthracycline therapy is whether the cardioprotective drug can decrease the heart damage caused by anthracyclines without reducing the anti-tumour efficacy and without negative effects on toxicities other than cardiac damage, such as alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea, fatigue, anaemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.</P>
<P>This is the second update of the systematic review on cardioprotective interventions during anthracycline therapy. Since performing the first update of this review, new evidence on the cardioprotective drugs has became available. All new evidence is included in this update.</P>

See additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for a description of the criteria used. Allocation concealment was assessed using the scale set out in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>).

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-04-27 12:28:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The data were entered into RevMan and analysed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). Dichotomous outcomes were related to risk using the risk ratio (RR). If possible, data were extracted by allocated group, irrespective of compliance with the allocated intervention, in order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. It was stated if this was not possible. Heterogeneity was assessed both by visual inspection of forest plots and by a formal statistical test for heterogeneity, that is the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50% was considered to represent substantial heterogeneity) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). If no substantial heterogeneity was detected, a fixed-effect model was used for the estimation of treatment effects; otherwise we used the random-effects model. All results are presented with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).</P>
<P>A meta-analysis was performed for each cardioprotective intervention for which two or more studies were identified. Interventions for which fewer studies were identified were summarised descriptively. For outcomes where only one study was available we were unable to calculate a RR if one of the treatment groups experienced no events and the Fischer's exact test was used instead (in statcalc.exe). Subgroup analyses were not performed. For PFS and OS, we used the generic inverse variance function of RevMan to combine logs of the hazard ratios (HRs).</P>
<P>Parmar's method was used to extract the log of the HR and its standard error (SE) from survival curves (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>) for the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Marty-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marty 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Speyer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Speyer 1992</LINK>. We digitised the published Kaplan-Meier survival curves and noted the minimum and maximum duration of follow up, which are required for Parmar's method. We performed the required calculations in Stata 9, using a specially written program, which yielded the reported log(HR) and variance when used on the data presented in table V of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. For the study of Swain (<LINK REF="STD-Swain-1997a_x0028_088001_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1997a(088001)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swain-1997a_x0028_088006_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1997a(088006)</LINK>), calculations were performed in an Excel spreadsheet.</P>
<P>The risk of bias in the studies included in the analyses was taken into account in the interpretation of the results of the review. For all outcomes for which pooling was possible we performed sensitivity analyses for all risk of bias criteria separately. We excluded the studies with a high risk of bias and the studies for which the risk of bias was unclear to compare the results of the studies with a low risk of bias with the results of all available studies.</P>

<P>We assessed the search results for CENTRAL (175 references: 48 identified in the first update (April 2007); four identified in the second update (November 2010)), MEDLINE (1129 references: 240 identified in the first update (April 2007); 57 identified in the second update (November 2010)) and EMBASE (2729 references: 1606 identified in the first update (April 2007); 162 identified in the second update (November 2010)). We included a total of 19 articles which fulfilled all the criteria for including studies in this review: one addressed N-acetylcysteine; two addressed phenethylamines; one addressed coenzyme Q10; one addressed the combination of vitamin E, vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine; one addressed L-carnitine (new in the first update); one addressed carvedilol (new in the first update); one addressed amifostine (new in the second update); and 11 addressed dexrazoxane (three new in the first update; three new in the second update). One of the articles addressing dexrazoxane provided the results of two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Swain-1997a_x0028_088001_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1997a(088001)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swain-1997a_x0028_088006_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1997a(088006)</LINK>) and two articles (<LINK REF="REF-Barry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barry 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipshultz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipshultz 2010</LINK>) provided long-term follow-up data of a RCT addressing dexrazoxane (<LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2004</LINK>); therefore the total number of identified RCTs was 18 (that is 10 for dexrazoxane and 8 for other cardioprotective interventions) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table).</P>
<P>Twenty-five articles were excluded for reasons described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table. Two studies did not provide enough information to assess eligibility for this review and we did not succeed in contacting the authors. These studies are included in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK> table. The remaining 3987 articles were excluded since they were not RCTs, were laboratory studies, were animal studies, or did not have heart failure as an outcome measure.</P>
<P>By scanning the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews no additional studies could be included in the review. However, we identified the abstracts of two studies addressing dexrazoxane. These studies have not been published yet and are awaiting further classification (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK> table). We also identified one ongoing trial addressing dexrazoxane, which is described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> table.

<P>Kraft et al investigated the effect of verapamil versus no cardioprotective intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Kraft-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 1990</LINK>). This study included 64 adults (30 in the intervention group and 34 in the control group) with leukaemia, who were treated with daunorubicin. Only 30 (13 in the intervention group and 17 in the control group) randomised patients were evaluated.

<P>In conclusion, the risk of bias in the included studies varied and bias could not be ruled out in the following percentage of included studies: selection bias (based on concealment of allocation) 40%; performance bias (based on blinding of the care provider and patient) 80%; detection bias (based on blinding of the outcome assessor) 44% for clinical heart failure (based on the original data of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2004</LINK>; using the long-term follow-up data this would be 33%), 25% for subclinical heart failure, 67% for response rate, 50% for PFS, and 100% for adverse effects; and finally attrition bias (based on the completeness of follow up) 22% for clinical heart failure, 13% for subclinical heart failure, 11% for response rate, 0% for both PFS and OS, and 14% for adverse effects.</P>

<P>Since only one study addressed N-acetylcysteine, pooling of results was not possible. We therefore provide descriptive results for this study. All the RR, 95% CI and P values mentioned below were calculated in RevMan, with the exception of the Fischer's exact test P value.</P>
<P>Heart failure only included cases of clinical heart failure. Three of the 24 (12.5%) patients treated with N-acetylcysteine developed clinical heart failure, as did 3 of the 30 (10%) control patients (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.28 to 5.64, P = 0.77).</P>
<P>The response rate in the intervention group was 16.7% (4/24 patients) and in the control group it was 6.7% (2/30 patients) with a RR of 2.50 (95% CI 0.50 to 12.51, P = 0.26). These patients had no evaluable disease or partial remission; we assumed that the patients with no evaluable disease were in complete remission.</P>
<P>With regard to adverse effects other than cardiac damage, the major difference between the intervention and control groups was the presence of diarrhoea in the group receiving N-acetylcysteine (7/24 (29%) versus 0/30 (0%) control patients (Fischer's exact test P = 0.002); we were unable to calculate a RR for this comparison because one group experienced no events.

Alopecia occurred in 12/24 patients (50%) in the intervention group versus 9/30 patients (30%) in the control group (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.28, P = 0.14). In three patients (12.5%) in the intervention group, an erythematous flare developed at sites of previous venepuncture (Fischer's exact test P = 0.08); we were unable to calculate a RR for this comparison because one group experienced no events. There were no differences in the occurrence of mucositis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and low haemoglobin level (defined as less than eight) between the two groups.</P>

<P>None of the patients in this study developed clinical heart failure. None of the patients in the intervention group and two patients in the control group (15.4%) developed subclinical heart failure (Fischer's exact test for heart failure (that is clinical and subclinical heart failure combined) P = 0.21); we were unable to calculate a RR for this comparison because one group experienced no events.</P>
<P>The response rate in the intervention group was 93.3% (14/15 patients) and in the control group it was 58.3% (7/12 patients; for one patient no histological examination was available) with a RR of 1.60 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.63, P = 0.06).</P>
<P>With regard to adverse effects other than cardiac damage (grade 3 or higher), the major difference between the intervention and control groups was the presence of vomiting in the group receiving amifostine (15/14 (100%) versus 1/13 (7.7%) of the control patients), RR of 9.04 (95% CI 1.99 to 41.12, P = 0.004).

There were 11 cases of clinical heart failure among 769 patients randomised to dexrazoxane and 69 among 792 randomised to the control group.

There were 34 cases of heart failure among 328 patients randomised to dexrazoxane and 113 among 315 randomised to the control group. Since in the study from <LINK REF="STD-Wexler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wexler 1996</LINK> it was not possible to separate cases of clinical and subclinical heart failure, it is not possible to give the exact number of patients with subclinical heart failure that were included in this meta-analysis. However, at least 21 of the 34 patients with heart failure in the dexrazoxane group and at least 58 of the 118 patients with heart failure in the control group suffered from subclinical heart failure. The meta-analysis showed a benefit in favour of dexrazoxane use (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.41, P &lt; 0.00001). No heterogeneity was detected (I = 0%).</P>

<P>Data on response rate (defined as the number of patients in complete and partial remission) could be extracted from six trials with a total of 1021 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Lopez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marty-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marty 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Speyer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Speyer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swain-1997a_x0028_088001_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1997a(088001)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swain-1997a_x0028_088006_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1997a(088006)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venturini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Venturini 1996</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). These trials used comparable criteria to assess tumour response. From the studies of Swain (<LINK REF="STD-Swain-1997a_x0028_088001_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1997a(088001)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swain-1997a_x0028_088006_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1997a(088006)</LINK>) only patients with evaluable disease were included (for study 088001: 141 in the dexrazoxane group and 152 in the control group; for study 088006: 54 in the dexrazoxane group and 69 in the control group). There were 223 complete and partial responses among 503 patients randomised to dexrazoxane and 260 among 518 randomised to the control group. The meta-analysis showed no significant difference between the treatment groups (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02, P = 0.08). No heterogeneity was detected (I = 0%).</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lopez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Speyer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Speyer 1992</LINK>) mentioned that the response rate was determined by at least two observers. We excluded the study of <LINK REF="STD-Wexler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wexler 1996</LINK> from this analysis since it was impossible to separate the three non-randomised patients from the randomised patients in the dexrazoxane group. We excluded the study of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2009</LINK> since partial remission was not mentioned and therefore the results only included complete remissions. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Galetta-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Galetta 2005</LINK> no information on response rate was provided.</P>
<P>Please note that due to the nature of this measurement (that is the number of patients with a remission) a high event rate is favourable.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-04-27 12:32:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heart damage due to anthracycline chemotherapy is a considerable, serious problem. It reduces QoL and can even cause premature death. Also, when heart damage occurs during therapy the maximum cumulative dose of anthracyclines needs to be limited and as a result the efficacy of anthracycline chemotherapy will be reduced. This is the second update of the systematic review evaluating the existing evidence on all known possibly cardioprotective agents.</P>
<P>We identified RCTs for N-acetylcysteine, phenethylamines, coenzyme Q10, the combination of vitamin E, vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine, L-carnitine, carvedilol, amifostine and dexrazoxane. For the other possible cardioprotective interventions included in our search no RCTs were found. Non-randomised studies and case reports have been published for some of these interventions. However, due to the high risk of bias associated with these study designs, they were not included in this systematic review and no conclusions can be made about the efficacy of these interventions in preventing heart damage in patients treated with anthracyclines.</P>
<P>For N-acetylcysteine, phenethylamines, coenzyme Q10, the combination of vitamin E, vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine, L-carnitine, carvedilol and amifostine, pooling of results was not possible either because only one RCT was available or (where two RCTs were identified) because the definitions used to describe heart failure were not comparable. All trials had methodological limitations so the presence of bias cannot be ruled out. None of the included RCTs showed a statistically significant difference in the occurrence of heart failure. The reason why no significant difference between the treatment groups was identified in these studies could be due to the fact that the number of patients included in these studies was too small to detect a difference between the treatment groups (that is low power). Also, anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is dose-dependent and in some of the studies patients received a relatively low cumulative anthracycline dose. Presently, no definitive conclusions can be made about the efficacy of these cardioprotective interventions in preventing heart damage in patients treated with anthracyclines.</P>
<P>For dexrazoxane, 10 RCTs were identified. It should be emphasised that the majority of the patients included in these studies were adults with advanced breast cancer. Subgroup analyses for children versus adults and leukaemias versus solid tumours were not possible.</P>
<P>Our meta-analysis showed a statistically significant benefit in favour of the use of dexrazoxane for the occurrence of both clinical heart failure and clinical and subclinical heart failure combined (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.32, P &lt; 0.0001 (eight trials, including long-term follow-up data of <LINK REF="STD-Lipshultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lipshultz 2004</LINK>) and RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.41, P &lt; 0.0001 (five trials), respectively). However, an important question regarding any cardioprotective intervention during anthracycline therapy is whether the cardioprotective drug could decrease the heart damage by anthracyclines without reducing the anti-tumour efficacy and without negative effects on toxicities other than cardiac damage. In the original version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2005</LINK>) there was some suggestion that patients treated with dexrazoxane might have a lower response rate (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01, P = 0.06 (five trials)). However, in the updated meta-analysis this was not confirmed. No statistically significant difference in response rate between the dexrazoxane and control group was found (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02, P = 0.08 (six trials)). Furthermore, the value of response rate for predicting survival is not clear (<LINK REF="REF-Odaimi-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odaimi 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pierga-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierga 2001</LINK>). In our meta-analysis of both PFS and OS no significant difference between the dexrazoxane and control group was found, which included the individual study in which a difference in response rate was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Swain-1997a_x0028_088001_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1997a(088001)</LINK>). However, in the meta-analysis of PFS unexplained substantial heterogeneity was detected. For 20 adverse effects (grade 3 or 4) it was possible to perform a meta-analysis (including either two, three or four trials). For thrombocytopenia, abnormal platelet count at nadir, abnormal platelet count at recovery, neutropenia, abnormal granulocyte count at nadir, abnormal granulocyte count at recovery, abnormal white blood cell count at recovery, stomatitis, pain on injection, anorexia, alopecia, phlebitis, diarrhoea, fever, vomiting, neurotoxicity and secondary malignant disease no significant differences between treatment groups were identified. However, in the meta-analyses of both vomiting and neurotoxicity unexplained substantial heterogeneity was detected. For abnormal white blood cell count at nadir (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.29, P = 0.005) and anaemia (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.81, P = 0.01) there were significant differences in favour of the control group; as opposed to the first update of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2008</LINK>) where no significant differences were seen between treatment groups). For nausea a significant difference in favour of dexrazoxane was identified (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94, P = 0.02). For some adverse effects pooling was not possible (see additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). For three adverse effects grade 3 or 4 (that is platelets, infection not otherwise specified or unknown and pulmonary) a significant difference in favour of the control group was identified. For two adverse effects grade 3 or 4 (that is absolute neutrophil count and sepsis) a borderline significant difference in favour of the control group was identified (P = 0.05 and P = 0.06 respectively). For the other adverse effects no significant difference between the treatment groups was observed.</P>
<P>At the moment, despite its clear cardioprotective effects, dexrazoxane is not routinely used in clinical practice. This might be explained by the suspicion of interference with anti-tumour efficacy (that is response rate and survival) and by the occurrence of secondary malignant disease. However, our meta-analyses of anti-tumour efficacy and secondary malignant disease showed no significant difference between patients who were treated with or without dexrazoxane. This latter finding was also identified in a recent publication (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2011</LINK>), a meta-analysis including three of the four randomised trials available on secondary malignancies after dexrazoxane (<LINK REF="REF-Barry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barry 2008</LINK> included in this review; and <LINK REF="STD-Tebbi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tebbi 2007</LINK>, this study includes data on two RCTs including the one by <LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2009</LINK> which was eligible for inclusion in our review), which did not show a significant difference in the occurrence of secondary malignancies between children treated with or without dexrazoxane (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.06 to 22.17, P = 0.92; eight secondary malignancies in the dexrazoxane group and four in the control group). One other trial did not provide enough information to be included in the meta-analysis but showed no statistically significant difference in the 5-year and 10-year cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies between treatment groups (<LINK REF="REF-Salzer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzer 2010</LINK>; this study did not provide data on cardiotoxicity and thus was not eligible for inclusion in our review).<BR/>
</P>
<P>In three of the 10 studies patients in the intervention and control groups received comparable cumulative anthracycline doses. In two studies patients in the dexrazoxane group received a higher cumulative anthracycline dose (100 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or more) than patients in the control group. So despite a higher cumulative anthracycline dose received in the dexrazoxane group there was still a significantly lower rate of cardiotoxicity. In five studies it was unclear if patients in the intervention and control groups received similar cumulative anthracycline doses. If patients in the control group received a higher cumulative anthracycline dose than patients treated with dexrazoxane this could have led to an overestimation of the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (and vice versa). This uncertainty should also be kept in mind when interpreting the results of the secondary outcomes (response rate, survival and adverse effects).</P>
<P>The risk of bias in the included studies varied. In many studies bias could not be ruled out due to lack of reporting. However, at the moment this is the best available evidence on RCTs evaluating dexrazoxane.</P>
<P>In the 10 included studies different ratios of dexrazoxane to anthracyclines were used. We did not analyse the effect of these different ratios on the outcomes.</P>
<P>It should be kept in mind that the inclusion of studies for this systematic review was limited to RCTs describing cardiotoxicity and, as a result, the analyses of response rate, survival, adverse effects and QoL were possibly based on only a subgroup of trials comparing cardioprotective interventions with a control group.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We are awaiting (additional) results of the currently ongoing studies and the studies on the use of the following cardioprotective agents, which await further classification: dexrazoxane (n = 9), valsartan (n = 1), L-carnitine (n = 1), enalapril (n = 1), telmirsartan (n = 1) and the combination hydroprednisone and gluthatione (n = 1).</P>

<P>For these cardioprotective interventions no RCTs were identified and so no conclusions can be made about their efficacy in preventing heart damage in patients treated with anthracyclines.

<P>For these cardioprotective interventions pooling was not possible, so no high quality evidence was available and therefore no definitive conclusions can be made about their efficacy in preventing heart damage in patients treated with anthracyclines. Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to give recommendations for clinical practice.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dexrazoxane</HEADING>
<P>Our meta-analysis clearly showed the efficacy of dexrazoxane in preventing heart damage in patients treated with anthracyclines. No evidence of a lower response rate or a negative effect on PFS and OS was identified. The results for adverse effects are ambiguous. No significant difference in the occurrence of secondary malignant disease was identified. It should be emphasised that the majority of the patients included in these studies were adults with advanced breast cancer.</P>
<P>We conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high, it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines. However, clinicians should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects including secondary malignancies for each individual patient.</P>

<P>No RCTs were identified for these cardioprotective interventions. Therefore, before definitive conclusions can be made about their efficacy in preventing heart damage in patients treated with anthracyclines, high quality RCTs need to be undertaken.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dexrazoxane</HEADING>
<P>Future trials on dexrazoxane should be performed in homogeneous study populations treated for either a haematological malignancy or a solid tumour, with a long-term follow up using valid outcome definitions (including cardiotoxicity, anti-tumour efficacy, survival and adverse effects). Since there is only a small amount of data for children, and also because data obtained in adults cannot be extrapolated to children, dexrazoxane should be further evaluated in children. The number of included patients should be sufficient to obtain the power needed for the results to be reliable. We are awaiting the results of the ongoing studies currently being performed in children. The performance of an individual patient data analysis is another possibility to assess the effect of dexrazoxane on survival.</P>
