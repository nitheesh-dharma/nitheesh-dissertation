<P>We assessed the therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese herbal medicines commonly used in China for acute bronchitis. There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to demonstrate that Chinese medicinal herbs are efficacious in treating acute bronchitis.</P>
<P>We identified 74 studies involving 6877 participants which reported to randomly allocate participants to their treatment groups. However, we did not identify any true RCTs for inclusion. The common reasons for exclusion were a potential high risk of selection bias and conflict of interest. These design limitations resulted in us being unable to draw conclusions on the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for acute bronchitis. In addition, the safety of Chinese medicinal herbs is unknown due to the lack of toxicological evidence, although some adverse events, for example, slight gastrointestinal reactions, skin rash, etc., were reported in some case reports but not in the so called 'random' studies which we excluded. High quality RCTs are needed in the future.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-12-16 15:06:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-12-16 10:49:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary-care physicians (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkwood-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkwood 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsland-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsland 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meza-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meza 1994</LINK>). This condition accounted for approximately 2.5 million visits to physicians in the United States in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Slusarcick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slusarcick 2000</LINK>). It consistently ranks as one of the top 10 diagnoses for which patients seek medical care, with cough being the most frequently mentioned symptom (<LINK REF="REF-Slusarcick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slusarcick 2000</LINK>). During each episode, patients receive an average of two prescriptions and miss two to three days of work (<LINK REF="REF-Oeffinger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oeffinger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Viruses are the most common cause of the bronchial inflammation associated with acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults. Only a small proportion of acute bronchitis infections are caused by non-viral agents, with the most common organism being <I>Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mogabgab-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogabgab 1968</LINK>). Study findings suggest that <I>Chlamydia pneumoniae</I> (<I>C. pneumoniae</I>) may also cause acute bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Falck-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hahn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 1991</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-06-10 18:56:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotics are the common therapy offered to patients with acute bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-William-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">William 1998</LINK>). However, evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics over placebo is of modest benefit only (<LINK REF="REF-Fahey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fahey 2004</LINK>). Symptomatic treatments have even less evidence, and include antitussives for cough; expectorants for sputum too viscous to expectorate; bronchodilators for cough associated with any associated asthma; and antipyretic analgesics for fever.</P>
<P>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) follows a particular theoretical and methodological pathway to look at the cause concept, diagnosis and treatment of an illness. Chinese medicinal herbs are made from natural plants and the typical TCM method is based on using several herbs to treat the disease. Depending on the symptoms or causes, specific herbs are selected using a particular method, to create a formulation of multiple, active ingredients. In recent decades more and more clinical doctors are following TCM practices to integrate traditional medicine with Western medicine, particularly in terms of diagnostic, aetiological and treatment theories.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-12-16 15:06:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Depending on the symptoms or causes, various medicinal herbs are used for treating acute bronchitis. In China, Chinese herbs are generally considered to be effective and are commonly prescribed by physicians for patients with acute bronchitis. Some Chinese herbs are considered to have antiviral, antiasthmatic, antitussive and fever-relieving properties. In pharmacological experiments, radix scutellariae has been shown to have antiphlogistic properties (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1990</LINK>); radix glycyrrhizae has expectorant properties (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 1976</LINK>); and folium perillae has antitussive properties (<LINK REF="REF-Yu-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 1986</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-12-16 10:51:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Natural medicinal herbs are a potential drug resource. The effects of any medicinal herb need to be studied systematically. Every year in China hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on treating acute bronchitis. In the United States the evaluation and treatment of this illness is estimated to cost between USD 200 million and USD 300 million annually (<LINK REF="REF-Dunlay-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunlay 1984</LINK>). Therefore, a systematic review of the evidence as to whether or not these medicinal herbs are effective, can be a helpful tool when making health policy decisions.</P>

<P>We had planned for two review authors (LJ, TW) to independently assess the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We planned to assess the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We planned to assess the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We planned to assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>

<P>We planned to assess the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We judged studies at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We planned to assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We planned to assess the methods as:</P>

<P>We planned to assess each study and each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We planned to state whether attrition and exclusions were reported; the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants); reasons for attrition or exclusion (where reported); and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook.

<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. the rate of exclusion was at least 20%; missing data imbalanced across groups; 'as treated analysis' done with substantial departure from intervention received compared to that assigned at randomisation); and</LI>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-21 14:22:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since there is no gold standard test, the diagnosis for acute bronchitis must be based on clinical assessment. Both <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2008</LINK> included participants with a recent onset of a respiratory illness with productive cough and fever and excluded participants with chronic pulmonary disease. Clinical characteristics of the enrolled participants varied but were consistent with the variety of similar definitions generally used by primary physicians. Therefore, these results would appear to be generalised to the management of acute bronchitis in community practices.</P>
<P>Although 74 studies were reported as RCTs by the trial authors, none of them met the inclusion criteria of this review. Out of the 74 trials, 39 were identified as non-RCTs and 35 compared different Chinese herbal medicines in the intervention and control groups.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-12-21 14:23:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was no evidence from RCTs of Chinese herbal medicines for acute bronchitis. However, the majority of studies considered for inclusion did not give adequate methodological information, which is a common phenomenon in Chinese journal articles (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>). In this updated review, we clarified the reliability of the randomisation allocation procedure used in each trial. We achieved this by interviewing the original authors of the studies which mentioned 'randomly allocated participants' in the text. As a result, we found that all of the trials did not use true randomisation methods.</P>
<P>In addition to the limitations of the lack of description of the randomisation and allocation concealment, a number of studies showed the following typical methodological limitations presented in some TCM studies published in Chinese journals.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Use of a 'positive drug' as the control: aimed to clarify that the experimental intervention had the same effect as the control, but most of these control drugs lack evidence of effect. For example, in the excluded study <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2008</LINK> we searched the databases and found that there was no evidence about the Chinese medicine Piba Zhike granules. Therefore we were unable to provide evidence for the Chinese medicine Ji Zhi granules. Similarly, the evidence of penicillin combined with the Chinese medicine Xiaoer Shangfeng Zhike syrup used in the control group of study <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK> has not been found. The effect of the control drug should be tested a priori comparing it with the placebo. However, we were unable to find any such evidence of this.</LI>
<LI>In <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>, the effect of the Chinese medicine Huoke granule was much better than the penicillin plus Chinese medicine Xiaoer Shangfeng Zhike syrup (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.60). However, the time point of detection of the outcomes was unclear. Therefore, the effect was questionable.</LI>
<LI>Conflict of interest: most drugs tested for effectiveness were prepared, or suggested, or made by the trial authors themselves. For example, Huoke granule was made by the authors' hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>). Therefore there was a high risk of bias in terms of conflict of interest.</LI>
<LI>Blinding for avoiding detection bias in assessment of some outcomes is very important, particularly for the objective outcomes, for example, change of symptoms and subject reports of how the participants felt. All of the outcomes in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2008</LINK> were objective outcomes, but as blinding was not used to detect the results, there was a high risk of detection bias.</LI>
<LI>The sample size problem: some studies, for example <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2008</LINK> included 433 participants, but included three different diseases (acute bronchitis, acute onset of chronic bronchitis and cough). Only 142 participants suffered from acute bronchitis. Whether the power is sufficient or not is unclear due to the changed sample size.</LI>
<LI>The effect of most TCMs was tested in one study only.</LI>
<LI>Most of the studies were conducted in lower level hospitals or smaller clinics. This means that most of the trials did not receive ethical approval and therefore may not be true trials, but rather analysis reports from case notes.</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-12-16 13:49:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a widespread belief among Chinese clinicians and patients that Chinese medicinal herbs are effective in improving signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis. Due to the absence of RCTs in this field, we were unable to draw a conclusion for recommendation. We suggest that additional, well-designed RCTs with adequate power to provide a definitive answer, need to be conducted. For many Chinese researchers, allocation concealment should be emphasised and the approaches should be reported clearly. The randomisation procedure should also be clearly described. Blinding should be conducted in trials on Chinese medicinal herbs, though this may be difficult. Studies should emphasise adverse effects, and more toxicological research on Chinese medicinal herbs should be conducted, which would provide important information for clinicians. The consolidated standards for reporting trials (CONSORT) for TCM is recommended as the standard for reporting TCM trials (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>).</P>
