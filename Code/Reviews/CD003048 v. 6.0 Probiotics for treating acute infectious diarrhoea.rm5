<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-04 10:21:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Episodes of acute infectious diarrhoea remain a major disease burden throughout the world, especially in developing countries. They are due to infection by many different organisms. Most episodes are self-limiting and usually investigations are not done to identify the infectious agent. The main risk to health is dehydration and management aims to improve and maintain hydration status. However, rehydration fluids do not reduce the stool volume or shorten the episode of diarrhoea. Probiotics are "friendly" bacteria that improve health and are not harmful in themselves. A number of randomized controlled trials have been done to see whether probiotics are beneficial in acute infectious diarrhoea. We have searched for as many of these trials as possible and collected together the data in a systematic way to try to discover whether or not probiotics are beneficial in acute diarrhoea. We identified 63 trials, which included a total of 8014 people - mainly infants and children. Probiotics were not associated with any adverse effects. Nearly all studies reported a shortened duration of diarrhoea and reduced stool frequency in people who received probiotics compared to the controls. Overall, probiotics reduced the duration of diarrhoea by around 25 hours, the risk of diarrhoea lasting four or more days by 59% and resulted in about one fewer diarrhoeal stool on day 2 after the intervention. However, there was very marked variability in the study findings and so these estimates are approximate. We concluded that these results were very encouraging but more research is needed to identify exactly which probiotics should be used for which groups of people, and also to assess the cost effectiveness of this treatment.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Definition</HEADING>
<P>Diarrhoea is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as three or more loose or watery stools (taking the shape of the container) in a 24-hour period. Diarrhoea is acute if the illness started less than 14 days previously, and persistent if the episode has lasted 14 days or more (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1988</LINK>). Normal infants who are exclusively breast fed may pass loose, "pasty" stools frequently. In this group the definition is usually based on what the mother considers to be diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>). Infectious diarrhoea is an episode of diarrhoea that is caused by an infectious agent.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Incidence and disease burden</HEADING>
<P>Infectious diarrhoea occurs much more commonly in developing countries than industrialized countries (<LINK REF="REF-Guerrant-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guerrant 1990</LINK>). Attack rates in developing countries are typically six to 12 episodes per child per year, compared with two in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Savarino-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savarino 1993</LINK>). In a systematic analysis of population health data available for 2001, diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 1.78 million deaths (3.7% of total deaths) in low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2006</LINK>). Most of these deaths occur in children under five years of age. Although 50% or more children with diarrhoea receive oral rehydration therapy and continued feeding in only six of 60 priority countries, and only seven countries include zinc in diarrhoeal management (<LINK REF="REF-Bryce-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryce 2006</LINK>), diarrhoeal deaths have reduced in this age group. However, diarrhoea still accounted for about 1.6 million deaths in 2001 (15% of all deaths in the under fives; <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2006</LINK>). In industrialized countries deaths from infectious diarrhoea occur mainly in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Savarino-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savarino 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Causes</HEADING>
<P>More than 20 viruses, bacteria and parasites are associated with acute diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Gadewar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gadewar 2005</LINK>). Worldwide, rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea and diarrhoea mortality in children (<LINK REF="REF-Cunliffe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunliffe 1998</LINK>). Other important viral pathogens are astrovirus, human caliciviruses (norovirus and sapovirus) and enteric adenoviruses. Important bacterial pathogens are diarrheogenic <I>Escherichia coli</I>, <I>Salmonella</I>, <I>Shigella</I>, <I>Yersinia</I>, <I>Campylobacter</I>, and <I>Vibrio cholerae</I>. The main parasitic causes of diarrhoea are <I>Cryptosporidium</I> and <I>Giardia </I>(reviewed by <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Ryan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Ryan 2005</LINK>). An aetiological study of young children attending hospitals in China, India, Mexico, Myanmar, and Pakistan showed that rotavirus, enterotoxigenic <I>E. coli</I> and <I>Shigella </I>spp. were the most commonly isolated pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-Huilan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huilan 1991</LINK>). Acute diarrhoea is frequent among travellers, in whom enterotoxigenic <I>E. coli</I> is particularly common (<LINK REF="REF-Black-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1986</LINK>). In practice, most episodes of acute diarrhoea that are assumed to be caused by an infectious agent are treated without the causative agent being identified. The major causes of acute infectious diarrhoea differ according to local factors, such as availability of clean water and sanitation. In contrast with acute infectious diarrhoea, infection is likely to be only one of several factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of persistent diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Walker_x002d_Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker-Smith 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>The aim of treatment is to prevent or reverse dehydration, shorten the duration of the illness (important for preventing progression to persistent diarrhoea, which is associated with adverse outcomes such as malnutrition), and to reduce the period that a person is infectious. Treatment options available are oral rehydration solution, antibiotics, and gut motility-suppressing agents such as loperamide, codeine, and probiotics. This review considers the use of probiotics only.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Probiotics</HEADING>
<P>Probiotics have been defined as microbial cell preparations or components of microbial cells that have a beneficial effect on the health and well-being of the host (<LINK REF="REF-Salminen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salminen 1999</LINK>). Although organisms used in clinical trials may not have a proven health benefit for the indication being investigated, we have used the term "probiotic" in this review for simplicity. Fermenting foods to enhance their taste and nutritional value is an ancient and widespread practice. Well-known probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria and the yeast <I>Saccharomyces</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Naidu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naidu 1999</LINK>). The taxonomy of the lactic acid bacteria relied traditionally on their phenotypic characteristics. Modern molecular techniques have shown these to be unreliable, and polyphasic taxonomy using both phenotypical and molecular techniques is now recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1998</LINK>). Even closely related probiotic strains can have different clinical effects, and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and WHO expert consultation committee have emphasized that the beneficial effects observed in one strain cannot be assumed to occur in other strains (<LINK REF="REF-FAO_x002f_WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">FAO/WHO 2001</LINK>). This implies that the reliable identification of organisms at the strain level is necessary for clinical studies.</P>
<P>The rationale for using probiotics in infectious diarrhoea is that they act against enteric pathogens by competing for available nutrients and binding sites, making the gut contents acid, producing a variety of chemicals, and increasing specific and non-specific immune responses (<LINK REF="REF-Gismondo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gismondo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vanderhoof-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanderhoof 1998</LINK>). No serious adverse effects of probiotics have been suggested in well people, but rarely, infections have been reported in people with impaired immune systems or indwelling catheters (<LINK REF="REF-Hata-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hata 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piarroux-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piarroux 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salminen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salminen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saxelin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saxelin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sussman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sussman 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six systematic reviews of probiotics in acute diarrhoea have been published. <LINK REF="REF-Szajewska-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szajewska 2001</LINK> included only published, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind studies of acute diarrhoea lasting three or more days in infants and children. A score was used to assess the methodological quality of these trials. The effects of all probiotics and individual strains were analysed. The risk of diarrhoea lasting three or more days was reduced by 0.40 in the probiotic compared with the placebo group (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.57, random-effects model, eight trials including 731 children), and probiotics reduced the duration of diarrhoea by 18.2 hours (95% CI 9.5 to 26.9 hours, random-effects model, eight trials including 773 children). The statistically significant heterogeneity in this result was resolved when one study, which employed a mixture of three probiotic organisms, was excluded. <I>Lactobacillus</I> GG was thought to be particularly effective in rotavirus diarrhoea.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis undertaken by <LINK REF="REF-Van-Niel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Niel 2002</LINK> was restricted to adequately randomized and blinded studies of several strains of lactobacilli in children. Children who had received recent antibiotics were excluded from the study. Probiotics reduced the duration of diarrhoea by 0.7 days (95% CI 0.3 to 1.2 days, seven studies including 675 children) and diarrhoea frequency on day 2 by 1.6 (95% CI 0.7 to 2.6, three studies including 122 children). The heterogeneity of results among the studies prevented an analysis of the effects of individual strains of lactobacilli.</P>
<P>Three meta-analyses have focused on randomized controlled trials of specific probiotics in acute infectious diarrhoea in children. <LINK REF="REF-Szajewska-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szajewska 2007a</LINK> analysed trials of <I>Lactobacillus casei</I> strain GG where a &gt; 80% follow up was achieved. Trial results published as letters to the editor, abstracts, and proceedings from scientific meetings were not included. <I>L.casei</I> GG reduced the duration of diarrhoea by 1.1 days (95% CI 0.3 to 1.9, seven trials, 876 infants) and was particularly effective in rotavirus diarrhoea (duration reduced by 2.1 days, 95% CI 0.6 to 3.6). However, the authors urged caution in the interpretation of the results in view of methodological limitations in the trials and the heterogeneity of the results in the studies. <LINK REF="REF-Chmielewska-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chmielewska 2008</LINK> identified two trials of <I>Lactobacillus reuteri </I>strain ATTCC 55730. This probiotic reduced the duration of diarrhoea by 22 hours (95% CI 6 to 38, 106 participants). In an update of a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Szajewska-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szajewska 2007b</LINK>), <LINK REF="REF-Szajewska-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szajewska 2009</LINK> pooled data from seven randomized controlled trials of <I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I> in 944 otherwise healthy children with acute gastroenteritis. The duration of diarrhoea was reduced by 1.08 days (95% CI 0.53 to 1.64) in children who received the yeast compared with the placebo although there was marked heterogeneity in results among the studies.</P>
<P>A recent review concluded that the beneficial effects of probiotics in acute infectious diarrhoea were dependent on the strain of bacteria and the dose (a greater effect with doses &gt;10<SUP>10</SUP>-10<SUP>11</SUP> colony-forming units (CFU)/day). They were significant in watery diarrhoea and viral gastroenteritis but absent in invasive bacterial diarrhoea, and were greater when probiotics were administered early in the illness and were more evident in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Wolvers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolvers 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our review aims to assess the evidence base to inform the use of probiotics in acute infectious diarrhoea. To maximize use of available data, we included participants of all ages, unpublished studies, and non-blinded (open) studies. We assessed the relevant methodological aspects of trials individually (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 1999</LINK>). These were the generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and loss to follow up. To maximize the relevance of our findings for clinical practice we included studies in which participants with infectious diarrhoea had received antibiotics prior to recruitment.</P>
<P>For primary outcomes, we chose the duration of diarrhoea and diarrhoea lasting &#8805; 4 days, as these are directly relevant to the development of persistent diarrhoea, and stool frequency on day 2 after intervention as a marker of diarrhoea severity.</P>
<P>This review is a substantial update of the original version, first published in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>We have attempted to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress). Searches of all databases was done on 1 July 2010.</P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's trials register using the search terms: diarrhea/; diarr$(tw); diarhea(tw); probiotic(tw); Lactobacill$(tw); Lactococc$(tw); Bifidobacter$(tw); Enterococc$(tw); Streptococc$(tw); Saccharomyces(tw). Full details of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's methods and the journals handsearched are published in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>in the section on 'Collaborative Review Groups'.</P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register published on <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(Issue 2, 2010) using the search terms: diarrhea/; diarr$(tw); diarhea(tw); probiotic(tw); Lactobacill$(tw); Lactococc$(tw); Bifidobacter$(tw); Enterococc$(tw); Streptococc$(tw); Saccharomyces(tw).</P>
<P>We searched MEDLINE (1966 to 2010) and EMBASE (1988 to 2010 using the search strategy defined by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>) and following search terms: diarrhea/; diarr$(tw); diarhea(tw); probiotic(tw); Lactobacill$(tw); Lactococc$(tw); Bifidobacter$(tw); Enterococc$(tw); Streptococc$(tw); Saccharomyces(tw).</P>
<P>The detailed search strategy is shown in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>In preparation for the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2003</LINK>), we contacted organizations and individuals working in the field, and the following pharmaceutical companies that manufacture probiotic agents to help identify additional published trials and unpublished data: Biogaia Biologicals, Lund, Sweden; Nestle Foundation, Lausanne, Switzerland; Probiotics International Ltd, Somerset, UK; Ross Products Division of Abbott Laboratories, Ohio, USA, and Yakult, London, UK. We have not re-contacted individuals or companies for this update.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>SA and LD independently reviewed the titles of articles and, where available, abstracts generated by the search to identify potentially relevant studies. All articles that could meet the inclusion criteria as identified by either of the reviewers were selected and the full article reviewed. Eligibility was assessed independently by SA and LD using a form based on the information presented in the article. We planned to contact trial authors if eligibility was unclear. Discrepancies among reviewers' eligibility assessments were resolved by discussion. Trial reports were scrutinized to ensure that multiple publications from the same trial were included only once. Excluded studies and the reasons for their exclusion were listed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Two reviewers (EM, GG), blinded to the origin of the articles, independently assessed the methodological quality of identified studies using generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and loss to follow up, and we recorded this information on a standard form.</P>
<P>We considered the generation of allocation sequence to be adequate if the study authors stated that they used a method resulting in unpredictable sequences (such as a random number table or list or computer-generated random numbers), unclear if a trial was stated to be randomized but no further information was provided and inadequate where allocation could be related to prognosis and therefore introduced selection bias (for example, the date of birth or date of admission to hospital).</P>
<P>We considered allocation concealment to be adequate if the assignment to arms of the study could not be predicted by the investigators or participants (for example, central randomization or numbered, identical drug containers), unclear if the method used to achieve concealment was not described or inadequate<I> </I>if they used a method such as alternation where the allocation of participants could be predicted.</P>
<P>We considered blinding to be adequate when studies were double blind (when an identical placebo was used and recruitment to intervention or control arms was not known by either the investigator or the participants), unclear if methods of blinding were not described adequately, and inadequate when blinding was not used or where the authors stated that unblinding had occurred.</P>
<P>We considered loss to follow up to be adequate when study endpoints were presented for 90% or more of the participants enrolled at the beginning, inadequate when follow up was less than this and unclear when either or both the number of participants recruited at the beginning of the study and the number of participants who completed the study were not clear.</P>
<P>LD resolved disagreements regarding the assessment of methodological quality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>SA, BO, SP, and SA independently extracted data using standard forms. Key data items were the aetiology and duration of diarrhoea, details of probiotic organism, participants' characteristics (nutritional and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status), location (countries classified according to mortality stratum; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>), and the outcome measures listed above. The number of participants recruited and the number for whom outcome data was reported were extracted and included in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the number of participants experiencing the event, and the total number of participants in each intervention group was extracted. For continuous outcomes, arithmetic means, standard deviations (SD), and the numbers of participants in each intervention group was extracted. SDs were calculated from 95% CI and standard errors, where these were reported. The findings of trials that presented data that could not be included in pooled analyses (eg median and inter-quartile range (IQR)), or reported outcomes other than the primary and secondary outcomes employed in this review were reported in the text.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>We pooled data from studies that used comparable outcome measures. For the duration of diarrhoea and number of stools per day of intervention, we achieved a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the weighted mean difference. For the number of participants with diarrhoea lasting 3 days or more, or 4 days or more after starting the intervention, we calculated a pooled estimate of the relative risk (RR) among probiotic and non-probiotic groups.</P>
<P>We reported the proportion of participants for whom outcome data were available in a 'Risk of bias' table for each study. We performed analyses according to the intention-to-treat principle using an available case analysis approach.</P>
<P>Where there was significant heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.1) in outcomes across studies assessed by the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test a random-effects model was used; otherwise a fixed-effect approach was taken.</P>
<P>We inspected the forest plots to detect non-overlapping CIs, applied the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and also implemented the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (with a value of &#8805; 50%) to assess heterogeneity in findings. Where there was significant statistical heterogeneity in primary outcomes for the probiotic versus no probiotic group comparisons, we conducted sensitivity analyses according to each of the four parameters of trial methodological quality (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>We proceeded to pool data for meta-analysis to provide a qualitative assessment of probiotic effect as a guide to clinical practice.</P>
<P>We expected that heterogeneity in results among studies would result from clinical diversity, including differences in probiotic(s) used, dose of organisms, types of participants, causes and severity of diarrhoea and the socioeconomic status of countries where the studies were undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Wolvers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolvers 2010</LINK>). Therefore, where there were results for a diarrhoea outcome available from three or more studies we conducted subgroup analyses according to the:</P>
<UL>
<LI>probiotic strain; single probiotic organisms versus combinations of two or more organisms, dose of live organisms (high dose [&gt; 10<SUP>10 </SUP>CFU/day] versus lower dose [&#8804;10<SUP>10 </SUP>CFU/day]); killed organisms;</LI>
<LI>age of participants;</LI>
<LI>identified diarrhoeal pathogens (rotavirus, bacterial diarrhoea);</LI>
<LI>severity of diarrhoea according to whether the participants were likely to have had mild diarrhoea and were, therefore, managed as outpatients;</LI>
<LI>mortality stratum for children and adults in the country or countries where the trial was undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>) to account for regional differences in major diarrhoeal pathogens and diarrhoea severity related to the availability of clean water and level of sanitation. To facilitate meta-analysis, countries were divided into two groups according to whether either child or adult mortality, or both, was classified as high.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Finally, we inspected funnel plots for the primary outcomes to assess publication bias. </P>

<P>Our search identified 120 potentially relevant studies. Of these, 63 met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 57 studies were excluded, including five that were preliminary or duplicate reports of other included studies (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Eligibility regarding inclusion in this review was clear for all studies and clarification from trial authors was not required. We have not been able to locate the reports of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Contreras-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Contreras 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salgado" TYPE="STUDY">Salgado</LINK>) and one study is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Freedman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 2010</LINK>).

<P>Of the 63 included studies, 23 were published in the 1980s-1990s, 37 between 2000-2009 and two in 2010; one study was unpublished.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study location</HEADING>
<P>According to country mortality strata for children/adults (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>), 41 trials were undertaken in countries where both child and adult mortality was classified as low or very low and 19 where either child or adult mortality was high. Two international studies recruited participants from countries crossing the mortality strata (<LINK REF="STD-Guandalini-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Guandalini 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jasinski-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jasinski 2002</LINK>). Finally, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2010</LINK> was undertaken in Australia (very low child and low adult mortality) but recruited Aboriginal children who commonly had co-morbidities such as pneumonia and malnutrition related to poverty and social disadvantage in the top end of the Northern Territory. Therefore, data from this study were not included in analysis according to country mortality strata.</P>
<P>A total of 47 studies were conducted in a single centre; 15 recruited participants from two to 150 centres. The number of recruitment centres was unclear in one study (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Apuzzo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">D'Apuzzo 1982</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The 63 selected studies recruited a total of 8014 participants. There were 6489 infants and children (age &lt; 18 years) and 352 adults. In three studies (1173 participants) the exact ages of participants was not clear: <LINK REF="STD-Bruno-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bruno 1983</LINK> studied participants aged 14 years and above, participants in <LINK REF="STD-Wunderlich-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wunderlich 1989</LINK> had a mean age of 33 years (age range not stated) and the age of the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Frigerio-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Frigerio 1986</LINK> was not stated.</P>
<P>Forty-four studies recruited inpatients, seven recruited outpatients and seven recruited both inpatients and outpatients. It was unclear in five studies whether the participants were inpatients or outpatients.</P>
<P>Although all studies recruited participants with acute diarrhoea, the criteria for acute diarrhoea varied considerably among studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Descriptions of stool consistency included watery, loose or liquid stools, or both, semi-liquid, increased fluidity, pasty, mucousy or non-formed in 46 studies but no description was stated in 17 studies. The minimum number of stools/day was specified in 36 studies; this ranged from &#8805;one to &#8805; five stools with the most commonly used criteria being &#8805; three (16 studies) and &#8805;four stools in 24 hours (13 studies). One study specified stool frequency as at least twice normal frequency, one as increased frequency and in one study stool consistency was taken into account. The minimum number of stools was not specified in 24 studies. The maximum duration of diarrhoea at recruitment was specified in 40 studies and varied between one and 14 days. The maximum diarrhoea duration was not specified in 23 studies.</P>
<P>Similarly, criteria used for the end of the diarrhoeal episode varied markedly among studies. The last liquid or watery stool (nine studies) and first normal stool (seven studies) were the most common. Twenty-one studies used a variety of criteria based on stool frequency and consistency in a specified period (eg first formed stool if followed by two consecutive non-watery stools or 12 hours without evacuation; <LINK REF="STD-Mao-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mao 2008</LINK>). Four studies also included the resolution of associated symptoms (eg &lt; two stools/day, formed, yellow/brown stools without mucus and no abdominal pains, vomiting, or fever for the whole day; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Apuzzo-1982" TYPE="STUDY">D'Apuzzo 1982</LINK>). Criteria were not stated in 17 studies.</P>
<P>Eighteen studies were either restricted to children with rotavirus diarrhoea or reported outcomes for a subgroup of children with rotavirus diarrhoea. Children with rotavirus diarrhoea were excluded in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lievin-Le_x002d_Maol-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lievin Le-Maol 2007</LINK>). Ten studies stated that participants with bloody diarrhoea were included whereas these were excluded in 32 studies. It was unclear whether participants with bloody diarrhoea were included in 21 studies. No study specifically recruited or excluded travellers, and none identified any of the participants as suffering from travellers' diarrhoea.</P>
<P>No study specifically recruited participants known to have HIV infection and no study stated HIV positivity as an exclusion criterion, but many excluded participants with chronic illness or immunosuppression, or both.</P>
<P>Nutritional status was reported in 35 studies, all undertaken in children. Ten studies either recruited malnourished children only or included malnourished children; 20 studies excluded severe malnutrition; five studies recruited well-nourished children only or excluded those with a chronic illness.</P>
<P>Twenty-six studies excluded participants who had received antibiotic treatment before recruitment, eight included participants who had received antibiotic treatment before recruitment and this information was unclear in 29 studies.</P>
<P>The hydration status of the participants was reported in 35 studies; 22 studies included participants with severe dehydration whereas 10 studies recruited only children with mild or moderate dehydration.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Many different probiotics were tested. Most studies tested live preparations of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria. Several studies identified the probiotic organisms only by the species name without specific identification details such as a culture collection number. Few studies undertook analyses to confirm the identity or viability of the organism(s).</P>
<P>Forty-six studies tested a single organism and 17 tested combinations of between two to eight organisms.<I> </I>The most common organisms evaluated were <I>L. casei</I> strain GG (13 studies), <I>S. boulardii</I> (10 studies) and <I>Enterococcus</I> lactic acid bacteria (LAB) SF68 (five studies). All other organisms and all combinations were tested in three or fewer studies. <LINK REF="STD-Canani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Canani 2007</LINK> allocated children to one of five different probiotic regimens and compared outcomes with a single control group. For the purposes of this review, we selected the <I>L. casei GG</I> group for inclusion because several other studies tested this probiotic and we wanted to maximize the data available for meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Grandi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Grandi 2009</LINK> allocated children either to a single organism or a four-organism group and compared outcomes with a single control group. No data extractable for meta-analysis were reported in this study.</P>
<P>Forty-seven studies tested live organisms, five studies tested a killed probiotic preparation (<LINK REF="STD-Billoo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Billoo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boulloche-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Boulloche 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lievin-Le_x002d_Maol-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lievin Le-Maol 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simakachorn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simakachorn 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khanna--2005" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 2005</LINK>), and one a pasteurized yogurt (<LINK REF="STD-Pashapour-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pashapour 2006</LINK>). The viability of the organisms was unclear in 10 studies.</P>
<P>Three studies compared different dosages (number of organisms) of the same probiotic (<LINK REF="STD-Basu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Basu 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mao-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mao 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shornikova-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Shornikova 1997b</LINK>) with a single control group. We selected the higher probiotic dose group for inclusion in the review but have included results from the lower dose group in the text. Overall, 15 studies used a high dose of organisms (&gt; 10<SUP>10 </SUP>CFU/day), 26 used a low dose (&#8804; 10<SUP>10 </SUP>CFU/day) and the dose was unclear in 22 studies.</P>
<P>As well as differences in dose or organisms, there was a wide variation in the treatment regimens according to timing of intervention, means of administration and duration of treatment. Probiotics were administered directly to the participants or mixed with a variety of fluids and foods. Although expressed breast milk was used to administer probiotics in some studies, some studies excluded exclusively breast-fed infants to minimize the interruption of normal feeding.</P>
<P>Forty-three studies used a placebo in the no probiotic control group; the remaining studies managed participants according to usual clinical practice.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The forest plots demonstrate that probiotics reduce the duration of diarrhoea. Values for duration of diarrhoea in the control arm varied widely, from 39.1 to 173.5 hours, and the difference between the intervention groups ranged from -79.2 to 7.0 hours (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Similar variability was evident in the other outcomes. Despite the high level of quantitative heterogeneity, the pattern was striking, and meta-analysis shows an important effect which is statistically significant. Using a random effects approach, probiotics reduced the mean duration of diarrhoea (mean difference 24.76 hours; 95% confidence interval 15.9 to 33.6 hours; n=4555, trials=35; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), diarrhoea lasting &#8805;4 days (risk ratio 0.41; 0.32 to 0.53; n=2853, trials=29; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) and stool frequency on day 2 (mean difference 0.80; 0.45 to 1.14; n=2751, trials=20; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The differences in these analyses are an average across all studies with quantitative heterogeneity, demonstrating that probiotics have a substantive and significant effect, rather than being a  precise estimate of the size of the effect.</P>
<P>The funnel plots for the primary outcomes (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) did not indicate publication bias as the largest intervention effects were observed in studies with a large number of participants as well as smaller studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The findings for diarrhoea lasting &#8805; 3days (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) and stool frequency on day 3 after intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) were broadly similar to the primary outcomes and there was also marked statistical heterogeneity among studies.</P>
<P>Seven studies reported diarrhoea outcomes data that could not be included in analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Billoo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Billoo 2006</LINK> evaluated <I>S. boulardii</I> in infants and children admitted with acute watery diarrhoea of mild to moderate severity in Pakistan. The mean duration of diarrhoea was reduced in the probiotic compared with the control group (n = 50, 86.4 hours versus n = 50, 115.2 hours, respectively; P = 0.001). Stool frequency on days 3 (P = 0.01) and 6 (P = 0.001) was also reduced in the probiotic group. <LINK REF="STD-Czerwionka-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Czerwionka 2009</LINK> evaluated <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus </I>in children with acute diarrhoea in Poland. The total number of stools per child was statistically significantly lower in the probiotic group than the controls. <LINK REF="STD-Misra-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 2009</LINK> evaluated <I>L. rhamnosus </I>GG in children in India. The mean duration of diarrhoea was 70.6 hours in the probiotic and 78.0 hours in the control group (P = 0.20).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Grandi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Grandi 2009</LINK> allocated young children admitted with acute rotavirus diarrhoea to receive either oral rehydration fluid (ORF) + <I>S. boulardii</I>, ORF + <I>Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum </I>and<I> S. boulardii, </I>or<I> </I>ORF alone (control group). The median duration of diarrhoea was shorter in both of the probiotic groups compared with the controls but this was statistically significant only for <I>S. boulardii</I> (58 hours versus 84.5 hours, respectively; P = 0.04).</P>
<P>In a short abstract, <LINK REF="STD-Frigerio-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Frigerio 1986</LINK> reported that the duration of diarrhoea was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.01) among 540 patients with an acute diarrhoeal disorder attending hospitals in Italy who received <I>Enterococcus</I> LAB SF 68 compared with 534 who received a placebo.</P>
<P>In a further study, <LINK REF="STD-Sepp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sepp 1995 </LINK>evaluated adding <I>L. casei </I>GG to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, compared to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole alone, in children with acute diarrhoea caused by <I>shigellosis</I> in Estonia. The duration of diarrhoea was similar in the probiotic (median 0.5 days) and the control group (1 day; not statistically significant). Also, the proportion of children with ongoing diarrhoea on day 5 was similar in the probiotic and control groups (6/13 (46.3%) versus 9/12 (75.0%); not statistically significant). However, a greater proportion was cured in the probiotic than the control group on day 10 (P &lt; 0.05). Finally, in an open study, <LINK REF="STD-T_x00e1_borsk_x00e1_-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Táborská 1997</LINK> evaluated live <I>L. acidophilus</I> ND in infants and children admitted with acute gastroenteritis in the Czech Republic.

<P>When analysis was restricted to trials assessed to be adequate for the four criteria of study quality (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>), highly statistically significant between-study heterogeneity persisted (forest plots not shown (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).

<P>In addition to the methodological quality of studies as a potential source of heterogeneity in the primary outcomes, we explored other prespecified factors in subgroup analyses where outcomes were reported in three or more studies (probiotic strain: <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>; single organism versus combinations: <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>; live versus killed organisms: <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>; dose or organisms: <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>; children with rotavirus diarrhoea: <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>; severity of diarrhoea: <LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK> and, finally, mortality stratum for children and adults in the countries where the studies were undertaken: <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-009.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-009.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.3</LINK>). With few exceptions, the magnitude of probiotic effect on diarrhoea outcomes was similar to that for all trials and marked heterogeneity in results persisted in the sub-group analyses.</P>
<P>In three of the sub-group analyses of trials that reported mean stool frequency on day 2, the magnitude of the effect in the intervention group was similar to that for all trials but there was greater consistency in the findings. This occurred in six trials (1335 participants) that assessed <I>L. casei</I> strain GG (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>), eight trials (861 participants) that used a high dose of live organisms (&gt; 10<SUP>10</SUP> organisms/day; <LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>) and three trials (164 participants) of children with rotavirus diarrhoea (<LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>). However, marked heterogeneity persisted in the corresponding sub-group analyses that reported the other primary diarrhoea outcomes (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK> respectively). Therefore, the significance of the greater consistency in the sub-group analyses reporting mean stool frequency on day 2 is unclear.</P>
<P>The sub-group analysis according to diarrhoea severity suggested that probiotics resulted in a greater reduction in mean duration of diarrhoea in mild diarrhoea (studies of out-patients) than in more severe diarrhoea (inpatients; <LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>). However, marked heterogeneity in findings persisted and, therefore, the significance of this finding is unclear.</P>
<P>Finally, probiotics appeared to be less effective in reducing mean stool frequency on day 2 in countries with high child and adult mortality rates compared with those with low or very low mortality rates (<LINK REF="CMP-009.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.3</LINK>). However, marked heterogeneity persisted and probiotic effects were similar in both settings for the other diarrhoea outcomes (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-009.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>On balance, we found no clear evidence that stratification according to the sub-groups modified probiotic effect.</P>
<P>Several studies reported findings relevant to the subgroup analyses that could not be included in the analyses.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Canani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Canani 2007</LINK> reported a statistically significantly reduced mean duration of diarrhoea for three different probiotics (live <I>L. casei</I> strain GG (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), a combination of live <I>Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus</I> and <I>Bacillus bifidum,</I> and <I>S. boulardii</I>)<I> </I>compared with controls but there was no effect of live <I>Enterococcus faecium</I> SF68 or live <I>Bacillus clausii </I>strains O/C84, N/R84, T84, SIN84.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Grandi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Grandi 2009</LINK> allocated children with rotavirus diarrhoea to either an <I>S. boulardii </I>group<I> </I>or a group treated with a combination of four organisms (<I>L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, B. longum </I>and<I> S. boulardii). </I>The median duration of diarrhoea was shorter in both of the probiotic groups compared with the controls, but this was statistically significant only for <I>S. boulardii</I> (58 hours versus 84.5 hours, respectively; P = 0.04).</P>
<P>Three studies directly compared different doses of the same probiotic preparation in infants and children, most of whom had rotavirus diarrhoea. <LINK REF="STD-Mao-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mao 2008</LINK> evaluated two dose levels of a combination of <I>Bifidobacterium lactis</I> B12 and <I>S. thermophilus</I> TH4.

<LINK REF="STD-Shornikova-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Shornikova 1997b</LINK> evaluated <I>L. reuteri</I> 10<SUP>7</SUP> CFU/day for up to 5 days.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-10-02 11:24:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A striking finding of this review is that most trials reported that probiotics improved diarrhoea. A beneficial effect of probiotics was consistent across the different diarrhoea outcomes and was statistically significant in many trials.</P>
<P>With the exception of possible mild hypersensitivity to <I>E. coli</I> strain Nissle reported in one participant (<LINK REF="STD-Henker-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Henker 2008</LINK>), no authors reported adverse events that they attributed to probiotics. Vomiting is common in acute diarrhoea and was the most frequently reported adverse event. Vomiting occurred less frequently in the probiotic than the control groups and, therefore, would appear to be a symptom of the illness rather than an adverse effect of probiotics. The reasons for non-compliance with protocol in some studies were not stated, but were unlikely to be related to the adverse events of probiotics since similar numbers of participants in the probiotic and control groups failed to comply. The causes of the withdrawal of participants from trials were related mostly to their primary illness rather than the interventions. Although this review supports the excellent safety record of probiotics, most of the studies recruited previously healthy people and more studies of susceptible individuals, for example, malnourished children and people with human immunodeficiency virus infection, are required to further evaluate safety.</P>
<P>The marked statistical heterogeneity between studies was expected given the marked clinical diversity in the definitions of diarrhoea and end of the diarrhoeal episode, the probiotic(s) tested, the treatment regimens, the diarrhoeal pathogens identified, the types of participants and the settings in which the trials were undertaken. Although these factors varied greatly among studies, individual studies used the same criteria and outcomes for both the probiotic and control groups. Although there was great variability in the methodological quality of the trials, there was no evidence that poor study design had led to an overestimate of the effects of probiotics.</P>
<P>Few studies reported outcomes for participants with bacterial diarrhoea and it was not possible to extract data for meta-analysis from any of these studies. Many of the other studies that reported a beneficial effect of probiotics included a significant proportion of participants with bacterial diarrhoea or bloody stools, or both. Although this suggests that probiotics are efficacious, more research is needed to assess probiotics in bacterial diarrhoea.</P>
<P>The subgroup analyses did not explain between-study statistical heterogeneity. Therefore, this review does not find important differences in probiotic effect according to probiotic strain, the number of different strains, the viability of the organisms, low versus high dose preparations, the causes or severity of diarrhoea or whether the studies were done in developed or developing countries. These findings are encouraging as effective interventions to prevent the progression from acute to persistent diarrhoea (&gt; 14 days; closely associated with malnutrition in children in developing countries [<LINK REF="REF-Walker_x002d_Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker-Smith 1993</LINK>]), are a priority.</P>
<P>The persistence of statistical heterogeneity in subgroup analyses is perhaps not surprising given the marked clinical variability among studies. This was demonstrated clearly by the wide range of values for primary outcomes reported in participants allocated to the control groups. There is general consensus that effects of probiotics are strain-specific and that results obtained with one probiotic cannot be extrapolated to other organisms, including closely related strains (<LINK REF="REF-Rijkers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rijkers 2010</LINK>). However, this review found that studies tested many different probiotics in many different settings yet nearly all reported beneficial outcomes. This suggests that a mechanism common to most probiotics, for example, colonization resistance, is effective against a wide range of gut pathogens. Probiotics are likely to have multiple mechanisms of action in the gut that may include effects on host immunity and gut mucosal barrier integrity as well as effects against diarrhoeal pathogens. Variations in several host and environmental factors that may determine the commensal gut flora may modify probiotic efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Wolvers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolvers 2010</LINK>). These include age, diet and eating practices, level of sanitation and exposure to antibiotics. It is likely that other factors, not considered in this review, underlie the marked among-studies heterogeneity.</P>
<P>The marked clinical variability among studies complicates meta-analysis and, therefore, weakens the evidence base to inform clinical practice. In particular, variability in the definition of diarrhoeal episodes results in misclassification and impairs the comparability of the findings from different studies (<LINK REF="REF-Baqui-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baqui 1991</LINK>). More large, well-designed studies are needed of specific probiotic regimens in specific settings. In future research, the standardization of definitions of acute diarrhoea, treatment regimens, inclusion criteria and outcome measures are needed to facilitate comparison of results across studies. All studies should try to present data separately for important subgroups, for example, according to participant nutritional status and identified causes of diarrhoea, such as rotavirus or bacterial causes. Guidance on undertaking trials with probiotics, such as reliably identifying the agent used, testing the viability of organisms and confirming their quantity, is readily available (<LINK REF="REF-Rijkers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rijkers 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolvers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolvers 2010</LINK>). Since most episodes of acute diarrhoea are uncomplicated, self-limiting, and require no specific treatment, cost-effect analyses need to determine whether probiotics should be used in particular groups of people.</P>

<P>Probiotics administered in addition to rehydration therapy resulted in clear reductions in the duration and severity of diarrhoea, and were not associated with adverse effects. This review supports the use of probiotics in acute, infectious diarrhoea. However, marked clinical variability between studies resulted in insufficient studies of specific probiotic regimens in defined groups of children or adults to inform the development of evidence-based treatment guidelines.</P>

<P>Although many different probiotics were effective in reducing diarrhoea, to better inform clinical practice studies of specific probiotic regimens in large numbers of participants with well-defined diarrhoeal illness are needed. Trials need to use standardized definitions for acute diarrhoea and the resolution of the illness. They need to identify infectious causes of diarrhoea and present data separately for important participant subgroups, such as viral and bacterial causes of diarrhoea. All studies should include a reliable identification of the probiotic being tested, and confirm the viability and number of organisms for live probiotics. More research is needed to assess the role of probiotics in developing countries, especially in preventing the progression from acute to persistent diarrhoea and associated malnutrition.</P>
<P>Basic research is needed to identify generic and strain-specific mechanisms underlying the apparent beneficial effects of probiotics in acute diarrhoea.</P>
