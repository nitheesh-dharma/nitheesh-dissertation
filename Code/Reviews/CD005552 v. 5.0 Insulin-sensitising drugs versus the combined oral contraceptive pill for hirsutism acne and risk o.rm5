<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Insulin-sensitising drugs versus the combined oral contraceptive pill for symptoms and risks of polycystic ovary syndrome.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Women with polycystic ovary syndrome suffer from excessive hairiness (hirsutism), irregular periods, and acne. They are also at greater risk of developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and endometrial cancer. <BR/>In women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) is more effective than insulin-sensitising drugs in improving menstrual pattern and reducing serum androgen (male hormone) levels whilst metformin, an insulin-sensitising drug (ISD), is more effective than the OCP in reducing fasting insulin levels and not increasing triglyceride levels. <BR/>There is insufficient evidence in favour of either metformin or the OCP in treating hirsutism or acne (pimples); nor in preventing the development of diabetes, heart disease, or endometrial cancer. The limited data available does not support the preferential use of either insulin-sensitising drugs or OCP (alone or in combination) for the long-term medical management of PCOS. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Insulin-sensitizing drugs (ISDs) have recently been advocated as possibly a safer and more effective long-term treatment than the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is important to directly compare the efficacy and safety of ISDs versus OCPs in the long-term treatment of women with PCOS.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness and safety of ISDs versus the OCP (alone or in combination) in improving clinical, hormonal, and metabolic features of PCOS.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (September 2005), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL (Ovid), third quarter 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2005), CINAHL (1982 to September 2005), and EMBASE (1988 to September 2005). References of the identified articles were handsearched, and pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field were also contacted for additional relevant studies. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials which compared ISDs versus the OCP (alone or in combination).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Performed independently by two review authors.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six trials were included for analysis, four of which compared metformin versus OCP (104 participants) and two of which compared OCP combined with metformin versus OCP alone (70 participants). Limited data demonstrated no evidence of difference in effect between metformin and the OCP on hirsutism and acne. There was either insufficient or no data on the relative efficacy of metformin or the OCP (alone or in combination) for preventing the development of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or endometrial cancer. Metformin was less effective than the OCP in improving menstrual pattern (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.45). Metformin resulted in a higher incidence of gastrointestinal (Peto OR 7.75, 95% CI 1.32 to 45.71), and a lower incidence of non-gastrointestinal (Peto OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.39), severe adverse effects requiring stopping of medication. Metformin was less effective in reducing serum androgen levels (total testosterone: weighted mean difference (WMD) 0.54, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86; free androgen index: WMD 3.69, 95% CI 2.56 to 4.83). Metformin was more effective than the OCP in reducing fasting insulin (WMD -3.46, 95% CI -5.39 to -1.52) and not increasing triglyceride (WMD -0.48, 95% -0.86 to -0.09) levels, but there was insufficient evidence regarding comparative effects on reducing fasting glucose or cholesterol levels. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Up to 12-months treatment with the OCP is associated with an improvement in menstrual pattern and serum androgen levels compared with metformin; but metformin treatment results in a reduction in fasting insulin and lower triglyceride levels than with the OCP. Side-effect profiles differ between the two drugs. There is either extremely limited or no data on important clinical outcomes such as the development of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or endometrial cancer. There are no data comparing ISDs other than metformin (that is rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and D-chiro-inositol) versus OCPs (alone or in combination). </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-13 11:45:52 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by chronic anovulation (failure or absence of ovulation) and hyperandrogenism (excessive production of male hormones in women) with clinical manifestations of irregular menstrual cycles (periods), infertility (failure to conceive), hirsutism (excessive hairiness) and acne (pimples). The condition is the most common endocrinopathy in women, affecting approximately 5 to 10 percent of women of reproductive age (<LINK REF="REF-Frank-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Homburg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homburg 1996</LINK>). PCOS is a heterogenous condition, both clinically and biochemically, and a recent international consensus workshop group, The Rotterdam Consensus Group 2003, recommended that all clinicians and investigators now use a new internationally agreed definition of PCOS (<LINK REF="REF-Rotterdam-ESHRE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotterdam ESHRE 2004</LINK>). This consensus group recommended that diagnosis of PCOS requires that at least two of the following three criteria are met: (1) oligo- or anovulation (infrequent or no ovulation), or both; (2) clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, or both; (3) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. Other causes for hyperandrogenism which mimic PCOS (such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, or androgen-secreting tumours) should be excluded. Recently it has become clear that PCOS is also linked to a number of metabolic disturbances, including type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and possibly cardiovascular disease (CVD) (<LINK REF="REF-Ovalle-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ovalle 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wild-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wild 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wild-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wild 2002b</LINK>). </P>
<P>The exact pathophysiological mechanism (body characteristics) leading to the characteristic PCOS phenotype remains unknown. Some investigators explain it as primarily an intrinsic ovarian problem (excess ovarian production of androgens), others as adrenal (excess adrenal gland production of androgens), and again others as hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (exaggerated gonadotropin releasing hormone pulsatility that results in hypersecretion of luteinizing hormone). Perhaps the most widely accepted explanation these days is metabolic, with the aetiologic factor being insulin resistance (IR) (defined as a reduced glucose response to a given amount of insulin) and consequent compensatory hyperinsulinaemia. Evidence of decreased insulin sensitivity is seen in both lean (30% incidence) and obese women (75% incidence) with PCOS (<LINK REF="REF-Conway-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dunaif-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunaif 1989</LINK>); but IR accompanied by compensatory hyperinsulinemia is most marked when there is an interaction between obesity and the syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Dunaif-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunaif 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>Hyperinsulinaemia directly stimulates both ovarian and adrenal androgen secretion and suppresses liver sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) synthesis, resulting in an increase in free, biologically active androgens. This excess in local ovarian androgen production, augmented by hyperinsulinemia, causes premature follicular atresia and anovulation along with the other clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism such as hirsutism and acne (<LINK REF="REF-Utiger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utiger 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>Women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of risk factors for T2DM (that is obesity, family history of type 2 diabetes, IR, reduced pancreatic b-cell function). Clear evidence now exists that women with PCOS have a 5 to 10 fold increased risk of developing T2DM compared to age and weight matched women. PCOS is also associated with an increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). There is a 31 to 35% prevalence of IGT and 7.5 to 10% prevalence of T2DM in women with PCOS. Preliminary data indicates that 10% and 30% of PCOS women with a normal or impaired oral glucose tolerance test, respectively, will develop T2DM over 2 to 3 years of follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Ovalle-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ovalle 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>The prevalence of risk factors for CVD (that is obesity, diabetes, IR, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, increased serum plasminogen activator inhibitor levels, and increased carotid artery intima-media thickness on ultrasound) is increased in PCOS, suggesting that women with PCOS are also at increased risk of developing CVD. However, the limited epidemiological studies available to date have shown no direct evidence of an increased incidence of coronary heart disease events in middle-aged women with a history of PCOS (<LINK REF="REF-Wild-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wild 2002a</LINK>). The available data indicates that premenopausal women in the general population are protected from cardiovascular disease; however, this protection is lost after menopause when significant disease develops in women, 10 to 15 years later than in men (<LINK REF="REF-Rossouw-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossouw 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>PCOS women are thought to be at increased risk for endometrial cancer through chronic anovulation with consequent unopposed estrogen exposure of the endometrium (that is unopposed by progesterone) (<LINK REF="REF-Hardiman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardiman 2003</LINK>). Endometrial cancer typically presents in postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-ACS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACS 2003</LINK>) but epidemiological studies linking chronic anovulation to increased risk of endometrial cancer have included women aged 20 to 65 years (mean age of 49 years); up to 50% of these women were aged less than age 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-Dahlgren-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahlgren 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Escobedo-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escobedo 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) have been the traditional therapy for the long-term treatment of PCOS , to provide endometrial protection, regularize and lighten menses, and to improve hirsutism and acne by reducing ovarian androgen production. A recent review, based on limited and contradictory evidence, raised the concern that OCPs may reduce insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in women with PCOS (<LINK REF="REF-Diam_x002d_Kandarakis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diam-Kandarakis 2003</LINK>). The most common side-effects in women taking the OCP included headache, mood changes, gastrointestinal disturbances, and breast pain (<LINK REF="REF-Gallo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallo 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Recently, insulin-sensitising drugs (ISD) have been advocated as another long-term treatment option for PCOS. Given the importance of hyperinsulinaemia in the development of hyperandrogenism and disrupted folliculogenesis, it seems probable that ISDs may be useful in the restoration of normal endocrinological and clinical parameters of PCOS by lowering insulin secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Hasegawa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasegawa 1999</LINK>). The major ISDs are metformin, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and D-chiro-inositol. The most extensively studied insulin sensitising drug in the treatment of PCOS is metformin (<LINK REF="REF-Nestler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nestler 2002</LINK>). The most common side-effects of metformin include gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, diarrhoea, and abdominal cramping. These occur in up to 50% of treated patients, usually improving or completely subsiding with continued treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hundal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hundal 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis comparing metformin with either placebo or no treatment demonstrated that metformin reduced blood pressure, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and serum androgens but had no effect on body weight or hirsutism scores. However, the negative finding on hirsutism scores was based on a single small trial. The effect of metformin on lipids was variable, with evidence of a reduction in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels but no effect on the levels of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides (<LINK REF="REF-Lord-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 2004</LINK>). In addition, metformin has been shown to reduce the risk of T2DM in women with IGT (not specifically PCOS women), but intense lifestyle intervention consisting of diet and exercise is more effective (<LINK REF="REF-Knowler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knowler 2002</LINK>). Metformin has also been shown to decrease cardiovascular events in overweight T2DM women (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-Group-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS Group 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>It is important to directly compare the use of OCPs versus ISDs in view of the above reservations concerning the appropriateness of OCPs as a therapeutic agent for PCOS. ISDs (either alone or combined with OCPs) may be a safer as well as a more effective treatment alternative. The overall aim of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of the ISDs versus OCP in the treatment of women with PCOS. It is important to emphasise that OCPs and ISDs were assessed for safety (in the context of concerns regarding reduction of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance) as well as efficacy. In addition, quality of life is an important outcome and was also assessed. </P>

<P>
<B>Study selection</B>
<BR/>The review was undertaken by five reviewer authors (MF Costello, B Shrestha, J Eden, P Sjoblom and N Johnson), four of whom work in reproductive medicine (MFC, JE, PS, and NJ). The described search strategy was performed to obtain titles and, where possible, abstracts of studies that were potentially relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts were screened by MFC and BS who aimed to be overly inclusive rather than risk losing relevant studies. The full text of potentially relevant studies were then independently assessed by MFC and BS as to whether the studies met the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved to form consensus with JE. If papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility, the authors of those papers were contacted in order to seek further information. Studies were excluded from the systematic review if they made comparisons other than those specified in the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological risk of bias</B>
<BR/>The quality of all studies eligible for the review were assessed independently by the two review authors (MFC and BS), with discrepancies resolved by discussion with JE. The following standard checklist created by the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Review Group (MDSG) was used.</P>
<P>
<I>Section I: internal validity </I>
<BR/>(1) Was the assigned treatment adequately concealed prior to allocation?<BR/>(2) Were the outcomes of participants who withdrew or were excluded after allocation described and included in an 'intention to treat' analysis?<BR/>(3) Were the outcome assessors blind to assignment status?<BR/>(4) Were the treatment and control group comparable at entry?<BR/>(5) Were the participants blind to assignment status following allocation?<BR/>(6) Were the treatment providers blind to assignment status?<BR/>(7) Were the care programmes other than the trial options identical?<BR/>(8) Were the withdrawals greater than 10% of the study population?</P>
<P>
<I>Section II: external validity</I>
<BR/>(1) Were the inclusion and exclusion criteria for entry clearly defined?<BR/>(2) Were the outcome measures used clearly defined?<BR/>(3) Were the accuracy, precision, and extent of observer variation of the outcome measures adequate?<BR/>(4) Was the timing of the outcome measures appropriate?</P>
<P>The quality of allocation concealment was graded as adequate (A), unclear (B), or inadequate (C), following the detailed descriptions of these categories provided by the MDSG. Other aspects of study quality including the extent of blinding (if appropriate), whether groups were comparable at baseline, the extent of losses to follow up, non-compliance, whether the outcome assessment was standardised, and whether an 'intention to treat' analysis was undertaken were also assessed. This information is presented in the table Characteristics of included studies and provides a context for discussing the reliability of the results.</P>
<P>For each included trial, information was collected regarding the location of the study, methods of the study (as per the quality assessment checklist), the participants (eligibility criteria, baseline characteristics of each group, and withdrawals), the nature of the interventions and co-interventions, and data specifying the outcomes measured. Where possible, missing data was sought from the authors.</P>
<P>Studies that initially appeared to meet the inclusion criteria but were then excluded are presented in the table Characteristics of excluded studies, briefly stating the reason for exclusion but no further information.</P>
<P>
<B>Analysis</B>
<BR/>Statistical analyses were performed in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. For dichotomous data, results for each study were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and combined for meta-analysis with Review Manager software using the fixed-effect model (Peto method). The goal was to calculate a pooled estimate of treatment effect for each outcome across studies. For continuous data, the mean post-treatment or intervention values and standard deviations for each group were measured and the weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI calculated. Where different scales measured the same continuous data outcome, the mean post-treatment or intervention values and standard deviations for each group were measured and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI was calculated.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity (variations) between the results of different studies were examined by inspecting the scatter in the data points and the overlap in their confidence intervals on a graph and, more formally, by checking the results of the chi-squared tests. Apparent statistical heterogeneity was investigated informally by consideration of factors such as study quality. Sensitivity analyses of such factors were used to test the robustness of any results that appeared to be based on heterogenous combinations by examining the effects of deleting each study in turn.</P>
<P>Data involving different follow-up periods were divided into follow-up periods of up to one year, one to two years, two to three years, and more than three years.</P>
<P>Data from crossover trials were only used from the first phase (that is before crossover). Any such trials that did not provide results at this point were excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Timeline</B>
<BR/>A search will be conducted for trials every 24 months and the review updated as and when new trials are found. The next update of this review will be submitted in March 2008.</P>

<P>All 16 of the pharmaceutical companies listed in <LINK REF="REF-MIMS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">MIMS 2005</LINK> as manufacturing or distributing metformin, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone were contacted in April 2005. There were seven replies, all of whom stated that there were no relevant on-going trials on the use of the drugs in polycystic ovary syndrome. Seven studies met the initial eligibility criteria. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Mitkov-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mitkov 2005</LINK>) was excluded because the participants were not randomized to metformin or OCP, leaving six randomized controlled trials to be included in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>). No studies using ISDs other than metformin were identified. Of the six included studies none were double blind, one was single blind (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>), and five were not blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>).

<BR/>Four of the studies compared metformin with the OCP (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>) and two compared the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>). No studies were identified comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus metformin. Three of the four trials comparing metformin with the OCP were conducted by the same investigator centre (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>). The patients in one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>) included the combined participants of two of the other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK> examined only the metabolic parameters of lipid levels as outcomes whilst the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK> (recruiting obese women with PCOS) and <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK> (recruiting non-obese women with PCOS) assessed clinical, hormonal, and metabolic (insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance) parameters.</P>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>Patient characteristics </B>
</P>
<P>The diagnosis of PCOS in five of the six trials required at least two of the following three features:</P>
<P>(i) oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea;</P>
<P>(ii) clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism; and</P>
<P>(iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The other trial based the diagnosis of PCOS on oligomenorrhea with clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>). Participants in three (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>) of the six included studies did not meet the new proposed internationally agreed definition of PCOS (<LINK REF="REF-Rotterdam-ESHRE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotterdam ESHRE 2004</LINK>) due to failure to exclude other causes of hyperandrogenism such as hyperprolactinaemia and congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</P>
<P>The main inclusion criteria were:<BR/>"women with PCOS in three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>);<BR/>"women with PCOS whose primary complaint was hirsutism in one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>);<BR/>"obese women with PCOS in one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>);<BR/>"non-obese women with PCOS in one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The participants in all of the trials were recruited from European centres, with none of the studies describing the specific ethnic origin of the participants. The six trials were conducted by four different investigator groups, with each investigator group located in a different European country. Investigator groups comparing metformin versus the OCP were located in Scotland (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>) and Finland (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>). Investigator groups comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP were located in the Czech Republic (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>) and Turkey (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>).

The mean ages of participants in three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>) were slightly older, at approximately 30 years age, compared to the other two trials where the mean age was about 25 years (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>). The mean BMI was in the normal range (20 to 25 kg/m2) in three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>) and in the obese range (&gt; 30 kg/m2) in the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>); two of the studies specifically recruiting either obese (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>) or non-obese (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>) women with PCOS. Two trials had baseline fasting insulin levels less than 15 mIU/L (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). All the studies had similar baseline fasting glucose levels. The baseline total testosterone levels were higher in Cibula et al (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>) compared to the other studies. Three of the trials reported significant differences between baseline characteristics of the treatment and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). The free androgen index (FAI) and dehydroepiandrosterone levels were higher in the metformin+OCP group compared to the OCP group in the <LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK> study; dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels were higher in the metformin compared to the OCP group in the <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK> study; and androstenedione levels were higher in the metformin group compared to the OCP group in the <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK> study.</P>
<P>
<B>Duration of treatment, withdrawals, treatment, and co-interventions</B>
</P>
<P>The duration of the trials ranged from four to 12 months with a median of six months. The trial duration for four of the six trials was six months (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>). The drop-out rate for the studies ranged from 0 to 44% with a median of 24%. The numbers of withdrawals were similar for both the treatment and control arms in all of the studies. The dose of metformin was 500 mg three times daily for three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>) and 500 mg twice daily for the first three months increasing to 1000 mg twice daily for the next three months for three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>). The OCP type was ethinyl estradiol (EE) 35 µg combined with cyproterone acetate (CPA) 2 mg (EE 35/CPA2) in five of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>) and EE 35µg combined with 250 µg norgestimate (NGM) (EE35/NGM250) in the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>). Co-interventions included the use of either progestogen or OCP-induced menstruation for the assessment of hormones in order to avoid testing during a spontaneous luteal phase at baseline or after follow up in four of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>). None of the trials actively changed the participant's lifestyle in terms of diet and exercise.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome measures </B>
</P>
<P>None of the trials reported on all of the review's primary or secondary outcome measures. In terms of primary outcome measures, four trials reported on hirsutism (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>); all four assessed hirsutism using the Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) score and also one using a patient-completed visual analogue scale (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>). A single trial measured acne, with this trial using a patient-completed visual analogue scale (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>). Only one trial reported on the development of T2DM (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>) and no trials reported either cardiovascular disease (stroke, myocardial infarction) or endometrial cancer events. Secondary outcomes were reported more frequently, with all six studies assessing clinical (that is BMI or WHR) and metabolic (glucose, insulin, or lipid) parameters. One trial did not report on secondary hormonal parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>).

<P>Five of the six trials were graded 'A - clear' for allocation concealment performed by an on-site computer system utilizing locked files or a third party with the random allocation sequence generated by a computer or from a random numbers table. The other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>) was graded 'B - unclear' for allocation concealment, the random allocation sequence being generated by computer. All studies were unblended, apart from <LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK> which was single blinded as only the outcome assessors of clinical parameters were blinded. Only one study analysed their data on an intention-to-treat basis (trial participants analysed in the groups to which they were randomised and all participants were included as there were no patient withdrawals) (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>), with the remainder conducting available case analyses (trial participants analysed in the groups to which they were randomised and only participants who completed the trial were included). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>) had sample size justification.</P>

<P>Three of the trials reported significant differences between baseline characteristics of the treatment and control groups despite randomization and concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). The baseline characteristics can be viewed in the Additional tables. The free androgen index (FAI) and dehydroepiandrosterone levels were higher in the metformin+OCP group compared to the OCP group in the <LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK> study; dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels were higher in the metformin compared to the OCP group in the <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK> study; and androstenedione levels were higher in the metformin compared to the OCP group in the <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK> study.</P>

</P>
<P>There were 36 primary analyses for metformin, with 20 analyses for metformin versus the OCP and 16 analyses for the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP. There were no trials comparing the following interventions: rosiglitazone versus the OCP, pioglitazone versus the OCP, D-chiro-inositol versus the OCP; the OCP combined with metformin versus metformin, the OCP combined with rosiglitazone versus rosiglitazone, the OCP combined with pioglitazone versus pioglitazone, the OCP combined with D-chiro-inositol versus D-chiro-inositol; the OCP combined with rosiglitazone versus the OCP, the OCP combined with pioglitazone versus the OCP, and the OCP combined with D-chiro-inositol versus the OCP.</P>
<P>There is heterogeneity in some of the results, as might be expected from such a diverse group of study populations. These are discussed within each of the sections below. All 36 analyses for metformin involved trials with follow-up periods of up to one year (12 months).

<P>(1) <I>Clinical outcomes</I>
</P>
<P>(a) Hirsutism: score</P>
<P>Two trials compared metformin versus the OCP with a combined total of 35 participants analysed (52 participants randomized). They reported hirsutism scores using the Ferriman-Gallway (FG) scoring system (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). Eighteen of the 52 participants randomized had clinical hirsutism, defined as hirsutism scores greater than 7. The meta-analysis demonstrated no difference in FG scores between metformin or the OCP, although a non-significant trend was observed in favour of the OCP (weighted mean difference (WMD) 2.66, P = 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.33 to 5.66).</P>
<P>A single trial compared OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP with a total of 40 participants randomized and analysed. The trial reported hirsutism scores using the Ferriman-Gallway (FG) scoring system (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>). These participants included patients with and without clinical hirsutism (FG score &gt; 7); the actual numbers were not stated. This trial showed a significant reduction in hirsutism score with the OCP combined with metformin compared to the OCP (WMD -2.82, P = 0.04, 95% CI -5.47 to -0.17).</P>
<P>(b) Hirsutism: subjective</P>
<P>One trial compared metformin versus the OCP with a total of 34 participants analysed (52 participants randomized). It reported hirsutism subjectively (patient self assessed) using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 10 (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>). All the participants in this trial had hirsutism (FG score &gt; 8). This trial showed a significant reduction in hirsutism with metformin compared to the OCP (WMD -2.70, P = 0.002, 95% CI -4.41 to -0.99). There were no trials assessing subjective hirsutism for the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP.</P>
<P>(c) Hirsutism: total (score and subjective)</P>
<P>Three trials compared metformin versus the OCP with a combined total of 69 participants analysed (104 participants randomized). The trials reported on hirsutism using either the FG scoring system (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>) or a subjective (patient self-assessed) visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>). Meta-analysis demonstrated no difference in effect on hirsutism between metformin or the OCP (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.18, P = 0.48, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.32). There was significant heterogeneity, with the results for the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK> differing from the trials by <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>. The reasons for this may be due to the differences in the assessment method for hirsutism, described above; selection criteria for the PCOS participants; and the duration of treatment. All participants in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK> and 18 of 52 participants in the trials by <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK> were clinically hirsute. The duration of treatment was 12 months for <LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK> and six months for <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>. Otherwise, there does not appear to be any apparent differences in terms of study validity, participants, and methodology between the studies.</P>
<P>No meta-analysis comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP was performed for total hirsutism as there were no trials assessing subjective hirsutism.</P>
<P>(d) Acne: score</P>
<P>There were no trials comparing metformin versus the OCP or the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP that reported acne scores.</P>
<P>(e) Acne: subjective</P>
<P>There was a single trial comparing metformin versus the OCP with 34 participants analysed (52 participants randomized). It reported acne subjectively (patient self assessed) using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 10 (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>). This trial demonstrated no difference in acne scores between metformin and the OCP (WMD 0.90, P = 0.18, 95% CI -0.40 to 2.20). There were no trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP and reporting acne subjectively.</P>
<P>(f) Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)</P>
<P>One trial compared metformin versus the OCP with 18 participants analysed (32 participants randomized) and reported on diagnosis of T2DM (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>). No difference was seen in the development of T2DM between the metformin and the OCP groups (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.17, P = 0.37, 95% CI 0.00 to 8.54). No trials compared the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP reporting on diagnosis of T2DM.</P>
<P>(g) Carciovascular disease event: stroke</P>
<P>There were no trials comparing metformin versus the OCP or the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP reporting the outcome measure of stroke.</P>
<P>(h) Cardiovascular disease event: myocardial infarction</P>
<P>There were no trials comparing metformin versus the OCP or the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP reporting the outcome measure of myocardial infarction.</P>
<P>(i) Endometrial cancer event</P>
<P>There were no trials comparing metformin versus the OCP or the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP reporting endometrial cancer as an outcome.</P>
<P>(j) Improved menstrual pattern</P>
<P>There were two trials comparing metformin versus OCP with a total of 35 participants analysed (52 participants randomized) that reported on improvement of menstrual cyclicity (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). Eighteen of 21 participants on metformin and 20 of 24 participants on the OCP had either oligoamenorrhea or amenorrhea at baseline. Both trials reported menstrual pattern in terms of days between menses and metformin was significantly less effective in improving menstrual pattern (Peto OR 0.08, P = 0.004, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.45). There were no trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP that reported on improved menstrual pattern as an outcome measure.</P>
<P>(k) Body weight (kg)</P>
<P>There were no trials comparing metformin versus the OCP reporting on body weight. There was one trial comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP with 28 participants analysed (30 participants randomized) reporting on body weight (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>). This trial found no difference in body weight between the two interventions (WMD 2.60, P = 0.30, 95% CI -2.29 to 7.49).</P>
<P>(l) Body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2)</P>
<P>Three trials comparing metformin versus OCP with a total of 69 participants analysed (104 participants randomized) reported on BMI (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). These three trials included two trials with obese participants (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>) and a trial with non-obese participants (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). Meta-analysis demonstrated no difference in effect on BMI between metformin or the OCP (WMD -1.39, P = 0.13, 95% CI -3.20 to 0.42) but with significant heterogeneity which appeared to be largely due to <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>, who showed a large treatment effect with metformin. There were two trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP with 68 participants analysed (70 participants randomizsed) reporting on BMI (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>). The participants in both of these trials were predominantly non-obese. There was no difference in BMI between the two treatment groups (WMD 0.79, P = 0.17, 95% CI -0.33 to 1.92).</P>
<P>(m) Waist circumference (cm)</P>
<P>There were no trials comparing metformin versus the OCP or the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP reporting on waist circuference.</P>
<P>(n) Waist-hip ratio (WHR)</P>
<P>Three trials comparing metformin versus the OCP with a total of 69 participants analysed (104 participants randomized) reported on WHR (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). There was no difference in the effect on WHR between metformin or the OCP as demonstrated by the meta-analysis (WMD 0.01, P = 0.29, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.04). A single trial with 40 participants randomized and analysed compared the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP and reported on WHR (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>). This trial showed no benefit to either intervention group in terms of WHR (WMD -0.01, P = 0.54, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.02).</P>
<P>(o) Blood pressure: systolic (mm Hg)</P>
<P>One trial comparing metformin versus the OCP with a total of 34 participants analysed (52 participants randomized) reported on systolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>). There was no difference in the effect on systolic blood pressure between metformin and the OCP (WMD 4.10, P = 0.51, 95% CI -8.01 to 16.21). There were no trials that compared the OCP combined with metformin versus theOCP reporting on systolic blood pressure.</P>
<P>(p) Blood pressure: diastolic (mm Hg)</P>
<P>One trial comparing metformin versus the OCP with a total of 34 participants analysed (52 participants randomized) reported on diastolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>). The diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher with metformin compared to the OCP (WMD 7.50, P = 0.02, 95% CI 1.27 to 13.73). There were no trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP that reported on diastolic blood pressure.</P>
<P>(q) Quality of life score<BR/>There were no trials comparing metformin versus the OCP or the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP reporting on quality of life.</P>
<P>(r) Adverse events: severe (gastrointestinal and others)</P>
<P>There were three trials comparing metformin versus OCP with a total of 104 participants randomized and analysed that reported on severe (requiring stopping of medication) adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). Metformin caused a significantly higher incidence of severe gastrointestinal side-effects (that is nausea, diarrhoea) (Peto OR 7.75, P = 0.02, 95% CI 1.32 to 45.71) and a significantly lower incidence of ther severe adverse events (that is weight gain, high blood pressure, depression, chest pain, headache) (Peto OR 0.11, P = 0.0008, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.39) compared to the OCP. However, overall there was no difference between metformin and the OCP when taking into account all severe adverse events (Peto OR 0.48, P = 0.18, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.39). Not surprisingly, there was significant heterogeneity in the overall severe adverse events meta-analysis due to the different side-effect profiles of metformin and the OCP.</P>
<P>A single trial comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP with 30 participants randomized and analysed reported on severe (requiring stopping of medication) adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>). Only severe gastrointestinal side-effects were reported and no difference was seen between the two treatment arms (Peto OR 3.21, P = 0.49, 95% CI 0.12 to 85.20).</P>
<P>(s) Adverse events: minor (gastrointestinal and others)</P>
<P>There were no trials comparing metformin versus the OCP reporting on minor (not requiring stopping of medication) adverse events. A single trial comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP with 40 participants randomized and analysed reported on minor adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>). There were only minor gastrointestinal side-effects reported and no difference was seen between the two treatment groups (Peto OR 11.18, P = 0.11, 95% CI 0.56 to 222.98).</P>
<P>(2) <I>Hormonal outcomes </I>
</P>
<P>(a) Serum total testosterone (nmol/L)</P>
<P>There were three trials comparing metformin versus the OCP with a total of 69 participants analysed (104 participants randomized) that reported on total serum testosterone (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). Meta-analysis demonstrated a significantly higher serum total testosterone with metformin compared to the OCP (WMD 0.54, P = 0.001, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86). There were two trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP with a total of 68 participants analysed (70 participants randomized) that reported on total serum testosterone (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>). There was no difference in total serum testosterone levels between the two interventions (WMD 0.05, P = 0.92, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.89).</P>
<P>(b) Serum free testosterone (pmol/L)</P>
<P>No trials comparing metformin versus the OCP reported on serum free testosterone as an outcome measure. However, there was only one trial comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP with a 40 participants randomized and analysed that reported on serum free testosterone (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>). This trial found no difference in the free testosterone levels between the OCP combined with metformin and the OCP groups (WMD -2.71, P = 0.49, 95%CI -10.45 to 5.03).</P>
<P>(c) Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) (SHBG) (nmol/L)</P>
<P>There were three trials comparing metformin versus the OCP with a total of 69 participants analysed (104 participants randomized) that reported on serum SHBG levels (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). Meta-analysis showed a significantly lower SHBG level with metformin compared to the OCP (WMD -119.94, P &lt; 0.00001, 95% CI -142.86 to -97.03). However, there was significant heterogeneity despite all three individual trials demonstrating significantly lower SHBG levels with metformin and all three trials had confidence limits that were overlapping (see free androgen index results below for further discussion on the probable reason for the heterogeneity). Therefore, these results need to be interpreted with caution. Two trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP with a total of 68 participants analysed (70 participants randomized) reported on serum SHBG levels (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>). A significantly higher SHBG level was seen with the OCP combined with metformin treatment compared with the OCP alone (WMD 28.68, P = 0.001, 95% CI 11.39 to 45.96).</P>
<P>(d) Free androgen index (FAI) (%)</P>
<P>Three trials comparing metformin versus the OCP with a total of 69 participants analysed (104 participants randomized) reported on FAI (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). Meta-analysis demonstrated a significant benefit with the OCP as the FAI was higher with metformin (WMD 3.69, P &lt; 0.00001, 95% CI 2.56 to 4.83). However, there was significant heterogeneity which most likely reflects the significant heterogeneity seen in the SHBG levels meta-analysis, given that FAI is calculated by the formula FAI = total testosterone level (nmol/L) x 100 divided by SHBG level (nmol/L). The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK> showed less of a benefit with the OCP in terms of both SHBG levels and FAI. This finding probably reflects that the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK> were all non-obese compared to the participants in both <LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK> who were predominately obese. Obesity causes a reduction in SHBG levels and, therefore, may limit the improvement in SHBG levels (and corresponding improvement in FAI) seen with the OCP. One trial comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP with a total of 28 participants analysed (30 participants randomized) reported on FAI (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>) and found no difference in FAI between the two interventions (WMD 0.90, P = 0.94, 95% CI -23.76 to 25.56).</P>
<P>(3) <I>Metabolic outcomes </I>
</P>
<P>(a) Fasting insulin (mIU/L)</P>
<P>There were three trials comparing metformin versus the OCP with a total of 69 participants analysed (104 participants randomized) that reported on fasting insulin levels (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>). Meta-analysis showed significantly lower fasting insulin levels in favour of metformin (WMD -3.46, P = 0.0005, 95% CI -5.39 to -1.52). The fasting insulin levels did not change with OCP treatment in any of the three trials. Two trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP with a total of 68 participants analysed (70 participants randomized) reported on fasting insulin levels (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>). A non-significant trend in favour of the OCP with metformin was demonstrated with a weighted mean difference of -4.02 (P = 0.06, 95% CI -8.24 to 0.20).</P>
<P>(b) Fasting glucose (mmol/L)</P>

No difference in HDL cholesterol levels were demonstrated between metformin and OCP treatment (WMD -0.05, P = 0.62, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.15).

Metformin resulted in a significantly lower triglyceride level than the OCP (WMD -0.48, P = 0.01, 95% -0.86 to -0.09). There were two trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP with a total of 68 participants analysed (70 participants randomized) that reported on triglyceride levels (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>).

<P>(4) <I>Sensitivity analyses</I>
</P>
<P>Consideration of sensitivity analyses was added in at the review stage. Sensitivity analyses to determine if there was an effect on outcome from allocation concealment, blinding, obesity, treatment length under six months, dose of metformin, type of OCP, or ethnicity were not performed due to the reasons outlined below. In summary, sensitivity analyses were not performed due to an insufficient number of trials to adequately perform a sensitivity analysis or there was no variation between trials in terms of the sensitivity analysis criteria.</P>
<P>(a) Quality of allocation concealment</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses based on quality of allocation concealment were not performed as allocation concealment was graded 'A - clear' for all four trials comparing metformin versus the OCP and one of the two trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>). As a result, there were either no trials or an insufficient number of trials to perform a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>(b) Blinding</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses based on blinding were not performed for the same reasons as discussed in the allocation concealment section above, as all four trials comparing metformin versus the OCP and one of the two trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP (<LINK REF="STD-Cibula-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cibula 2005</LINK>) were unblinded.</P>
<P>(c) Intention-to-treat analysis</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses based on intention-to-treat analysis were not performed for the same reasons as discussed in the allocation concealment section above, as no trials comparing metformin versus the OCP and one of the two trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>) analysed their data on an intention-to-treat basis.</P>
<P>(d) Obesity</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses based on participants with or without obesity were not performed due to an insufficient number of trials to perform sensitivity analyses. There were a maximum of three trials comparing metformin versus the OCP assessing clinical, hormonal, and metabolic outcome parameters. Both trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP had participants with a mean BMI in the non-obese range (20 to 25 kg/m2).</P>
<P>(e) Treatment length under six months</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses based on treatment length under six months were not performed for the same reasons as in the allocation concealment, blinding, and intention-to-treat sections above, as no trials comparing metformin versus the OCP and one of the two trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>) had a treatment duration of under six months.</P>
<P>(f) Dose of metformin</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses based on the dose of metformin were not performed, as all six trial in the review used the same dose of metformin (500 mg three times daily). Three of the four trials comparing metformin versus the OCP increased the dose from 500 mg three times daily to 1000 mg twice daily for the last three months of the six month treatment duration (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>). However, there were a maximum of three trials comparing metformin versus the OCP reporting clinical, hormonal, and metabolic outcome parameters.</P>
<P>(g) Type of OCP</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses based on the type of OCP were not performed for the same reasons as discussed in the previous sections, as all trials comparing metformin versus the OCP and one of the two trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP (<LINK REF="STD-Elter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elter 2002</LINK>) used the same OCP type: ethinyl estradiol (EE) 35µg combined with cyproterone acetate (CPA) 2mg (EE 35/CPA2).</P>
<P>(h) Ethnicity</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses based on ethnicity were not performed as the participants in all six trials were recruited from European centres, with none of the studies describing the specific ethnic origin of the participants. The six trials were conducted by four different investigator groups with each investigator group located in a different European country (see Description of studies section above).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review has found that up to 12 months treatment with the OCP compared to metformin in women with PCOS is associated with an improvement in menstrual pattern and serum androgen levels with the OCP , with metformin there wasa a reduction in fasting insulin and lower triglyceride levels. Side-effect profiles differ between the two therapies. There is either extremely limited or no data on important clinical outcomes such as the development of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or endometrial cancer. </P>
<P>There have been a number of recent narrative reviews published that compare the potential benefits and disadvantages of treating women with PCOS with ISDs or OCPs as primary long-term therapy, based on both observational and experimental evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Baillargeon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baillargeon 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Checa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Checa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Costello-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costello 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diam_x002d_Kandarakis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diam-Kandarakis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vrbikova-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vrbikova 2005</LINK>). These narrative reviews discuss potential metabolic concerns with the use of OCPs in PCOS. This present review aims to help clarify whether ISDs or the OCP are the preferred primary medical therapy for the short and long-term treatment of women with PCOS, in terms of efficacy and safety, by systematically reviewing high quality clinical trials in order to undertake a meta-analysis, thereby reducing bias. </P>
<P>Ideally, women with PCOS participating in trials should have clearly defined PCOS with at least two of the following three features: (i) oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea; (ii) clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism; and (iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. This population of women with PCOS is now well recognised in gynaecolgical and endocrine clinics throughout the world. Participants in three (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rautio-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rautio 2005</LINK>) of the four trials comparing metformin versus the OCP included participants who did not meet the new proposed internationally agreed definition of PCOS (<LINK REF="REF-Rotterdam-ESHRE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotterdam ESHRE 2004</LINK>), due to failure to exclude other causes of hyperandrogenism such as hyperprolactinaemia and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. However, these other causes are rare, making up less than seven percent of women presenting with features consistent with PCOS (<LINK REF="REF-Azziz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azziz 2004</LINK>). All participants in the trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP met the new proposed internationally agreed definition of PCOS (<LINK REF="REF-Rotterdam-ESHRE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotterdam ESHRE 2004</LINK>). The mean age of the participants ranged from 28.4 to 31.5 years in the trials comparing the OCP with metformin and 23.5 to 24.2 years in the trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP. There is no data comparing metformin with the OCP, either alone or in combination, in adolescents with PCOS. </P>
<P>Although this review sought to compare OCPs as a group, five of the six trials in the review (all four trials comparing metformin versus the OCP and one of the two trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP) used ethinyl estradiol (EE) 35µg combined with cyproterone acetate (CPA) 2mg (EE 35/CPA2) as the OCP. Therefore, the results of this review are generally applicable to this specific type of OCP. </P>
<P>There are a number of limitations to this review. The value of any meta-analysis is totally dependent on the quality and lack of bias in its component primary studies. A significant concern with any meta-analysis is that meta-analytic methods may be used inappropriately to combine biased and disparate studies, leading to misleading systematic reviews. The careful assessment of study validity and heterogeneity is essential in minimising this risk (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1996</LINK>). Therefore, it is important to restrict inclusion to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), ideally with adequate randomization, objective or blinded outcome assessment, complete follow-up information, and intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt--1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1993</LINK>). Unfortunately, very few of the RCTs included in this review satisfied all these criteria (see the Methodological quality of included studies section above). Although the inclusion of unpublished studies is controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1993</LINK>), reliance upon published studies alone may distort the results of a meta-analysis because positive studies (statistically significant) are more likely to be published than negative ones (non-significant) with the attendant risk for the review to overestimate treatment efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1987</LINK>). Funnel plot analysis for the identification of publication bias in this review was not performed due to the limited number of studies. </P>
<P>There is a limited number of RCTs comparing ISDs versus the OCP (either alone or in combination), with only four trials comparing metformin versus the OCP and two trials comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP. There were no trials identified comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus metformin, other ISDs (that is rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and D-chiro-inositol) either alone or in combination with the OCP versus the OCP, and the OCP combined with ISDs other than metformin versus the respective ISD alone. All of the data in this review are from women with PCOS who were recruited from European centres and three of the four trials comparing metformin versus the OCP were conducted by the same investigator group. This may limit the potential applicability of the results of this review if ethnic variation in baseline risk of adverse outcomes (clinical or metabolic) or response to ISDs or the OCP exists. Differences between trial populations and drug side-effect profiles have resulted in heterogeneity within some of the analyses, as discussed above. All the trials were of short duration and, therefore, long-term data on the comparison effects of ISDs or OCPs are lacking in terms of important clinical outcomes such as hirsutism, acne and development of T2DM, CVD, or endometrial cancer. A number of the results are constrained by small numbers of participants and wide confidence intervals which limit the precision and confidence of conclusions. </P>
<P>Meta-analysis was not possible for a number of clinical (primary and secondary) and hormonal outcomes comparing metformin versus the OCP due to either an absence of trials or the presence of a single trial only. There were no trials assessing the following primary clinical outcomes: development of CVD or endometrial cancer; secondary clinical outcomes: body weight, waist circumference, quality of life, or minor adverse events; and hormonal parameters: serum free testosterone level. Only data from single trials were available for the following primary: acne, development of T2DM; and secondary: blood pressure clinical outcomes. </P>
<P>The OCP is superior to metformin in improving menstrual pattern. This finding was not surprising given that metformin has been shown in a recent systematic review to result in the restoration of regular menses in only approximately 60% of women with PCOS who had oligoamenorrhea or amenorrhea (<LINK REF="REF-Costello-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costello 2003</LINK>). Unfortunately, there were no studies assessing whether this more favourable OCP effect leads to a reduction in the long-term risk of endometrial cancer compared with metformin. </P>
<P>This review showed that metformin resulted in a more favourable effect on subjective (patient-assessed) hirsutism measured by visual analogue scale compared to the OCP, based on the results of one trial with a small number of participants and a consequent large confidence interval (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>). Two trials assessed hirsutism score (FG) (<LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morin_x002d_Papunen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morin-Papunen 2003</LINK>) with the meta-analysis showing no difference between metformin and the OCP, although there was a non-significant trend in favour of the OCP. Meta-analysis of the total hirsutism data from all three trials demonstrated no benefit to either metformin or the OCP, although statistical heterogeneity was present. There was no evidence of benefit with either metformin or the OCP for acne based on one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Harborne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harborne 2003</LINK>). The OCP was superior to metformin in reducing serum androgen levels (total testosterone, FAI) and increasing SHBG levels. Therefore, the OCP appears to result in a greater reduction in androgen levels compared to metformin but there are insufficient studies to date assessing whether this more favourable biochemical androgen profile leads to a more favourable clinical androgen effect in terms of hirsutism or acne. </P>
<P>PCOS is associated with insulin resistance, which is believed to be a key factor in the development of the metabolic syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Reaven-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reaven 1999</LINK>). The metabolic syndrome: the clustering of abdominal obesity, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension, is associated with a substantially elevated risk of T2DM (five fold) and CVD (two to three fold) (<LINK REF="REF-Eckel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eckel 2005</LINK>). The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is significantly higher in women with PCOS than in age-matched women in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Apridonidze-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apridonidze 2005</LINK>). There was only a single trial (six-months duration) assessing the outcome of development of T2DM, which showed no difference in the development of T2DM between metformin and OCP therapy. No trials were identified comparing metformin with the OCP in terms of development of CVD (stroke or myocardial infarction). However, meta-analysis of surrogate metabolic outcomes favoured metformin over the OCP in terms of reducing fasting insulin and triglyceride levels. However, the OCP resulted in a lower diastolic blood pressure (based on one trial). No evidence of benefit was seen with metformin or the OCP in terms of the other surrogate clinical outcomes: BMI, WHR, and systolic blood pressure (based on one trial); and metabolic outcomes: fasting glucose and cholesterol (total, HDL, or LDL) levels. </P>
<P>In terms of severe adverse effects requiring stopping of medication, metformin resulted in a higher incidence of gastrointestinal side-effects whilst the OCP resulted in a higher incidence of other side-effects (weight gain, high blood pressure, depression, chest pain, and headache). </P>
<P>Meta-analysis was also not possible for a number of clinical (primary and secondary) and hormonal outcomes when comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP, due to either an absence of trials or the presence of a single trial. There were no trials assessing the following primary: acne; development of T2DM, CVD or endometrial cancer; and secondary: menstrual pattern, waist circumference, blood pressure, and quality of life clinical outcomes. Only data from single trials were available for the following primary clinical outcomes (hirsutism), secondary clinical outcomes (body weight, WHR, severe and minor adverse events) and hormonal parameters (serum free testosterone, FAI). </P>
<P>There were no trials comparing menstrual pattern or the development of endometrial cancer between the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP participants. The addition of metformin to the OCP improved hirsutism score (FG score) but the result was based on a single trial and lacked precision due to the wide confidence interval as a consequence of the small number of participants in the study. However, there was no evidence supporting an improvement in serum testosterone (total or free) or FAI with the addition of metformin to the OCP. An improvement in SHBG level was seen with the addition of metformin to the the OCP. No trials assessing differences in effect on acne between the two therapies were identified. </P>
<P>No trials were identified comparing the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP in terms of development of T2DM or CVD (stroke or myocardial infarction). However, the assessment of surrogate clinical (body weight, BMI, and WHR) and metabolic (fasting insulin, glucose and lipids) outcomes demonstrated no evidence supporting any benefit with the addition of metformin to the OCP. However, there was a non-significant trend in favour of adding metformin to the OCP in terms of fasting insulin levels. Only a single trial evaluated minor and severe adverse effects and found no difference between the OCP combined with metformin versus the OCP. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>From the studies included in this review, there is limited evidence to support that the OCP is more effective than metformin in improving menstrual pattern and reducing serum androgen levels. There is also limited evidence to show that metformin is more effective than the OCP in reducing fasting insulin and not increasing triglyceride levels, and that metformin causes a higher incidence of severe gastrointestinal adverse effects whilst the OCP results in a higher incidence of severe non-gastrointestinal adverse effects. However, there is insufficient evidence to show that either metformin or the OCP is more effective in terms of treating hirsutism and acne, preventing the development of T2DM, reducing body weight or related anthropic variables, lowering blood pressure, and reducing fasting glucose or cholesterol levels. There are no data (or evidence) on which to make clinical decisions in terms of development of CVD or endometrial cancer when comparing metformin with the OCP. In other words, there is no evidence showing adverse metabolic risk with the use of the OCP compared to metformin in terms of both clinical (T2DM, CVD) and surrogate (BMI, WHR, blood pressure, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and fasting cholesterol) metabolic outcomes. </P>
<P>There is also limited evidence demonstrating that the addition of metformin to the OCP is more effective than the OCP alone in improving hirsutism score and increasing serum SHBG levels. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate any benefit to adding metformin to the OCP in terms of reducing body weight or related arthropometric variables, reducing serum androgen levels, and reducing fasting serum levels of metabolic parameters such as insulin, glucose, or lipids. There is no data available on which to make decisions in terms of treating acne, preventing the development of T2DM or CVD or endometrial cancer, and reducing blood pressure. </P>
<P>Finally, there is also no data comparing ISDs other than metformin (that is rosiglitazone, pioglitazone and D-chiro-inositol) versus OCPs (alone or in combination). </P>
<P>Therefore, in summary, the limited available data from RCTs to date does not support the preferential use of either ISDs or the OCP (alone or in combination) for the long-term medical management of PCOS. However, it should be re-emphasized that all available trials are limited in the duration of ISD or OCP treatment and, therefore long-term effects are not known. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The limited number of RCTs comparing ISDs versus OCPs (alone or in combination) highlights the need for more long term, well designed and executed studies directly comparing the efficacy (in terms of both clinical and surrogate hormonal and metabolic outcomes) and safety of these therapies in order to help clarify the preferred long-term medical treatment option for women with PCOS, including adolescents. There is a striking lack of data concerning long term outcomes, including T2DM, CVD and endometrial cancer and this should be addressed in longer term trials.</P>
