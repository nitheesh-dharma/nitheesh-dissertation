<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane reviewers investigated how well sucrose (table sugar) works as a reliever of pain in newborn babies who are having painful procedures (e.g. an injection, or heel lance, or insertion of a needle to obtain a blood sample (venipuncture), or eye examinations). The babies' pain responses (e.g. crying, grimacing) were assessed by scoring systems for pain used by health care professionals to measure the pain that babies are experiencing. In addition, the reviewers wanted to investigate whether the level of pain relief is related to the dose of sucrose, or the method of delivery (e.g. as a solution squirted into the mouth, or on a pacifier (also called a soother or dummy), and whether there are any safety concerns about using sucrose to relieve pain.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Although there are ways to manage the pain of surgery, medical illness and major procedures, ways of preventing or reducing pain from minor medical procedures (e.g. heel lance and venipuncture) have, until relatively recently, been lacking. Sucrose has been examined for its calming effects in crying newborns and its pain-relieving effects for invasive procedures in full-term and premature newborns.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the medical literature widely up to February 2016 for studies that investigated the pain-relieving effect of sucrose for minor medical procedures in newborn full-term and premature babies. We included randomised controlled trials only, as these provide the most reliable medical evidence. We identified 74 studies that reported on a total of more than 7000 infants in this Cochrane Review.</P>
<P>Thirty-eight studies included full-term babies only, 31 included premature babies only, and five included both full-term and premature babies. Heel lance was the painful procedure in 38 studies, and venipuncture in nine; the remaining studies investigated a wide variety of other minor painful procedures.</P>
<P>The studies used a variety of delivery methods for the sucrose solution (oral syringe, dropper or sucrose-dipped pacifier), as well as a range of concentrations and volumes of dose. Sucrose treatment was compared with giving the babies a similar volume of water, a pacifier, routine care, breastfeeding, 'facilitated tucking' (holding the infant in a flexed position with arms close to the body and hands placed to promote sucking), laser acupuncture, swaddling, warmth, anaesthetic cream for the skin (EMLA), or a combination of these. The studies used a range of pain assessment scales to measure their results.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
</P>
<P>We did not identify any studies that received funding from the industry.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was high-quality evidence that sucrose reduces different measures of newborn pain during heel lance, venipuncture and intramuscular injection. However, sucrose does not provide effective pain relief during circumcision. There is conflicting evidence for whether sucrose reduces pain for other minor painful procedures and further research is needed to investigate these more thoroughly.</P>
<P>Twenty-nine studies reported on adverse events (harms of the sucrose and other treatments) and found that the number of minor adverse events (e.g. choking or gagging) was very low, and was similar in the different groups (so not attributable to the sucrose treatment). No major adverse events were reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Although sucrose has been widely studied as a pain reliever for newborn babies, most studies have included few babies and have used many different measures of pain to assess its effectiveness. We identified high-quality evidence that sucrose reduces pain for heel lance, venipuncture and intramuscular injection. The quality of evidence was low or moderate in favour for the use of sucrose for other painful procedures.</P>

<P>To determine the efficacy, effect of dose, method of administration and safety of sucrose for relieving procedural pain in neonates as assessed by validated composite pain scores, physiological pain indicators (heart rate, respiratory rate, saturation of peripheral oxygen in the blood, transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide (gas exchange measured across the skin - TcpO<SUB>2</SUB>, TcpCO<SUB>2</SUB>), <B>n</B>ear <B>i</B>nfra<B>r</B>ed <B>s</B>pectroscopy (NIRS), <B>e</B>lectro<B>e</B>ncephalo<B>g</B>ram (EEG), or behavioural pain indicators (cry duration, proportion of time crying, proportion of time facial actions (e.g. grimace) are present), or a combination of these and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-07-07 10:56:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal. We performed electronic and manual literature searches in February 2016 for published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2016), MEDLINE (1950 to 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 2016)<I>. </I>We did not impose language restrictions.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-05-31 09:35:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RCTs in which term or preterm neonates (postnatal age maximum of 28 days after reaching 40 weeks' postmenstrual age), or both, received sucrose for procedural pain. Control interventions included no treatment, water, glucose, breast milk, breastfeeding, local anaesthetic, pacifier, positioning/containing or acupuncture.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-06-04 01:35:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our main outcome measures were composite pain scores (including a combination of behavioural, physiological and contextual indicators). Secondary outcomes included separate physiological and behavioural pain indicators. We reported a mean difference (MD) or weighted MD (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed-effect model for continuous outcome measures. For categorical data we used risk ratio (RR) and risk difference. We assessed heterogeneity by the I<SUP>2</SUP> test. We assessed the risk of bias of included trials using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-12 14:28:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seventy-four studies enrolling 7049 infants were included. Results from only a few studies could be combined in meta-analyses and for most analyses the GRADE assessments indicated low- or moderate-quality evidence. There was high-quality evidence for the beneficial effect of sucrose (24%) with non-nutritive sucking (pacifier dipped in sucrose) or 0.5 mL of sucrose orally in preterm and term infants: Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) 30 s after heel lance WMD -1.70 (95% CI -2.13 to -1.26; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% (no heterogeneity); 3 studies, n = 278); PIPP 60 s after heel lance WMD -2.14 (95% CI -3.34 to -0.94; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% (no heterogeneity; 2 studies, n = 164). There was high-quality evidence for the use of 2 mL 24% sucrose prior to venipuncture: PIPP during venipuncture WMD -2.79 (95% CI -3.76 to -1.83; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% (no heterogeneity; 2 groups in 1 study, n = 213); and intramuscular injections: PIPP during intramuscular injection WMD -1.05 (95% CI -1.98 to -0.12; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% (2 groups in 1 study, n = 232). Evidence from studies that could not be included in RevMan-analyses supported these findings. Reported adverse effects were minor and similar in the sucrose and control groups. Sucrose is not effective in reducing pain from circumcision. The effectiveness of sucrose for reducing pain/stress from other interventions such as arterial puncture, subcutaneous injection, insertion of nasogastric or orogastric tubes, bladder catherization, eye examinations and echocardiography examinations are inconclusive. Most trials indicated some benefit of sucrose use but that the evidence for other painful procedures is of lower quality as it is based on few studies of small sample sizes. The effects of sucrose on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes are unknown.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-06-28 10:23:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sucrose is effective for reducing procedural pain from single events such as heel lance, venipuncture and intramuscular injection in both preterm and term infants. No serious side effects or harms have been documented with this intervention. We could not identify an optimal dose due to inconsistency in effective sucrose dosage among studies. Further investigation of repeated administration of sucrose in neonates is needed. There is some moderate-quality evidence that sucrose in combination with other non-pharmacological interventions such as non-nutritive sucking is more effective than sucrose alone, but more research of this and sucrose in combination with pharmacological interventions is needed. Sucrose use in extremely preterm, unstable, ventilated (or a combination of these) neonates needs to be addressed. Additional research is needed to determine the minimally effective dose of sucrose during a single painful procedure and the effect of repeated sucrose administration on immediate (pain intensity) and long-term (neurodevelopmental) outcomes.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-06-13 16:27:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infants hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) undergo frequent painful tissue-breaking procedures for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Epidemiological research from audits in NICUs in high-income countries estimates that neonates undergo an average of four to 16 painful exposures per day (<LINK REF="REF-Carbajal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carbajal 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lago-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lago 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roofthooft-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roofthooft 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2011</LINK>). Similarly, estimates of procedural pain in infants in low- and middle-income countries - including those in South America (<LINK REF="REF-Linhares-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linhares 2011</LINK>), Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeong 2014</LINK>), and Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Kyololo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kyololo 2014</LINK>) - are equally high.</P>
<P>Treatment for prevention or relief of procedural pain for neonates in the NICU varies widely in practice and is generally less than optimal (<LINK REF="REF-Carbajal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carbajal 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2011</LINK>). An audit of 3508 tissue-damaging procedures performed on 582 infants across a one week period in 14 Canadian NICUs indicated that only about 50% were accompanied by any form of pharmacologic, behavioural or physical pain-relieving intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2011</LINK>). Although clinical practice guidelines outlining strategies to relieve pain from surgery, medical illness, and major procedures exist (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2014</LINK>), their quality is inconsistent.</P>
<P>Untreated pain in neonates, and particularly preterm infants, during a critical time in brain development, has the potential to result in significant immediate and long-term consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Grunau-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunau 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2013</LINK>).

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-12-31 15:21:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Arne Ohlsson">
<P>Administration of oral sucrose with or without non-nutritive sucking (NNS) (e.g. pacifiers) and other sweet solutions (e.g. glucose) prior to and during painful procedures have been the most frequently studied interventions for relief of procedural pain in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Bueno-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bueno 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2013</LINK>). Analgesic effects persist up to approximately one year of age, although the robustness of the effect may decline in older infants compared to neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2013</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-06-28 06:35:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Analgesic, calming and stress reducing effects of sucrose were first reported in infant rats (<LINK REF="REF-Blass-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blass 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ren-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ren 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shide-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shide 1989</LINK>). These effects occurred rapidly, persisted for several minutes and were blocked by systemic opioid receptor antagonists. They were age dependent and had differential maturational effects consistent with changes in the endogenous analgesic mechanisms and the development of the gustatory and pain pathways (<LINK REF="REF-Anseloni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anseloni 2002</LINK>). Researchers contend that sucrose may act at, or be mediated at, the level of the brainstem (<LINK REF="REF-Anseloni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anseloni 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anseloni-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anseloni 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 2015</LINK>), which has been shown to be a primary relay in the ascending gustatory pathway in animals (<LINK REF="REF-Anseloni-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anseloni 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In human infants, the analgesic and calming effects of sweet-tasting solutions are speculated to influence endogenous opioid pathways activated by the sweet taste (<LINK REF="REF-Blass-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blass 1994</LINK>). However, the underlying mechanisms for calming and pain may differ. These mechanisms may be additive or synergistic, but most likely depend on normal functioning of central mechanisms. Further research has demonstrated that the effects are associated with the potency of sweet taste (sweeter, more concentrated solutions), rather than volume of solution administered; with sucrose being more analgesic than glucose and fructose, and lactose not demonstrating any analgesic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Blass-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blass 1994</LINK>). In a systematic review/meta-analysis of the efficacy of sucrose for procedural pain management in 13 trials and 982 neonates, <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1997a</LINK> found that the proportion of time crying decreased with 0.24 g to 0.48 g sucrose (i.e. 2 mL of a 12% to 24% solution) administered orally two minutes prior to a painful procedure (e.g. heel lance or venipuncture).</P>
<P>Despite advances through research on the potential mechanisms of sucrose analgesia, further research is required to enhance our understanding of the opioid pathways involved in the developing infant, the effectiveness of sucrose when administered with concomitant opioids and/or other pain-relieving interventions, and with repeated use for extended periods of time (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2012</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-06-04 02:36:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review is a substantive update of the original 1998 Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1998</LINK>), and the updates completed in 2001, 2004, 2010 and 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2013</LINK>). The most recently updated version in 2013 included 57 studies - with 4730 term and preterm neonates - demonstrated that single doses of sucrose were effective and safe for reducing pain associated with several single painful procedures performed in stable full-term and preterm neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2013</LINK>). Tissue-damaging procedures included heel lance, venipuncture, eye examinations, circumcision, subcutaneous injections, bladder catheterization, and nasogastric tube insertion. A meta-analysis of four studies indicated that a range of sucrose doses (from a few drops to 0.5 mL of 24% solution) significantly reduced composite infant pain scores.</P>
<P>Repeated use, or use in extremely preterm and sick infants has rarely been addressed (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2009</LINK>). Johnston reported that preterm infants of less than 31 weeks gestational age who were exposed to more than 10 repeated doses of sucrose a day were more prone to poorer attention and motor development in early life (<LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2007</LINK>). Other studies have not reported differences between sucrose and non-sucrose groups (<LINK REF="STD-Banga-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Banga 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaspardo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gaspardo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taddio-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taddio 2009a</LINK>). However, comprehensive studies evaluating repeated dosing of sucrose for all painful procedures during hospitalizations of the neonate have not been undertaken. Concerns regarding the repeated use of sucrose and cumulative volumes administered during painful procedures in the developing brains of preterm infants have been raised (<LINK REF="REF-Ranger-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranger 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although 24% or 25% sucrose solutions are the most widely used concentrations for treatment of procedural pain in clinical practice, there is considerable variation in the volumes of sucrose reported to be effective in diminishing pain, and a more than 20-fold variation in doses used in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Taddio-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taddio 2009a</LINK>). There is currently no clear recommendation regarding the optimal volume of sucrose for analgesia in infants, or for the use of sucrose in the presence of opioid analgesia, despite frequent administration of opioids to infants during their NICU stay (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2011</LINK>). Ideally the amount of sucrose (mg/kg body weight) administered should be reported. A critical evaluation of guidelines for incorporating sucrose as an intervention for preventing or ameliorating procedural pain in infants indicates that recommendations for practitioners are not clear (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2014</LINK>). These knowledge gaps and lack of consistent strategies for effective application of knowledge most likely contribute to the current suboptimal or non-standardized utilization of sucrose in NICUs.</P>

<P>For this update the following issues were evaluated and entered into the 'Risk of bias' tables.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Random sequence generation (selection bias): for each included study, we categorized the risk of selection bias as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk - adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk - inadequate (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no, or unclear, information provided.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Allocation concealment (selection bias): for each included study, we categorized the risk of bias regarding allocation concealment as:</LI>

<LI>high risk - inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no, or unclear, information provided.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Blinding (performance bias): for each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk - adequate for personnel (a placebo that could not be distinguished from the active drug was used in the control group);</LI>
<LI>high risk - inadequate, personnel aware of group assignment;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no, or unclear, information provided.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Blinding (detection bias): for each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention.) Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.

<LI>Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias): for each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re included missing data in the analyses.

<LI>Selective reporting (reporting bias): for each included study, we described how we investigated the risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk - adequate (where it was clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review had been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk - inadequate (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes had been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; or the study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no, or unclear, information provided (the study protocol was not available).</LI>

<LI>Other bias: for each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design, or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk - no concerns of other bias raised;</LI>
<LI>high risk - e.g. investigators were aware of results before the end of the study; differences exist between abstracts and final publications of papers concerning the number of participants enrolled;</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following primary outcomes for each of the comparisons listed under <LINK TAG="OBJECTIVES" TYPE="SECTION">Objectives</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2009</LINK>):</P>

<LI>composite pain score</LI>
<LI>long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes (assessed by a standardized and validated assessment tool, a child developmental specialist, or both) at 18 to 24 months, or at any later age in childhood. No study reported on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, and therefore this outcome could not be included in the GRADE assessment.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used the RevMan table editor (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>), which is based on GRADEprofiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>), to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. We produced a summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the main comparisons and outcomes listed above (if reported) using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>). The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias. The GRADE approach considers evidence from RCTs as being of high quality, but this quality rating may be downgraded on the basis of any of five areas: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates and presence of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>). The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence as one of four grades explained below.</P>
<OL>
<LI>High quality: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate quality: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</LI>
<LI>Low: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Further research is very likely to have and important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</LI>
<LI>Very low: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. We are very uncertain about the estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The review authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence found for outcomes identified as critical or important for clinical decision making, namely: composite pain score. No study reported on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>
<P>When we considered the risk of bias, the presence of inadequate concealment of allocation or randomised assignment, incomplete follow-up or unblinded outcome assessment reduced our confidence in the effect estimates, and we downgraded the quality of evidence accordingly (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011b</LINK>). We evaluated consistency by comparing the similarity of point estimates, extent of overlap of confidence intervals and statistical criteria, including measurement of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>). We downgraded the quality of evidence when inconsistency across study results was present, large and unexplained (i.e. some studies suggested important benefit and others no effect or harm without a clinical explanation) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011c</LINK>). We assessed precision according to the 95% confidence interval around the pooled estimation (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011d</LINK>). If trials had been conducted in populations other than the target population, we would have downgraded the quality of evidence because of indirectness (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011e" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011e</LINK>). Publication bias was not applicable, as only three or fewer studies were included in each analysis. We entered data (i.e. pooled estimates of the effects and corresponding 95% confidence intervals) and made explicit judgments for each of the above aspects assessed in the 'Summary of findings' tables. Because of the large number of comparisons (n = 37) and outcomes under each comparison we elected to include only those comparisons that included outcomes for validated pain scores (BPSN, DAN, NAPI, NFCS, NIPS, N-PASS, PIPP, PIPP-R). All judgements involving the assessment of the study characteristics described above are explained in foot notes or comments in the 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>

We analyzed categorical data using risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or additional harmful outcome (NNTH) if the RD was statistically significant. We analyzed continuous data using mean difference (MD). We reported the 95% confidence interval (CI) on all estimates. Three authors (AO, SH and AS) used the formulas reported in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (Section 7.7.3.2) to convert 95% confidence intervals to standard deviations (SD) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).

<P>The studies we included enrolled between 15 and 671 infants. Forty-eight studies (65%) enrolled &lt; 100 infants. The largest study enrolled 671 term infants, who were randomised to four groups (<LINK REF="STD-Leng-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 2015</LINK>); sucrose, sucrose + non-nutritive sucking (NNS), sucrose + swaddling, and sucrose + NNS + swaddling. The second largest study enrolled 560 infants (<LINK REF="STD-Leng-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 2013</LINK>), but we could not include data for sucrose versus sterile water for increase in heart rate and decrease in oxygen saturation at three minutes after heel lance in RevMan-analyses, as they were reported as means and full ranges.</P>
<P>Few researchers provided a definition of pain or how it was conceptualised in relation to the outcomes. There were differences in study methods. Heel lance was studied as the pain stimulus in the majority of studies, however, little detail about this procedure (e.g. manual versus automated lance) was provided. Therefore, it is impossible to know if the painful stimuli were comparable in intensity, duration or frequency across studies. The length of infant observation following the heel lance was infrequently reported, and may have implications for the incidence of reported adverse effects.</P>
<P>The delivery method of sucrose differed between studies (syringe, dropper or sucrose-dipped pacifier), as did the concentrations of sucrose and the volume used. Outcomes were reported inconsistently; as means with SDs, standard errors (SE) or 95% CIs, or medians with ranges and often in graphic form without reporting of numerical data.</P>

<P>In the previous update (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2013</LINK>), 16 studies evaluated adverse effects of sucrose compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Ramenghi-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Ramenghi 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carbajal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carbajal 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guala-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Guala 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibbins-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Acharya-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Acharya 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grabska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Grabska 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Codipietro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Codipietro 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCullough-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McCullough 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taddio-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Taddio 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Sullivan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">O'Sullivan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biran-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Biran 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taddio-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taddio 2011</LINK>). Six of these studies observed minor side effects in infants (<LINK REF="STD-Gibbins-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grabska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Grabska 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCullough-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McCullough 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taddio-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Taddio 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Sullivan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">O'Sullivan 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gibbins-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gibbins 2002</LINK> described minor adverse effects in six infants, none of which occurred in the sucrose + pacifier group. One neonate who received water with pacifier choked when the water was administered but stabilized within 10 s. Three infants randomised to the sucrose group and two infants randomised to the water + pacifier groups experienced oxygen desaturation when the study intervention (sucrose or water) was administered. Each neonate recovered spontaneously with no medical intervention required. <LINK REF="STD-Grabska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Grabska 2005</LINK> confirmed choking and oxygen desaturation as possible adverse effects of administering sucrose for pain. <LINK REF="STD-McCullough-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McCullough 2008</LINK> reported that there was no significant difference between the sucrose and control groups with regard to adverse effects; the investigators observed brief apnoea or self-limiting bradycardia in some infants, but none required clinical intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2005a</LINK> reported that the adverse events related to repeated use of sucrose over the first 28 days of life were 'low' and all immediate adverse events resolved spontaneously. <LINK REF="STD-Taddio-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Taddio 2008</LINK> reported no significant differences between groups in blood glucose levels monitored during the study, as well as the incidence of spitting up the sucrose solution. Lastly, <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Sullivan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">O'Sullivan 2010</LINK> reported that four neonates in the water group and one in the sucrose group experienced oxygen desaturation or bradycardia.</P>
<P>In this current 2016 update we included 20 newly identified studies and evaluated adverse effects in 13 of them. <LINK REF="STD-Dilli-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dilli 2014</LINK> did not notice any choking episode or vomiting in any of the study infants. <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2012</LINK> observed no adverse events or side effects from the brief exposure to a heat source or change in the infants&#8217; ambient temperature, and did not mention any adverse effects related to sucrose. The <LINK REF="STD-Tutag-Lehr-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Tutag Lehr 2015</LINK> study assessed a number of adverse events including gagging, choking, and vomiting and noted that only one infant in the sucrose group experienced a mild episode of 'spitting up'. <LINK REF="STD-Thakkar-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Thakkar 2016</LINK> reported on a total of five episodes of adverse events in all four groups. One neonate each in the sucrose group, the NNS group and the sucrose + NNS group desaturated, while two neonates desaturated in the no intervention group. <LINK REF="STD-Leng-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marin-Gabriel-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Marin Gabriel 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milazzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Milazzo 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pandey-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Pandey 2013</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Simonse-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Simonse 2012</LINK> noted no adverse events in any infant. <LINK REF="STD-Potana-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Potana 2015</LINK> reported no episode of hyperglycaemia, necrotizing enterocolitis, or feed intolerance after sucrose administration. <LINK REF="STD-Abbasoglu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Abbasoglu 2015</LINK> stated that no child developed any clinically visible changes on the skin, and that no side effects were observed in their comparison of laser acupuncture with oral sucrose. <LINK REF="STD-Banga-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Banga 2015</LINK> reported that there was no significant difference in the frequency of adverse effects (fall in heart rate or oxygen saturation) across the two groups (sucrose and water).</P>
<P>Seven newly included studies did not report on adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Qahtani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Al Qahtani 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Asmerom-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Asmerom 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cignacco-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cignacco 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leng-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liaw-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Liaw 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suhrabi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Suhrabi 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2015</LINK>). In the current review, it would appear that researchers are being much more vigilant in observing and reporting adverse events. The proportion of minor adverse events remains very low with no major adverse events reported.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-12 14:28:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Below we report for each painful procedure the results from the 'Summary of findings' tables. In those tables we included only results from the most validated pain assessment scales (DAN, NFCS, NIPS, N-PASS, domains of NAPI, PIPP, PIPP-R and Total Bernese Pain Scale for Neonates) and provide GRADE assessments for the quality of the evidence. In brief paragraphs we summarize the results from outcomes that could be included in analyses in RevMan and provide short comments on the results from studies that could not be included in the RevMan-analyses.</P>
<P>As shown in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, results from only 39 of the 74 included studies could be included in RevMan-analyses, and the remaining studies are included in narrative qualitative syntheses.</P>
<P>The largest study included in any analysis was <LINK REF="STD-Leng-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 2015</LINK>, which reported on 342 infants, and the two meta analyses with the largest numbers of participants included 278 infants (3 studies) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) and 232 infants (2 groups of infants from one study) (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heel lance</HEADING>
<P>Heel lance was the most common painful procedure and was included in 38 studies. There was moderate quality evidence that sucrose (20% to 30%) compared with water significantly reduced NIPS scores during heel lance (indicating less pain with sucrose). No significant differences were noted in PIPP scores at 30 s or 60 s after heel lance, or during heel lance. There was no difference in DAN scores 30 s after heel lance (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sucrose (24%) was a more effective analgesic than breastfeeding (low quality evidence) (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>For sucrose (24%) + NNS compared with water + NNS, or pacifier dipped in sucrose compared with pacifier dipped in water there was high quality evidence that PIPP scores at 30 s (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) and 60 s (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) were significantly reduced (indicating less pain) and that the NFCS score was non-significantly reduced (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>No significant difference was found between sucrose (24%) + NNS + NIDCAP compared with breast milk (by breastfeeding or by syringe) (low quality evidence) (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was low quality evidence that sucrose was more effective than laser acupuncture in reducing heel lance-associated pain (<LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was moderate quality evidence that sucrose (24%) + NNS or sucrose (24%) + swaddling or sucrose (24%) + NNS + swaddling were more effective than sucrose alone to reduce pain associated with heel lance (<LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-08" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 8</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-09" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 9</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many studies that could not be included in RevMan-analyses, or reported on outcomes other than validated pain assessment scores supported these findings (see summary in the results section).</P>
<P>
<I>Sucrose in concentrations of 20% to 30% reduces composite and multidimensional behavioural pain scores, as well as individual behavioural and physiological pain indicators associated with heel lance. Other pain reducing interventions such as NNS and swaddling in association with sucrose provides further pain relief. </I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Venipuncture</HEADING>
<P>Venipuncture was the painful intervention in nine studies. In addition one study assessed both heel lance and venipuncture (<LINK REF="STD-Ogawa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogawa 2005</LINK>), but results were reported separately for the two interventions and we present the results under the two different headings (heel lance and venipuncture).</P>
<P>There was moderate quality evidence that sucrose (12% to 12.5%) versus water had no significant effect on the NIPS score (<LINK REF="SOF-12" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 12</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was high quality evidence that the PIPP score was significantly lower in the sucrose group (24% to 30%) than the sterile water group during venipuncture (<LINK REF="SOF-13" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 13</LINK>).</P>
<P>Comparison of sucrose (24% to 30%) versus sucrose (24% to 30%) + EMLA/liposomal lidocaine cream on the skin showed that the DAN scores during venipuncture and the recovery period were significantly higher (indicating more pain) in the sucrose group (moderate quality evidence). There were no significant differences in the PIPP scores at the same time points (<LINK REF="SOF-14" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 14</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies that could not be included in RevMan-analyses or reported outcomes using other non-validated pain assessment scores supported these findings (see summary in the results section) including lower DAN scores, NFCS scores and shorter durations of crying.</P>
<P>
<I>Sucrose (24% to 30%) reduces composite and multidimensional behavioural</I> <I>pain scores and cry variables associated with venipuncture.</I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Arterial puncture</HEADING>
<P>Arterial puncture was the painful intervention in one trial that reported on 47 infants (<LINK REF="STD-Milazzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Milazzo 2011</LINK>). There was no significant difference between the groups in the physiological outcomes measured; heart rate (beats/minute) or oxygen saturation after needle insertion, or one minute after the procedure. This one small study might have lacked power to ascertain a true difference.</P>
<P>
<I>Currently there is lack of evidence for or against the use of sucrose for arterial puncture. </I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effectiveness of sucrose for pain during subcutaneous injections</HEADING>
<P>Subcutaneous injection was studied in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mucignat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mucignat 2004</LINK>). The results could not be included in RevMan-analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Allen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1996</LINK> found that sucrose decreased the percentage of time that two-week-old infants spent crying. <LINK REF="STD-Mucignat-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mucignat 2004</LINK> found that crying time was significantly lower in the sucrose + EMLA + pacifier group. There was a significant reduction in DAN and NFCS scores in the EMLA + NNS, sucrose + NNS, and sucrose + EMLA + pacifier groups compared to NNS alone.</P>
<P>
<I>There is not sufficient evidence to judge whether sucrose is beneficial or not for reducing pain associated with subcutaneous injections. </I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effectiveness of sucrose for pain associated with intramuscular injection (immunization against hepatitis B or injection of vitamin K)</HEADING>
<P>Intramuscular injection was studied in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liaw-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liaw 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suhrabi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Suhrabi 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was low quality evidence that sucrose (20% to 25%) versus water or no intervention significantly lowers NIPS scores during the one to two minutes after immunization (<LINK REF="SOF-15" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 15</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was high quality evidence that PIPP scores during intramuscular injections were significantly lower (indicating less pain) in the sucrose group than the water group for infants born to both non-diabetic and diabetic mothers (<LINK REF="SOF-15" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 15</LINK>).</P>
<P>For sucrose (25%) versus glucose (25%) there was no significant difference in the NIPS score one to two minutes after immunization (low quality evidence) (<LINK REF="SOF-16" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 16</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data from one trial could not be entered in RevMan-analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2012</LINK> showed that providing warmth during immunization for hepatitis B decreased crying and grimacing as much as sucrose or a pacifier did, and in a similar study, <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2015</LINK>, showed that infants exposed to sucrose + warmth cried significantly less and grimaced less compared to the infants who received sucrose only.</P>
<P>
<I>There is some high quality evidence that sucrose reduces pain associated with intramuscular injections. Adding a body warmer to administration of sucrose may provide further pain relief. Further research is recommended for that co-intervention. </I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Bladder catheterization</HEADING>
<P>The painful intervention of bladder catheterization was reported in one study. There was a significantly smaller change in the DAN score in the sucrose group than the water group, and the number of infants crying at maximal catheter insertion was significantly lower in the sucrose group (moderate quality evidence) (<LINK REF="SOF-17" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 17</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Further research is required to assess the effectiveness of sucrose to reduce pain during bladder catheterization. </I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Orogastric or nasogastric tube insertion</HEADING>
<P>Orogastric or nasogastric tube insertion was studied in three trials.</P>
<P>Although the sample size was small, there was high quality evidence from one trial of a significantly lower PIPP score 30 s after the procedure in the sucrose (24%) group than in the water group, but no difference in PIPP score during the procedure or one minute after the procedure (<LINK REF="SOF-18" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 18</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies of nasogastric tube insertion could not be included in RevMan-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Kristoffersen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kristoffersen 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCullough-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McCullough 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kristoffersen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kristoffersen 2011</LINK> found that pacifier + 30% sucrose provided the most effective pain reduction (P value &lt; 0.001 versus no treatment). The highest pain score was for infants in the sterile water group. <LINK REF="STD-McCullough-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McCullough 2008</LINK> reported that the sucrose group had a significant lower median NFCS score during NG tube insertion compared with the water group.</P>
<P>
<I>Further research is required to assess the effectiveness of sucrose to reduce pain during orogastric or nasogastric tube insertion. </I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">ROP examination</HEADING>
<P>ROP examinations were studied in seven trials.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the PIPP score between groups for sucrose (24%) by syringe + swaddled + pacifier compared with water by syringe + swaddled + pacifier (low quality evidence) (<LINK REF="SOF-19" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 19</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pooling of three studies revealed a significant reduction in the PIPP score for the sucrose group when sucrose (24% to 33%; sucrose ± NNS) was compared with water (water ± NNS). There was a significant reduction in the crying time in the sucrose + NNS group (moderate quality evidence) (<LINK REF="SOF-20" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 20</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>There is limited evidence that sucrose may confer some pain relief when combined with other pain reducing interventions. Further research on sucrose in combination with other pain reducing interventions is required. </I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Circumcision</HEADING>
<P>Circumcision was studied in four trials.</P>
<P>For sucrose (24%) versus EMLA there was a significantly higher N-PASS score (indicating more pain for sucrose) during circumcision and 5 minutes after circumcision. The heart rate (beats/minute) was significantly higher and the oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the sucrose group during circumcision (low quality evidence) (<LINK REF="SOF-21" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 21</LINK>).</P>
<P>For sucrose (24%) versus EMLA + sucrose (24%) there were significantly higher N-PASS scores in the sucrose only group during circumcision and five minutes after circumcision (low quality evidence) (<LINK REF="SOF-22" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 22</LINK>). During circumcision the heart rate (beats/minute) was significantly higher and the oxygen saturation significantly lower in the sucrose only group.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>When a pacifier dipped in 24% sucrose + DPNB was compared with a pacifier dipped in water + DNPB there was a significantly lower behavioural score in the group that received sucrose. There was no significant difference in the mean plasma cortisol levels between the groups.</P>
<P>When sucrose (50%) solution on a premature nipple, with a 2 x 2 cm gauze pad inside the nipple moistened by fluid was compared with DPNB there was an increase (indicating more pain) in heart rate (beats/minute) in the sucrose group.</P>
<P>
<I>Based on low quality of evidence the use of sucrose alone is insufficient for pain relief from circumcision.</I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Echocardiography</HEADING>
<P>The stress/pain associated with echocardiography examination was reported in one low-quality evidence study. The mean PIPP score was significantly lower in the sucrose group compared with the no intervention group (<LINK REF="SOF-23" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 23</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>The use of sucrose during echocardiography deserves further study.</I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Potentially painful procedures for seven days after study entry</HEADING>
<P>One high-quality evidence study reported on two domains of the NAPI score; motor development and vigor (MDV) and alertness and orientation (AO). The potentially painful procedures included; venipuncture, heel lance, peripheral venous catheterization, orogastric or nasogastric tube insertion, intramuscular injection, suprapubic bladder tap, ROP examination and removal of adhesive tapes.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in these two domains between the sucrose (24%) and water groups at 40 weeks PMA.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes were not assessed in any of the included studies. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Adverse effects were evaluated in 29 studies and in most no side effects were reported. Minor, rare and untoward events included 'spitting up', oxygen desaturation, bradycardia, choking, and brief apnoea. Most of these occurred in both the sucrose and the control groups and were self-resolved. One study that measured blood glucose levels did not find any significant difference between the sucrose and the water group (<LINK REF="STD-Taddio-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Taddio 2008</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-07-12 14:28:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although sucrose has been studied in 74 trials that included 7049 infants, the large variation in painful procedures, dose of sucrose (concentration and volume), co-interventions in the comparison groups, assessment tools used and differences in the population (term or preterm infants) resulted in a large number of RevMan-analyses that include one or few trials. There were few infants included for each comparison and each outcome, which weakens our ability to draw firm conclusions. However, if the effectiveness of sucrose for a specific intervention were measured by a variety of instruments, and the results showed a similar reduction, this would strengthen the results and the conclusions.</P>
<P>
<I>To date, the best studied use of sucrose is for heel lance, venipuncture and intramuscular injections and for these interventions sucrose appears to offer pain relief.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>Sucrose does not seem to relieve the pain associated circumcision adequately</I> <I>and there is no strong indication that further studies are indicated. For pain/stress associate with arterial puncture, subcutaneous injection, bladder catheterization, orogastric or nasogastric tube insertion, ROP examination and echocardiography examination further research is warranted. For these procedures, we would recommend that if trials are done, a rescue dose should be available for infants in obvious distress, where the sucrose alone does not seem to be effective in preventing moderate to severe pain.</I>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-07-07 10:57:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence varied from low to high and for each of the painful interventions and comparisons the quality of the evidence is reported in separate 'Summary of findings' tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> to <LINK REF="SOF-24" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 24</LINK>). We excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials reported in abstract form only. We could include only a few studies for most comparisons and outcomes. For most outcomes we included the results of a single study only, and so tests for heterogeneity were not applicable. The main reasons for our inability to include study results in RevMan-analyses were that the results were not presented as means and SDs or were presented in graph form only.</P>
<P>By early February 2016, we had identified 74 RCTs that tested the effectiveness of sucrose in reducing stress or pain associated with common, potentially painful procedures in neonates. These studies reported on 7049 neonates. Most studies had a small sample size: the sample sizes ranged from 15 to 671 infants, and 48 studies reported on fewer than 100 infants.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-06-28 15:33:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are not aware of any biases in the review process. Two authors (AO, JY) selected the trials from the literature searches and there was complete agreement. One author (AO) abstracted data and filled in pre designed forms for 'Risk of bias' assessments and data abstraction, transformed 95% CIs to SDs and two authors (SH, AS) checked the data abstraction and transformation of data. Any discrepancies were discussed and resolved by consensus. Three authors (BS, JY, AO) are coauthors of some included trials. For these trials two authors (SH, AS) did the data abstraction and RoB assessments. One author (BS) is the developer of the PIPP and PIPP-R measure.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-07-12 14:26:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In our previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2013</LINK>), we reported inconsistency in effective sucrose dosage, although we identified studies in which the dose ranged from 0.012 g to 0.12 g. <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1999</LINK> identified that very small volumes of 24% sucrose (estimated at 0.01 g to 0.02 g) significantly reduced pain. However, the meta-analyses in <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1997a</LINK> showed 0.18 g sucrose was ineffective in reducing crying and did not differ from the control solution (water). Doses of 0.24 g or more were more effective; there was some additional benefit of administering 0.48 g to 0.50 g sucrose, but effectiveness did not increase when sucrose doses greater than 0.50 g were administered. In this updated review, a significant reduction in PIPP scores was demonstrated with sucrose doses between 0.012 g to 0.12 g (0.05 mL to 0.5 mL of 24% sucrose solution) at 30 and 60 seconds after heel lance and 0.12 g (0.5 mL) prior to ROP examinations. In these studies, there was a one- to two-point reduction in the PIPP score. <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2004</LINK> reported that clinicians and researchers consider a 20% reduction in pain to be the minimal clinically important difference, although other researchers suggest a 10% reduction may suffice (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Lemyre-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemyre 2006</LINK> used a three-point reduction on the PIPP scale as being clinically meaningful; however, a rationale for this decision was not reported. Determining the level of clinical improvement is challenging in infants, given their inability to self-report their pain and the level of improvement that could make significant differences either in treatment strategy or the affective component of pain (i.e. how bad pain makes you feel).</P>
<P>The greatest analgesic effect occurs when sucrose is administered approximately two minutes before the painful stimulus. This interval is thought to coincide with the release of endogenous opioids (<LINK REF="REF-Blass-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blass 1994</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 1999</LINK> reported increased analgesia when sucrose solution was repeatedly administered in small aliquots (i.e. 0.05 mL of 24% sucrose) at two-minute intervals throughout the painful procedure. The peak effect appears to last about four minutes; therefore, the analgesic effect may wear off if procedures are prolonged. The infant's postnatal age may influence the effectiveness of sucrose (<LINK REF="STD-Taddio-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Taddio 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse effects following the short-term use of sucrose are currently not a concern. We reported the possible adverse effects in the <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>. Adverse effects would be more likely to occur when multiple doses of are used. <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2005a</LINK> found no significant differences in incidence rates for necrotizing enterocolitis between infants who received repeated doses of sucrose over 28 days of life compared to control groups. <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2002</LINK> studied 107 preterm infants of less than 31 weeks' postmenstrual age where 1 mL of 24% sucrose or sterile water was administered up to three times, two minutes apart, for all painful procedures over a seven-day period. Johnston indicated that higher frequency of sucrose doses was predictive of lower awareness, orientation (AO), motor development and vigour (MDV) on the NAPI scale at 36 weeks, and lower (MDV) at 40 weeks. At two weeks' postnatal age, a higher number of doses of sucrose were predictive of higher Neuro-Biological Risk Score (NBRS) scores. Proposed explanations were that: (a) low neurodevelopmental scores could be related to infants receiving sucrose during the one-week study period only, and ongoing exposure to painful procedures might have resulted in heightened sensitivity to pain; or (b) the sample size was inadequate to identify other explanatory variables. Further analysis revealed that 10 or fewer doses of sucrose over a 24-hour period were unlikely to be related to poorer neurodevelopmental scores (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Banga-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Banga 2015</LINK> reported that 93 infants randomised to either repeated doses of sucrose or water for painful procedures for seven consecutive days showed no significant differences in MDV or AO scales of the NAPI scale or adverse events. <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2005a</LINK> reported no statistically significant differences between sucrose + pacifier, water + pacifier, or the standard care group on neurobiological risk status outcomes</P>
<P>Generally, infants in this review were healthy term and preterm neonates and very few were under 27 weeks' PMA at birth. Although the preterm infant's pain response is generally consistent with that of the term infant, it is often more subtle, less sustained and affected by the infant's behavioural state and severity of illness (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbins 2008</LINK>). There was no significant difference in this review between crying in term and preterm infants; however, the incidence of crying following painful stimuli is reported to be 50% less in preterm infants compared to term infants (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1994</LINK>); therefore, crying alone may not be a reliable indicator of pain in the preterm infant population and is precluded as an indicator in many validated infant pain measures.</P>
<P>Few researchers provided a definition or conceptualisation of pain as an outcome. If the reported outcomes reflect the investigators' concept of pain, then we can assume that most investigators considered proportion, percentage or duration of time crying to be the most valid indicator of pain in neonates. Although research on infant crying has delineated certain crying characteristics, such as pitch, intensity, melody and harmonics, as being good indicators of pain, these were not assessed in the sucrose studies reviewed. Cry duration may give some indication of distress. However, cry duration does not necessarily confirm or deny that the infant is in pain. For unstable ventilated infants who often do not cry following painful procedures, any cry characteristic would be an inappropriate outcome. Attempts at cry or a silent cry in ventilated infants may be reasonable to consider. A multivariate approach looking at multiple indicators or a composite pain score may be a more comprehensive approach.</P>
<P>The majority of researchers studied heel lance as the painful procedure. However, they provided little detail about this procedure (e.g. type of lancet used, number of attempts, number of squeezes, duration of the procedure). Therefore, it was impossible to determine if the painful stimuli (or painful procedures) were comparable in intensity, duration or frequency between studies. Similarly, details about other procedures (e.g. subcutaneous injection, ROP examination, bladder catheterization and circumcision) and co-interventions such as skin-to-skin (kangaroo care), breastfeeding or comforting strategies (e.g. containment, bundling, tucking or positioning) that may enhance the effect of sucrose would be desirable. The length of observation and return to baseline parameters (e.g. heart rate) of infants following procedures was not reported frequently.</P>
<P>The delivery of sucrose (by syringe, dropper or dipping pacifier) varied among studies. The pacifier promotes NNS and calming that may contribute to reducing pain-elicited distress (<LINK REF="REF-Campos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campos 1994</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Blass-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blass 1994</LINK> suggests that sucking exerts a profound behavioural effect and induces feelings of calm. Other researchers have found that NNS reduces heart rate and metabolic rate, causes infants to self-soothe and elevates the pain threshold. NNS has not been shown to affect cortisol response, vagal tone or oxygen saturation of blood (<LINK REF="REF-DiPietro-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiPietro 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gunnar-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunnar 1992</LINK>). The calming effects are not sustained following cessation of the NNS alone. This is in contrast to NNS + sucrose administration, where the effects persist for several minutes beyond the cessation of contact. Results from this 2016 update indicate that the use of sucrose with NNS appears to have synergistic effect with both single and repeated doses of sucrose.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Codipietro-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Codipietro 2008</LINK> concluded that breastfeeding was more effective than sucrose for reducing pain from heel lance in term neonates. <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2006</LINK> recommended that breastfeeding, when available, should be used to reduce procedural pain in neonates who are exposed to single painful procedures; breast milk alone in small volumes is shown to be as effective as water for the relief of procedural pain (much less so than sucrose), and its effectiveness for repeated painful procedures has not yet been established.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2010</LINK> conducted a systematic review of 14 RCTs with 1674 injections to compare the efficacy of oral sweet solutions to water or no treatment in infants aged one to 12 months. Infants who received sucrose or glucose before immunisation had moderately reduced incidence and duration of crying. <LINK REF="REF-Pillai-Riddell-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pillai Riddell 2015</LINK> in a systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions found that the most established evidence for managing procedural pain in preterm and term neonates and older infants was for NNS, swaddling, facilitated tucking, and rocking/holding. <LINK REF="REF-Bueno-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bueno 2013</LINK> in a systematic review demonstrate that 20% to 30% glucose reduces pain scores and crying during single heel lances and venipunctures and can be recommended as an alternative to sucrose for procedural pain reduction in healthy term and preterm neonates.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Slater-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slater 2010</LINK> demonstrated no significant differences in the nociceptive brain activity measured with neonatal EEG or magnitude or latency of the spinal nociceptive reflex withdrawal measured with EMG between neonates given sucrose and those given sterile water; however, the PIPP scores were significantly lower in the infants given sucrose. The authors suggested that oral sucrose does not affect activity in the neonatal brain or spinal cord and many not be an effective analgesic. The small sample size, moderate attrition rates and methods used to measure and analyse EEG and EMG recordings limit the generalization of these findings.</P>
<P>This evidence has been integrated into evidence-based sucrose consensus protocols and guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Dunbar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunbar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lefrak-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefrak 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharek-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharek 2006</LINK>). However, in an evaluation of infant pain guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2014</LINK>), recommendations were not sufficient, clear or consistent to guide clinical practice. Furthermore, in a cross-sectional survey of painful procedures in NICUs, procedural pain was managed using sweet solutions only 3.5% of the time (<LINK REF="REF-Carbajal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carbajal 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>We still have significant gaps in our understanding of how pain is processed in the developing brain and optimal assessment and treatment approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 2015</LINK>). Methodological and pain treatment issues need to be addressed, and new evidence generated in light of the existing evidence. A comprehensive approach to validating various measures to evaluate pain in neonates and a standardized approach to measuring outcomes is critical, especially when evaluating pain-relieving interventions that form the basis for clinical decision making.</P>
<P>There is a need to assess the long-term effects of sucrose administration to neonates. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes should be assessed by a standardized and validated assessment tool, a child developmental specialist, or both at 18 to 24 months or at any later age in childhood.</P>

<P>We included 74 studies in this review, 38 of which examined pain associated with heel lancing. The results from these studies provide further evidence to support the efficacy of sucrose for reducing pain from single and, to a lesser extent, repeated heel lances. The included studies reported on the use of sucrose for venipuncture, intramuscular injection, arterial puncture, subcutaneous injections, nasogastric or orogastric tube insertion, bladder catheterization, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) examinations, circumcision, and echocardiography exam in hospitalized neonates. However, except for venipuncture and intramuscular injection for which there was high-quality evidence for the use of sucrose, further studies of these other painful procedures are required due to conflicting evidence on the effect of sucrose in reducing pain. Sucrose reduces procedural pain with minimal to no reported adverse effects. Small doses of 24% sucrose (0.01 g to 0.02 g) are efficacious in preterm infants, while larger doses (0.24 g to 0.50 g) reduce the proportion of time term infants spend crying.There is some moderate-quality evidence that sucrose in combination with other non-pharmacological interventions such as non-nutritive sucking is more effective than sucrose alone. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-06-28 11:03:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The optimal dose of sucrose for pain relief in term and preterm infants has not yet been established. Researchers should consider establishing more precise and tailored doses based on the infant (e.g. postmenstrual age, severity of illness) and context in which it is to be used. Optimal sucrose doses could be assessed further using sensitivity/meta-regression techniques. More research is needed to address the analgesic and calming effects of sucrose and its interaction with other behavioural (e.g. facilitated tucking, kangaroo care), and pharmacological (e.g. morphine, fentanyl), interventions for more invasive procedures such as ROP exam and circumcision. Strategies need to be initiated to increase understanding of the underlying mechanisms of pain and sucrose for pain relief in infants. The use of repeated administrations of sucrose in neonates needs to be investigated further in terms of clinical, developmental and economic outcomes.</P>
<P>Investigators should be cautious when utilising existing evidence to answer questions on efficacy in other painful procedures that have been minimally addressed to date (e.g. lumbar punctures, peripherally inserted central catheter insertions, endotracheal intubation, chest tube insertions). Strengthened study design and methods with particular attention to the adequacy of sample size, acknowledgment of conceptualisation of pain, use of validated pain measures to determine outcomes, and context are required. Use of sucrose in neonates that are of extremely low birthweight, unstable, ventilated, or a combination of these factors needs to be addressed.</P>
<P>Replication of existing studies of high methodological quality, using a valid pain assessment measure and standard set of validated outcomes would allow for further combination of results in meta-analyses. Researchers should report on means and standard deviations (SD) in addition to medians and ranges, if the data are not normally distributed, to allow for the use of meta-analytic techniques. If researchers choose to present data in graph form, they should include the means and SDs in the text (or additional appendices). Preferably the amount of sucrose administered should be reported in g/kg body weight. Future research should focus on long-term effects of repeated sucrose administration with other behavioural and pharmacological interventions in sick and very-preterm neonates. Results should be presented for individual indicators and any composite pain scores constructed from these indicators. The relationship between pain measures and individual physiological and cognitive indicators of nociceptive brain activity should be explored further.</P>
<P>Additional research is urgently needed regarding the understanding of the neurophysiological basis of pain, as well as addressing the pressing clinical need by determining the minimally effective dose of sucrose during a single painful procedure, and the effect of repeated sucrose administration on immediate (pain intensity) and long-term (neurodevelopmental) outcomes.</P>
<P>Effective knowledge translation strategies are required to translate research evidence on sucrose into practice effectively (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2014b</LINK>). For healthcare providers these strategies could include the use of reminders, interactive education and educational outreach and regular audit and feedback sessions.</P>

During heel lance NIPS score was predictive of SBF. An increase of 1 in NIPS score was associated with 11 PU increase in SBF (R = 0.21; P = 0.09) for sucrose and 16 PU increase for placebo-treated infants (R = 0.20; P = 0.014).</P>
<P/>
<P>Increased SBF assessed by LDI is a pain response among term neonates following routine heel lance that was not completely attenuated by oral sucrose administration. Increased SBF is associated with NIPS scores. Sucrose analgesic efficacy evidenced by decreased NIPS scores for the sucrose group.
