<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review is an update of a previous Cochrane systematic review of the same title (<LINK REF="REF-Davies--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2004</LINK>) that included only one study. The literature search for this current version was extended from May 2004 to November 2012, with preservation of the original criteria for study inclusion and review objectives. The abstract, background, plain language summary, methods, results and discussion sections were rewritten to take account of relevant new information on acute lung injury and partial liquid ventilation and current guidance for the completion of Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Risk of bias assessment with tables and figures was included.</P>
<P>One new eligible study was identified and included (<LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2006</LINK>), yielding a total of two eligible studies. Pooled estimates of effect of partial liquid ventilation on mortality, days free of mechanical ventilation at 28 days and adverse events were calculated.</P>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Hovhannisyan">No evidence of benefit of partial liquid ventilation in adults with acute lung injury and some evidence of increased risk associated with its use</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Seriously ill adults can get a severe lung disease called <I>acute lung injury</I> or <I>acute respiratory distress syndrome,</I> which stops enough oxygen from getting into the blood. About half of these patients die, and for those who survive, it can take several years to get back to near normal.</P>
<P>At the height of their illness, many of these patients are unable to breathe properly and need the assistance of a breathing machine called a <I>ventilator</I>, which pushes gas into the lungs under pressure through a process called <I>artifical ventilation</I>. Artifical ventilation can cause further damage to the lungs. The need to support breathing for these patients, while avoiding further lung damage, has led to a search for gentler types of ventilation.</P>
<P>One such gentler type of ventilation is called <I>partial liquid ventilation</I>. It uses a special liquid called <I>perfluorocarbon</I> instead of the gas used by traditional ventilators.</P>
<P>The purpose of this systematic review was to determine whether patients with acute lung injury who received partial liquid ventilation were less likely to die or were more likely to recover completely than those who received traditional gas ventilation.</P>
<P>To provide the best possible answer to this question, this review was conducted in a special preplanned way with the intention of putting together the results of all selected studies to produce an overall measure of the value of partial liquid ventilation. Two eligible studies (including a total of 401 participants) were found, and a comparison was made between those who received similar doses of perfluorocarbon and those who received traditional ventilation. No evidence indicated that partial liquid ventilation reduced the risk of death or the duration of artifical ventilation, and some evidence suggested that it may increase the risk of complications, including low blood oxygen levels, low heart rate, low blood pressure, air leakage from the lungs and cardiac collapse.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are syndromes of severe respiratory failure that are associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. Artifical ventilatory support is commonly required and may exacerbate lung injury. Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) has been proposed as a less injurious form of ventilatory support for these patients. Although PLV has been shown to improve gas exchange and to reduce inflammation in experimental models of ALI, a previous systematic review did not find any evidence to support or refute its use in humans with ALI and ARDS.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-07-10 09:59:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Imelda  M Galvin">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to assess whether PLV reduced mortality (at 28 d, at discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU), at discharge from hospital and at one, two and five years) in adults with ALI or ARDS when compared with conventional ventilatory support.</P>
<P>Secondary objectives were to determine how PLV compared with conventional ventilation with regard to duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of respiratory support, duration of oxygen therapy, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, incidence of infection, long-term cognitive impairment, long-term health related quality of life, long- term lung function, long-term morbidity costs and adverse events. The following adverse events were considered: hypoxia (arterial PO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt;80 mm Hg), pneumothorax (any air leak into the pleural space requiring therapeutic intervention), hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg sustained for longer than two minutes or requiring treatment with fluids or vasoactive drugs), bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 50 beats per minute sustained for longer than one minute or requiring therapeutic intervention) and cardiac arrest (absence of effective cardiac output).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Imelda  M Galvin">
<P>In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 10, 2012, in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>; MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1966 to November 2012); EMBASE (Ovid SP, 1980 to November 2012) and CINAHL (EBSCOhost,1982 to November 2012) for published studies. In our original review, we searched until May 2004.</P>
<P>Grey literature was identified by searching conference proceedings and trial registries and by contacting experts in the field.<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>As in the original review, review authors selected randomized controlled trials that compared PLV with other forms of ventilation in adults (16 y of age or older) with ALI or ARDS, reporting one or more of the following: mortality; duration of mechanical ventilation, respiratory support, oxygen therapy, stay in the intensive care unit or stay in hospital; infection; long-term cognitive impairment or health-related quality of life; long-term lung function or cost.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews">
<P>Two review authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted the data from included studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-10 03:14:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Mark W Davies">
<P>In this updated review, one new eligible study was identified and included, yielding a total of two eligible studies (including a combined total of 401 participants). Of those 401 participants, 170 received 'high'-dose partial liquid ventilation (i.e. a mean dose of at least 20 mL/kg), 99 received 'low-dose' partial liquid ventilation (i.e. a dose of 10 mL/kg) and 132 received conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV). Pooled estimates of effect were calculated for all those who received 'high'-dose PLV versus conventional ventilation. No evidence indicated that 'high'-dose PLV either reduced mortality at 28 d (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.85, P = 0.37) or increased the number of days free of CMV at 28 d (mean difference (MD) -2.24, 95% CI -4.71 to 0.23, P<I> </I>= 0.08). The pooled estimate of effect for bradycardia in those who received PLV was significantly greater than in those who received CMV (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.81, P = 0.005). Pooled estimates of effect for the following adverse events&#65293;hypoxia, pneumothorax, hypotension and cardiac arrest&#65293;all showed a nonsignificant trend towards a higher occurrence of these events in those treated with PLV. Because neither eligible study addressed morbidity or mortality beyond 28 d, it was not possible to determine the effect of PLV on these outcomes.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-10 10:26:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Mark W Davies">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-10 03:14:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Mark W Davies">
<P>Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are characterized by the development of noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema and hypoxaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1994</LINK>). By definition, it is a secondary illness, occurring in response to an initial primary illness or insult, including severe pneumonia, pancreatitis, sepsis, trauma, shock and massive blood transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raneiri-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raneiri 2012</LINK>). Since it was first described more than four decades ago, ALI remains a major cause of acute respiratory failure, accounts for in excess of 200,000 intensive care unit (ICU) admissions annually and requires more than 3.5 million d of inpatient care per year. It carries a mortality rate of 35% to 44% and substantial survivor morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Ashbaugh-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashbaugh 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herridge-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herridge 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubenfeld-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenfeld 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubenfeld-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenfeld 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pathophysiological changes seen in ALI include endothelial inflammation, increased microvascular permeability, alveolar and interstitial oedema and de-activation of surfactant, leading to atelectasis, ventilation/perfusion mismatch and reduced lung compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Matthay-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthay 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ware-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2000</LINK>). The resultant hypoxaemia and increased work of breathing, superimposed on the initial causative acute illness, mean that many patients are unable to maintain effective spontaneous breathing and require artificial ventilatory support (<LINK REF="REF-Tobin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mechanical ventilation can exacerbate lung injury by causing ventilator-induced lung injury&#65293;a constellation of structural damage caused by volume and pressure changes and biotrauma due to activation of inflammatory cascades (<LINK REF="REF-de-Prost-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Prost 2011</LINK>). This has led to a search for less traumatic ways of providing respiratory support for these patients. Lung protective ventilation strategies, limiting tidal volumes and pressures, have been shown to improve outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>). Other techniques that have been explored include the use of nitric oxide, prone positioning, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (<LINK REF="REF-Adhikari-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adhikari 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Derdak-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derdak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taccone-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taccone 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Combes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combes 2012</LINK>). To date, none of these interventions have been shown to confer a substantial survival benefit in unselected participants with ALI (<LINK REF="REF-Adhikari-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adhikari 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Derdak-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derdak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taccone-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taccone 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Combes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combes 2012</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Mark W Davies">
<P>Partial liquid ventilation has been proposed as a possibly beneficial form of ventilatory support in ALI (<LINK REF="REF-Wiedemann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiedemann 2000</LINK>). Using liquids to facilitate gas exchange was first proposed in the 1960s, when Kylstra and colleagues showed that mammals could breathe in a liquid medium (<LINK REF="REF-Kylstra-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kylstra 1962</LINK>). Initial experiments using saline required hyperbaric conditions to dissolve enough oxygen in solution (<LINK REF="REF-Kylstra-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kylstra 1962</LINK>). This led to a search for fluids that could carry large amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide at atmospheric pressure. Only silicone oils and perfluorocarbons were found to have these properties, and as silicone oils proved toxic, only perfluorocarbons were investigated further (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1966</LINK>). These synthetic fluorinated hydrocarbons are nontoxic, have an oxygen-carrying capacity three times that of blood and low surface tension and are chemically and metabolically inert, being eliminated by evaporation (<LINK REF="REF-Kaisers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaisers 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Initial studies of liquid ventilation involved filling the lungs completely with liquid and administering a liquid tidal volume. This technique, which is called <I>total liquid ventilation,</I> necessitates the use of a specially designed ventilator (<LINK REF="REF-Kaisers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaisers 2003</LINK>). It remains largely experimental.</P>
<P>In 1991, Fuhrman and colleagues described an animal experiment in which they filled the lungs to functional residual capacity with perfluorocarbon (PFC) and provided a gaseous tidal volume (<LINK REF="REF-Fuhrman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuhrman 1991</LINK>). This technique, in which the lungs are partially filled with liquid, is called <I>partial liquid ventilation</I> (PLV) (<LINK REF="REF-Kaisers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaisers 2003</LINK>). It can be used with commercially available ventilators and has been the focus of much study in both animals and humans (<LINK REF="REF-Hernan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hernan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 1995</LINK> Effects of interventions; <LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiedemann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiedemann 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:49:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Mark W Davies">
<P>The rationale for the use of PLV in ALI centres on the physical properties of perfluorocarbons, which make them particularly useful in the context of increased surface tension at the air-gas interface, which occurs in this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Kaisers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaisers 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matthay-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthay 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The very low surface tension of PFCs gives them surfactant-like properties, thereby improving lung compliance. Twice as dense as water, they gravitate to dependent regions of the lung, reopening collapsed alveoli and acting as liquid positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaisers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaisers 2003</LINK>). Perfluorocarbons are thought to improve ventilation/perfusion matching by compressing blood vessels (through PFC-filled alveoli) in dependent regions of the lung, with consequent diversion of blood flow to the gas-filled alveoli in nondependent regions (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaisers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaisers 2003</LINK>). The kinetic effects of liquid ventilation may assist with mobilization of debris and secretions (<LINK REF="REF-Tawfic--2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tawfic 2010</LINK>). Aside from their physical properties, animal studies have shown that PFCs have anti-inflammatory effects that may reduce lung injury and inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Pakulla-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pakulla 2004</LINK>: <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2010</LINK>).</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-07-10 03:05:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to assess whether PLV reduced mortality (at 28 d, at discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU), at discharge from hospital and at one, two and five years) in adults with ALI or ARDS when compared with conventional ventilatory support.</P>
<P>Secondary objectives were to determine how PLV compared with conventional ventilation with regard to duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of respiratory support, duration of oxygen therapy, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, incidence of infection,long-term cognitive impairment, long- term health related quality of life, long-term lung function, long-term morbidity costs and adverse events. The following adverse events were considered: hypoxia (arterial PO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 80 mm Hg), pneumothorax (any air leak into the pleural space requiring therapeutic intervention), hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg sustained for longer than two minutes or requiring treatment with fluids or vasoactive drugs), bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 50 beats per minute sustained for longer than one minute or requiring therapeutic intervention) and cardiac arrest (absence of effective cardiac output).</P>

<P>For all missing data, we planned to determine whether data were 'missing completely at random', missing at random' or 'missing not at random'. Data were judged to be 'missing completely at random' and 'missing at random' if the reasons the data were missing were 'highly unlikely' and 'unlikely', respectively, to be related to the intervention or the outcome being addressed. Data were judged to be 'missing not at random' if the reason the data were missing was 'likely' related to the intervention or to the outcomes being addressed. For data judged to be 'missing not at random', we planned to determine the degree of influence this was likely to have on the effect estimates from the study and on the adequacy of statistical measures used to take account of the missing data.</P>
<P>Where appropriate alternative analyses were used to take account of missing data, we planned to use effect estimates from those analyses to contribute to our pooled estimates of effect.</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2013-07-10 10:27:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Two studies were eligible for inclusion in this updated review. The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK>) was the only study included in the original review because although the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2006</LINK>) had been completed at the time the original review was conducted, the results were not published until 2006.</P>
<P>The study included in the original review (<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK>) was a multi-centred RCT conducted between July 1995 and August 1996 at 18 centres in North America. This was a pilot study that sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PLV in adults with ARDS. The mean dose of PFC used was 22 mL/kg. As detailed below (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>), this study raised some concerns related to changes in oxygenation criteria for recruitment and the exclusion of patients with multiple organ failure, both of which may influence the generalizabilty of results.</P>
<P>The additional study included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2006</LINK>) was a multi-centred RCT that was conducted at 56 centres in Europe and North America between December 1998 and December 2000. It enrolled 311 participants, achieving its target sample size, although the sample size was changed on two occasions in response to protocol amendments and interim analyses. Investigators evaluated two doses of PFC&#65293;'low dose' of 10 mL/kg and 'high dose' of 20 mL/kg&#65293;using a control group that received CMV alone. All three groups received standardized ventilatory support, target gas exchange criteria for weaning were defined clearly a priori and the numbers of weaning attempts per day were equal between groups when these criteria were met and were not met. The study was generally well conducted and was clearly reported. The long period between the end of the study and publication of results, as highlighted by the authors, emphasizes the problems associated with publication of negative trials and the importance of negative results to medical knowledge.</P>

<P>In the study by Hirschl and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK>), the allocation sequence was generated randomly, and a centralized intervention assignment was used. These factors reduced the risk of selection bias. However, participants randomly assigned to PLV were randomly assigned on average 25 hours after other participants were randomly assigned to conventional ventilation. Those in the PLV group therefore had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation before randomization and may have been at a different stage in their disease process compared with those in the conventional ventilation group.The trial by Kacmarek and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2006</LINK>) used a randomized computer method to generate the allocation sequence. Methods used to ensure allocation concealment are not detailed in the trial report. The corresponding author was contacted for clarification, but no further information was obtained. However, given that a computer generated method of allocation was used, the overall risk of selection bias due to these elements was judged to be low.</P>

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Mark W Davies">
<P>Neither of the two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2006</LINK>) used blinding of participants or of key study personnel. However, given that the outcome measures of both studies were unambiguous and objective, the lack of blinding alone is unlikely to have had a significant impact on outcome ascertainment. In the study by Hirschl (<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK>), investigators did have access to the interim data and were aware of the preliminary results. It was on this basis that they decided to change the inclusion criteria. Also although ventilation management guidelines were provided, no measures were taken to ensure or to measure adherence to these guidelines, and no guidelines were provided regarding the discontinuation of PLV. It is therefore possible that participants may not have been treated equally with respect to ventilation management, weaning decisions and discontinuation of PLV.</P>

The trial by Hirschl (<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK>) does not provide such a statement but does provide enough information, based on adverse event data to allow the reasonable assumption that all enrolled participants were followed up for outcome assessment.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2013-07-10 10:27:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Mark W Davies">
<P>The two identified eligible studies addressed similar populations, interventions and outcomes and were therefore reasonably clinically homogenous.The trial by Kacmarek (<LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2006</LINK>) employed two doses of PLV&#65293;a higher dose of 20 mL/kg and a lower dose of 10 mL/kg. Only the higher dose was used to calculate pooled estimates of effect for the outcomes below, as the lower dose was substantially less than the mean dose of 22 mL/kg used in the trial by Hirschl (<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK>). Assessment of statistical heterogeneity is limited by the small number of included studies, but the CIs for all comparisons overlap, and I<SUP>2</SUP> values were 0 and 20% for 28 mortality-free and ventilator-free days, respectively.</P>
<P>
<B>Mortality </B>
</P>
<P>The overall pooled estimate for the RR of mortality at 28 d of PLV was 1.21 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.85, P = 0.37) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) .</P>
<P>Both included studies suggested a trend towards higher mortality when PLV was used, but neither study showed a significant difference. <LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK> reported a 28 day mortality of 36% in the CMV group and of 42% in the PLV group (RR of death with use of PLV 1.15, P = 0.63). <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2006</LINK> showed a 28 day mortality of 15% in the CMV group compared with 26.3% in the low-dose PLV group (RR 1.75, P = 0.06) and 19% in the high-dose PLV group (RR 1.27, P = 0.39).</P>
<P>
<B>Duration of ventilation </B>
</P>
<P>'Days free of mechanical ventilation' was used in both eligible trials as a measure of duration of ventilation. The overall pooled estimate of the effect of PLV on days free of mechanical ventilation at 28 d was an MD of -2.24 (95% CI -4.71 to 0.23, P = 0.08) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) .</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK> did not show a significant difference in the number of days free from the ventilator at 28 d between those who received PLV and those who received CMV (CMV = 6.7 d (standard deviation (SD) 9), PLV = 6.3 d (SD 8.06), MD -0.40, P = 0.85). <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2006</LINK> showed significantly more days free from the ventilator at 28 d in the CMV group than in the low-dose PLV group (CMV = 13 d (SD 9.3), low dose PLV = 7.4 d (SD 8.5), MD 5.6 d, P &lt; 0.001) and in the high-dose PLV group (high-dose PLV = 9.9 d (SD 9.1), MD 3.10, P = 0.043).Time to unassisted ventilation was significantly shorter in the CMV group than in both the low-dose PLV group (12.5 vs 18.9 days, MD 6.2 d, P &lt; 0.001) and the high-dose PLV group (12.5 vs 13.9 d, MD 1.4 days, P = 0.017). Also the percentage of participants alive and off ventilation at 28 d was significantly greater in the CMV group than in the low-dose PLV group (76% vs 53%, P &lt; 0.001) or the high-dose PLV group (76% vs 61%, P = 0.027).</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse events</B>
</P>
<P>Both studies reported data on the following adverse events: hypoxia, pneumothoraces, hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac arrest. Pooled estimates of effect were calculated for each of these outcomes. The RR of bradycardia in those who received PLV was 2.51 (95% CI 1.31 to 4.81, P = 0.005) (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Pooled estimates for other adverse events in those who received PLV were as follows: hypoxia RR 1.77 (95% CI 0.97 to3.24, P = 0.06), pneumothorax RR 2.06 (95% CI 0.71 to 5.95, P = 0.18), hypotension RR 1.38 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.18, P = 0.22), cardiac arrest RR 1.31 (95% CI 0.56 to 3.04, P = 0.54).</P>
<P>Both included studies reported high numbers of PLV-related adverse events. Kacmarek reported statistically significantly more adverse events in those receiving PLV (<LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2006</LINK>) and noted that most episodes of hypoxia and hypotension occurred during the first five days of drug delivery; investigators attributed these events to the need to interrupt ventilatory support to administer the PFC. A similar observation was made by Hirsch, with most adverse events occurring at the time of PFC dosing (<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Other outcomes </B>
</P>
<P>Duration of respiratory support, duration of oxygen therapy, length of stay in the ICU, length of stay in the hospital, infection (sepsis, pneumonia), long-term cognitive impairment, long-term health related quality of life, long-term lung function and costs were not addressed by either trial.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Mark W Davies">
<P>
<B>Mortality</B>
</P>
<P>This review suggests a trend toward higher 28 day mortality with the use of PLV versus CMV; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.83, P = 0.37).</P>
<P>
<B>Duration of ventilation </B>
</P>
<P>Similarly, this review suggests a trend toward fewer ventilator-free days when PLV versus CMV is used (MD 2.24 d, 95% CI 4.71 to - 0.23, P<I> </I>= 0.08).</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse events </B>
</P>
<P>Participants who received PLV were significantly more likely to suffer bradycardia (RR 2.51, CI 1.31 to 4.81, P = 0.005), and the pooled estimates of effect for other adverse events uniformly suggested trends toward higher risk for those receiving PLV, but these findings were not statistically significant.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>The findings of this review are subject to the following important limitations.</P>
<P>First, there is a lack of evidence. Only two studies were eligible for inclusion in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Second, both studies used ventilator-free days as the primary endpoint. Ventilator-free days is a rather ambiguous concept that when used as a primary outcome measure carries an unacceptably high risk of showing that a treatment that increases mortality is actually superior (<LINK REF="REF-Schoenfeld-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoenfeld 2002</LINK>); it is an outcome of dubious clinical relevance. Although 28 day mortality serves as a slightly more informative outcome measure, it provides vital outcome information only up to this limited time point. Neither study measured morbidity, which is known to be substantial and persistent in survivors of ALI/ARDS (<LINK REF="REF-Herridge-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herridge 2011</LINK>). Unfortunately, the current ongoing study of PLV in adults with ALI is assessing the oxygenation index and pulmonary mechanics as primary outcome measures, with survival again reported as a secondary outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Third, this review used the AECC definition (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1994</LINK>) of ARDS to identify those used in the individual studies and in the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Davies--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2004</LINK>). Both included studies excluded patients with serious nonpulmonary organ dysfunction and severe shock. Multiple-organ failure is the most common cause of death in those who die with ALI; therefore, the findings of the included studies may not be representative of patients with ARDS in general (<LINK REF="REF-Stapleton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stapleton 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, both studies preceded the era of lung protective ventilation and used tidal volumes well in excess of 6 mL/kg (<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK> used mean tidal volumes of 9 mL/kg actual body weight, and <LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2006</LINK> used tidal volumes of 9 mL/kg predicted body weight). Both the intervention groups and the control groups received similar tidal volumes; therefore, it is unlikely that tidal volume had a significant influence on the results of either study. However, we cannot be sure what role if any PLV has when used in accordance with ARDS Network guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the limitations detailed above, our findings should be treated with caution. It is possible that additional research that uses more participant-relevant outcomes, current definitions of ARDS (<LINK REF="REF-The-ARDS-Definition-Task-Force-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">The ARDS Definition Task Force 2012</LINK>) and lung protective ventilation strategies may produce different results.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Mark W Davies">
<P>The quality of both studies was reasonable in terms of risk of bias; however, both studies were subject to the limitations detailed above. Futhermore, both studies excluded patients with severe nonpulmonary organ dysfunction, limiting the generalizabilty of their results and hence of the results of this review .</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Every effort was made to minimize selection and reporting bias by comprehensively searching both mainstream and grey literature to identify all relevant studies, with two review authors (IMG and AS) separately applying a priori defined selection criteria to select appropriate studies for inclusion.</P>
<P>The small number of eligible studies may contribute to content bias. The findings of this review and meta-analysis need to be interpreted in the light of these limitations.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>The findings of this review are consistent with those of existing studies in humans, namely, that PLV has not been shown to offer any survival benefit over CMV in participants with ALI and ARDS. On the basis of results of the most recent human studies, PLV in fact may be inferior to CMV, and it may be associated with increased risk of adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Kacmarek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kacmarek 2006</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 2002</LINK>). Several narrative reviews include sections on PLV, all of which acknowledge that in the light of current evidence, this strategy cannot be recommended in ALI/ARDS (<LINK REF="REF-Anzueto-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anzueto 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of animal studies differ from those of human studies and of this review. Several animal models of ALI have shown promising results in terms of improvements noted as reduced inflammation and improved oxygenation and short-term survival (<LINK REF="REF-Pakulla-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pakulla 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2010</LINK>). However, as is often the case, promising animal data do not necessarily translate into useful treatments for humans.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-10 02:34:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Mark W Davies">
<P>Although no current evidence supports the use of PLV in practice, available evidence is limited. Further clinical research may therefore be appropriate but would require very careful monitoring for adverse events and would be most informative if it employed the current definition of ARDS and lung protective ventilation strategies, and if it addressed morbidity as well as mortality beyond 28 d.</P>

<P>Randomly assigned to receive PLV or CMV for a maximum of four days for the first 45 participants and a maximum of five days for subsequent participants. Groups were allocated at a PLV-to-CMV ratio of 2:1. Perflurocarbon was administered at a dosage of 5 mL/kg increments based on ideal body weight to a maximum of 30 mL/kg. Each participant was assessed every four hours for the presence of a meniscus visible within the endotracheal tube during transient ventilator disconnect. If none was present, an additional 1 to 5 mL/kg aliquot of perflubron was administered. PLV was discontinued at the discretion of the investigator; no guidelines or rules regarding discontinuation of PLV were provided<BR/>The mean duration of perflubron administration was 80 ± 3 h, with a range of 17 to 120 h<BR/>

<LI>VFDs to day 28. The initial primary outcome was oxygenation, but this was changed during the study to mean number of ventilator-free days to day 28. Ventilator-free days to day 28 were defined as follows: "On Day 28, each survivor received 1 point for every day following discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, including the day of extubation, if the patient remained successfully weaned for the remainder of the day. Participants who died during the first 28 d of the study received a VFD score of zero. Participants who were re-intubated had days counted toward a VFD only if they remained off the ventilator for the remainder of the 28-day period. For instance, if a participant was extubated for two days and then re-intubated for the remainder of the 28 d, the VFD was zero. Only those days for which the participant was extubated and remained extubated for the remainder of the 28-day experimental period counted toward VFD"</LI>

<B>
<U>Methodological rigour and external validity:</U>
</B>
</P>
<P>Concerns regarding methodological rigour and generalizability of results due to changes in selection criteria and primary endpoints during the course of the study and exclusion of patients with refractory shock and renal, hepatic and haematological dysfunction</P>

<U>Adverse event reporting: </U>
</B>
</P>
<P>The authors conclude that &#8220;PLV may be performed reasonably safely in adult patients with respiratory failure with few adverse events, which appear to be transient, self limited and with appropriate vigilance, manageable&#8221;. This statement does not accurately represent the findings of the study, which showed a higher incidence of hypoxia, hypotension, pneumothoraces, bradycardia and cardiac arrest in the partial liquid ventilation group, most of which occurred at times of perfluorocarbon dosing, and at least four episodes of cardiac arrest were attributable to treatment in this group</P>
<P>
<B>
<U>Miscellaneous:</U>
</B>
</P>
<P>A large number of post hoc analyses are reported. Post hoc analyses showed more rapid discontinuation of ventilation in the PLV arm (P = 0.045), although participants who were randomly assigned to PLV had a longer length of CMV before randomization (P = 0.12). The time lag involved may explain the difference in rapidity of discontinuation, as those randomly assigned later may already be in the recovery phase of their illness</P>

<P>Although the study was generally well conducted and well reported, there are some concerns regarding the following:</P>
<P>
<B>
<U>Internal validity:</U>
</B>
</P>
<P>Investigators changed the target sample size on two occasions in response to protocol amendments and interim analyses, and the rationale for these changes is not well explained or justified.</P>
<P>Initially a total sample size of 480 was estimated for a power of &#8805; 90% for a two-sided t test, to detect a 3 VFD difference between groups with an overall type 1 error of 5%. After protocol amendments, this was decreased to 260, and the number of VFD considered to represent a significant difference was increased from three to four. After interim analysis, the sample size was subsequently increased to 309 with a power of 80% for a two-sided t test to detect a 4 VFD difference between groups with an overall type 1 error of 5%.</P>
<P>
<B>
<U>External validity:</U>
</B>
</P>
<P>This study excluded patients with shock and severe nonpulmonary organ dysfunction, and the strict oxygenation criteria for inclusion meant that only those with severe lung injury were included. This limits its generalizability to a subset of critically ill patients with severe lung injury without multiple organ dysfunction.</P>
