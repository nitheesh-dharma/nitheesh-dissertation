<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-03-05 15:22:38 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>While more commonly used to reduce water retention, loop diuretics are are also indicated for lowering elevated blood pressure. We asked to what degree this drug class lowers blood pressure, whether individual drugs within the class produce different effects, and what the estimate of harms is associated with this class of drugs. We searched the available scientific literature to find all the trials that had addressed these questions. We found 9 trials studying the blood pressure-lowering ability of 5 different loop diuretics (furosemide, cicletanine, piretanide, indacrinone and etozolin) in 460 participants. The blood pressure-lowering effect was modest, with systolic pressure lowered by 8 mmHg and diastolic pressure by 4 mmHg. No loop diuretic drug appears to be any better or worse than others in terms of blood pressure-lowering ability. Due to lack of reporting and the short duration of included trials, this review could not provide an estimate of the harms associated with loop diuretics.</P>

<P>Antihypertensive drugs from the thiazide diuretic drug class have been shown to reduce mortality and cardiovascular morbidity.

<P>To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or both, as well as adverse events leading to participant withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects (serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids profile) due to loop diuretics versus placebo control in the treatment of people with primary hypertension.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-05 14:59:47 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 9), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov to 27 October 2014.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-03-05 15:00:07 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>We included double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials of at least three weeks duration comparing loop diuretic with a placebo in people with primary hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg at baseline.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-03-05 15:00:54 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We used weighted mean difference and a fixed effects model to combine continuous outcome data. We analysed the drop outs due to adverse effects using relative risk ratio.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-05 15:01:10 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Nine trials evaluated the dose-related blood pressure-lowering efficacy of five drugs within the loop diuretics class (furosemide 40 mg to 60 mg, cicletanine 100 mg to 150 mg, piretanide 3 mg to 6 mg, indacrinone enantiomer -2.5 mg to -10.0/+80 mg, and etozolin 200 mg) in 460 people with baseline blood pressure of 162/103 mmHg for a mean duration of 8.8 weeks. The best estimate of systolic/diastolic blood pressure-lowering efficacy of loop diuretics was -7.9 (-10.4 to -5.4) mmHg/ -4.4 (-5.9 to -2.8) mmHg. Withdrawals due to adverse effects and serum biochemical changes did not show a significant difference.</P>
<P>We performed additional searches in 2012 and 2014, which found no additional trials meeting the minimum inclusion criteria.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-05 15:01:53 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Based on the limited number of published RCTs, the systolic/diastolic blood pressure-lowering effect of loop diuretics is -8/-4 mmHg, which is likely an overestimate. We graded the quality of evidence for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimates as "low" due to the high risk of bias of included studies and the high likelihood of publication bias. We found no clinically meaningful blood pressure-lowering differences between different drugs within the loop diuretic class. The dose-ranging effects of loop diuretics could not be evaluated. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with loop diuretics because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-13 19:52:22 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-05 15:29:35 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Loop diuretics are indicated as pharmacological agents for the treatment of hypertension. Of all known diuretics they are the most powerful, capable of causing the excretion of 15% to 25% of filtered sodium. Loop diuretics include furosemide (formerly frusemide), bumetanide, torsemide, piretanide, azosemide, ethacrynic acid, indacrinone, muzolimine, ozolinone, xipamide, and tienilic acid.</P>
<P>The first loop diuretics were mercurial agents, which are of historic interest only. In 1959 chemists synthesized furosemide, which was active orally and soon became the loop diuretic of choice. Additional loop diuretics have since been developed; the differences between them is in their pharmacokinetics.</P>
<P>Loop diuretics act from the lumen side of the nephron, hence urinary, rather than serum amounts, are the major determinants of response. Since they are extensively bound to serum protein albumin, they cannot enter the tubular lumen by glomerular filtration and reach this site by active secretion by the organic acid transport pump at the straight segment of the loop of Henle. These drugs are rapidly absorbed, with peak serum concentration attained within 0.5 to 2 hours. The onset of action of furosemide after oral dosing is slower than that of other loop diuretics because its absorption rate is slower than the rate of elimination (<LINK REF="REF-Seldin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seldin 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The bioavailability of loop diuretics varies, with that of azosemide being 10%; bumetanide and torsemide 80% to 100%; and furosemide 40% to 60%, with a half-life of 1 to 2 hours. Muzolimine, xipamide, and ozolinone (the active metabolite of etozolin) have longer half-lives of 6 to 15 hours, and elimination is unchanged in people with renal insufficiency or congestive heart failure. The route of elimination varies. About half of intravenous furosemide is eliminated unchanged in the urine and most of the remainder is glucuronidated in the kidney itself. By contrast, nonrenal elimination of bumetanide and torsemide is in the liver.</P>
<P>Loop diuretics act primarily on the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, inhibiting the transport of sodium chloride out of the tubule into the interstitial tissue by inhibiting the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter on the apical membrane. Furosemide and bumetanide have a direct inhibiting effect on the carrier, acting on the chloride binding site while ethacrynic acid forms a complex with cysteine, the complex being active form of the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Materson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Materson 1983</LINK>). They lower blood pressure acutely because of their potent natriuretic effect and consequently fall in circulating blood volume. However, when used alone, loop diuretics may not have useful long-term antihypertensive effect.</P>
<P>Another group of diuretics, the thiazides, inhibit Na+/Cl- reabsorption in the early part of distal tubule. Thiazide and thiazide-related drugs include hydrochlorothiazide, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methyclothiazide, trichlormethiazide, cyclothiazide, and chlorthalidone.</P>
<P>It is currently unknown whether the blood pressure-lowering efficacy of either thiazide or loop diuretics is due solely to their diuretic effect. Diuretics were originally prescribed in starting doses that exceed the average prescribed dose that is used today.</P>
<P>Although the aim of antihypertensive drug therapy is to reduce systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure, the ultimate clinical goal is to lower the risk of cardiovascular-related mortality and morbidity. A systematic review based on 19 RCTs in 39,713 participants has shown proven benefit in terms of reduced mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.71), coronary heart disease (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95), and cardiovascular morbidity (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.76). Low-dose thiazides reduced coronary heart disease (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20) (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2009</LINK>). In the same systematic review, first-line low-dose thiazide decreased blood pressure by 13 mmHg (99% CI 12 to 14)/5 (99% CI 4 to 6) as compared to placebo or no treatment, and first-line high-dose thiazide decreased blood pressure by 14 mmHg (99% CI 13 to 15)/7 (99% CI 6 to 8) (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>No systematic review of loop diuretics has been identified that measured either their blood pressure-lowering efficacy or effectiveness in lowering cardiovascular mortality or morbidity in the treatment of primary hypertension. It is also important to establish whether loop diuretics lower blood pressure to the same degree as thiazide diuretics and other classes of antihypertensive drugs, and to know the blood pressure-lowering dose response relationship to other effects of loop diuretics, such as the adverse metabolic effects. Individual drugs within the diuretic drug class might have differing dose-related blood pressure-lowering efficacy and adverse effects.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The aims of this systematic review were to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>determine the lowest dose with the maximum blood pressure-lowering efficacy for each drug within the loop diuretic class.</LI>
<LI>establish dose equivalencies of different drugs within the loop diuretic family.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The information derived from this review should facilitate future reviews of head-to-head comparisons with other drug classes and assist clinicians in determining when to choose a loop diuretic and what dose to use.</P>

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of the trials using a trial selection form. Any discrepancies were resolved by JMW and KB.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2015-03-05 15:42:28 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Two review authors (VM, CJ) abstracted data independently using a standard form and then cross-checked.  If data were presented numerically (in tables or text) and graphically (in figures), the numeric data were preferred because of possible measurement error when estimating from graphs. A second review author confirmed all numeric calculations and extractions from graphs or figures. We resolved any discrepancies by consensus.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-03-05 15:42:56 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Two review authors (VM, CJ) checked the methodological quality of the included studies according to The Cochrane Collaboration's recommended tool. We based the risk of bias within each included study on the six domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting, with ratings of Yes (low risk of bias); No (high risk of bias); and Unclear (uncertain risk of bias). Refer to the &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; table for each study.

<P>The position of the patient during blood pressure measurement can affect the blood pressure-lowering effect. However, so as not to lose valuable data if only one position was reported, we included data from that position. When blood pressure measurement data in more than one position was available, sitting blood pressure was the first preference. If standing and supine blood pressure measurements were available, we used standing blood pressure.</P>

<P>In case of missing information in the included studies, we contacted investigators through email, letter, and/or fax to obtain the missing information.

<P>In case of missing standard deviation (SD) of the change in blood pressure, we imputed the SD based on information in the same trial or from other trials using the same dose. We used the following hierarchy (listed from high to low preference) to impute SD values:</P>
<OL>
<LI>SD of change in blood pressure from a different position than that of the blood pressure data used</LI>
<LI>SD of blood pressure at the end of treatment</LI>
<LI>SD of blood pressure at the end of treatment measured from a different position than that of the blood pressure data used</LI>
<LI>SD of blood pressure at baseline, unless this measure was used for entry criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Musini-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musini 2009</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>mean SD of change in blood pressure from other trials using the same drug and dose</LI>
<LI>mean weighted SD of change available from all other trials meeting the inclusion criteria</LI>

<P>Most trials reported end-of-treatment SD, which we imputed as SD of change from baseline for SBP as well as DBP. For the two piretanide trials (<LINK REF="STD-Homuth-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Homuth 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Verho-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Verho 1986</LINK>), since the end-of-treatment SD was not reported, the baseline SD of the SBP or DBP could be used if it was not the entry criteria for inclusion in the study. <LINK REF="STD-Homuth-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Homuth 1993</LINK> did not report the criteria for inclusion (states as hypertensive patients), and <LINK REF="STD-Verho-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Verho 1986</LINK> included patients based on DBP but did not report the baseline SD values for both SBP and DBP. We therefore calculated the mean weighted SD at the end of treatment across all trials and imputed it as SD of change. It was calculated as 13.7 mmHg for SBP in the treatment group and 15.9 mmHg for the placebo group, and 8.3 mmHg for DBP in the treatment group and 8.8 mmHg for the placebo group.</P>

<P>The original search (<LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>) led to 380 citations, of which 264 (69.5%) were excluded after reading the abstract because they did not meet the minimum inclusion criteria. Of the remaining 116 citations, 74 (25.6%) were excluded after retrieving the trials and reading the detailed methodology. We considered 42 (11.0%) potentially appropriate studies for inclusion, of which 33 studies had to be excluded for various documented reasons (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>We ran the search again with an updated search strategy from January 2009 to February 2012 (<LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>). This led to 400 additional citations, of which no new studies met the minimum inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>We ran the search a third time with an updated search strategy on 27 October 2014 (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>), which led to 721 additional citations.

<P>The earliest study evaluating the antihypertensive efficacy of loop diuretic monotherapy using office blood pressure measurements was published in 1973. The other eight studies were published during the 1980s and early 1990s. Since 1994 no further studies have been published. Of the nine included studies, seven were published in English, one in German (<LINK REF="STD-Gotzen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gotzen 1994</LINK>), and one in French (<LINK REF="STD-Bodak-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bodak 1989</LINK>). One of the included studies was industry sponsored (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 1984</LINK>); the remaining eight studies did not report the source of funding.</P>
<P>Since the number of trials meeting the inclusion criteria was very limited, to maximize data inclusion we included data in the <LINK REF="STD-Bodak-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bodak 1989</LINK> trial at the end of 6 months, although the publication did not report data between 3 and 12 weeks. All other trials ranged from 4 to 12 weeks duration. The mean weighted duration of treatment across all trials was 8.8 weeks. Including or excluding this trial from the analysis showed no significant difference in SBP or DBP MD. The mean weighted baseline SBP/DBP across all nine trials was 162.3/103.4 mmHg.</P>

<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Wertheimer-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Wertheimer 1973</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gotzen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gotzen 1994</LINK>reported random sequence generation and allocation concealment, respectively. Five of the nine trials (55% of included studies) reported blinding adequately. Four of the nine trials (44%) reported incomplete outcome data. Only two of the nine trials (22%) reported all outcome data. Four of the nine trials (44%) had high risk of other bias, and in the remaining five trials it was unclear if other risk was present. In summary, the effect size reported in this review could be an overestimate due to the potential for high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Another source of bias likely to have a significant impact on this review is the selective publication of trials. Since it only included and appraised published trial evidence, this review was evaluated for the existence of publication bias. In the absence of bias, the funnel plot should resemble a symmetrical inverted funnel. The most common way to investigate whether or not a review is subject to publication bias is to examine for funnel plot asymmetry, as smaller studies with null results remained unpublished.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-05-13 19:51:30 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>We found the paucity of data available in the public domain to evaluate the dose ranging effects of loop diuretics in the treatment of primary hypertension shocking and surprising, and suspect that there are trials meeting our inclusion criteria that have not been published. We hoped in 2009 that as a result of the publication of this systematic review trialists would contact us to provide us with more data. However, this has not happened. We continued to hope for this following the publication of this systematic review's 2012 update, but no additional data has been made available to date. The results of this systematic review emphasize the need for all studies, regardless of the findings, to be published and accessible for secondary analysis.</P>
<P>Only 9 trials with a mean duration of 8.8 weeks at a fixed dose of loop diuretics met the pre-specified inclusion criteria. These trials reported data on 460 participants (242 treated with loop diuretics and 198 with placebo) with a weighted mean age of 54.4 years and a weighted mean baseline blood pressure of 162/103 mmHg. The best estimate at this time of the overall SBP- and DBP-lowering efficacy of this drug class is 8/4 mmHg as compared to placebo control, based on double-blind RCTs. However, we have graded this result as low-quality evidence based on too few participants, high risk of bias of included studies, presence of publication bias, and the wide 95% confidence intervals, ranging from 5 mmHg to 11 mmHg systolic (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Considering the currently available data, the effect is not significantly different from thiazides, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or renin inhibitors. (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Heran-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2008a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Heran-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2008b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Musini-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musini 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the limited number of published studies, there is insufficient evidence for the various loop diuretics to generate dose-response curves for systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction. At any given dose of loop diuretics, there were only one or two studies contributing blood pressure data.</P>
<P>Given the limited data available, it is impossible with this analysis to be certain of any blood pressure-lowering differences between one or more of the drugs. To assess whether or not there are differences between different drugs and evaluate the dose equivalence between drugs within the loop diuretic class would require head-to-head trials of different loop diuretics. However, at the present time, given that all the drugs within the loop diuretic class work by the same mechanism of action and the overlapping of the 95% CI in the blood pressure-lowering effect, it is most likely that the blood pressure-lowering effect of the different loop diuretics at equivalent doses is the same.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-13 19:52:22 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-05-13 19:52:16 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Based on the limited number of published RCTs, the SBP/DBP-lowering effect of loop diuretics is -8/-4 mmHg, which is likely an overestimate due to the high risk of bias in the available studies and the high likelihood of publication bias. There are no clinically meaningful blood pressure-lowering differences between different drugs within the loop diuretic class. We could draw no conclusions regarding the dose-related decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of loop diuretics in the treatment of primary hypertension. This review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with loop diuretics because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-13 19:52:22 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Data from unpublished trials of the effect of loop diuretics on blood pressure needs to be made available. More RCTs are needed assessing the blood pressure-lowering effect of loop diuretics as compared to placebo and as compared to other classes of drugs where the blood pressure-lowering effect has already been established. In particular, the benefit of loop diuretics in the setting of renal insufficiency, the patient population where loop diuretics are often used for their antihypertensive effect, needs to be assessed.</P>

Serum procollagen type I carboxy-terminal peptide (PICP) is a biochemical marker of collagen type I fibers synthesis and myocardial deposition. The TORAFIC study is a phase IV clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of Torasemide, in its prolonged-release (PR) formulation, and Furosemide on serum PICP in patients with chronic HF (CHF) of hypertensive origin. The rationale for the study was based on previous studies showing that immediate release Torasemide, but not Furosemide, reduces myocardial fibrosis and serum PICP, and improves cardiac function and functional class in patients with CHF. Multicentre, parallel-group, randomised, open-label study with blinded evaluation of data (PROBE: Prospective Randomised Open Blinded Endpoints). Patients with NYHA class II-IV were randomised to treatment with Torasemide-PR (10 mg/day) or Furosemide (40 mg/day) on top of the best standard CHF treatment, with an 8-month follow-up. Serum PICP was measured by specific ELISA at baseline and final visit. Clinical efficacy, tolerability, safety and the quality of life of treated patients were also evaluated. Estimated sample size is 142 patients, based on prior PICP studies. The first patient was recruited in February, 2007. To date (November, 2008) 169 patients (93 men (57.4%) and 69 women (42.6%)) have been recruited at 25 Spanish centers (hospitals and Primary Care). 93.9% of them had class II HF and 6.1% class III. Mean age (+/- SD) was 65.9 (+/- 10.6) years in men and 73.2 (+/- 9.7) in women. Baseline mean SBP/DBP values were 135.09 (+/- 18.76) / 77.8 (11.82) mmHg. The most common cardiac history in the recruited patients consists of non-severe arrhythmia (29.7%),coronary artery disease (19.3%) and myocardial infarction (17.2%).

<REFERENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-13 22:24:30 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Diuretics are frequently required to treat fluid retention in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Unfortunately, they can lead to a decline in renal function, electrolyte depletion, and neurohumoral activation. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) promotes renal water reabsorption via the V2 receptor, and its levels are increased in CHF. This study was designed to assess the effects of a single oral dose of tolvaptan, a selective V 2-receptor blocker, in the absence of other medications, on renal function in human CHF and to compare this to the effects of a single oral dose of furosemide. We hypothesized that V2-receptor antagonism would yield a diuresis comparable to furosemide but would not adversely affect renal hemodynamics, plasma electrolyte concentration, or neurohumoral activation in stable human CHF. Renal and neurohumoral effects of tolvaptan and furosemide were assessed in an open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study in 14 patients with NYHA II-III CHF. Patients received placebo or 30 mg of tolvaptan on day 1 and were crossed over to the other medication on day 3. On day 5, all subjects received 80 mg of furosemide. Tolvaptan and furosemide induced similar diuretic responses. Unlike tolvaptan, furosemide increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion and decreased renal blood flow. Tolvaptan, furosemide, and placebo did not differ with respect to mean arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate, or serum sodium and potassium. We conclude that tolvaptan is an effective aquaretic with no adverse effects on renal hemodynamics or serum electrolytes in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.

<REFERENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-13 22:24:38 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Loop diuretics, such as torasemide and furosemide, are important agents in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Beneficial effects of torasemide immediate-release formulation beyond diuresis have been documented as the ability of this compound to inhibit myocardial synthesis and deposition of collagen type I in patients with chronic heart failure. In addition, torasemide-treated patients, but not furosemide-treated patients, showed decreased serum concentrations of the C-terminal propeptide of procollagen type I, a biochemical marker of myocardial fibrosis. The aim of the TORAFIC study is to test the efficacy of torasemide prolonged-release formulation (PR) in reducing myocardial fibrosis in chronic heart failure in a large, randomized clinical trial. METHODS: This prospective, Phase IV, randomized, blinded end point, active-controlled clinical trial will randomize 142 patients with chronic heart failure in New York Heart Association functional class II-IV to 8 months treatment with either torasemide-PR (10-40 mg daily) or furosemide (40-160 mg daily). The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that torasemide-PR is superior to furosemide in reducing myocardial fibrosis. The primary outcome measure is the difference in the change of serum propeptide of procollagen type I concentration from the initial to the final visit between both study groups. Secondary outcome measures include all efficacy variables related to heart failure (signs and symptoms, ECG, echocardiogram and serum levels of N-terminal brain natriuretic propeptide). Secondary safety variables are heart rate, blood pressure, laboratory data, adverse events, cardiovascular events (hospital admission, emergency department visits) and quality of life (Minnesota questionnaire). DISCUSSION: This trial will test whether torasemide-PR possesses antifibrotic properties, which may provide an additional benefit beyond diuresis in patients with chronic heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2015-05-13 22:24:38 -0700" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<REFERENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-13 22:25:33 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Background. Contrast nephropathy (CN) is a common cause of renal dysfunction that may be prevented by saline hydration and by drugs such as theophylline or furosemide. Whether oral saline hydration is as efficient as intravenous saline hydration is unknown. The preventive efficacy of theophylline and furosemide for CN remains controversial. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of oral saline hydration and of intravenous saline hydration plus theophylline or furosemide for the prevention of CN. Methods. We prospectively studied 312 patients with chronic renal failure (serum creatinine 201 +/- 81mumol/l, Cockcroft clearance 37 +/- 12 ml/min/1.73 m2), who were undergoing various radiological procedures with a non-ionic, low osmolality contrast agent. Patients were randomly assigned to four arms. In arm A, patients received 1g/10 kg of body weight/day of sodium chloride per os for 2 days before the procedure. In arm B, patients received 0.9% saline intravenously at a rate of 15 m1/kg for 6 h before the procedure. In arm C, patients received the same saline hydration as in arm B plus 5 mg/kg theophylline per os in one dose 1 h before the procedure. In arm D, patients received the same saline hydration as in arm B plus 3 mg/g of furosemide intravenously just after the procedure. Results. Patients were well-matched with no significant differences at baseline in any measured parameters. Acute renal failure, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 44 mumol/l (0.5 mg/dl), occurred in 27 out of 312 patients (8.7%). There was no significant difference between the rate of renal failure in the different arms of the study: five out of 76 (6.6%) in arm A, four out of 77 (5.2%) in arm B, six out of 80 (7.5%) in arm C and 12 out of 79 (15.%) in arm D. No patient had fluid overload or a significant increase in blood pressure in the 2 days following the radiological procedure.

Genuine dose-response studies on combination therapy are not available and published studies involved adding one drug on top of 'usual treatment'. Sixteen different dosage combinations of trandolapril and bumetanide was tested in a double blind, double placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple cross-over study in a 16 times six balanced incomplete Latin square design. Patients reported optimal quality of life on the sub maximal dose bumetanide. Bumetanide decreased left ventricular function and increased heart rate and plasma noradrenaline in a dose dependent manner. Doses of bumetanide of more than 05 mg, given twice daily significantly decreased the quality of life and increased diuresis. Weight loss was maximal on 05 mg bumetanide twice daily. Trandolapril significantly reduced systolic blood pressure with the maximal effect at 05 mg daily. Both drugs significantly increased renin concentration with a significant potentiating interaction. It was not possible to detect beneficial effects of combination therapies. The optimal dosage of Bumetanide appeared to be 05 mg twice daily based on its effect on quality of life and weight loss. Estimated by the reduction in systolic blood pressure the optimal dosage of Trandolapril appeared to be 05 mg once daily. Conclusions: It appears that patients should be given less than the usually recommended dosages. Patients may be treated with a low dose loop diuretic, if signs of water retention are present or if symptomatic relief is desired. 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2015-05-13 22:25:51 -0700" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Chronic diuretic therapy causes persistent and potentially harmful neuroendocrine activation. Alternatively, in patients in whom neuroendocrine activation is blocked with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-blockers, diuretics may be beneficial by decreasing preload and afterload and preventing congestion. We aimed to assess the effect of the loop diuretic, torasemide on quality of life, and surrogate markers of prognosis when given to patients with LVSD who were not clinically congested and who were optimally treated with ACE-inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor antagonists) and beta-blockers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty patients with stable LVSD who had no clinically detectable fluid overload were randomized to receive either torasemide 5 mg daily or placebo for 3 months (Phase A), and after a washout phase of 2 months, cross-over was performed for 3 months (Phase B). Diuretic therapy did not cause significant change in peak VO(2), mean N-terminal pro-hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, or measures of quality of life compared with placebo. Diuretic therapy did however lead to significant fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and increase in plasma renin levels compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: Diuretic therapy with torasemide is not superior to placebo in improving peak VO(2) or reducing NT-proBNP levels in patients with left ventricular dysfunction who are not clinically congested.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2015-05-13 22:26:21 -0700" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Doses of loop diuretics administered in this trial (10 and 25 mg/day of torasemide and furosemide, respectively) had been shown to be equipotent in healthy subjects. Torasemide induced significantly greater natriuresis than furosemide (p less than 0.02), with a twofold greater percentage increase in basal values (day 1: 130% vs. 50%; day 2: 104% vs. 42%; and day 3: 65% vs. 26%, respectively). Body weight loss was significantly higher during torasemide (p less than 0.02) administration, and the overall decrease at the end of the treatment was twice as high for furosemide (2.5 +/- 0.6 kg vs. 1.3 +/- 0.4 kg, respectively). Diuresis was also higher during torasemide administration, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.08). The extent of kaliuresis observed during the two treatments was almost identical despite the striking differences in the natriuretic response. The effects of the two treatments on plasma electrolytes, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, mean arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma arginine vasopressin concentration were similar. Both drugs caused increases in plasma renin activity at the end of the treatment, whereas plasma aldosterone concentration slightly increased only after torasemide administration. Despite the presence of a trend toward a more pronounced effect on these parameters after torasemide administration, no significant difference between the two treatments was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2015-05-13 22:28:03 -0700" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

However, the direct cardiac effects of this compound class have not been investigated to date. METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 111 patients (109 men and 2 women) received a 1-hour infusion of 5, 10, and 15 mg SLV320, an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, placebo, or 40 mg furosemide. Mean age was 57.9 years, mean ejection fraction was 28.1%, 82 patients were of New York Heart Association class II, and 29 patients were of New York Heart Association class III. Hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, right atrial pressure, and cardiac output) were determined. Kidney function was assessed by cystatin C measurements and by analysis of urine output and urine electrolytes. In addition, pharmacokinetics of SLV320 and ex vivo inhibition of adenosine A1 receptor activity were performed. SLV320 was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were observed. Heart rate, blood pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, right atrial pressure, and cardiac output were not altered by any dose of SLV320. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was significantly (P=0.04) decreased by furosemide (-6.2+/-5.9 mm Hg). Systemic vascular resistance was significantly (P=0.04) increased in the furosemide group (+166.70+/-261.87 dynes . s(-1) . cm(-5)), whereas all SLV320 groups showed no significant alterations of systemic vascular resistance. Changes from baseline cystatin C plasma concentrations decreased after 10 mg SLV320 (-0.093+/-0.137 mg/L, P=0.046), whereas furosemide resulted in a significant (P=0.03) increase of cystatin C (+0.052+/-0.065 mg/L) versus baseline. All values represent mean changes+/-SD from baseline at 3 hours postdosing: SLV320 (10 and 15 mg) increased significantly sodium excretion and diuresis compared with placebo during the 0- to 6-hour collection period postdosing. CONCLUSIONS: SLV320 infusion shows no immediate effects on cardiac hemodynamics. SLV320 might improve glomerular filtration rate while simultaneously promoting natriuresis and diuresis.

Infants were randomly selected to receive either furosemide, 4 mg/kg in two divided doses on alternate days orally, or placebo for 8 days, followed by crossover to the alternate-therapy for an additional 8-day period. The two study periods were separated by a 48-hour washout period. Dynamic compliance, total pulmonary resistance, the concentration of electrolytes in serum, and the concentrations of calcium and creatinine in urine were measured on nontreatment days. Alternate-day furosemide therapy increased dynamic lung compliance by 76 +/- 112% and decreased total pulmonary resistance by 20 +/- 39%, compared with placebo (both variables p = 0.032). Alternate-day furosemide therapy did not result in increased urine output, electrolyte abnormalities, or increased urinary calcium excretion. We conclude that this simplified treatment regimen may be useful in the management of infants with chronic bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The results support our previous speculation that furosemide improves pulmonary function by mechanisms unrelated to its diuretic properties.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2015-05-13 22:30:18 -0700" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Whether continuous infusions are more effective in patients on higher outpatient diuretic doses, who may be more diuretic refractory, is unclear. Methods: 308 patients with acute HF receiving 80 to 240 mg oral furosemide equivalents were randomized in 2x2 design to (1) low (1x oral dose) vs. high intensity (2.5x oral) diuretics; (2) continuous vs. Q12 hour bolus dosing. Patients were grouped by outpatient dose (low: =120 mg; n=177). Characteristics between groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum or Chi-square tests. Linear regression, with interaction between strategy (continuous vs. bolus) and outpatient dose, was used to assess associations between strategy and outcome. Results: As compared to the lower dose group, patients on a higher outpatient diuretic dose were less often on RAS inhibitors (p=.014), had worse renal function (p=.003) and more severe symptoms (by global and dyspnea VAS, p=120 mg outpatient furosemide had larger net fluid loss at 72 hr (NFL72) with bolus vs. continuous strategy (4436 vs. 4113 ml), whereas patients on =120 mg (HR=0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.97; p=.03). Conclusions: Higher outpatient diuretic dose on HF admission is associated with greater disease severity and longer length of stay. In patients admitted with acute HF, outpatient diuretic dose may impact the efficacy and therefore choice of initial diuretic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2015-05-13 22:30:37 -0700" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
