<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-08-07 14:47:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Training in 'advanced trauma life support' (ATLS) is increasingly used in both rich and poor countries. ATLS is intended to improve the way in which care is given to injured people, thereby reducing death and disability. Some research has been done that suggests ATLS programmes improve the knowledge of staff who have been trained, but there have been no controlled trials to show the impact of ATLS-trained staff (or staff trained in similar programmes) on the rates of death and disability of injured patients themselves. The review calls for more research and puts forward suggestions about how future research might be conducted.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-01-27 13:10:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Injury is responsible for an increasing global burden of death and disability. As a result, new models of trauma care have been developed. Many of these, though initially developed in high-income countries (HICs), are now being adopted in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). One such trauma care model is advanced trauma life support (ATLS) training in hospitals, which is being promoted in LMICs as a strategy for improving outcomes for victims of trauma. The impact of this health service intervention, however, has not been rigorously tested by means of a systematic review in either HIC or LMIC settings.</P>

<P>There is no evidence from controlled trials that ATLS or similar programs impact the outcome for victims of injury, although there is some evidence that educational initiatives improve knowledge of hospital staff of available emergency interventions. Furthermore, there is no evidence that trauma management systems that incorporate ATLS training impact positively on outcome. Future research should concentrate on the evaluation of trauma systems incorporating ATLS, both within hospitals and at the health system level, by using more rigorous research designs.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-08-14 16:42:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-14 10:42:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Global Burden of Disease Study has repeatedly identified injuries as one of the top ten causes of death and disability worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2006</LINK>). Injury is predicted to rise in the rankings by the year 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-Mathers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathers 2006</LINK>). While infectious diseases continue to be extremely important causes of death in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), there are increasing challenges posed by injury and non-communicable disease for premature mortality and morbidity globally (<LINK REF="REF-Gwatkin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwatkin 1997</LINK>). Injuries place a disproportionately large burden of disease on young people, causing premature loss of productive life, high medical care costs, significant degrees of disability, and a large socio-economic loss to society (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recently there have been calls by the public health community, professional associations and nongovernmental organisations for the formulation of a strategy to decrease the social burden from injuries. Responding to injuries requires considerable attention to preventive efforts (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1996</LINK>), as well as improvements in healthcare provision to reduce deaths, disability and costs to society (<LINK REF="REF-Sethi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sethi 2000</LINK>). In many high-income countries (HICs), reductions in trauma mortality of 15-20% have been achieved in the last few decades (<LINK REF="REF-Cales-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cales 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lecky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lecky 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1996</LINK>), largely as a result of improved healthcare interventions and trauma care systems. Training programmes such as Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) established by the American College of Surgeons and introduced in North America, the United Kingdom and Australia, have presumably contributed to this reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Kirsch-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirsch 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reines-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reines 1988</LINK>). Improvement in the organisation and delivery of trauma services, with ATLS-trained staff acting as co-ordinated trauma response teams, are thought to improve the timing and quality of the emergency response in the 'golden hour' (<LINK REF="REF-Calicott-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calicott 1980</LINK>), specifically through the appropriate use of acute interventions such as fluid replacement, endotracheal intubation, chest drainage and emergency surgery.</P>
<P>However, the evidence of effectiveness and impact of ATLS has not been rigorously tested for either HIC and or LMIC settings. Currently, the evidence base for trauma services in LMICs is almost non-existent. Yet, despite this lack of evidence, the ATLS system is being promoted as a model for improving outcomes for trauma victims in LMICs (<LINK REF="REF-Ali-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ali 1994</LINK>). In resource-constrained settings, models of trauma care developed in HICs need to be considered carefully based on effectiveness, affordability and appropriateness before they can be recommended for implementation in LMICs (<LINK REF="REF-Sethi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sethi 2000</LINK>). One way of ensuring that trauma care interventions add value for money is to evaluate the evidence of supporting their effectiveness and impact. A previous systematic review has examined ATLS interventions in the pre-hospital setting (<LINK REF="REF-Jayaraman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jayaraman 2014</LINK>). This review seeks to evaluate the impact of hospital-based ATLS training programmes on injury mortality and morbidity.</P>

<P>Eligible trials will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled trials (CTs), and controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies, each of which is defined as follows.<BR/>
<BR/>RCT: a study involving at least one intervention and one control treatment, with concurrent enrolment and follow up of the intervention and control groups, in which the interventions to be tested are selected by a random process such as the use of a random numbers table (coin flips are also acceptable). If the author(s) state explicitly (usually by using some variant of the term 'random' to describe the allocation procedure used) that the groups compared in the trial were established by random allocation, then the trial is classified as an 'RCT'.</P>
<P>CT: a study in which treatment allocations are made using odd or even numbers, days of the week, or other such pseudo- or quasi-random processes. These are not truly randomised and a study employing any of these techniques for assignment is classified as a CT. If a trial has not been described as randomised, but either is a quasi-randomised study or may have been randomised or quasi-randomised, then it is classified as a 'CT'. The classification is based solely on what the author has written, not on a reader's interpretation. Efforts will, however, be made to contact the authors for confirmation, if necessary.</P>
<P>CBA: a study design with contemporaneous data collection before and after the intervention, and an appropriate control site or activity. Prospective studies were considered eligible for inclusion.</P>

<P>Previously, four studies were excluded because even though they showed improvements in processes of care, they did not report on patient outcomes such as death and morbidity because they failed to fulfill the pre-set criteria of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Aboutanos-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aboutanos 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ali-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ali-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2000</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-08-14 10:36:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not find any study that met the inclusion criteria, despite conducting a very thorough literature search in which a total of 3109 citations, were screened to identify eligible trials. We believe it is unlikely that relevant trials have been overlooked since a search for new studies has been conducted every few years since 2004.</P>
<P>At present, the evidence base for the impact of an ATLS training programme (or equivalent) on trauma outcomes is poor. This is not entirely unexpected, as ATLS training is an educational approach rather than a process approach per se, and the evaluation of initiatives that are entirely hospital or system-based is complex and difficult. In addition, as ATLS training is applied to an individual, and individuals change their places of practice, it is difficult to quantify which patients have been treated by ATLS-trained health professionals. However, there is some evidence that such educational interventions addressing emergencies and injury can increase knowledge of early and effective intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Aboutanos-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aboutanos 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ali-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ali-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In some hospitals, ATLS training forms part of a process approach to trauma care, of which the establishment of trauma teams is an example. In some cities, this has been taken further with the introduction of trauma systems that 'stream' patients to particular receiving hospitals. Needless to say, trying to separate the influence of education, process approaches, experience related to higher patient volumes, and systems issues, is methodologically challenging and, to date, has not been completed. There is no evidence to conclude that educational interventions such as ATLS or similar training are <I>not</I> valuable. ATLS principles can be easily, and cost effectively, incorporated into undergraduate or post-graduate training programmes and teach an approach that is transferable to other critically ill patients. The more difficult questions revolve around the formal interaction between ATLS training and systems of care within hospitals and health care systems. This review highlights the lack of rigorous evidence to show that ATLS training results in improved outcomes from injury and highlights the complexity of conducting such research, in view of the systems-related issues.</P>
<P>We are aware that advocates for the expansion of ATLS programmes will point out that the aim of this training has always been to improve the knowledge and skills of individual doctors. In our inclusion criteria for this review we did not specify studies that attempted to assess whether such improvements were achieved, believing that reductions in mortality and morbidity are the ultimate goals of such interventions. It is also true that the number of doctors who have undergone ATLS training will vary considerably between hospitals, as training may often be done on an individual rather than an institutional basis.</P>
<P>It is possible that there may be studies of ATLS programmes which have examined outcomes falling outside our inclusion criteria. As with all systematic reviews, it is worth remembering that <I>no evidence of effect does not equal evidence of no effect</I>. Nevertheless, we believe that our review highlights the lack of evidence on which to base current practice and policy in many countries.</P>
<P>This review emphasises the need to conduct well designed intervention studies to establish the effectiveness and impact of trauma services, in order to ensure that policies, particularly in LMICs, are based on firm supporting evidence. A number of factors need to be taken into account when planning evaluative and comparative research of the effectiveness of hospitals, or health systems with trauma systems that incorporate ATLS training to reduce mortality and morbidity following trauma. These include the impact of pre-hospital interventions, the impact of scene time (i.e. time ambulance staff spend at scene of injury), the mechanism of trauma (blunt versus penetrating), injury severity, injury pattern (presence and severity of head injury), and the mode of pre-hospital transport. A conventional RCT is unlikely to be able to address such questions, given the problems of comparing different levels of training and different trauma systems, unless it is large, with cluster randomisation and a factorial design. A controlled, sequential before-and-after design (similar to the Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support Study (<LINK REF="REF-Stiell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiell 1999</LINK>)), conducted in a health system that currently does not have an organised trauma response is likely to be able to answer this question and the related question of the value of advanced life support interventions by pre-hospital health care providers.</P>

<P>There are no controlled trials of the effect of ATLS training (or similar) on outcomes of injury victims. There is some evidence that educational initiatives improve knowledge of immediate emergency response and treatment of injured patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1994</LINK>). Future research should concentrate on the evaluation of trauma systems with ATLS training, both within hospitals and at the health system level.</P>

<P>In view of the wide acceptance in high income countries that trauma systems incorporating ATLS programmes are beneficial to injury victims, and its widespread implementation, it may be difficult to conduct evaluative research in these settings. Future research should concentrate on the evaluation of trauma systems, both within hospitals and at the health system level. A controlled, sequential before-and-after design (similar to the Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support Study) conducted in a health system that does not currently have an organised trauma response is likely to be able to answer this question. This may be preferable to an RCT, given the problems of comparing different levels of training and differences in trauma systems, unless the trial is large, with cluster randomisation and a factorial design.</P>
