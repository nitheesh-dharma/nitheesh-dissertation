<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Are heat and moisture exchangers or heated humidifiers more effective in preventing complications such as airway blockages and pneumonia in adults, children or infants who receive invasive mechanical ventilation.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>When mechanical ventilation is used to keep critically ill people breathing effectively, the upper airway must be humidified by artificial means. Heat and moisture exchangers and heated humidifiers are the most commonly used methods of artificial humidification. Both have been associated with specific advantages and disadvantages; for example, heat and moisture exchangers are thought to be more likely to cause airway obstruction while heated humidifiers have been associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (swelling (inflammation) of the tissue in one or both lungs).</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for studies up to May 2017. We included 34 trials in the review, with 2848 participants from 12 countries. The majority of trials (27) were set in an intensive care unit with one in a neonatal intensive care unit. The remaining seven studies were done in an operating department. Participants were infants in three studies with adults (average age of 40 to 69 years) in the remainder.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was no overall difference in the rates of airway blockage, pneumonia or death in adults who were ventilated through heat and moisture exchangers compared to adults ventilated through a heated humidifier. There was some evidence that the occurrence of pneumonia may be lowered by using heat and moisture exchangers that capture less moisture. There was not enough information to make any conclusions about either of these methods in children or infants.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The overall low quality of this evidence was low, making it difficult to be confident about these findings.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Invasive ventilation is used to assist or replace breathing when a person is unable to breathe adequately on their own. Because the upper airway is bypassed during mechanical ventilation, the respiratory system is no longer able to warm and moisten inhaled gases, potentially causing additional breathing problems in people who already require assisted breathing<B>. </B>To prevent these problems, gases are artificially warmed and humidified. There are two main forms of humidification, heat and moisture exchangers (HME) or heated humidifiers (HH). Both are associated with potential benefits and advantages but it is unclear whether HME or HH are more effective in preventing some of the negative outcomes associated with mechanical ventilation. This review was originally published in 2010 and updated in 2017.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:38:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess whether heat and moisture exchangers or heated humidifiers are more effective in preventing complications in people receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and to identify whether the age group of participants, length of humidification, type of HME, and ventilation delivered through a tracheostomy had an effect on these findings.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL up to May 2017 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. There were no language limitations.<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included RCTs comparing HMEs to HHs in adults and children receiving invasive ventilation. We included randomized cross-over studies.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the quality of each study and extracted the relevant data. Where possible, we analysed data through meta-analysis. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI or standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for parallel studies. For cross-over trials, we calculated the MD and 95% CI using correlation estimates to correct for paired analyses. We aimed to conduct subgroup analyses based on the age group of participants, how long they received humidification, type of HME and whether ventilation was delivered through a tracheostomy. We also conducted sensitivity analysis to identify whether the quality of trials had an effect on meta-analytic findings.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 34 trials with 2848 participants; 26 studies were parallel-group design (2725 participants) and eight used a cross-over design (123 participants). Only three included studies reported data for infants or children. Two further studies (76 participants) are awaiting classification.</P>
<P>There was no overall statistical difference in artificial airway occlusion (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.60 to 4.19; participants = 2171; studies = 15; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 54%), mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.20; participants = 1951; studies = 12; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) or pneumonia (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.19; participants = 2251; studies = 13; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 27%). There was some evidence that hydrophobic HMEs may reduce the risk of pneumonia compared to HHs (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.82; participants = 469; studies = 3; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%)..</P>
<P>The overall GRADE quality of evidence was low. Although the overall methodological risk of bias was generally unclear for selection and detection bias and low risk for follow-up, the selection of study participants who were considered suitable for HME and in some studies removing participants from the HME group made the findings of this review difficult to generalize.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence suggests no difference between HMEs and HHs on the primary outcomes of airway blockages, pneumonia and mortality. However, the overall low quality of this evidence makes it difficult to be confident about these findings. Further research is needed to compare HMEs to HHs, particularly in paediatric and neonatal populations, but research is also needed to more effectively compare different types of HME to each other as well as different types of HH.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-09-14 00:14:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mechanical ventilation is used to assist or replace breathing when a person is unable to breathe adequately on their own (<LINK REF="REF-AARC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">AARC 2012</LINK>). Mechanical ventilation is provided through an endotracheal tube (ETT) inserted into the trachea through the mouth or nose, or directly into the trachea through a surgical incision known as a tracheostomy and now more commonly through a technique known as percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy which can be conducted at the bedside using a guidewire and tracheal inflation (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2017</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because the upper airway is bypassed during mechanical ventilation, the respiratory system is no longer able to warm and moisten inhaled gases (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Ashry-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Ashry 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schiffmann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffmann 2006</LINK>). The consequent delivery of cooler and dryer gases can cause a range of problems including decreased body temperature, increased difficulty in breathing and airway obstruction in people who already require assisted breathing (<LINK REF="REF-AARC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">AARC 2012</LINK>). To prevent these problems, humidification is routinely provided for people who receive invasive mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Branson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Branson 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two main forms of humidification used during mechanical ventilation are active or passive.</P>
<P>Active humidification is provided by a heated humidifier (HH), which warms and moistens gases as they pass over the surface of a heated water reservoir attached to the ventilator. The system may also have a heated wire in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit to prevent the warmed air cooling and condensing as it moves from the reservoir to the person (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Ashry-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Ashry 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inhaled gases may also be passively humidified with a heat and moisture exchanger (HME). This device contains a condenser, which retains heat and moisture from every exhaled breath and returns it back to the person in the inspired breath (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Ashry-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Ashry 2014</LINK>). Because there are concerns that the performance of HMEs decrease with prolonged use, most manufacturers recommend changing HMEs every 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-AARC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">AARC 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The type of condenser used in an HME varies. They can be hydrophobic, hygroscopic or combined condensers (<LINK REF="REF-AARC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">AARC 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Al-Ashry-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Ashry 2014</LINK>). In hydrophobic HMEs, the condenser is made of a water repelling element. Hygroscopic condensers are based on salts (such as calcium or lithium chloride) which absorb water vapour during expiration and release it during inspiration. In combination HMEs, a hygroscopic salt is added inside the hydrophobic HME.</P>
<P>HMEs may have filters which prevent viruses or bacteria from inspired air reaching the person's airway (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Ashry-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Ashry 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>An active heated water source can be added to HMEs converting them from passive to active, increasing their humidification capacity. Another active HME model releases heat through chemical reactions with exhaled carbon dioxide (<LINK REF="REF-AARC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">AARC 2012</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-09-14 00:14:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a major source of morbidity and mortality in people who receive invasive mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Lorente-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorente 2010</LINK>). It increases hospital stay by a mean of seven to nine days per person and is associated with an "attributable mortality" of 33% to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koenig-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koenig 2006</LINK>). VAP accounts for up to 25% of all intensive care unit (ICU) infections (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koenig-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koenig 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kola-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kola 2005</LINK>). The high level of bacterial colonization associated with HHs means they may be considered a greater risk for VAP than HME (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Ashry-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Ashry 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koenig-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koenig 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ricard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricard 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>HMEs may be more cost effective than HHs in people without contraindications for their use (<LINK REF="REF-Dodek-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodek 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorente-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorente 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ricard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricard 2006</LINK>), but are also associated with complications. Because HMEs are thought to provide lower levels of humidification than HHs and increase inspiratory and expiratory airway resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Ashry-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Ashry 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rathgeber-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rathgeber 2006</LINK>), they are associated with increased rates of airway occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-AARC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">AARC 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hess-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hess 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koenig-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koenig 2006</LINK>). Thus, they are not recommended in people with thick, copious secretions, pulmonary trauma or inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-AARC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">AARC 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Branson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Branson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rathgeber-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rathgeber 2006</LINK>). HMEs may also be inappropriate for children and babies as their smaller airways may mean they are at a greater risk of airway occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Rathgeber-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rathgeber 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schiffmann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffmann 2006</LINK>). In addition, because HMEs require heat retention to provide effective warming of inspired gases, they can be contraindicated for people with hypothermia particularly children and babies who are more susceptible to heat loss (<LINK REF="REF-AARC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">AARC 2012</LINK>). There may, however, be differences in risk and benefit between different types of HME. Hydrophobic HMEs may be more likely to cause ETT occlusion compared to HMEs with a hygroscopic element (<LINK REF="REF-AARC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">AARC 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Al-Ashry-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Ashry 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although humidification for mechanically ventilated people is widely accepted as an essential practice, there is a lack of consensus over which method of humidification is preferable. In their review of VAP, Lorente and colleagues commented that while new evidence-based guidelines for prevention of VAP had been published in the previous two years by American, Canadian and European scientific societies, recommendations on whether HMEs or HHs should be used were not consistent (<LINK REF="REF-Lorente-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorente 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our original systematic review of 33 trials, with 2833 participants of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of HH to HME in people undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation found no clear evidence that either method was less likely to be associated with adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2010b</LINK>). This review update included the relevant literature from 2010 to 2015.</P>

<P>Before beginning this review, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) to identify whether any relevant systematic reviews already existed.</P>
<P>We searched the current issue of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 5); MEDLINE, OvidSP (1966 to 30 May 2017); Embase, OvidSP (1980 to 30 May 2017); and CINAHL, EBSCO host (1982 to 30 May 2017) for trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodology filter</HEADING>
<P>A modified version of the first two phases of the Cochrane RCT search strategy was used to identify RCTs and controlled clinical trials. We combined the population and intervention terms, as outlined above, with the methodology terms. Where duplicate publication occurred, we used the publication with the most data as the primary publication for the review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For meta-analyses of dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using a random-effects model. If data were only reported by a single study, these data were also calculated and reported but a forest plot was not generated.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI using a random-effects model.</P>
<P>As a meta-analysis is based on assumptions of normality, all continuous data were checked for skew before inclusion. Data were considered substantially skewed if the standard deviation was greater than the mean (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If data were substantially skewed, they were not included in meta-analyses and were reported separately.</P>

<P>Where cluster randomized trials were identified, we planned to make appropriate corrections for the cluster design if appropriate data had been reported and these data incorporated into the meta-analyses. However, no data which could be used to make these corrections were reported in included studies.</P>
<P>If parallel studies reported data for more than one group for each intervention (e.g. two ventilation pressures for both HME and HH), we calculated pooled means and SDs and used them in the meta-analysis. In three of the four studies that used more than one type of HME or HH, data were given separately for each type of intervention. Therefore, we pooled data for HME or HH in these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Luchetti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Luchetti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ricard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ricard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villafane-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Villafane 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>As there is no method for pooling mean and variance data from cross-over studies, data were used from only one of the two groups of participants receiving each intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Girault-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girault 2003</LINK>. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2000</LINK>, we used the data reported for people who were chemically paralysed and sedated rather than those who were breathing spontaneously as this was more consistent with the other included studies. <LINK REF="STD-Girault-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girault 2003</LINK> reported data for people receiving two different levels of pressure support ventilation so we used data from the group receiving ventilation at a pressure of 15 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O as this was similar to what was used in the other included studies.</P>

<P>As adults and children have different respiratory anatomy and physiology, we decided a priori to perform subgroup analysis by age group if there were adequate data. Since the anatomical and physiological differences are even more pronounced in preterm and term neonates, the age group categories were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>neonates: term and preterm infants up to 28 days of age (or corrected age for preterm infants). Preterm infants have a gestational age of less than 37 weeks while term infants have a gestational age of 37 weeks or greater;</LI>
<LI>infants and children, aged 28 days to 16 years; and</LI>
<LI>adults, aged over 16 years.</LI>
</UL>
<P>As respiratory complications and damage are linked to the length of time a person is intubated and the duration of mechanical ventilation, subgroup analysis by the duration of the experimental humidification was conducted. These were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>ultra-short humidification: up to 12 hours;</LI>
<LI>short-term humidification: from 12 to 48 hours;</LI>
<LI>medium-term humidification: from 48 hours to seven days;</LI>
<LI>long-term humidification: more than seven days.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>hydrophobic;</LI>
<LI>hygroscopic;</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' table and GRADE</HEADING>
<P>We produced a 'Summary of findings' table for the primary outcomes of artificial airway occlusion, all-cause mortality and pneumonia when HME was compared to HH using GRADEpro software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro</LINK>). Baseline risk was based on the risk rates calculated by GRADEpro from included studies. We used the GRADE system to assess the quality of studies and data contributing to these analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>). The GRADE approach gives an assessment of within-study risk of bias (methodological quality), that may affect the directness of the evidence, heterogeneity of the data, precision of the effect estimates and potential for publication bias. For assessments of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome, we downgraded the evidence from 'high quality' by one level for single or two for multiple risks of bias.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-12 10:45:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, our results showed no evidence that either HMEs or HHs reduce the risk of artificial airway occlusion, mortality or pneumonia. However, there was substantial heterogeneity between studies for the outcomes of airway occlusion and pneumonia. HMEs may increase the PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> and minute ventilation and decrease body temperature. Hydrophobic HMEs appear to reduce the prevalence of pneumonia compared to HHs but this requires further investigation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Artificial airway occlusion</HEADING>
<P>Blockage of the endotracheal or tracheostomy tube is a life-threatening adverse event that can occur in a ventilated person. Over all studies, we found that there was no difference in the risk of artificial airway occlusion with either method of humidification. This was also the finding in the review by <LINK REF="REF-Bench-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bench 2003</LINK>, although these data came from only one study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>We found no effect of the type of artificial humidification on mortality. It would be difficult to attribute a person's death directly to the type of humidification used since the studies were performed in ventilated people who were critically ill. However, death could result from complications associated with the type of humidification used, for example, occlusion of the artificial airway or pneumonia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pneumonia</HEADING>
<P>Overall, we found that the prevalence of pneumonia was no different when an HME was used. However, the use of a hydrophobic HME without hygroscopic properties may reduce the risk of pneumonia compared to an HH.</P>
<P>This apparent difference between HMEs may be due to the higher moisture-retaining properties of hygroscopic HMEs, although both <LINK REF="STD-Dreyfuss-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dreyfuss 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Boots-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boots 1997</LINK> reported that contamination was still higher with HH compared to hygroscopic HMEs. As HHs without a heated wire have been associated with a higher risk of VAP (<LINK REF="REF-Siempos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siempos 2007</LINK>), we also considered whether the apparent difference between HME may have been explained by the HH they were compared to. All hydrophobic HME were compared to HH without a heated wire while six of the eight studies using a hygroscopic HME used an HH with a heated wire (<LINK REF="STD-Boots-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boots 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boots-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Boots 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Branson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Branson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dreyfuss-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dreyfuss 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kollef-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kollef 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacherade-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lacherade 2005</LINK>). However, this does not appear to be the case as the prevalence of pneumonia was 16% in the HH groups with and without a heated wire, as well as the hygroscopic HME group, but only 7.5% in the hydrophobic HME group. Therefore, the prevalence of pneumonia does appear to be lower in the group with a hydrophobic HME.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Respiratory complications</HEADING>
<P>There was no difference between groups for the outcomes of atelectasis, pneumothorax or tracheal aspirations. The number or volume of saline instillations was significantly lower in the HME group but given the subjectivity of these outcomes, these results may not be valid measures of potential airway blockage.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Respiratory measures</HEADING>
<P>There was no difference in PaO<SUB>2</SUB> over the three cross-over studies that reported this outcome although these data were highly heterogenous (I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic between 63% and 83%). The PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> was higher in the HME group at all correlation estimates over the five studies that reported PaCO<SUB>2</SUB>, which may be because of carbon dioxide retained within the HME. This higher PaCO<SUB>2 </SUB>may also be related to the higher measures of work of breathing reported for the HME group in two studies although these data could not be meta-analysed.</P>
<P>In the cross-over studies, minute ventilation was significantly higher for HMEs across the five studies reporting this outcome. However, the findings for tidal volume were more equivocal, only being statistically higher in the HME group at the high correlation estimate.</P>
<P>While HMEs appeared to increase minute ventilation relative to HHs, as with many of the respiratory variables this may be affected by ventilatory settings and should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Change in body temperature</HEADING>
<P>There was good evidence across parallel studies that body temperature was significantly decreased by approximately 0.5 C when an HME was used. Although the results of cross-over studies were equivocal, these data came from two small contradictory studies. This decrease in body temperature in many cases may not be considered clinically relevant when the participants are adults. However, temperature control is vitally important and very finely balanced in neonates, and a drop of 0.5 C could have adverse effects. While to a lesser extent, a temperature drop of 0.5 C may also have adverse effects on older children and elderly people, particularly if they were initially hypothermic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cost of devises</HEADING>
<P>There was evidence of cost savings with HMEs in our review but the variation in the way that the information was reported made it difficult to be definitive about how great the cost saving could be. The apparent cost advantages associated with an HME need to be weighed against the potential disadvantages.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Frequency of heat and moisture exchanger changes</HEADING>
<P>Less-frequent HME changes may increase the risk of adverse outcomes such as artificial airway occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Karpadia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karpadia 2001</LINK>), although a number of studies have advocated that HMEs can be used safely for 48 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Boyer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Markowicz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowicz 2000</LINK>). We were unable though to make any conclusions about the frequency of HME changes from data in this review. Although HMEs were used for at least 24 hours in 16 parallel studies, six studies did not report the frequency of HME changes (<LINK REF="STD-Branson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Branson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diaz--2002" TYPE="STUDY">Diaz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dreyfuss-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dreyfuss 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kollef-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kollef 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Memish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Memish 2001</LINK>). In the 10 studies that did report the frequency, eight reported changing the HME at least every 24 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Boots-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boots 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boots-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Boots 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daoud-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Daoud 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kirton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luchetti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Luchetti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Misset-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Misset 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roustan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Roustan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villafane-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Villafane 1996</LINK>), and only two reported 48-hour changes (<LINK REF="STD-Lacherade-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lacherade 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorente-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lorente 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Since the original version of this review in 2010, we identified only one new study. Therefore, there is little information which has been added to our original findings. Thus, evidence to date remains inadequate to make any conclusions about the relative risk associated with either method of humidification. We endeavoured to compare patient-related factors (age group and type of ventilation) and humidification factors (length of ventilation and type of HME) that may have important implications on findings; however, there were inadequate data to make any conclusions about the effects of these factors. Data were particularly poor for infants and children, and people who were ventilated through a tracheostomy.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two earlier narrative reviews found that VAP was reduced when an HME was used compared to an HH but these conclusions were not strongly supported by the data (<LINK REF="REF-Bench-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bench 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cook-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1998</LINK>). Only one of the five studies in the review by <LINK REF="REF-Cook-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1998</LINK>, and neither of the two studies in <LINK REF="REF-Bench-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bench 2003</LINK>, showed a significant difference in VAP. One meta-analysis of eight trials with 1368 participants by <LINK REF="REF-Kola-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kola 2005</LINK> also found pneumonia was reduced when an HME was used in people who had mechanical ventilation for seven days or more.</P>
<P>However, as with this review update and our original Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2010b</LINK>), we found no difference in the risk of VAP when HMEs or HHs were used. These findings were also reported by <LINK REF="REF-Siempos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siempos 2007</LINK> in their meta-analysis of 2580 participants in 13 trials and by <LINK REF="REF-Ni_x00eb_l_x002d_Weise-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nil-Weise 2007</LINK> in their meta-analysis of 2014 participants in 10 trials.</P>
<P>As with our reviews, other reviews also reported no difference between HH and HME in the risk of artificial airway occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Bench-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bench 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siempos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siempos 2007</LINK>), mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Siempos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siempos 2007</LINK>), or length of ICU stay (<LINK REF="REF-Siempos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siempos 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>An additional meta-analysis and meta-regression of HME versus HH in critically ill adults was published during this update (<LINK REF="REF-Vargas-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vargas 2017</LINK>). We had previously included 17 of the 18 studies included by <LINK REF="REF-Vargas-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vargas 2017</LINK> who found no overall difference between HME and HH in the rates of airway occlusion, pneumonia or mortality.</P>

<P>Overall, the type of humidification device (either passive or active) does not appear to affect the prevalence of artificial airway occlusion, mortality or pneumonia in people undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs) were consistently cheaper to use than heated humidification (HH). Hydrophobic HMEs may reduce the risk of pneumonia although HMEs may also increase the risk of artificial airway occlusion in some groups of patients. There are insufficient data to make any conclusions about the use of HMEs or HHs in children or infants.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-09-07 10:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There has been little new work in this area since 2012. Further research is needed comparing HH and HME, particularly relating to the use of in the paediatric and neonatal populations. Much more research comparing different types of HME and different types of HH is needed. Clear information on the types of devices used, if filters are used, the types of condensers, the use of heated wires in HH, the length of humidification and change frequency of humidification devices should be reported. Information that can help us make better judgements about the quality of trials must also be clearly reported. In particular, information about the number of people not deemed suitable for HMEs or taken off HMEs during the study must be reported.</P>
<P>Trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the newer HMEs, and their combination with new devices such as boosters (<LINK REF="REF-Kola-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kola 2005</LINK>). Trials investigating the use of HMEs beyond 24 hours are also needed (<LINK REF="REF-AARC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">AARC 2012</LINK>).</P>

<LI>Moved mortality and pneumonia from secondary to primary outcomes.</LI>
<LI>In line with the new 'Risk of bias' table, added sequence generation to the assessed quality criteria.</LI>
<LI>There was significant heterogeneity between studies of people who had been ventilated for at least 48 hours compared to people ventilated for less than 48 hours. Therefore, a further analysis was conducted based on the types of HMEs, that is, whether they were hydrophobic or hygroscopic.</LI>
<LI>In the earlier version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2010a</LINK>), we conducted the following subgroup analysis:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>short-term ventilation, defined as less than six hours;</LI>
<LI>medium-term ventilation, defined as between six and 48 hours;</LI>
<LI>long-term ventilation, defined as greater than 48 hours.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>However, in this updated version of the review, the following additional changes were made:</LI>
<LI>The title was changed from "Heated humidification versus heat and moisture exchangers for mechanically ventilated adults and children" to "Heat and moisture exchangers versus heated humidifiers for mechanically ventilated adults and children." This was done because it was not clear in the original title that we were only including people who were undergoing invasive ventilation (though it was stated in the inclusion criteria). In addition, the order of heated humidification and heat and moisture exchangers was reversed because heat and moisture exchangers are treated as the intervention group in all analyses and therefore throughout the text.</LI>
