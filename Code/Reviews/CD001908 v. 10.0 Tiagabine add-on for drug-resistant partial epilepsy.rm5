<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:22:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a disorder in which recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. Most seizures can be controlled by a single antiepileptic drug (AED); this approach is known as monotherapy. Unfortunately, some people require more than one antiepileptic drug to control their seizures, especially if these originate from one area of the brain (partial epilepsy), instead of being generalised.</P>
<P>Tiagabine is a newer antiepileptic drug that has been used as an additional AED to monotherapy. This review looks at the evidence about how effective tiagabine is in reducing seizures, as well as the side effects that may be associated with its use.</P>
<P>A search of databases was carried out on 11 November 2013. Six trials were found that included 900 people with partial epilepsy. These trials were all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the antiepileptic drug topiramate versus a placebo drug or a different AED for a period of up to 24 weeks. By taking all evidence from the trials into account, the review found that tiagabine is effective when used with other drugs to reduce the number of seizures in drug-resistant partial epilepsy. However, adding tiagabine to the usual treatment is associated with an increase in side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, nervousness and tremor.</P>
<P>Trials were assessed with regards to bias and quality, and overall, the quality of evidence for the outcome of seizure reduction was rated as high. The trials included in this review did not examine the long-term effects of topiramate as an add-on treatment. Future research is needed to determine how this drug performs in comparison with other newer antiepileptic drugs.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:19:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological condition that affects almost 0.5% to 1% of the population. Nearly 30% of people with epilepsy are resistant to currently available drugs. Tiagabine is one of the newer antiepileptic drugs; its effects as an adjunct (add-on) to standard drugs are assessed in this review.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:20:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2012 (Issue 5). We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (November 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2013, Issue 10) and MEDLINE (1946 to November 2013). No language restrictions were imposed. We also contacted the manufacturers of tiagabine and experts in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:20:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised placebo-controlled add-on trials of people of any age with localisation-related seizures in which an adequate method of concealment of randomisation was used were included. The studies could be double-blind, single-blind or unblinded and of parallel or cross-over design. They had to have a minimum treatment period of eight weeks. Trials using an active drug control group were also included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, treatment withdrawal, adverse effects, effects on cognition and quality of life. The primary analyses were performed by intention-to-treat. Worst-case and best-case analyses were calculated for seizure outcomes. Dose response was evaluated in regression models. Risk of bias in each study was assessed by two review authors using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:22:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four parallel-group and two cross-over group trials were included. The overall risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (tiagabine vs placebo) was 3.16 (95% CI 1.97 to 5.07). Because of differences in response rates among trials, regression models were unable to provide reliable estimates of response to individual doses. The RR for treatment withdrawal was 1.81 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.62). The 99% CIs for the adverse effects of dizziness, fatigue, nervousness and tremor did not include unity, indicating that they are significantly associated with tiagabine. For cognitive and quality of life outcomes, the limited available data suggested no significant effects on cognition and mood and adjustment. Two of the five studies were judged as having low risk of bias, three studies unclear risk of bias and one study high risk of bias. Overall study quality was rated as high using the GRADE approach.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:25:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:22:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological condition, with an estimated incidence of 50 per 100,000 and a prevalence of five to 10 per 1000 in the developed world (<LINK REF="REF-Sander-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 1996</LINK>). Between 2% and 3% of the population will be given a diagnosis of epilepsy at some time in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser--1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>); most will go into remission. However, up to 30% will continue to have seizures (i.e. become drug-resistant) despite treatment with adequate doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>) and often are treated with combinations of AEDs. No definition of 'drug-resistant' has been internationally accepted, and for the purposes of this review, people will be considered drug-resistant if they have failed to respond to a minimum of two AEDs given as monotherapy. Most of these drug-resistant individuals have partial-onset seizures, which are divided into three types: simple partial, complex partial and secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Commission-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1989</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:24:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Over the past 10 to 15 years, renewed interest has been seen in the development of new AEDs, as standard drugs (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate) do not leave all patients seizure-free, and they are not without adverse effects. In the first instance, new AEDs are tested in RCTs as add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Because they have demonstrated a therapeutic effect in these trials, new AEDs tend to be licensed for add-on use before monotherapy trials have been undertaken in which new AEDs are compared with standard AEDs.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:24:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tiagabine, one of these newer drugs, exerts its antiepileptic effect by inhibiting presynaptic and glial uptake of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (<LINK REF="REF-Ostergaard-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostergaard 1995</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:25:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is part of a series of reviews conducted to investigate the newer AEDs. An initial tiagabine review reported its effects on seizure frequency and adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Marson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 1997</LINK>). In this initial review, the most common adverse effects were investigated. However, one concern is that AEDs may impair cognitive abilities, and in this Cochrane review, we have included outcomes assessing cognitive effects. In addition, we have chosen to include quality of life outcomes to assess the global impact of this drug on well-being. In this review, we assess the effects of tiagabine on seizures, adverse effects, cognition and quality of life when used as add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant localisation-related seizures.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each trial using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias table', as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2010</LINK>). Disagreements were discussed and resolved. Included studies were rated as adequate, inadequate or unclear on six domains applicable to randomised controlled trials: randomisation method, allocation concealment, blinding methods, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. 'Summary of findings' tables were created for which the GRADE approach to assessing quality of evidence was employed.</P>

<P>Clinical heterogeneity was assessed by comparing the distribution of important individual participant factors among trials (e.g. age, seizure type, duration of epilepsy, number of AEDs taken at the time of randomisation) and trial factors (e.g. randomisation concealment, blinding, losses to follow-up). Statistical heterogeneity was examined using a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic for heterogeneity; provided no significant heterogeneity was present (P &gt; 0.10), we employed a fixed-effect model. In the event that heterogeneity was found, a random-effects model analysis was planned using the inverse variance method.</P>

<P>Dose-response relationships were examined using logistic regression in the framework of generalised linear models (<LINK REF="REF-McCullagh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullagh 1989</LINK>) and the package GLIM. For these models, a binary variable was defined with value 0 if the response was less than 50% and with value 1 otherwise. Models included an indicator variable for trials. To examine the effect of dose, the following were considered as possible explanatory variables: dose levels, dose as a continuous variable and logarithmic transformation of dose.

<P>We found three parallel-group studies and two cross-over studies comparing tiagabine versus placebo for people with drug-resistant localisation-related seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalviainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kalviainen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uthman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Uthman 1998</LINK>). All trials were initially sponsored by Novo Nordisk as part of a prelicensing programme, but the drug patent is now owned by Sanofi-Synthelabo. People were excluded from these studies if they had a history of non-epileptic attacks; any active progressive disease of the central nervous system (e.g. brain tumour); any significant illness within the previous three months; any medical or neurological disorder requiring frequent changes in medication or dosage; abnormal laboratory findings that were not attributable to their concomitant AEDs; a history of drug abuse or addiction (including alcohol) or poor compliance with past medication or medical advice. Women who were pregnant or at risk of pregnancy and those who were lactating were also excluded. Valproate monotherapy was not allowed in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uthman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Uthman 1998</LINK>). We found one further parallel study (<LINK REF="STD-Fritz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fritz 2005</LINK>), which examined tiagabine and topiramate in participants with refractory epilepsy. This study was previously excluded from the review because a placebo control group was not included. It has now been included as a head-to-head trial.</P>
<P>The parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kalviainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kalviainen 1998</LINK>) had a 12-week prerandomisation baseline period, and people who had eight or more localisation-related seizures during this period were eligible to be randomly assigned. The treatment period lasted 22 weeks, and 154 individuals were randomly assigned&#8212;77 to placebo and 77 to 30 mg tiagabine per day. Data on cognitive and quality of life effects on a subset of 43 people were reported separately (<LINK REF="REF-Kalviainen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalviainen 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fritz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fritz 2005</LINK>) had an eight-week screening period, a titration phase of three months and a three-month maintenance phase. Twenty-one participants were randomly assigned to tiagabine (final dose at least 20 mg/d) and 20 were randomly assigned to topiramate treatment (final dose at least 200 mg/d). This study reported seizure outcome, cognitive outcome and quality of life effects.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1997</LINK>, a parallel trial, included an eight-week prerandomisation baseline period, and people who had eight or more seizures during this period were eligible to be randomly assigned. The treatment period lasted 12 weeks, and 318 individuals were randomly assigned&#8212;107 to placebo and 211 to 32 mg tiagabine per day. Of those randomly assigned to tiagabine, 106 were allocated 16 mg twice a day and 105 were allocated 8 mg four times a day. No effects on cognition or quality of life were reported for this study.</P>
<P>The parallel trial (<LINK REF="STD-Uthman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Uthman 1998</LINK>) had a 12-week prerandomisation baseline period, and people who had eight or more localisation-related seizures during this period were eligible to be randomly assigned. The treatment period lasted 20 weeks, and 297 individuals were randomly assigned&#8212;91 to placebo, 61 to 16 mg, 88 to 32 mg and 57 to 56 mg tiagabine per day. Data on cognitive and quality of life effects were reported separately for a subset of 162 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Dodrill-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodrill 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The cross-over trials ( <LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1995</LINK>) were similar in design, using what has been called a response conditional design. People who had six or more seizures in the eight weeks before the study were entered into a 12-week screening phase. During the screening phase, all participants were given tiagabine, the dose of which was titrated up with a target dose of 52 mg/d in <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1995</LINK> and 64 mg/d in <LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK>. Participants with a reduction in seizure frequency of 25% or more during the screening phase were eligible to be randomly assigned (hence response conditional). Eligible individuals were randomly assigned into a two-by-two cross-over trial and to a sequence of placebo-tiagabine or tiagabine-placebo. Treatment periods lasted seven weeks and the cross-over periods three weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1995</LINK> screened 94 individuals, 46 of whom were randomly assigned; <LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK> screened 88 individuals, 44 of whom were randomly assigned.

For the cohort recruited in <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1995</LINK>, the cognitive effects of tiagabine were reported separately for a subset of 22 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Sveinbjornsdottir-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sveinbjornsdottir 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In total, the studies assessing seizure outcomes and treatment withdrawal randomly assigned 900 individuals. Studies assessing adverse effects randomly assigned 859 participants.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:31:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As already outlined in the description of studies, we found four parallel-group and two cross-over studies. The cross-over studies used a response conditional design in which participants were given tiagabine during a screening period, and those with a 25% or greater reduction in seizure frequency were eligible to be randomly assigned. The people randomly assigned therefore are highly selected and are biased towards a response to tiagabine. We have chosen to report separately the effects on seizure frequency from the parallel and cross-over trials. In addition, reports of the cross-over studies do not provide detailed adverse effect data or data on treatment withdrawal, and only the parallel studies contributed results for these outcomes. The parallel study that examined tiagabine and topiramate was assessed separately (<LINK REF="STD-Fritz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fritz 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency: parallel trials</HEADING>
<P>A Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity for a response to tiagabine indicated no significant heterogeneity between trials (ITT analysis: Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.81, df = 2, P value 0.67; worst-case scenario: Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.41, df = 2, P = 0.81; best-case scenario: Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 1.09, df = 2, P value 0.58). The overall risk ratio for a response to tiagabine is 3.16 (95% CI 1.97 to 5.07), indicating that participants are significantly more likely to respond to tiagabine than to placebo. The risk ratios for worst-case and best-case scenarios are 2.70 (95% CI 1.75 to 4.19) and 3.32 (95% CI 2.08 to 5.32), respectively (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dose regression analysis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Intention-to-treat</HEADING>
<P>Because of differences in response rates in individual trials, it is not possible to give valid estimates of precise responses to individual doses. Because of differences in response rates among trials, the model with the best summary of the log odds includes a contrast between <LINK REF="STD-Kalviainen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kalviainen 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Uthman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Uthman 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1997</LINK>. After adjustments for trial effects, this model includes two contrasting dose groups: one group containing placebo and 16 mg, and the other 30, 32 and 56 mg tiagabine per day. The reduction in deviance due to dose at these two levels with adjustment for trial effects is 40.6 on 1 df (P value 0.001). Upon contrast of trials included, the residual deviance is 4.8 on 5 df.</P>
<P>The estimated odds ratio relative to placebo is 3.67 (95% CI 2.30 to 5.86). The odds ratio for trials two and three versus trial one is 1.65 (95% CI 1.11 to 2.44).</P>
<P>Actual and estimated response rates are given in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Although we are unable to give precise overall estimates for the proportion responding to individual doses, strong evidence suggests an effect for daily doses of 30 to 56 mg or more. As an indication of the possible effects, we can say that, with placebo rates in the range of 6% to 10%, at least an additional 13%, and possibly 20%, of people similar to those in these trials would experience a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency when taking a dose of 30 mg tiagabine or more per day.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Best-case and worst-case scenarios</HEADING>
<P>The best-case results are very similar to the ITT results. After adjustments for trial effects, contrast between placebo and 16 mg and 30, 32 or 56 mg gives the best summary of the log odds. The reduction in deviance due to dose, with adjustments for trial effects, is 47.7 on 1 df (P value 0.001). With contrast of trials included, the residual deviance is 6.7 on 5 df.</P>
<P>The estimated odds ratio relative to placebo is 4.03 (95% CI 1.97 to 8.25). The odds ratio for trials two and three versus trial one is 1.51 (95% CI 0.98 to 2.33). Actual and estimated response rates are given in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>The worst-case results are also very similar to the ITT results. After adjustments for trial effects, contrast between placebo and 16 mg and 30, 32 or 56 mg gives the best summary of the log odds. The reduction in deviance due to dose, with adjustments for trial effects, is 35.4 on 1 df (P value 0.001). With contrast of trials included, the residual deviance is 4.5 on 5 df.</P>
<P>The estimated odds ratio relative to placebo is 3.22 (95% CI 2.05 to 5.05). The odds ratio for trials two and three versus trial one is 1.70 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.50). Actual and estimated response rates are given in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency: cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>Reports of the cross-over trials contain insufficient data from the first treatment period to allow the analyses that were planned. Reported results from the two cross-over trials therefore have been summarised below.</P>
<P>Of the 46 people randomly assigned in <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1995</LINK>, 11 (24%) had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency in the tiagabine versus placebo phase. Of the 44 people randomly assigned in <LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK>, 12 (27%) had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency in the tiagabine versus placebo phase. Pooling these data, weighted according to the inverse variance, gives an estimate of the proportion of responders of 0.25 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.34). The proportion of responders is higher than that seen in the parallel-group trials; this is not surprising given that people in the cross-over trials had to have an apparent response to tiagabine before they were randomly assigned.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>Treatment withdrawal data were available only for the parallel trials. A Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity suggests no significant statistical heterogeneity (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 1.75, df = 2, P value 0.42). The overall risk ratio for discontinuation for any reason is 1.81 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.62), indicating that people are significantly more likely to withdraw from tiagabine than from placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Results for the parallel and cross-over trials are reported separately. For the parallel trials, in addition to the five adverse effects specified in the protocol for this review, headache, infection, nervousness and tremor were amongst the five most commonly reported adverse effects. A Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity for adverse effects indicated no significant heterogeneity between trials. The 99% CIs around RR estimates for the following did not cross unity, indicating that they are significantly associated with tiagabine: dizziness 1.69 (99% CI 1.31 to 2.51); fatigue 1.38 (99% CI 0.89 to 2.14); nervousness 10.65 (99% CI 0.78 to 146.08) and tremor 4.56 (99% CI 1.00 to 20.94). The 99% CIs for the following adverse effects did not cross unity and therefore were not significantly associated with tiagabine: ataxia 1.24 (99% CI 0.34 to 4.55); nausea 1.24 (99% CI 0.69 to 2.22); somnolence 1.18 (99% CI 0.76 to 1.83); headache 1.15 (99% CI 0.48 to 2.79) and infection 1.00 (99% CI 0.36 to 2.76) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.9</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the cross-over trials, <LINK REF="STD-Crawford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crawford 2001</LINK> reported that eight people experienced adverse effects while taking tiagabine and 10 people reported adverse effects while taking placebo. While taking tiagabine, two people reported dizziness and another two incoordination. While taking placebo, three people reported accidental injury. All other adverse events were reported by one individual only. <LINK REF="STD-Richens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 1995</LINK> did not report a detailed breakdown of adverse events occurring with tiagabine or placebo.</P>

In total, these studies used 24 neuropsychological tests, only two of which&#8212;the Stroop test and the Rey auditory verbal learning test&#8212;were used in all three studies that reported cognitive effects. Three tests were used by two of the three studies, and the remaining 19 tests were used in just one study. Even when the same test had been used in two or more studies, it was not already clear that the same aspects of the test had been used. The tests used in the individual studies are outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>.</P>
<P>No statistically significant differences were noted at the 0.01 level of confidence for any test, and for only three tests statistically significant differences were seen at the 0.05 level (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Evidence therefore is insufficient to conclude that tiagabine as an add-on treatment has an effect on cognition.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of life measures</HEADING>
<P>Two reports addressed quality of life outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Dodrill-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodrill 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalviainen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalviainen 1996</LINK>). Both report effects on mood and adjustment but used different tests to assess them (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). Neither study found a significant difference between tiagabine and placebo; hence evidence is insufficient to conclude that tiagabine has an effect on quality of life.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tiagabine versus topiramate</HEADING>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Fritz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fritz 2005</LINK> compared tiagabine versus an active control drug (topiramate); therefore pooling of data was not undertaken for this comparison.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency</HEADING>
<P>Within this study, no significant differences were noted between the two add-on drugs (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.58). According to the study authors' analysis of 37 participants, three participants (one tiagabine, two topiramate) became seizure-free; 11 participants (four tiagabine, seven topiramate) reduced their seizure frequency by 50% or more (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>No significant differences were found between tiagabine and topiramate upon withdrawal from the study (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.74) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cognitive effects</HEADING>
<P>For this outcome, authors of this study did not compare the two add-on antiepileptic drugs. Both add-on drugs were examined over separate time points: baseline/post-titration phase and post-titration/maintenance phase. Within the first evaluation, baseline/post-titration, significant deteriorations were found within the topiramate group in phonematic verbal fluency (P value 0.001), semantic verbal fluency (P value 0.006), language comprehension (P value 0.002), working memory (P &lt; 0.05) and visual block tapping (P value 0.032).. A significant deterioration in verbal memory was also found in the tiagabine group (P value 0.039).</P>
<P>Within the post-titration/maintenance phase, one significant improvement was found in mental flexibility in the topiramate group (P value 0.045). No changes were found in the tiagabine group for any of the cognitive outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of life measures</HEADING>
<P>Again, authors did not use appropriate analysis; therefore, we are unable to compare the two add-on antiepileptic drugs. Within the baseline/post-titration phase, significantly more complaints about medication were reported within the tiagabine group (P value 0.048). Participants taking topiramate reported significantly higher depression scores (P value 0.011), lower cognitive functioning (P value 0.024) and increased medication adverse effects (P value 0.008).</P>
<P>For the post-titration/maintenance phase evaluation, the tiagabine group was significantly more fatigued/had less energy (P value 0.025). No other differences were found from post-titration to maintenance.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:31:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All trials included in this review were sponsored by Sanofi-Synthelabo as part of a drug licensing programme. Five of the six included trials used adequate methods of concealment of randomisation; however, only two of the trials were rated as low risk of bias for the way the randomisation sequence was generated. All trials except one were double-blinded and used identical packaging and medication to maintain this; however, little detail was reported about whether specific study personnel and outcome assessors were blinded. All studies were rated as low of bias for missing data and how this was dealt with because intention-to-treat analyses were used. We had no access to the protocols for any of the studies; therefore selective outcome reporting bias is unclear for each of the studies. Limitations of two of the trials include the use of a response conditional design, the aim of which was to select and randomly assign a group of people likely to respond favourably to tiagabine. In theory, this will maximise the effects observed and may lead to the efficiency of requiring the recruitment of fewer individuals into trials. This is not a process that mimics clinical practice, and the results of these studies are difficult to translate into everyday clinical practice. The length of the treatment period was another limitation of all included trials: seven weeks in the cross-over studies and 12 to 22 weeks in the parallel studies. Clinical practice will be better informed by trials of longer duration, especially for a chronic condition such as epilepsy.<BR/>
<BR/>Despite these limitations, this review provides strong evidence that tiagabine reduces seizure frequency for people with drug-resistant localisation-related seizures. Because of differences in response rates among trials, regression models were unable to give valid estimates of the proportion of participants responding to specific doses of tiagabine. We can say however that for people similar to those recruited into the trials reviewed, compared with placebo, we might expect at least an additional 13%, and possibly 20%, of people to experience a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency when taking a dose of 30 mg tiagabine or more per day.</P>
<P>Results for the outcome of treatment withdrawal show that tiagabine is more likely to be withdrawn than placebo. In trials of relatively short duration, such as those reviewed here, this is likely to represent problems with tolerability rather than poor seizure control. Of the adverse effects investigated, dizziness, nervousness and tremor were significantly more likely to occur with tiagabine than with placebo.</P>
<P>Because of lack of uniformity in the approach used to test for cognitive effects and quality of life, as well as the relatively small numbers of participants tested, evidence is insufficient to conclude whether tiagabine has an effect on these outcomes.</P>
<P>Given that only one trial included in this review compared add-on tiagabine versus another add-on antiepileptic drug, the results from this study must be interpreted with caution. Authors of this study compared the two drugs only for two of the outcomes reported. Given the increasing number of licensed antiepileptic drugs, this is an important issue that must be addressed in trials that compare one drug versus another. We should emphasise that the results of this review do not provide information about the effects of tiagabine when used as monotherapy, and that the results apply only to localisation-related seizures.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-02-03 14:32:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of the six included studies, two studies were rated individually as low risk of bias, three as unclear because of the method of sequence generation used and one as high. For all studies included in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome, the overall risk of bias was rated as low, and the evidence was considered to be methodologically sound. The GRADE approach was employed to rate the level of evidence for the primary outcome. This is presented in a 'Summary of findings' table.</P>

<P>Add-on tiagabine reduces the frequency of seizures for people with drug-resistant localisation-related seizures. Doses between 30 and 56 mg per day are likely to reduce the frequency of seizures by 50% or more for between 13% and 20% of people. Doses higher than 56 mg per day were not tested in the trials included in this review.</P>
