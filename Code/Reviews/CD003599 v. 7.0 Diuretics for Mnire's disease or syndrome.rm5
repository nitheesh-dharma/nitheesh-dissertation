<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Diuretics for the treatment of Ménière's disease or syndrome</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Diuretics (drugs which reduce fluid accumulation in the body) are commonly used in the management of the symptoms of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus or aural fullness in patients with Ménière's disease. 'Endolymphatic hydrops' is an increase in the pressure of the fluids in the chambers of the inner ear and is thought to be the underlying cause of Ménière's disease. Diuretics are believed to work by reducing the volume (and therefore also the pressure) of these fluids. The authors of this systematic review carried out an extensive search but could not identify any randomised controlled trials of sufficient quality to include in the review. There is no good evidence about the effect of diuretics on the symptoms of Ménière's disease and further research is needed.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:46:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition</HEADING>
<P>Prosper Ménière gave his name to a disorder characterised by recurrent episodes of spontaneous vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss and tinnitus, often with a feeling of fullness in the ear. The disorder may be subdivided into two categories. It is usually idiopathic (i.e. without known cause), in which case it is referred to as Ménière's disease. It may also be secondary to a number of known inner ear disorders, in which case it is referred to as Ménière's syndrome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aetiology</HEADING>
<P>Ménière's disease is thought to be associated with endolymphatic hydrops, i.e. raised endolymph pressure in the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear (<LINK REF="REF-Hallpike-1938" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallpike 1938</LINK>). The cause of the hydrops is not known in most cases. Specific disorders affecting the inner ear which are also associated with hydrops include temporal bone fracture, syphilis, hypothyroidism, Cogan's syndrome and Mondini dysplasia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevalence</HEADING>
<P>Ménière's disease is most common between 40 and 60 years of age, although younger people can also be affected (<LINK REF="REF-da-Costa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Costa 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morales-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morales 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takeda-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeda 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watanabe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watanabe 1995</LINK>). The incidence is estimated to be between 100 and 200 per million new cases per year. Acute episodes of Ménière's tend to occur in clusters with a mean frequency of between 6 and 11 clusters per year, though remission may last several months. Episodes have been observed to occur with increasing frequency over the first few years after presentation and then decrease in association with a sustained deterioration in hearing (<LINK REF="REF-Moffat-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffat 1997</LINK>). In most cases, vertiginous episodes eventually cease completely (<LINK REF="REF-Silverstein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverstein 1989</LINK>). This fluctuating natural history makes formal evaluation of any treatment effect in Ménière's difficult.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The disorder is not always easy to diagnose and there is no 'gold standard' diagnostic test. It is almost certainly over-diagnosed by non-specialists. The American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) has produced diagnostic guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Alford-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alford 1972</LINK>) which have been revised twice (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00e9_ni_x00e8_re_x0027_s-Guide-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ménière's Guide 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1985</LINK>), but these are not universally accepted. Nevertheless, they provide a standard which can be applied easily to make the diagnosis in normal clinical practice. In brief, these guidelines now stipulate that a 'definite' diagnosis can only be made on the basis of:</P>
<OL>
<LI>at least two spontaneous episodes of rotational vertigo lasting at least 20 minutes;</LI>
<LI>audiometric confirmation of a sensorineural hearing loss;</LI>
<LI>tinnitus and/or a perception of aural fullness.</LI>
</OL>
<P>These criteria exclude most other vestibular conditions, but further investigation is also necessary to exclude other disease processes such as an acoustic neuroma.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>Ideally, the aim of treatment is to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>reduce the number and severity of acute attacks of vertigo;</LI>
<LI>abort or ameliorate the hearing loss and tinnitus associated with such attacks;</LI>
<LI>alleviate any chronic symptoms (e.g. tinnitus and imbalance);</LI>
<LI>prevent progression of the disease, in particular the loss of hearing and balance function which characterises the disorder.</LI>
</OL>
<P>No treatment modality has been shown to achieve all of these aims. In fact an evidence base for the management of patients with Ménière's disease is sadly lacking. The two main medical treatment modalities are betahistine therapy and diuretics. The effect of betahistine compounds in patients with either Ménière's disease or Ménière's syndrome was assessed in 2001 by a Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-James-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2001</LINK>) (updated in 2007). Betahistine is thought to exert its effect by either reducing the endolymphatic pressure through improved circulation in the stria vascularis or inhibiting activity in the vestibular nuclei. The review concluded that there was no evidence that betahistine was effective in Ménière's. The strict criteria used in the review may have excluded studies with patients with Ménière's-type symptoms including vertigo and a further evaluation of the effect of betahistine on such patients is in progress.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:47:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The different types of diuretic are as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Thiazide diuretics, e.g. benzofluazide, hydrothiazide and chlorthalidone - inhibitors of Na<SUP>+</SUP>/Cl<SUP>-</SUP> reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules of the nephrons.</LI>
<LI>Potassium-sparing diuretics, e.g. amiloride, spironolactone and triamterene - inhibitors of Na+/K+ exchange within collecting ducts.</LI>
<LI>Loop diuretics, e.g. frusemide - inhibitors of co-transporter in the medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.</LI>
<LI>Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, e.g. acetazolamide - inhibitors of H+ secretion and resultant promotion of Na+ and K+ excretion.</LI>
</OL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:48:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The proposed mechanism of action of diuretics in Ménière's disease is an alteration in the electrolyte balance within the endolymph causing a reduction of the endolymph volume and pressure either by increased drainage of endolymph or a reduction in its production.</P>
<P>The main type of diuretic used in Ménière's is thiazide, but a search was made for all diuretic agents.</P>
<P>As in the <LINK REF="REF-James-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2001</LINK> Cochrane Review, we focused on studies employing strict criteria for the diagnosis of Ménière's to try to address the specific question of the effects of drugs in patients with 'definite' Ménière's disease or syndrome.</P>
</THEORY>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-08-06 10:40:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ian J Chamberlain">
<P>We sought to assess the effects of diuretics in patients with either Ménière's disease or Ménière's syndrome. Specifically we sought to assess the effect of diuretic treatment on the frequency and severity of attacks, on chronic symptoms such as tinnitus, imbalance and hearing loss and on the progression of these symptoms.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:48:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of diuretic versus placebo. Trials analysed on an intention-to-treat basis were preferred, and where necessary and possible, we planned to reconstruct intention-to-treat analyses.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:48:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Patients of any age with Ménière's disease or syndrome. Studies were to be graded on the basis of the robustness of the methods used to diagnose these disorders and this grading was to form the basis of a sensitivity analysis:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Grade I - Studies in which the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) 1995 criteria have been used and only patients with definite and certain Ménière's included in the study.</LI>
<LI>Grade II - Studies in which clear but less rigorous criteria have been used.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Studies that distinguished patients with Ménière's syndrome but did not use an appropriate criteria were to be considered separately.</P>
<P>Priority would be given to trials studying patients who had not received diuretics for any reason in the past.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:48:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Diuretics versus placebo. Other medication may be used concurrently provided it is used equally in each group. We decided to compare diuretics with placebo as no 'gold standard' treatment for Ménière's is available. We excluded any trials with no placebo group as there is a significant placebo effect in Ménière's management.</P>
<P>Trials with a cross-over design were only to be included if data from results before the cross-over were extractable in order to avoid the potential confounding effect of a carry-over phenomenon.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:48:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Important outcomes were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Number and severity of acute attacks of vertigo;</LI>
<LI>Changes in hearing;</LI>
<LI>Severity of tinnitus;</LI>
<LI>Changes in perception of aural fullness;</LI>
<LI>Functional impairment and disability;</LI>
<LI>Overall changes in well-being and quality of life;</LI>
<LI>Side effects of the treatment.</LI>
</OL>
<P>If disease was bilateral and asymmetrical, we planned to assess outcomes 2, 3 and 4 using the more severely affected ear.</P>
<P>Outcomes were measured in the short or long-term. The prevention of progressive hearing loss is equally important but must be measured over a period of many months or years.</P>
<P>Ménière's is a chronic disease with a fluctuating and episodic pattern of symptoms, therefore assessment of long-term effectiveness of any therapy is extremely important. Ideally trials should evaluate both the long-term (&gt; 3 months) effects of both short courses of treatment (2 to 12 weeks), and the effectiveness of long-term (&gt; 3 months) treatment. Long-term outcomes should be assessed at 18 to 24 months and 42 to 48 months after the onset of treatment, as suggested by the AAO-HNS.</P>
<P>The severity of the disease and the time elapsed before treatment could be an important factor in determining response to diuretics and we followed the same staging system as <LINK REF="REF-James-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2001</LINK> to address this issue in more detail.</P>
<P>The AAO-HNS 1995 guidelines for the evaluation of treatment of Ménière's disease are designed to evaluate the long-term effects of specific (usually surgical) intervention. However, like the diagnostic criteria referred to above, they are well-defined and rigorous.</P>
<P>In outline:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the number of vertiginous episodes per unit time is recorded with and without treatment;</LI>
<LI>hearing is assessed by four-tone average of pure tone threshold at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz on audiogram;</LI>
<LI>functional impairment is assessed with a scale measuring daily tasks;</LI>
<LI>measures for assessment of tinnitus and perception of aural fullness have not been defined.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Studies were to be categorised on the similarity of their outcome measures to AAO-HNS guidelines. Studies using similar measures were to be graded (I), dissimilar but appropriate measures (II), and those using measures considered inadequate were to be graded (III). This was also to form the basis for a sensitivity analysis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Klockhoff-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Klockhoff 1967</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-Deelen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Van Deelen 1986</LINK> were cross-over trials.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brookes-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Brookes 1984</LINK> was an observational study of 14 patients given acetazolamide for varying duration of one week to nine months. A Grade I criteria for diagnosis of Ménière's diagnosis was used. The study was not placebo controlled, nor randomised. Outcome measures were qualitative and there was no long-term evaluation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Corvera-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Corvera 1989</LINK> was a retrospective review of three groups of patients thought to have Ménière's disease; 79 had been given chlorthalidone, 42 acetazolamide, 71 had symptom control only. Diagnosis was not based on the AAO-HNS guidelines and the criteria for diagnosis were not specified. The study was not placebo controlled, randomised or assessed in a double blind manner. Initial hearing loss appeared to be much greater in the symptom control group. Only hearing loss was assessed, and not vertigo, tinnitus or functional impairment. All frequencies were averaged together which means that changes in low frequency may have been masked.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Klockhoff-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Klockhoff 1967</LINK> was a randomised controlled double blind trial of 30 patients. A Grade II criteria for diagnosis of Ménière's disease was used. There was an initial two-month observation period then patients were given a placebo or hydrochlorothiazide for four months. There was then an observation period and then placebo or drug for four months. Data for the period before the cross-over could not be extracted and it was not possible to exclude the carry-over phenomenon.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Klockhoff-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Klockhoff 1974</LINK> was an observational study of 34 patients with a Grade II criteria for diagnosis of Ménière's disease. All patients were given chlorthalidone for varying time periods depending on symptoms. The trial was not randomised or placebo controlled. Outcomes were measured as for <LINK REF="STD-Klockhoff-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Klockhoff 1967</LINK>. The analysis of results was poor as the paper only describes individual patient improvement, with no statistical analysis. It was not possible to determine whether the patients would have improved symptomatically independently of the chlorthalidone. A further group of 220 patients also received chlorthalidone but they had incapacitating vertigo with no mention of Ménière's.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Petermann-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Petermann 1982</LINK> was a randomised controlled double blind trial of betahistine dihydrochloride versus hydrochlorothiazide in 32 patients.

There was also no long-term follow up of results and patients were only assessed for the three-month duration of each intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ralli-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ralli 1989</LINK> was not a randomised, double blind or controlled study. Twenty-five patients were given acetazolamide and observed for five hours.

<LINK REF="STD-Van-Deelen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Van Deelen 1986</LINK> was a double blind cross-over placebo controlled trial. There was no Grade II criteria for Ménière's diagnosis. Randomisation was unspecified. The trial was rejected because data for each part of the study could not be extracted.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-08-11 03:14:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search strategy identified ten trials studying the treatment of Ménière's disease with diuretics. None of these trials could be included in this review.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:49:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The outcome of treatment of Ménière's disease is difficult to assess. Although there are strict criteria established by the AAO-HNS for the diagnosis of Ménière's disease, they are often not adhered to. Outcome measures are rarely assessed according to AAO-HNS criteria. Also, because of the long duration of treatment required, and long period of follow up required to assess any benefit, high quality trials are difficult to set up and execute. Consequently, we found no high quality evidence evaluating the effectiveness of diuretics in Ménière's disease or syndrome. There were no double blind randomised placebo controlled trials using the AAO-HNS criteria for diagnosis and outcome measure evaluation, or of sufficient length of treatment and follow up, to be included. We found no trials with a low risk of methodological bias that used the highest level of diagnostic criteria and outcome measures (i.e. overall quality grade A - see <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section).</P>
<P>The effect of diuretics on vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus or aural fullness in clearly defined Ménière's disease cannot currently be evaluated.</P>
<P>Despite the lack of high quality evidence, some studies have reported an improvement in patients' vertigo whilst using diuretics. No study considered for this review described any side effects from the use of diuretics. The generally documented side effects include polyuria, thirst, constipation, mild stomach problems, impotence, hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia, impaired glucose tolerance, gout, hyperlipidaemia and skin rashes. However, the low dose diuretics used for Ménière's disease appear to be well tolerated and are relatively inexpensive. Some patients may still be willing to try them.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no good evidence for or against the use of diuretics in Ménière's disease or syndrome. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A large randomised clinical trial is required to establish the efficacy of diuretics in Ménière's disease or syndrome. The AAO-HNS guidelines provide a standardised protocol for diagnosis and assessment that would form an ideal basis for future trials of diuretics.</P>
