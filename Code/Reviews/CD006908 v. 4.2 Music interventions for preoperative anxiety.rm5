<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-23 11:38:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People awaiting surgical procedures often experience high levels of anxiety. Such anxiety may result in negative bodily responses, such as increased blood pressure and heart rate, leading to slower wound healing and increased risk of infection. High anxiety may also affect the start of anaesthesia and slow down postoperative recovery. To reduce patient anxiety, sedatives and anti-anxiety drugs are regularly administered before surgery. However, these often have negative side effects, such as causing drowsiness and breathing difficulties, and may interact with anaesthetic drugs to prolong patient recovery and discharge. Therefore, increasing attention is being paid to music therapy and music medicine interventions, amongst other non-pharmacological interventions, for reduction of preoperative anxiety. Interventions are categorized as 'music medicine' when passive listening to pre-recorded music is offered by medical personnel. In contrast, music therapy requires the implementation of a music intervention by a trained music therapist, the presence of a therapeutic process, and the use of personally tailored music experiences. A systematic review was needed to gauge the efficacy of both music therapy and music medicine interventions for reduction of preoperative anxiety.</P>
<P>The review included 26 trials with a total of 2051 participants. The findings suggested that music listening may have a beneficial effect on preoperative anxiety. Most trials presented some methodological weakness. Therefore, these results need to be interpreted with caution. However, these findings are consistent with the findings of three other Cochrane systematic reviews on the use of music interventions for anxiety reduction in medical patients. Therefore, we conclude that music interventions may provide a viable alternative to sedatives and anti-anxiety drugs for reducing preoperative anxiety.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-29 09:47:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 26 trials (2051 participants). All studies used listening to pre-recorded music. The results suggested that music listening may have a beneficial effect on preoperative anxiety. Specifically, music listening resulted, on average, in an anxiety reduction that was 5.72 units greater (95% CI -7.27 to -4.17, P &lt; 0.00001) than that in the standard care group as measured by the Stait-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), and -0.60 standardized units (95% CI -0.90 to -0.31, P &lt; 0.0001) on other anxiety scales. The results also suggested a small effect on heart rate and diastolic blood pressure, but no support was found for reductions in systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and skin temperature. Most trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias because of lack of blinding. Blinding of outcome assessors is often impossible in music therapy and music medicine studies that use subjective outcomes, unless in studies in which the music intervention is compared to another treatment intervention. Because of the high risk of bias, these results need to be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>None of the studies included wound healing, infection rate, time to discharge, or patient satisfaction as outcome variables. One large study found that music listening was more effective than the sedative midazolam in reducing preoperative anxiety and equally effective in reducing physiological responses. No adverse effects were identified.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-05-23 11:42:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Patients awaiting surgical procedures often experience significant anxiety in anticipation of events that are uncomfortable, uncertain, and that may include a health risk. High levels of anxiety result in negative physiological manifestations, such as elevated blood cortisol levels, and increased blood pressure and heart rate, leading to slower wound healing, diminished immune response, and increased risk of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2004</LINK>). High anxiety may also complicate presurgical drug administration, adversely affect the induction of anaesthesia, and impede postoperative recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Kain-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kain 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kiecolt_x002d_Glaser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiecolt-Glaser 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maranets-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maranets 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ozalp-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ozalp 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2004</LINK>). To reduce patient anxiety, sedatives or antianxiety drugs are regularly administered before surgery. However, sedatives often have negative side effects, such as drowsiness and respiratory depression, and may interact with anaesthetic agents prolonging patient recovery and discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 2005</LINK>). Therefore, increasing attention is being paid to a variety of non-pharmacological interventions for reduction of preoperative anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leroy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leroy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norred-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norred 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2007</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-05-29 09:47:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Music has been used in different medical fields to meet physiological, psychological, and spiritual needs of patients. Research on the effects of music and music therapy for medical patients has burgeoned during the past 20 years and has included a variety of outcome measures in a wide range of specialty areas (<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2005</LINK>). Specifically, the anxiolytic effects of music have been studied in a variety of medical patients, including surgical (<LINK REF="STD-Daub-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Daub 1988</LINK>
<LINK REF="STD-Kaempf-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kaempf 1989</LINK>
<LINK REF="STD-Koch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1998</LINK>
<LINK REF="STD-Mok-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mok 2003</LINK>), cardiac (<LINK REF="REF-Bolwerk-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolwerk 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999</LINK>), and oncology patients (<LINK REF="REF-Frank-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfaff-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfaff 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is important to make a clear distinction between music interventions administered by medical or healthcare professionals (music medicine) and those implemented by trained music therapists (music therapy). A substantive set of data (<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2005</LINK>) indicates that music therapy interventions with medical populations are significantly more effective than music medicine interventions for a wide variety of outcomes. This difference might be attributed to the fact that music therapists individualize their interventions to meet patients' specific needs, more actively engage the patients in the music making, and employ a systematic therapeutic process that includes assessment, treatment, and evaluation. As defined by Dileo (<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 1999</LINK>), interventions are categorized as 'music medicine' when passive listening to pre-recorded music is offered by medical personnel. In contrast, music therapy requires the implementation of a music intervention by a trained music therapist, the presence of a therapeutic process, and the use of personally tailored music experiences. These music experiences include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>listening to live, improvised, or pre-recorded music;</LI>
<LI>performing music on an instrument;</LI>
<LI>improvising music spontaneously using voice or instruments, or both;</LI>
<LI>composing music; and</LI>
<LI>music combined with other modalities (e.g., movement, imagery, art) (<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2007</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-05-23 11:51:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>A common theory regarding the anxiety-reducing effects of music is that music can help patients focus their attention away from stressful events to something pleasant and soothing (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 2008</LINK>). Even though this is an important mechanism in preoperative anxiety reduction, it is important to emphasize that music does more than refocusing patients&#8217; attention. It provides the patient with an aesthetic experience that can offer comfort and peace while awaiting surgery. In music interventions provided by a trained music therapist, the music therapist furthermore adapts the live music interactions to the in-the-moment needs of the patients. This often provides a deeply humanizing and validating experience for the patient. The act of making music together can provide a strong sense of support. Moreover, the active and creative engagement in music making (for example, singing songs, improvising music) stands in stark contrast to passively submitting oneself to surgical procedures. This may result in an increased sense of control and empowerment.</P>
<P>On a neurophysiological level, it has been postulated that music induces relaxation through its impact on automated and central nervous responses (<LINK REF="STD-Gillen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gillen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2006</LINK>). More specifically, it is believed that the anxiolytic effect of music is achieved through its suppressive action on the sympathetic nervous system, leading to decreased adrenergic activity and decreased neuromuscular arousal (<LINK REF="REF-Chlan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chlan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gillen 2008</LINK>). Music furthermore triggers the limbic system in the brain to release endorphins; these neurotransmitters play an important role in enhancing a sense of well-being (<LINK REF="STD-Arslan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Arslan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>). However, Gillen (<LINK REF="STD-Gillen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gillen 2008</LINK>) has suggested that more research is needed to examine the physiological mechanisms that explain the anxiolytic effects of music. </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-05-23 11:52:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Most research studies examining the anxiety-reducing effects of music in presurgical patients have used music listening as the primary intervention. Several of these studies have found that exposure to music reduces preoperative anxiety. Several studies, however, have suffered from small sample size, making it nearly impossible to achieve statistically significant results. In addition, a number of individual factors that are likely to influence responses to music, including age, gender, emotional state, music preference, personal associations with the music, prior musical training, and culture, are likely to influence the outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pelletier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelletier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Standley-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Standley 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Standley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Standley 2000</LINK>). A systematic review was needed to more accurately gauge the efficacy of both music medicine and music therapy for reduction of preoperative anxiety as well as to identify variables that may moderate the effects.</P>

In contrast, in music medicine studies blinding of personnel is possible by providing control group participants with headphones but no music (e.g., blank CD). Therefore, downgrading for not blinding personnel was only applied in studies that used listening to pre-recorded music.</P>

<P>Not all studies measured all outcomes identified for this review.</P>
<P>All included studies were categorized as music medicine studies (as defined by the review authors in the background section) and used listening to pre-recorded music as the intervention. Some authors provided theoretical frameworks for the use of music to reduce anxiety including: (a) decreased adrenergic and sympathetic nervous system activity through entrainment of body rhythms with music (<LINK REF="STD-Arslan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Arslan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2004</LINK>); (b) sedative music's capacity to reduce neuroendocrine activity (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2011</LINK>); (c) the influence of music listening on the limbic system of the brain by reducing the ability of neurotransmitters to relay uncomfortable feelings and by triggering the release of endorphins (<LINK REF="STD-Arslan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Arslan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2005</LINK>); (d) alteration of perceptual responses including the perception of time (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2005</LINK>); and (e) music as a distracter, focusing the patient&#8217;s attention away from negative stimuli to something pleasant and encouraging (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2012</LINK>). Robb and colleagues emphasize the need for researchers to specify a theoretical framework and "provide a rationale for the music selected and specify how qualities and delivery of the music are expected to impact targeted outcomes" (<LINK REF="REF-Robb-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robb 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most studies offered one 20 to 30-minute music session to the participants during the preoperative waiting period. Two studies offered multiple music listening sessions, starting several days before surgery and continuing to the day of the surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Few studies provided detailed information about the music that was used (<LINK REF="STD-Bringman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bringman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeMarco-2012" TYPE="STUDY">DeMarco 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winter-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Winter 1994</LINK>). Most authors only reported the different styles of music that were offered to the participants (for example, jazz, easy listening, country and western, classical music) without any composition-specific or performance-specific information. Five studies indicated the tempo range of the music, namely between 60 to 80 beats per minute (bpm) (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hook-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hook 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2011</LINK>). The majority of the studies asked the participants to select their preferred music from a limited number of music offerings. In contrast, two studies used researcher-selected music and did not take into account participant preference (<LINK REF="STD-DeMarco-2012" TYPE="STUDY">DeMarco 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004</LINK>). The decision to use patient-selected music was based on the assumption that music preference plays an important part in the effectiveness of music relaxation. This assumption has been supported by a recent series of studies that found that music preference and familiarity with the music are positively correlated with the degree of relaxation obtained from listening to music (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2012</LINK>). It needs to be noted that, in the studies included in this review, participants could only select from a limited number of music styles presented by the researcher. It is likely that the preferred music of some of the participants was not included in the music selections offered and, even if it were, that they may not have liked the specific compositions or songs being played. In two studies, participants were asked to bring music of their own choice (<LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ganidagli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ganidagli 2005</LINK>).</P>

In two studies, standard preoperative drugs, including midazolam hydrochloride and alfentanil hydrochloride, were administered to both the music intervention group and the standard care control group (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ganidagli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ganidagli 2005</LINK>). For a few studies, it was unclear whether participants received preoperative sedatives (<LINK REF="STD-Guo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hook-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hook 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2011</LINK>).

Finally, one study compared a music intervention group who did not receive preoperative sedatives with a standard care control group who received midazolam (<LINK REF="STD-Bringman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bringman 2009</LINK>). Because of the differences in preoperative drug administration between the two groups, this study could not be pooled with the other studies in this review.

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2013-05-24 11:06:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>In music intervention studies, participants cannot be blinded (unless they are in studies that compare different types of music interventions). Three studies reported blinding personnel. This was achieved by having both music group and control group participants wear headsets and listen to a CD. The control group listened to a blank CD. Twenty-one studies did not blind personnel, and for two studies blinding of personnel was unclear.</P>
<P>Only seven trials reported blinding of the outcome assessors for objective measures. For 12 trials, the use of blinding was unclear. The other trials did not use blinding. However, it is important to point out that blinding of outcome assessors is not possible in the case of subjective measurement tools (for example, STAI (<LINK REF="REF-Spielberger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spielberger 1983</LINK>)) unless the participants are blinded to the intervention. We would like to point out that the assessment of risk of bias figure (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) lists three studies as having used blinding for subjective outcomes. However, these were studies that did not include subjective outcomes. A rating of low risk was assigned if studies did not include subjective outcomes.</P>

<P>We did not identify any other potential sources of bias in the studies included in this review.</P>
<P>As a result of the risk of bias assessment, we concluded that two trials were at moderate risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Ganidagli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ganidagli 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2005</LINK>). All other trials were at high risk of bias. The main reason for receiving a high risk of bias rating was the lack of blinding. As mentioned before, blinding is often impossible in music therapy and music medicine studies that use subjective outcomes, unless in studies where the music intervention is compared to another treatment intervention (for example, progressive muscle relaxation or different type of music intervention). Therefore, it appears impossible for these types of studies to receive a low or moderate risk of bias even if all other risk factors (for example, randomization, allocation concealment, etc.) have been adequately addressed.</P>
<P>It is worth noting that the Chinese trials were particularly problematic in terms of providing sufficient information regarding risk of bias. It is unclear, however, if this was due to incomplete translations or lack of detail in the original trial reports.</P>

<P>Twenty trials (N = 1400) examined the effects of music interventions on preoperative anxiety. Thirteen trials measured anxiety by means of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State Anxiety scale (STAI-S) (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Augustin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Augustin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cassidy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassidy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeMarco-2012" TYPE="STUDY">DeMarco 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miluk_x002d_Kolasa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miluk-Kolasa 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ni-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ni 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szeto-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Szeto 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winter-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Winter 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yung-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yung 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yung-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yung 2003</LINK>). The STAI-S is a validated and widely used instrument to measure patients' anxiety. It consists of 20 statements aimed at determining a patient's current anxiety level. The total score for STAI-S ranges from 20 to 80. Seven trials reported mean anxiety measured by other scales such as a numeric rating scale and a visual analogue scale (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaberson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gaberson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ganidagli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ganidagli 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2011</LINK>). The data of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bringman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bringman 2009</LINK>) could not be included in the meta-analysis because, unlike the other studies, midazolam was withheld from participants in the music group but not from the control group.

<P>A meta-analysis of 13 trials that used the STAI-S to examine state anxiety in 896 participants indicated significantly lower state anxiety in participants who received standard care combined with music interventions than those who received standard care alone (MD -5.72, 95% CI -7.27 to -4.17, P &lt; 0.00001).

<P>The standardized mean difference (SMD) of those trials that reported post-test anxiety scores on measures different than the STAI-S (N = 504) also suggested a moderate anxiety-reducing effect of music (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.31, P &lt; 0.0001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

The results were inconsistent across studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Ten of these studies used inadequate methods of randomization or did not report the specific randomization method used. A sensitivity analysis excluding these studies from the analysis resulted in a similar MD of -2.44 (95% CI -5.95 to 1.07, P = 0.17). However, this effect size was no longer statistically significant and the heterogeneity of the studies increased (I² = 90%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2012</LINK>) examined the impact of music listening on heart rate variability (HRV) in patients awaiting surgery. HRV is gaining acceptance as a measurement of cardiac parasympathetic activity and, therefore, an indicator of a relaxation response (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2007</LINK>). Lee stated that "in the frequency-domain of HRV, low frequencies (LFs; frequencies between 0.04 and 0.15 Hz) reflect mixed sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. High frequencies (HFs; frequencies between 0.15 and 0.4 Hz) reflect parasympathetic activity. High values of the low to high (LF/HF) ratio indicate a dominance of sympathetic activity while low values indicate a dominance of parasympathetic activity. Activation of the sympathetic nerves, as in anxiety, can cause the HR to increase, high frequencies to decrease, and low frequencies and the low-to-high ratio to increase" (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>, p1182). The pooled estimate of these two studies did not show evidence for an effect of music listening on HRV (LF/HF ratio) (MD -0.37, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.42, P = 0.36; I² = 69%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The study by Bringman (<LINK REF="STD-Bringman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bringman 2009</LINK>) did not find a statistically significant difference for HR between the music listening group (mean post-test value of 67 bpm, SD 11) and the midazolam control group (mean post-test value of 68 bpm, SD 10). However, given that the music listening group did not receive a preoperative sedative whereas the control group did means that music listening was able to achieve the same sedative effects as preoperative sedative drugs.</P>
<P>Finally, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Miluk_x002d_Kolasa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Miluk-Kolasa 1996</LINK>) reported a -2.2% (SD 1.4) reduction from baseline HR for the music listening group (n = 50) and an 11.1% (SD 1.1) increase for the standard care control group (n = 50). In addition, this study measured the impact of music on cardiac output, the volume of blood being pumped by the heart. An increase in cardiac output can be attributed to an increase in HR and sympathetic nervous system activity. A reduction of 3.5% (SD 2.0) was reported in cardiac output for the music group whereas the control group's results indicated an increase of 10.9% (SD 2.1).</P>

<P>A large study (N = 327) by Bringman (<LINK REF="STD-Bringman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bringman 2009</LINK>) suggested that music listening can result in similar reductions in SBP and DBP compared with the administration of midazolam. Music listening resulted in mean post-test values of 131 (SD 16) and 81 (SD 12), respectively, whereas midazolam intake resulted in mean post-test values of 129 (SD 18) and 81 (SD 14), respectively.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Preoperative anxiety</HEADING>
<P>The results of 20 trials suggest that music listening may have a beneficial effect on anxiety in people awaiting surgery. Music listening resulted, on average, in an anxiety reduction that was 5.72 units greater than that of the standard care group, as measured by the STAI-S. At this time, there is no consensus on what constitutes a clinically significant change in anxiety as measured by the STAI-S. However, assessment of clinical significance is often determined using 0.5 standard deviation (SD) of the baseline measure as a guideline (<LINK REF="REF-Sloan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloan 2005</LINK>). Baseline SDs of studies included in this review ranged from 5.7 to 10.66, with a mean SD of 8.77. Based on the 0.5 SD rule, the difference between the treatment group and control group found in this review could therefore be considered clinically significant. Studies that used anxiety scales other than the STAI-S resulted in a difference of -0.60 standardized units. Although the magnitude of the effect differed across the studies that used non-STAI anxiety scales, the trials agreed on the direction of the point estimates. These anxiety-reducing results are considered moderate in size according to interpretation guidelines put forth by Cohen (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>). Cohen suggested that an effect size of 0.2 be considered a small effect, an effect size of 0.5 medium, and an effect size of 0.8 large.</P>

<P>None of the studies in this review included preoperative sedative drug intake as an outcome variable. However, the results of one study that compared a non-midazolam music listening group directly with a midazolam group found that music listening was more effective than midazolam for preoperative anxiety reduction.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Physiological responses</HEADING>
<P>As for the effect of music on physiological responses, the results of 16 studies suggest that music listening has a small effect on heart rate, but these results were inconsistent across studies. No evidence was found for an effect of music listening on heart rate variability (HRV). However, the HRV result is based on two studies and more research is needed. One study reported that music listening significantly reduced cardiac output compared to a standard care control group.</P>
<P>Mixed results were found for blood pressure. Whereas no support for an effect of music was found for systolic blood pressure, those same studies did find support for an effect of music on diastolic blood pressure, although again the results were inconsistent across studies.</P>
<P>Listening to music had a clinically insignificant effect on respiratory rate, namely listening to music resulted in a respiratory rate that was faster by one breath per minute compared to the control group. The results were highly inconsistent across studies.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-05-29 09:47:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included 26 randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials. All trials used listening to pre-recorded music as the music intervention. No music therapy trials, as defined by the authors in the background section, were included in this review. Although we found several music therapy studies that measured preoperative anxiety, these studies could not be included because they did not use a control group, suffered from insufficient data reporting, or failed to use standardized measures of anxiety.</P>
<P>In general, the trials that used listening to pre-recorded music included limited information about the music selections used, except for mentioning general music styles (for example new age, classical music, easy listening, etc.). Music within each of these styles can vary widely and more detailed information would help clinicians make well-informed decisions regarding music selections. More research is needed to evaluate the effect of music that is truly patient-preferred, as well as the effect of music with different characteristics (tempo, timbre, harmony, emotional intensity, etc.) on patients during high anxiety situations such as when awaiting surgery.</P>
<P>Most trials used one music intervention session of 20 to 30 minutes. This clinical uniformity adds to the strength of this review, but also leaves several questions unanswered. First, the relationship between the frequency and duration of treatment and treatment effect remains unclear. Could it be that multiple music sessions before the onset of surgery, where feasible, result in greater benefit? Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2011</LINK>) did offer multiple music sessions starting with the first session several days before surgery and continuing to the day of the surgery. Compared to other studies, these two studies resulted in greater anxiety reduction. We would like to suggest that offering multiple music listening sessions allows for the patient to give feedback about the music, select different music if needed, and become more skilled in using music for relaxation purposes. Further investigation into the optimal frequency and duration of music interventions for presurgical patients is needed. In addition, since no music therapy interventions that use live music to meet specific in-the-moment needs of the patients were included in these studies, we were unable to determine whether these would be more effective than listening to pre-recorded music.</P>
<P>Presently, no data can be provided regarding cost or cost-effectiveness of the use of music interventions in the presurgical arena as these data were not included in the trials reviewed.</P>
<P>Because little information was provided in these studies about the ethnic make-up of the patient samples, one can question the generalizability of these results to various ethnic groups. Persons' cultures may influence their music preferences and their potential acceptance and use of music as a therapeutic agent, especially during high-stress medical situations such as surgery. This in turn may influence the anxiety-reducing potential of music, to a greater or lesser degree.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-05-29 09:38:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In general the quality of reporting was poor, with only 11 studies detailing the methods of randomization and allocation concealment, and level of blinding. The chief investigators of many studies needed to be contacted to provide additional methodological and statistical information. All but two studies received a high risk of bias rating.</P>
<P>Because of the large number of trials at high risk of bias, the findings of this review need to be interpreted with caution. It is important to be mindful that many studies received a high risk of bias because of lack of blinding. Often blinding of participants is not possible in music medicine or music therapy studies unless a comparative design is used (for example, comparing listening to pre-recorded music with interactive music making with a therapist). When participants cannot be blinded to the intervention, there is definitely an opportunity for bias when participants are asked to report on subjective outcomes such as anxiety. However, this also means that trials that meet all other requirements for a low risk of bias rating are assigned a high risk of bias because of the inability to meet the blinding requirement for subjective outcomes.</P>
<P>For anxiety, consistent effects were obtained across studies. For the other outcomes included in the protocol, inconsistent results were obtained or not enough studies were available.</P>
<P>In summary, the quality of evidence was low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-05-29 09:47:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The strength of our review is that we searched all available databases and a large number of music therapy journals (English, German, and French language), checked reference lists of all relevant trials, contacted relevant experts for identification of unpublished trials, and included publications without restricting language. In spite of such a comprehensive search, it is still possible that we missed some published and unpublished trials. We requested additional data, where necessary, for all trials we considered for inclusion. This allowed us to get accurate information on the trial quality and data for most trials and helped us make well-informed trial selection decisions.</P>
<P>It is possible that we did not identify some grey literature; however, it is doubtful that this would have had a significant impact on our results. Grey literature tends to include trials with relatively small numbers of participants and inconclusive results (<LINK REF="REF-McAuley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAuley 2000</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-05-24 06:29:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this review are consistent with the results of a review (26 studies) on the effects of music interventions on anxiety in patients awaiting minimally invasive procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Gillen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gillen 2008</LINK>). Gillen and colleagues reported that music had a consistent and statistically significant effect on pre-procedural anxiety. However, no consistent effects were found for physiological responses. Based on these results, they questioned the adequacy of current theories that link anxiety and the autonomic nervous system and the impact that music listening may have on these processes. Similarly, a review by Pittman and Kridli (<LINK REF="REF-Pittman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittman 2011</LINK>) (11 studies) found that music listening consistently reduced anxiety in patients awaiting surgery or invasive medical procedures. However, they reported inconsistent results regarding music&#8217;s effectiveness in lowering blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration in presurgical and pre-procedural patients.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-05-29 09:47:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-05-29 09:47:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results of this review indicate that music listening may help reduce anxiety in patients awaiting surgery. These results are consistent with the findings of three other Cochrane systematic reviews on the use of music for anxiety reduction with coronary heart disease patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2009</LINK>), mechanically ventilated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2010</LINK>), and cancer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2011</LINK>). Moreover, the results of one large study (<LINK REF="STD-Bringman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bringman 2009</LINK>) indicated that music listening was more effective than midazolam for preoperative anxiety reduction and equally effective for reduction of heart rate and blood pressure. Given the support provided now by four Cochrane reviews for the anxiety-reducing effects of music for medical patients, in addition to the fact that preoperative sedatives and anti-anxiety drugs often have negative side effects and may prolong patient recovery and discharge, we suggest that music interventions should be offered to patients as an alternative to these drugs.</P>
<P>Although other Cochrane reviews have shown clear support for a beneficial though small effect of music on physiological responses in medical patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2011</LINK>), the current review is less conclusive. Support was found for a small effect of music on heart rate and diastolic blood pressure although results were inconsistent across studies. Single studies reported a beneficial effect of music listening on salivary cortisol and blood glucose levels. This decrease in sympathetic nervous system and endocrine activation corresponds with the anxiety-reducing effects found by subjective outcome measures in this review. However, this review did not provide evidence of such effect for respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, or skin temperature. These conflicting findings regarding the impact of music on vital signs in presurgical patients may be related to the type and duration of music, as well as preoperative medication potentially masking physiological changes (<LINK REF="REF-Pittman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittman 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the studies included postoperative outcomes such as wound healing, infection rate, patient recovery and discharge, or patient satisfaction.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-05-24 06:37:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review provides evidence that listening to pre-recorded music may have beneficial effects on preoperative anxiety. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed that examine the impact of other types of music interventions including live, interactive music experiences provided by professional music therapists. Music therapists are specially trained both clinically and academically to carefully select music interventions that actively engage patients and meet their specific needs. The act of making music together can provide a strong sense of support. Furthermore, the active and creative engagement in music making stands in stark contrast to passively submitting oneself to surgical procedures. This may result in an increased sense of control and empowerment. Future studies should examine the effects of active music therapy interventions and identify mediating variables such as social support, perceived level of control, and positive outlook.</P>
<P>Given the inconsistent changes in physiological responses in participants when listening to music during the preoperative period, more studies are needed to investigate the physiological mechanisms by which music reduces self-reported anxiety. Consequently, some of the current theories on music's sedative impact through alteration of autonomic nervous system activity may need to be reconsidered (<LINK REF="STD-Gillen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gillen 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Future trials that use listening to pre-recorded music should report greater details related to the music selections made available to participants and exercise greater care in selecting music that reflects the patient's true preference (rather than just giving the patient the option to select from four or five general genres). In addition, more details concerning the delivery of the music are needed. We recommend that researchers consult the reporting guidelines for music-based intervention developed by Robb, Burns, and Carpenter (<LINK REF="REF-Robb-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robb 2011</LINK>). Finally, studies are needed that compare the effects of different frequencies and durations of music sessions.</P>
<P>Studies are urgently needed on the use of music interventions in paediatric surgical patients. All studies in this review included adult patients only.</P>
<P>Future studies should include important outcome variables such as preoperative sedative drug intake as well as postoperative outcomes including wound healing and recovery, infection rate, and time to discharge. Furthermore, given the promising results of the Bringman study (<LINK REF="STD-Bringman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bringman 2009</LINK>), in which the effects of music listening were directly compared with the intake of a preoperative sedative, more studies are needed that make such direct comparisons. In addition, formal evaluation of the cost benefit of music interventions for preoperative anxiety reduction is needed.</P>
<P>Finally, researchers of future studies need to take greater care to design trials that meet current methodological standards (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2012</LINK>) and adhere to CONSORT standards for reporting of RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>) including detailing the randomization method, procedures for allocation concealment, blinding of personnel and outcome assessors, and attrition rate and reasons. Although blinding of participants is often not feasible in music medicine or music therapy trials, it is important that future trials meet those design aspects that minimize risk of bias.</P>

Hence, 177 patients in the music group and 159 in the midazolam group went through the study protocol; however, nine patients in the midazolam group were too sedated to be able to complete the second STAI X-1."</P>
