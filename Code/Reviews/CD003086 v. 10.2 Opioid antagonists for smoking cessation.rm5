<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-21 10:12:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Opioid antagonists are a type of drug which blunts the effects of narcotics such as heroin and morphine, and might help reduce nicotine addiction by blocking some of the rewarding effects of smoking. Our review identified eight trials of naltrexone, a long-acting opioid antagonist. The trials included over 1200 smokers. Half the trials gave everyone nicotine replacement therapy and tested whether naltrexone had any additional benefit. Compared to a placebo, naltrexone did not increase the proportion of people who had stopped smoking, at the end of treatment, or at six months or more after treatment, either on its own or added to NRT. The available evidence does not suggest that opioid antagonists such as naltrexone assist smoking cessation.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2013-05-21 10:08:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-06 14:49:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>The reinforcing properties of nicotine may be mediated through release of various neurotransmitters both centrally and systemically. People who smoke report positive effects such as pleasure, arousal, and relaxation as well as relief of negative affect, tension, and anxiety. Opioid (narcotic) antagonists are of particular interest to investigators as potential agents to attenuate the rewarding effects of cigarette smoking.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the efficacy of opioid antagonists in promoting long-term smoking cessation. The drugs include naloxone and the longer-acting opioid antagonist naltrexone.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-04-18 14:51:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register for trials of naloxone, naltrexone and other opioid antagonists and conducted an additional search of MEDLINE using 'Narcotic antagonists' and smoking terms in April 2013. We also contacted investigators, when possible, for information on unpublished studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-02-04 06:44:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>We considered randomised controlled trials comparing opioid antagonists to placebo or an alternative therapeutic control for smoking cessation. We included in the meta-analysis only those trials which reported data on abstinence for a minimum of six months. We also reviewed, for descriptive purposes, results from short-term laboratory-based studies of opioid antagonists designed to evaluate psycho-biological mediating variables associated with nicotine dependence.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-05-21 10:02:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>We extracted data in duplicate on the study population, the nature of the drug therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. Abstinence at end of treatment was a secondary outcome. We extracted cotinine- or carbon monoxide-verified abstinence where available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis, pooling risk ratios using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-21 10:08:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;According to Wong, there were 350 participants in total and the 100 from Mayo were reported in Wong, leaving 250&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-05-21 10:08:01 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>Eight trials of naltrexone met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis of long-term cessation. One trial used a factorial design so five trials compared naltrexone versus placebo and four trials compared naltrexone plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo plus NRT. Results from 250 participants in one long-term trial remain unpublished. No significant difference was detected between naltrexone and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.51, 445 participants), or between naltrexone and placebo as an adjunct to NRT (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30, 768 participants). The estimate was similar when all eight trials were pooled (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24, 1213 participants). In a secondary analysis of abstinence at end of treatment, there was also no evidence of any early treatment effect, (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.22, 1213 participants). No trials of naloxone or buprenorphine reported abstinence outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-05-21 10:08:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Monaz Mehta">
<P>Based on data from eight trials and over 1200 individuals, there was no evidence of an effect of naltrexone alone or as an adjunct to NRT on long-term smoking abstinence, with a point estimate strongly suggesting no effect and confidence intervals that make a clinically important effect of treatment unlikely. Although further trials might narrow the confidence intervals they are unlikely to be a good use of resources.</P>

<P>Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2010</LINK>). United States clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of approved cessation pharmacotherapy for quitting smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Fiore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiore 2008</LINK>). Evidence-backed medications delivering abstinence at six months or longer include nicotine replacement in the form of gum, patch, lozenge, inhaler, and nasal spray (risk ratio (RR) for any NRT 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.53 to 1.68, <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>); bupropion (RR 1.69; 95% CI 1.53 to 1.85, <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2007</LINK>); and varenicline (RR 2.27, 95% CI 2.02 to 2.55; <LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mills-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 2012</LINK>; ). Effective second-line treatments include nortriptyline (RR 2.03; 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78, <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2007</LINK>) and clonidine (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.74, <LINK REF="REF-Gourlay-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gourlay 2008</LINK>;). However long-term quit rates are relatively modest, in the range of 19.0% to 36.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Fiore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiore 2008</LINK>). With relapse as the norm, there is continued interest in other pharmacological agents for assisting cessation.</P>
<P>Nicotine dependence involves a complex interplay of learned or conditioned behaviours, personality, social settings, and pharmacological factors. The reinforcing properties of nicotine are theorised to be mediated in part through release of various neurotransmitters throughout the brain. Acute exposure to nicotine activates nicotinic cholinergic receptors resulting in the release of neurotransmitters including dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, vasopressin, serotonin, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and beta endorphin. It has been suggested that release of beta endorphin may be associated with reduction of anxiety and tension (<LINK REF="REF-Benowitz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benowitz 1999</LINK>). Nicotine also activates nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the adrenal medulla leading to the release of epinephrine (adrenaline) and beta endorphin, which may contribute to the systemic effects of nicotine. In one study, smoking a cigarette increased beta-endorphin levels 30 to 300%, which was significantly correlated with plasma nicotine levels (<LINK REF="REF-Pomerleau-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomerleau 1983</LINK>). In addition to evidence suggesting a possible reinforcing role for the endogenous opioid system in smoking, findings from other studies suggest that this system might be involved with mediating nicotine withdrawal. Studies by Malin and colleagues indicate that the opioid antagonist naloxone precipitates nicotine withdrawal in nicotine-maintained rats, and nicotine-induced reversal of this withdrawal syndrome is antagonised by naloxone (<LINK REF="REF-Malin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malin 1996</LINK>), and these and other studies have demonstrated that naloxone may actually precipitate physical and affective symptoms of nicotine withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Biala-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biala 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isola-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isola 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malin 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Opioid antagonists are typically used in the treatment of opioid dependence and alcohol dependence. The focus of this review and meta-analysis is on evaluations of opioid antagonists for the treatment of tobacco dependence. A secondary focus is the effect of opioid antagonists on psycho-biological mediating variables associated with nicotine dependence and smoking cessation.</P>
<P>Naloxone (Narcan; half-life 30-100 min; <LINK REF="REF-Goodrich-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodrich 1990</LINK>), a short-acting opioid antagonist, is routinely administered to reverse the acute effects of narcotic overdose. Evidence that naloxone and related drugs may block the reinforcing properties of nicotine and affect nicotine withdrawal has led to clinical trials of naloxone to determine its effects on smoking behaviour and withdrawal symptoms.</P>
<P>Naltrexone (Narpan&#8482;, Revia&#8482;, Vivitrol&#8482;, half-life 240 mins <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1984</LINK>), a long-acting opioid antagonist, is a marketed drug which blunts certain effects of narcotics such as heroin, meperidine, morphine and oxycodone. It has been shown to help in the treatment of alcohol dependence (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Malley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Malley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volpicelli-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpicelli 1992</LINK>). Naltrexone occupies the &#956;-opioid receptors, which putatively diminishes the activation of mesolimbic dopamine and therefore may reduce craving for nicotine. Thus it is believed that NRT and naltrexone could produce additive effects by reducing craving through different mechanisms of action. Naltrexone has also been studied for its utility to reduce post-smoking cessation weight gain; a recent Cochrane review showed a modest benefit of naltrexone on reduced post-cessation weight gain at end of treatment, but this did not persist for six months or longer (<LINK REF="REF-Farley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farley 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Buprenorphine (Buprenex&#8482;, Subutex&#8482;, Suboxone&#8482;, Butrans&#8482;, half-life 24 - 60 hrs; <LINK REF="REF-SAMHSA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAMHSA 2013</LINK>), a mixed agonist-antagonist, has also been evaluated in two published studies of smoking (<LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Mello-1985" TYPE="STUDY">°Mello 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Mutschler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">°Mutschler 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since opioid antagonists are known to precipitate nicotine withdrawal in nicotine-dependent animals, using them as an adjunct to NRT may have the additional benefit of attenuating the increased withdrawal, dysphoria and sedation caused by naloxone and naltrexone.</P>
<P>Serious adverse events are uncommon when these drugs are used in the treatment of alcohol dependence (<LINK REF="REF-CSAT-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSAT 2009</LINK>). The most common side effects have included nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, fatigue, nervousness, anxiety, and somnolence. Less common side effects include gastrointestinal distress, chest and joint/muscle pain, rash, difficulty sleeping, excessive thirst, loss of appetite, sweating, increased tears, mild depression, and delayed ejaculation. Side effects of buprenorphine are similar to those of other opioids and include nausea, vomiting, and constipation.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of the review was to evaluate the efficacy of opioid antagonists (including naltrexone, naloxone, buprenorphine), alone or in combination with nicotine replacement, in promoting smoking cessation. <BR/>The secondary objectives of the review were to evaluate the efficacy of opioid antagonists in treating withdrawal symptoms, attenuating the reinforcing value of smoking, and reducing ad libitum smoking. In the analysis, specific opioid antagonists were considered separately rather than grouping these medications as a class. For example, studies evaluating naltrexone were compared only to other studies evaluating naltrexone and not grouped with naloxone. </P>
<P>The main hypotheses were: <BR/>1. Opioid antagonists are more effective than placebo in promoting sustained abstinence from smoking. <BR/>2. Opioid antagonists used in combination with nicotine replacement therapy are more effective than either opioid antagonists or nicotine replacement therapy alone in promoting sustained abstinence from smoking. </P>

<P>For the abstinence outcomes we extracted the numbers reported quit at longest follow-up and at end of treatment using the strictest definition used in the study, i.e. preferring sustained over point prevalence rates, with biochemical validation where possible. We calculated risk ratios using as the denominators the numbers of patients randomised to each arm excluding any deaths and treating those who dropped out or were lost to follow-up as continuing to smoke. We noted any deaths and adverse events in the results tables. If necessary, we contacted authors for clarification of specific points.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-05-22 09:41:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>We combined the results of studies evaluating long-term cessation using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model for pooling risk ratios. Interventions including nicotine replacement therapy were grouped separately from those without. In previous versions of this review we used odds ratios to summarise effects, but the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group now recommends the use of risk ratios, as being less likely to be misinterpreted (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). Data on other outcomes were tabulated and described narratively. In a sensitivity analysis we estimated the effect at end of treatment of adding in the results from studies excluded due to lack of long-term follow up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies evaluating long-term abstinence</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Naltrexone:</HEADING>
<P>We identified eight trials evaluating naltrexone and reporting long-term abstinence data (six months or more). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Covey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Covey 1999</LINK> randomised 80 volunteers to either naltrexone or placebo daily for four weeks. All smokers began taking 25 mg naltrexone or placebo at least three days before the target quit date (TQD) and the dose was increased to 50 mg on the TQD. Medication was continued for four weeks and all subjects received individual counselling. The investigators reported continuous abstinence verified by saliva cotinine at three and six months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wong-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1999</LINK> randomised 100 volunteers to receive 12 weeks of either placebo only, naltrexone only, placebo with nicotine patches, or naltrexone with nicotine patches. The naltrexone dose was 50 mg taken once daily, and the nicotine patch dose was 21 mg/24-hour for the first eight weeks and 14 mg/24-hour for the remaining four weeks. Treatment with naltrexone and/or the nicotine patches started on the TQD. The trial therefore contributed separate data to both the naltrexone versus placebo and the naltrexone plus NRT versus placebo plus NRT subgroups. All participants received brief (15 to 20 minutes) counselling sessions throughout the treatment phase. Brief behavioural intervention was provided at each visit. The outcomes used in the meta-analysis were continuous abstinence at end of treatment and six months This study was part of a multicentre, partially-blinded, 2 x 2 factorial design study of naltrexone (50 mg, active versus placebo) and nicotine patch (active versus no treatment). Three hundred and fifty subjects were enrolled at five centres in the United States. However, the authors could report only the data from the Mayo Clinic site which enrolled 100 people. We made several attempts to obtain unpublished data in order to include them for the other 250 participants, but the funder, Dupont, has not disclosed further results (<LINK REF="STD-Croop-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Croop 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK> randomised 110 smokers to either naltrexone 50 mg/day or placebo for six weeks. Both groups received weekly smoking cessation counselling sessions. All participants received nicotine patch. Prolonged abstinence was assessed at eight and 24 weeks, verified by carbon monoxide (CO). Change in body weight, withdrawal symptoms, smoking urges and affect were also assessed.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Malley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">O'Malley 2006</LINK> randomised 385 volunteers to four treatment conditions: placebo, 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg of naltrexone for six weeks. All participants also received 21 mg active nicotine patch throughout the study period, and brief weekly counselling sessions and self-help support. Abstinence, weight gain and adverse events were the main outcomes of interest. The published report gives outcomes at six weeks. CO-verified quit rates at six and 12 months were provided to us by the authors. The longer term outcome is used in the meta-analysis, combining 50 mg and 100 mg dose arms.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Baltieri-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baltieri 2009</LINK> randomised 155 alcohol-dependent individuals, of which 105 were smokers, to three treatment conditions: placebo, naltrexone 50 mg/day or topiramate up to 300 mg/day for 12 weeks after a one-week alcohol detoxification period. The authors provided unpublished six-month follow-up abstinence data without biochemical verification. The authors also reported changes in cigarettes/day, mood and alcoholic relapse.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Meszaros-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meszaros 2010</LINK> randomised 79 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and comorbid alcohol and nicotine dependence to naltrexone thrice weekly (100 mg twice, + 150 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. The authors provided unpublished six-month follow-up abstinence data without biochemical verification. No effects on withdrawal or cigarette consumption were reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Toll-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Toll 2010a</LINK> randomised 172 treatment-seeking smokers and concerned about their weight to either naltrexone 25 mg a day or placebo for 27 weeks. Self-reported abstinence with CO verification was reported at six months after the quit date. In addition, changes in body weight, cigarettes smoked per day, withdrawal and craving were assessed.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-King-2012" TYPE="STUDY">King 2012</LINK> randomised 315 treatment-seeking smokers to either naltrexone 50 mg a day plus nicotine patch or placebo plus nicotine patch for 12 weeks. Both groups received weekly smoking cessation counselling sessions. Self-reported CO-validated abstinence was measured at 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. We have used the longer term outcome in the meta-analysis. In addition, change in body weight and self-reported ratings of smoking urges and depression symptoms were assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies evaluating effects on other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The remaining included studies do not report long-term abstinence and are not included in the meta-analysis. However, they fall into our second eligible category of studies that cover withdrawal or craving, reinforcing or hedonic effects of smoking, mood states, and ad libitum smoking. Studies in this category have ° preceding the study identifier (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Boureau-1978" TYPE="STUDY">°Boureau 1978</LINK>). There was methodological heterogeneity in assessments of effects of opioid antagonists on these secondary outcomes. There were cue reactivity studies (elicited craving or withdrawal) and static (no smoking cue, unelicited craving or withdrawal) assessments of withdrawal or craving or smoking urges, and some trials combined treatment with nicotine replacement while others did not. For measures and methods with more than one trial to evaluate them, results were mixed and inconclusive.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Naltrexone:</HEADING>
<P>Naltrexone was also evaluated for its effects on withdrawal syndrome, ad libitum smoking, and/or the reinforcing properties of smoking in 14 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over or within-subject designed studies in laboratory settings (<LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Brauer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">°Brauer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Caskey-2001" TYPE="STUDY">°Caskey 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">°Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Houtsmuller-1997" TYPE="STUDY">°Houtsmuller 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Hutchison-1999" TYPE="STUDY">°Hutchison 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">°King 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Knott-2007" TYPE="STUDY">°Knott 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Lee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">°Lee 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Ray-2006" TYPE="STUDY">°Ray 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Ray-2007" TYPE="STUDY">°Ray 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Rohsenow-2007" TYPE="STUDY">°Rohsenow 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Rukstalis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">°Rukstalis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Sutherland-1995" TYPE="STUDY">°Sutherland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Wewers-1998" TYPE="STUDY">°Wewers 1998</LINK>) and in eight non-laboratory-based randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Covey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Covey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2012" TYPE="STUDY">King 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_O_x0027_Malley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">°O'Malley 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Malley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">O'Malley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Rohsenow-2003" TYPE="STUDY">°Rohsenow 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toll-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Toll 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1999</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Naloxone:</HEADING>
<P>The studies of naloxone and buprenorphine were designed to evaluate effects on withdrawal syndrome, ad libitum smoking, and/or the reinforcing properties of smoking. Five studies of naloxone were small sample, placebo-controlled, cross-over or within-subject designed studies carried out in controlled laboratory environments (<LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Boureau-1978" TYPE="STUDY">°Boureau 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Gorelick-1988" TYPE="STUDY">°Gorelick 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Karras-1980" TYPE="STUDY">°Karras 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Krishnan_x002d_Sarin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">°Krishnan-Sarin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Nemeth_x002d_Coslett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">°Nemeth-Coslett 1986</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Buprenorphine:</HEADING>
<P>The effect of buprenorphine on amount smoked was assessed in two studies. <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Mello-1985" TYPE="STUDY">°Mello 1985</LINK> administered buprenorphine to seven heroin addicts, and <LINK REF="STD-_x00b0_Mutschler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">°Mutschler 2002</LINK> randomised 23 opioid- and cocaine-dependent detoxification inpatients to 4 or 8 mg of buprenorphine for 12 days.</P>

<P>Studies included in the meta-analysis were evaluated on their attempts to control bias in randomisation, allocation, assessment and analysis. None of the eight studies was judged to be at high risk for selection bias due to inadequate randomisation or allocation concealment procedures, but three (<LINK REF="STD-Baltieri-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baltieri 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Covey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Covey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meszaros-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meszaros 2010</LINK>) did not report methods in sufficient detail for the possibility of allocation bias to be discounted. Two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baltieri-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baltieri 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meszaros-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meszaros 2010</LINK>) have only been reported as abstracts with limited methodological detail.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies evaluating long term abstinence</HEADING>
<P>Eight published studies of opioid antagonists (<LINK REF="STD-Baltieri-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baltieri 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Covey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Covey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2012" TYPE="STUDY">King 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meszaros-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meszaros 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Malley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">O'Malley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toll-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Toll 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1999</LINK>) reported long-term abstinence data and are included in the primary outcome meta-analysis. All of these trials evaluated the efficacy of naltrexone for smoking cessation. We summarise the results of studies of opioid antagonists evaluating other outcomes (withdrawal symptoms, ad libitum smoking, hedonic effects) below as a review of extant data with potential utility for clinical practice pending further and more generalisable studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Naltrexone versus placebo without NRT</HEADING>
<P>Five studies with a total of 450 participants in the relevant arms contributed to this subgroup of the meta-analysis. The pooled estimate did not detect a significant benefit for naltrexone over placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.51 <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). All studies reported outcomes at six months. Two studies were included based on unpublished data without biochemical validation of abstinence (<LINK REF="STD-Baltieri-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baltieri 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meszaros-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meszaros 2010</LINK>). The pooled estimate was not sensitive to the exclusion of these studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Naltrexone versus placebo as an adjunct to NRT</HEADING>
<P>Four studies with a total of 768 participants in the relevant arms contributed to this subgroup. We used the 100 mg and 50 mg arms from the <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Malley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">O'Malley 2006</LINK> study.The pooled results from the relevant arms in these four studies did not give any indication of a treatment effect for naltrexone as an adjunct to the nicotine patch (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30). Including the 25 mg arm of the <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Malley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">O'Malley 2006</LINK> study in the meta-analysis left the RR virtually unchanged.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of heterogeneity in subgroups with or without NRT. We also pooled both subgroups to estimate the effect of naltrexone irrespective of the use of NRT. The pooled estimate gave no evidence of a treatment effect (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24, 1213 participants <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Short-term outcomes of long-term studies</HEADING>
<P>In the absence of any evidence of long-term effect, we did a secondary analysis using end-of-treatment outcomes (week 6 for <LINK REF="STD-Toll-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Toll 2010a</LINK> which provided 27 weeks of treatment). This supported the longer-term analysis, showing no evidence that there was any early treatment effect either, and with a slightly narrower confidence interval (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.22, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Since three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Byars-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Byars 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krishnan_x002d_Sarin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnan-Sarin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toll-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Toll 2010b</LINK>) that reported only short-term outcomes had been excluded, we also did a sensitivity analysis including them in the short-term analysis. The additional 116 participants from these trials did not greatly alter the estimates (RR 1.09 95% CI 0.93 to 1.27, data not shown).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-05-21 14:00:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>Eight trials of naltrexone with a total of 1213 smokers randomised to naltrexone at doses of 25 - 100 mg/day or placebo tablets have now reported long-term abstinence data. The point estimate for the risk ratio (RR) pooling all studies, 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.24), suggests that naltrexone has no effect on abstinence whether used alone or in combination with NRT. The addition of four studies in this update has narrowed the confidence interval sufficiently to conclude that the likelihood of any clinically important effect is very small. The consistency of the effects seen so far suggest that further research is only likely to reduce the CI around no effect. We also know that one study remains unpublished, the likelihood being that it too did not detect evidence of benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Croop-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Croop 2000</LINK>). Further studies would probably strengthen the evidence of lack of benefit, but may not be the best use of resources. In a secondary analysis added for this update we pooled short-term outcomes, which also showed no evidence of any early treatment effect. Three randomised clinical trials with a total of 116 participants were excluded because of lack of assessing or reporting long-term abstinence rates, and including their results in the short-term analysis did not affect the conclusions. By comparison, the RR of long-term abstinence rates for NRT from 117 trials with over 50,000 participants was 1.60 (95% CI 1.53 to 1.68) (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>At least three study reports (<LINK REF="STD-Covey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Covey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2012" TYPE="STUDY">King 2012</LINK>) raised the possibility that there could be a difference in effect by gender, with women showing more evidence of a benefit than men. The other five abstinence studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baltieri-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baltieri 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meszaros-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Meszaros 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Malley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">O'Malley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toll-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Toll 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1999</LINK>) did not report quit rates for men and women separately, so we could not conduct a meta-analysis without risk of reporting bias.</P>
<P>Although not an end point of this systematic review, it should be noted that the <LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-King-2012" TYPE="STUDY">King 2012</LINK> studies showed significant benefits of naltrexone for reducing post-cessation weight gain, but <LINK REF="STD-Toll-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Toll 2010a</LINK> did not find a significant effect of naltrexone for this outcome. The effects on weight gain are evaluated in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Farley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farley 2012</LINK>). There are mixed results with regard to whether or not naltrexone reduces withdrawal symptoms, diminishes the reinforcing effects of nicotine and tobacco or reduces post-cessation weight gain. However, because of heterogeneity of methods and data reporting we are unable to examine withdrawal symptoms and reinforcing effects using meta-analytic techniques. Also, we do not have enough data to examine whether or not the use of combination naltrexone and nicotine replacement has a significant effect on withdrawal symptoms compared to nicotine replacement plus placebo.</P>
<P>There were no clear trends suggesting positive or negative effects of naloxone on withdrawal, ad libitum smoking or hedonic effects. In any case, the very short half-life, and route of administration of naloxone (intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous) precludes its use as an agent for smoking cessation in clinical settings.</P>
<P>Given the purported role of opioid pathways in nicotine dependence, it would seem biologically plausible that opioid antagonists would blunt the rewarding effects of smoking. Moreover, we would expect, if opioid antagonists diminished the reinforcing properties of smoking, that this would translate to decreased tobacco consumption or ad libitum smoking. However, we found no such trends. This lack of observed effects of opioid antagonists on smoking rates and aversive or reinforcing properties of nicotine is consistent with a study in rats that showed no effect on nicotine self administration (<LINK REF="REF-Corrigall-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrigall 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>A large body of converging evidence suggests that nicotine stimulates the release of dopamine in the mesocorticolimbic system and plays an important role in the reinforcing properties of smoking. <LINK REF="REF-Blum-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blum 1995</LINK> and others have suggested that individuals may be at higher risk for dependence on nicotine and other substances because of deficiencies in dopamine transmission in the mesocorticolimbic system. However, the neurobiology of nicotine addiction is complex and involves interactions between multiple neurotransmitter systems (<LINK REF="REF-Benowitz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benowitz 2010</LINK>). The dopamine re-uptake inhibitor bupropion appears to diminish the rewarding effects of smoking and also appears to decrease withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Shiffman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shiffman 2000</LINK>) and the nicotine receptor partial agonist varenicline has shown similar effects (<LINK REF="REF-Brandon-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandon 2012</LINK>). While we cannot draw any firm conclusions on the effect of opioid antagonists on the reinforcing properties of smoking or withdrawal, the literature to date suggests that dopamine and other interacting pathways play a more important role in nicotine dependence.</P>
