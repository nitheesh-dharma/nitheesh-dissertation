<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:22:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nishad Plakkal">
<P>Liver cancer is a leading cause of death among people with chronic hepatitis B infection. Screening such patients with ultrasound of the liver or alpha-foetoprotein in the blood, or both, is widely performed to detect liver cancer at an early stage. The hope is that early stages of liver cancer can be treated by resection or transplantation, or both, with improved outcomes. Only three trials could be included in this review. One of these trials was conducted in Shanghai, China. It compared screening twice yearly with ultrasound and alpha-foetoprotein against no screening. The trial has a high risk of systematic errors (bias) and several published reports of the trial provide different results. Another trial was conducted in Toronto, Canada. It compared screening with alpha-foetoprotein and ultrasound versus screening with alpha-foetoprotein alone. This trial had too few participants. As there were no participants who were not screened, we cannot assess whether screening is effective in reducing mortality. The remaining trial was published as an abstract only. It was designed to determine the optimal time interval for screening using alpha fetoprotein and ultrasound. The cumulative four-year survival was not significantly different between the two studied screening intervals of four months and 12 months. Thus, to date, there is insufficient evidence regarding screening for liver cancer among patients with chronic hepatitis B infection.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-07-31 12:52:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>All published reports of randomised trials on screening for liver cancer were eligible for inclusion, irrespective of language of publication.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:22:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nishad Plakkal">
<P>Three randomised clinical trials were included in this review. All of them had a high risk of bias. One trial was conducted in Shanghai, China. There are several published reports on this trial, in which data were presented differently. According to the 2004 trial report, participants were randomised to screening every six months with alpha-foetoprotein and ultrasonography (n = 9373) versus no screening (n = 9443). We could not draw any definite conclusions from it. A second trial was conducted in Toronto, Canada. In this trial, there were 1069 participants with chronic hepatitis B. The trial compared screening every six months with alpha-foetoprotein alone (n = 532) versus alpha-foetoprotein and ultrasound (n = 538) over a period of five years. This trial was designed as a pilot trial; the small number of participants and the rare events did not allow an effective comparison between the two modes of screening that were studied. The remaining trial, conducted in Taiwan and published as an abstract, was designed as a cluster randomised trial to determine the optimal interval for screening using alpha foetoprotein and ultrasound. Screening intervals of four months and 12 months were compared in the two groups. Further details about the screening strategy were not available. The trial reported on cumulative four-year survival, cumulative three-year incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and mean tumour size. The cumulative four-year survival was not significantly different between the two screening intervals. The incidence of hepatocellular cancer was higher in the four-monthly screening group. The included trials did not report on adverse events. It appears that the sensitivity and specificity of the screening modes were poor, accounting for a substantial number of false-positive and false-negative screening results.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:09:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nishad Plakkal">
<P>There is not enough evidence to support or refute the value of alpha-foetoprotein or ultrasound screening, or both, of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients for hepatocellular carcinoma. More and better designed randomised trials are required to compare screening against no screening.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:22:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nishad Plakkal">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:22:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nishad Plakkal">
<P>Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, accounting for approximately 600,000 deaths annually. The incidence of liver cancer is two to four times higher in men than women (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2004</LINK>). Geographic differences also exist and can be largely attributed to the differences in the distribution of risk factors like hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and the toxin aflatoxin (<LINK REF="REF-Kumagi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumagi 2009</LINK>). The number of liver cancers is increasing in some parts of the world, such as the United States, while a decreasing trend has been reported for some other areas like China. Immunisation against hepatitis B and migration from endemic areas contribute to these changing trends of hepatocellular carcinoma. Other factors implicated in the changing trends of hepatocellular carcinoma include an aging population, increasing survival in those with cirrhosis due to more effective treatment, and a changing epidemiology of hepatitis B and C virus (<LINK REF="REF-Llovet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llovet 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hepatitis B is a potent hepatocarcinogen (<LINK REF="REF-Tsai-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsai 2010</LINK>). Patients with cirrhosis have a 3% to 5% annual risk of malignant transformation (<LINK REF="REF-Coon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coon 2007</LINK>) but when cirrhosis is secondary to chronic hepatitis B, the risk is as high as 8% (<LINK REF="REF-Tsai-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsai 2010</LINK>). Hepatocellular carcinoma develops in patients with chronic hepatitis B without cirrhosis at a rate of 0.5% to 0.6% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Llovet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llovet 2003</LINK>). A recent study in Australia showed that those with hepatitis B virus infection have a relative risk of dying from hepatocellular carcinoma of 34.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 30.4 to 40.2) compared to those without infection (<LINK REF="REF-Walter-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walter 2011</LINK>). The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma among people with chronic hepatitis B varies. There is a higher risk among males, and for those who are older, have a family history of hepatocellular carcinoma, consume alcohol regularly, have elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, have positive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status, with high hepatitis B viral loads, and have specific genotypes of hepatitis B virus. These have been formulated into a nomogram and validated on a Taiwanese population (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2010</LINK>). Even in the presence of low viral load, the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among hepatitis B infected people is 4.4 times the risk of those who are not infected (<LINK REF="REF-Iloeje-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iloeje 2007</LINK>). Worldwide, hepatitis B is estimated to account for 80% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Llovet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llovet 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chronic hepatitis B affects around 400 million people worldwide, with prevalence in some areas like China and sub-Saharan Africa approaching 15% of the general population (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Hepatitis B acquired in childhood has a different natural history compared to that acquired in adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Pungpapong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pungpapong 2007</LINK>). Being a DNA virus, hepatitis B virus integrates with the host genome, and the possibility of reactivation exists even after clearance of circulating hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (<LINK REF="REF-Pungpapong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pungpapong 2007</LINK>). Hepatitis B infection during childhood becomes chronic in up to 90% of individuals, who pass into an immune tolerant phase where high levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication occurs with little or no liver inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Pungpapong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pungpapong 2007</LINK>). This may persist for years or decades and often changes into an immune active phase with active liver inflammation. The severity and duration of this inflammation determines the progression to cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2010</LINK>). Seroconversion with amelioration of liver inflammation passing into a low replicative phase or 'inactive carrier' phase occurs at a rate of less than 10% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Chu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chu 2000</LINK>). During these phases reactivation can occur at any time resulting in a return of inflammation even though HBeAg may be negative and anti-HBeAg may be positive. When HBV infection is acquired in adulthood, less than 5% develop chronic infection (<LINK REF="REF-Pungpapong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pungpapong 2007</LINK>). This type of infection is characterised by an absence of the immune-tolerant phase, with persistence of active inflammation ending either in resolution of the infection or the occurrence of complications.</P>
<P>While histology remains the gold standard for making a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and differentiating it from other types of liver cancer, it cannot always be performed. Concerns about the underlying liver condition, bleeding risks, the risk of tumour seeding of the biopsy tract, the impact of the diagnosis, and patient refusal all affect the decision to biopsy (<LINK REF="REF-Coon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burak-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burak 2010</LINK>). Furthermore, in the presence of cirrhosis a negative biopsy of a suspicious nodule does not rule out hepatocellular carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Kumagi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumagi 2009</LINK>). This has resulted in the development of diagnostic criteria by various professional organizations such as European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) (<LINK REF="REF-Bruix-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruix 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jelic-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jelic 2010</LINK>). The EASL diagnostic criteria include cyto-histological criteria and non-invasive criteria (restricted to cirrhotic patients). The non-invasive criteria are radiological criteria, with two coincidence imaging techniques showing a focal lesion larger than 2 cm with arterial hypervascularity; or combined criteria, with one imaging technique showing focal lesion larger than 2 cm with arterial hypervascularity plus alpha-foetoprotein levels greater than 400 ng/mL. Using these criteria, lesions larger than 2 cm can be identified as hepatocellular carcinoma with more than 95% certainty (<LINK REF="REF-Kumagi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumagi 2009</LINK>). However, for a lesion of 1 cm to 2 cm the sensitivity of these criteria is only 33% (<LINK REF="REF-Forner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forner 2008</LINK>). Many studies, especially older ones, do not use these criteria and often diagnosis is established by a 'long-term follow-up'.</P>
<P>Many prognostic indicators have been postulated for hepatocellular carcinoma, but the two most important ones are the stage of the cancer and the underlying liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Coon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coon 2007</LINK>). There are various staging systems available, like the tumour node metastases (TNM) staging system and the Barcelona staging system. In many hepatitis B endemic countries, like China, locally developed staging systems are used. The Barcelona staging system has been widely used in trials of the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Bruix-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruix 2010</LINK>). Studies using different staging systems are poorly comparable.</P>
<P>Symptomatic hepatocellular carcinoma usually presents at an advanced stage (<LINK REF="REF-Kumagi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumagi 2009</LINK>). Treatment options for late stage hepatocellular carcinoma are few and often restricted to palliative measures (<LINK REF="REF-Oliveri-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliveri 2011</LINK>). Furthermore, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma invariably have advanced liver disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma can cause decompensation in previously compensated cirrhosis. In the event of death, it is often difficult to discriminate between being secondary to the cancer or the underlying liver disease as the cause of death (<LINK REF="REF-Llovet-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llovet 2008</LINK>). Survival at this stage, with only supportive measures, is between three months and seven months (<LINK REF="REF-Coon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coon 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>For early stage disease, resection or transplantation is thought to be effective. However, only 20% to 25% of hepatocellular carcinoma can be managed with a curative intent (<LINK REF="REF-Yeung-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeung 2005</LINK>). Other treatment methods like transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have been used, but the trials in this area are few and often of poor quality (<LINK REF="REF-Kumagi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumagi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oliveri-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliveri 2011</LINK>).<B> </B>
</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:13:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nishad Plakkal">
<P>Screening is accomplished by ultrasound or biomarkers, such as alpha-foetoprotein, alpha-foetoprotein-L3, protein induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA-II), or glypican-3 (<LINK REF="REF-Bruix-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruix 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ultrasound has been widely used for liver imaging. It is increasingly believed to be the method of choice for screening. Although it is highly observer dependent, the pooled sensitivity for hepatocellular carcinoma is estimated at 94%, with a lower sensitivity of 63% for early disease with smaller tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Coon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coon 2007</LINK>). Specificity is estimated at between 92% and 98% (<LINK REF="REF-Coon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coon 2007</LINK>). Newer techniques such as microbubble contrast enhancement and harmonic imaging techniques may significantly improve detection rates by demonstrating the arterialization of hepatocellular carcinoma, allowing differentiation from other liver tumours that are fed by the portal vein. Since these are recent developments, only specialised centres offer these techniques, and their role in screening has not been studied in randomised clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Kudo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kudo 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Serum biomarker estimation has also been used as a screening technique. Alpha-foetoprotein remains widely used although it has never been sufficiently studied as a single screening tool. Alpha-foetoprotein is secreted by immature hepatocytes. Apart from with pregnancy and some germ cell tumours, increased levels are seen in inflammation of the liver (such as in chronic hepatitis), regenerating nodule(s), and hepatocellular carcinoma. Around 20% of hepatocellular carcinomas do not secrete alpha-foetoprotein. At a cut-off of 20 ng/mL of alpha-foetoprotein, the sensitivity and specificity are estimated to be between 39% to 64% and 76% to 91%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 9% to 32% (<LINK REF="REF-Coon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coon 2007</LINK>). The other biomarkers remain investigational. In one phase II study, PIVKA-II and alpha-foetoprotein L-3 were found to be less sensitive for the diagnosis of early hepatocellular carcinoma than alpha-foetoprotein at a cut-off of 10.9 ng/mL, though this cut-off needs further evaluation (<LINK REF="REF-Kudo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kudo 2010</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:14:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>With newer diagnostic methods, it is now possible to detect hepatocellular carcinoma much earlier. Around 55% to 65% of tumours detected by screening among high risk groups in Japan are at an early stage (<LINK REF="REF-Kudo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kudo 2010</LINK>). Potentially effective treatment modes, such as hepatic resection and liver transplantation, are now available to well-selected patients in the early stages of the disease. Resection is advised for a single tumour nodule that is peripheral in location with no vascular invasion together with good liver function (Child-Pugh A) and functional status, and normal portal pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Bruix-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruix 2010</LINK>). Treatment with hepatic resection results in a five-year survival of 50%, with a 70% risk of recurrence or multi-focal development over the same time period. Transplantation is recommended in Child-Pugh stages A-B with one tumour nodule less than 5 cm or three tumour nodules that are each less than 3 cm. This tumour size definition (Milan criteria) has been expanded by the University of California, San Francisco protocol to include a single nodule less than 6.5 cm or three nodules each less than 4.5 cm with similar results. Transplantation is associated with a five-year survival of 60%, with less than 25% recurrence over that time period (<LINK REF="REF-Coon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coon 2007</LINK>). Since liver transplantation treats hepatocellular carcinoma as well as liver failure, some centres also offer it to patients with Child-Pugh stage C cirrhosis and tumours within the Milan criteria, with five-year survival of 73.5% and tumour recurrence of less than 15% (<LINK REF="REF-Burak-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burak 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>This improved prognosis of early hepatocellular carcinoma, which is often asymptomatic, has led to the belief that early detection of tumours will reduce the mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, many expert professional organisations recommend screening (<LINK REF="REF-Bruix-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruix 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jelic-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jelic 2010</LINK>). However, even in the best circumstances, only 50% of hepatocellular carcinomas from any screened cohort are at an early enough stage to be eligible for effective therapy.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:14:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hepatocellular carcinoma screening satisfies many of the criteria for a successful screening program in being fairly common in certain definable groups, causing substantial mortality, and with fairly simple screening tools. However, it is a fast growing tumour, and treatment with curative intent is available only to a highly selected group (<LINK REF="REF-Yeung-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeung 2005</LINK>). Many hepatologists recommend screening (<LINK REF="REF-Bruix-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruix 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jelic-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jelic 2010</LINK>), and its performance is widespread (<LINK REF="REF-Chalasani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalasani 1999</LINK>). Many non-randomised studies support this stand. However, even in the best of circumstances non-randomised studies often use voluntary participants (selection bias), tend to detect slower growing tumours (length time bias), and assume that all of the increase in survival is due to early detection (lead time bias). Thus, we undertook this review of randomised clinical trials to examine the evidence for the efficacy of screening programs for hepatocellular carcinomas.</P>

<P>1. All-cause mortality.<BR/>2. Disease-specific mortality: controversy exists regarding the use of this outcome to estimate the efficacy of a screening programme. Cause of death is often difficult to determine, and deaths due to the screening process per se or its complications are often not included under disease-specific mortality. Thus, this is an inadequate surrogate to all-cause mortality, but it is often the only available outcome measure (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2002</LINK>).<BR/>3. Adverse events. Proportion of patients with serious adverse events and proportion of patients with non-serious adverse events. Serious adverse events are defined according to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-ICH_x002d_GCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH-GCP 1997</LINK>) as any event that leads to death, is life-threatening, requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability, and any important medical event that may have jeopardised the patient or requires intervention to prevent it. All other adverse events are considered non-serious.<BR/>4. Quality of life.<BR/>

Number of patients with early stage of hepatocellular carcinoma detected per 1000 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection screened per year.<BR/>7. Differences, if any, in survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: survival is measured using the denominator 'all those with the disease'; the screening group will have artificially increased survival proportions due to lead and length-time bias.

<P>Three of the four trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The included randomised trials were conducted in: Toronto, Canada, between 1989 and 1994 (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>); in Taiwan (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>); and in Shanghai, China, between 1992 and 1997 (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>). The trial by Zhang et al (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>) was reported in seven publications that we found in English and Chinese language journals, while the trial by Sherman et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>) was reported in one publication and the trial by Wang et al was available only as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Patients</HEADING>
<P>The Sherman et al trial involved 1069 participants from a multi-ethnic background (71% of 1037 participants whose ethnic origin was recorded were classified as Asian) (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>). All participants were HBsAg positive. This population was the result of a mixture of referrals from family physicians, gastroenterologists, and general public responding to advertisements in the popular media. A total of 538 participants were individually randomised to screening with alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasound versus 531 randomised to screening with alpha-fetoprotein alone. The mean age of the trial population was 39 years (SD 12). About 2.4% of this population had evidence of cirrhosis, and 40% had abnormal liver enzymes at recruitment.</P>
<P>The trial by Wang et al was conducted in an endemic area covering 10 townships. Participants were randomly allocated to a four-month screening group or an annual screening group (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>). Within the 10 townships, the trialists identified patients with a platelet count less than 150 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>, or positive for HBsAg, or positive for HCV antibody, and invited them for screening. In the four-month screening group there were 387 participants, while in the 12-month screening group there were 357 participants.</P>
<P>Factories, schools, or enterprises were used as the units of randomisation in the Zhang et al trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>). Each unit became a cluster of patients. General practitioners serving these institutions recruited patients for the intervention site of the trial. According to the 2004 report, the trial involved 18,816 participants; 9373 were randomised to the screening group and 9343 to the no screening group (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>). The mean age of the participants was 41.5 years (range 35 to 59), and 63% were males. The participants were presumably ethnically homogenous. No information was given regarding the initial liver functions of the participants.They were either participants with HBsAg positive (91.6%) or HBsAg negative (8.4%) chronic hepatitis. The small proportion of participants with other chronic hepatitis infections included in the trial does not in our opinion significantly affect the results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Sherman et al used real-time ultrasound and radioimmunoassay for alpha-foetoprotein as the screening tools (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>). They followed all participants at six-monthly intervals (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>). If a participant missed a screening appointment, he or she was contacted to confirm withdrawal from the trial or to confirm occurrence of outcome measures, hepatocellular carcinoma or death specifically. The diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy, surgical resection, or by a combination of elevated alpha-foetoprotein and typical features on ultrasound or computed tomography. There was a high attrition rate of 254 people (23.7%) dropping out before completion of the trial.</P>
<P>In the trial by Sherman et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>), resection was the only treatment option.</P>
<P>The trial by Wang et al was designed to determine the optimal interval for screening using alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasound (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>). Screening in the two groups was offered at a four-monthly and annual intervals. Further details about the screening strategy were not available.</P>
<P>The two groups in the Zhang trial were similar with respect to age, sex, HBsAg positivity and HBsAg negativity (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>). Screening was carried out at six-monthly intervals using alpha-foetoprotein estimation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time ultrasound. Confirmation of diagnosis was done with ultrasound examination by a senior physician or computed tomography or, if required, magnetic resonance imaging of the lesion. Further confirmation was achieved by long-term follow-up or biopsy.</P>
<P>The screened participants in the Zhang et al trial were followed at six-monthly intervals, while the controls were not actively followed (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>). Information regarding hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence and deaths were collected from their general practitioners or from the Shanghai cancer registry, or both (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>). Interval cancers and cancers among those not compliant with screening were also identified by this method. Most participants in the screened group received between one and 10 screens (median five). Participation was 58.2% initially, but it dropped to around 30% by the eighth screening. Resection, transarterial chemoembolization, or percutaneous ethanol injections were offered, as appropriate, for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.</P>
<P>The trials by <LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK> used alpha-foetoprotein levels greater than 20 &#956;g/L as the cut-off for abnormal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Suspected hepatocellular carcinomas were confirmed by ultrasonography in most participants. Studies have shown that even in the absence of liver biopsy, diagnosis can be made with fair certainty (<LINK REF="REF-Kumagi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumagi 2009</LINK>) using imaging techniques like computer tomography with contrast or magnetic resonance imaging, where the vascular pattern of the tumour can be demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Forner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forner 2008</LINK>). Ultasound alone is inadequate for this purpose.</P>
<P>Staging of hepatocellular carcinoma was done by a local system where stage I is hepatocellular carcinoma with no signs or symptoms; stage III is hepatocellular carcinoma with decompensated liver disease; and stage II is everything in between. This system of staging does not allow inference regarding the size of the tumour or its extent. This method is not validated and is not comparable with other accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Bruix-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruix 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Sherman et al trial was designed as a pilot feasibility trial prior to a planned randomised clinical trial to study the efficacy of screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>). Thus, the outcomes studied in the trial were prevalence and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and mortality in a cohort of participants, as well as sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of alpha-foetoprotein levels and ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma.</P>
<P>The trial abstract for the study by Wang et al does not clearly identify the primary outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>). The trial reports on cumulative three-year incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, mean tumour size, and cumulative four-year survival.</P>
<P>The outcomes used by Zhang et al were mortality due to hepatocellular carcinoma, stage and resectability of hepatocellular carcinoma, and survival after diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>One trial was excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK>). This trial was conducted in the Qidong county of China between 1989 and 1995 (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK>). Two reports found in one Chinese and one English language journals were identified (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK>). This trial was excluded as screening of participants was performed using a reverse passive hemagglutination method for estimation of alpha-foetoprotein. This method is about half as sensitive as the enzyme-linked immunoassay. This introduces bias and reduces our ability to assess the benefits and harms of the intervention. This trial involved 5581 HBsAg positive participants between the age of 35 and 69 years. The participants were randomised after stratifying at township level to yield a screening group (n = 3702) and no screening group (n = 1809). Screening was carried out by a six-month estimation of alpha-foetoprotein by the reverse passive hemagglutination method, with a cut-off of 100 &#956;g/L. Confirmation of diagnosis was done by ultrasonography in most participants, with addition of a computer tomography scan in about 4.3%. Autopsy and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in a few patients. Outcome measures studied were death and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. The outcome measures in the control group were assessed through a population-based cancer registry. The trial found 257 participants with hepatocellular carcinoma among the participants in the screened group and 117 in the control group. More cancers were at stage I among the screened participants (29.6%) compared with the control group (6%). A local system of staging was used, where stage I refers to hepatocellular carcinoma with no symptoms or signs. There was no significant difference in either hepatocellular carcinoma mortality specifically (1132/100,000 versus 1113/100,000) or all-cause mortality (1842/100,000 versus 1788/100,000).</P>

<P>The trial by Sherman et al used simple random sampling (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>). It was designed as a pilot trial and aimed at describing the prevalence and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and mortality in this cohort, and the test characteristics of alpha-foetoprotein estimation and ultrasound for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. It did not allow for any inference regarding the efficacy of screening compared with no screening. Furthermore, the small number of participants (n = 1069) and the small number of events (n = 14 hepatocellular carcinomas detected) also precluded any comparison of the two methods of screening. No sample size calculation was mentioned. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.</P>
<P>The trial by Wang et al was a cluster randomised trial using townships as the units for allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>).

<P>The randomised trial by Zhang et al was a cluster randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>). The 2004 report says "...simple cluster sampling was carried out.", while the 1997 report states it as "Regarding 'factory', 'enterprise', or 'school' as a unit, we then drew a simple random sample from these units...". The number of controls was 9711 in two reports, in 1996 and 1997; and this dropped to 9443 in all subsequent reports. A sample size calculation was not given. Intention-to-treat analysis was used in the final report of the trial.</P>

<P>The Sherman et al trial reported 14 hepatocellular carcinomas detected during the trial period (2340 person years of observation); the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma being 470/100,000 person years (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>). No information regarding the stage of the disease was given nor whether there was any clear indication of which screening group the people with hepatocellular carcinomas belonged to. Only half of the patients had liver resection. There were 11 deaths in total, accounting for an all-cause mortality of 470/100,000 person years; and five deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma, resulting in a disease-specific mortality of 213.7/100,000 person years in the entire cohort of 1069 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of alpha-foetoprotein estimation were 64.3%, 91.4%, and 9% respectively. For ultrasound, the values were 71.4%, 93.8%, and 15.1%, respectively. No adverse events were reported.The authors conceded that the events were too few to enable comparison of the two screening modes, so no such information was provided in the trial report.</P>
<P>Multiple reports of the Zhang et al trial presented different results (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>). The number of controls and total number of participants dropped from 9771 and 19,144 in the 1997 report, before completion, to 9443 and 18,816 in the reports published at the end of the trial. For the sake of simplicity, discrepancies noted in two reports that were both published after the end of the trial, one in a Chinese language journal and the other in an English language journal, are presented in the tables below. The reasons for these differences are not given in any of the two publications, and while we did make contact with one of the authors he did not give answers to our questions.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:22:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nishad Plakkal">
<P>This systematic review is an update of a previous systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Wun-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wun 2003</LINK>). Since then, only one new trial of screening for hepatocellular carcinoma among people with chronic hepatitis B could be found (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>). However, three new reports of older trials, two from the trial by Zhang et al (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>) and one by Chen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK>), were identified and more data included in this review.</P>
<P>The Sherman et al trial was not designed to test the efficacy of screening (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>). The small number of participants and the small number of events preclude any inference regarding the benefit or harm of screening with alpha-fetoprotein alone, or with alpha-foetoprotein and ultrasound. This trial only reported all-cause mortality for the entire cohort and not for any of the individual groups (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trial by Wang et al, published in abstract format only, did report on survival and occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>). The trials by Sherman et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>) and Zhang et al (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>) reported disease-specific mortality. None of the trials reported adverse events or quality of life outcomes.</P>
<P>The trial by Chen was excluded as the method of estimation of alpha-foetoprotein was insensitive (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK>). This trial did not demonstrate a difference in all-cause mortality between the two trial intervention groups. The trial by Zhang et al had many methodological flaws, and the multiple reports of the trial presented conflicting evidence (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>). This made the results of the trial difficult to evaluate. The inclusion of the two latest reports of the trial by Zhang et al did not clarify any of the issues (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the trial by Wang et al, the incidence of hepatocellular cancer was higher in the four-monthly screening group (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>). In the two other trials, hepatocellular cancer incidence was higher in the screened group, though the absolute magnitude varied widely for both the control and intervention groups in both trials. This may be the result of inherent differences in the populations studied. In the Sherman and Zhang trials, around 50% of the detected cancers were treatable (<LINK REF="STD-Sherman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>). Such information is not available for the Wang et al trial.</P>
<P>In the Wang et al trial, cumulative four-year survival was not significantly different when the two screening intervals were compared (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>). Survival was evaluated in the trial by Zhang et al, though various reports present it differently (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:19:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Many cohort studies support screening of patients with chronic hepatitis B using ultrasonography or alpha-foetoprotein, or both. Two community-based studies in the United States, a retrospective cohort (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2009</LINK>) and a case-control study (<LINK REF="REF-Tong-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2010</LINK>), concluded that screening improved survival among patients at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B virus infection is endemic among Alaskan indigenous groups in the United States. MacMohan et al reported on regular screening for hepatocellular carcinoma in this population. The authors concluded that compared to historical controls, the cohort in whom regular screening with alpha-foetoprotein was carried out every six months had better survival (<LINK REF="REF-McMahon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMahon 2000</LINK>). In an Italian cohort study of patients admitted with hepatocellular carcinoma, screen detected cancers appeared to have better outcomes than incidentally detected cancers among those with cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Farinati-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farinati 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Santi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santi 2010</LINK>). All these studies, being non-randomised, have the same problem of having dissimilar comparison groups and of being subject to length bias and lead-time bias. Kunz et al demonstrated that estimates of effect in cohort studies differ widely from those of randomised trials, by -78% to 400% (<LINK REF="REF-Kunz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunz 2007</LINK>). Thus, results from non-randomised studies cannot be taken as proof of efficacy of screening.</P>
<P>Even among patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma varies, and this is dependent on ethnicity (<LINK REF="REF-Bruix-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruix 2010</LINK>). Asian males over the age of 40 years with or without active viral replication develop hepatocellular carcinoma at the rate of 0.2% per year, while Caucasians with no active viral replication are at no increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Bruix-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruix 2010</LINK>). Thus, evidence from one ethnic group may not be directly applicable to other groups. This highlights the need for using ethnicity as a stratification factor in randomised clinical trials.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, there is a paucity of randomised trials on screening for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis B. This lack of trials is surprising considering the large numbers of people with chronic hepatitis B virus infection worldwide who are at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and are being screened. This may in part reflect the distribution of chronic hepatitis B virus infection, which is common in developing and underdeveloped countries where resources required to conduct such a large scale trial may be hard to assemble. However, many experts have asserted that a screening program works (<LINK REF="REF-Bruix-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruix 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jelic-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jelic 2010</LINK>) and have pre-empted the question of whether a randomised trial is needed.</P>
<P>Since the time of these studies, in the late 1990s, there have been many developments in the area of diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Coon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bruix-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruix 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jelic-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jelic 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kudo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kudo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forner 2012</LINK>). None of the trials in the review offered transplantation as a treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. This may affect the outcome of the trials, though liver transplant is not available in many parts of the world nor is it likely that enough liver transplants will be available to treat all patients detected in a trial. The trial by Wang et al looks at screening people with chronic viral hepatitis for hepatocellular carcinoma at four-monthly versus yearly intervals using alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasound (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2011</LINK>). The published trial abstract indicates that there is no significant difference in survival between the two groups.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:20:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Screening trials are fraught with many biases. Lead-time and length-time biases are well known and can be overcome by adequate randomisation (<LINK REF="REF-Croswel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croswel 2010</LINK>). However, other forms of bias such as the healthy volunteer bias and overdiagnosis bias may still persist. The outcome measure often used is disease-specific mortality, and many screening trials are powered to detect changes in this quantity (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2009</LINK>). However, the cause of mortality is difficult to determine even if there is blind third party adjudication and may result in sticky diagnosis bias or slippery-linkage bias (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, screening is a programme implementation rather than a one-at-a time project. Thus screening trials must be very carefully conducted and evaluated before conclusions can be drawn.</P>
<P>Overall, the quality of evidence in the trials included in this review was judged as at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>One of the two included trials presented conflicting results in its various reports. When we contacted the authors, they did not give any clear explanation for the noted discrepancies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:19:37 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We cannot exclude the possibility that there may be unpublished trials that we did not identify. Such publication bias is more likely to affect trials with a neutral or negative result. Thus, even if such a publication bias does exist it would be unlikely to be in favour of screening for hepatocellular carcinoma.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-07-31 13:19:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Compared to the previous version of this review, we identified and added two new reports on the trials by <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>. The new reports did not change our initial opinion regarding inclusion or exclusion of the trials, nor our conclusions. In addition, we were able to identify one new trial whose results, when published fully, may shed additional light on the issue of screening for hepatocellular carcinoma.</P>
<P>Multiple professional organisations (<LINK REF="REF-Bruix-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruix 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jelic-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jelic 2010</LINK>) recommend screening, based on poor quality evidence with high risk of bias (systematic errors) and high risk of play of chance (random errors) (<LINK REF="REF-Keus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2010</LINK>). A recent review by the Health Technology Assesment, United Kingdom on screening for hepatocellular carcinoma among those with cirrhosis concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend screening (<LINK REF="REF-Coon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coon 2007</LINK>). Cirrhosis and hepatitis C are other risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma and we could not identify any systematic reviews for screening in these groups either.</P>

<P>There is an urgent need for well-designed randomised clinical trials in this area. Future research should compare screened individuals with a control group without screening. Such trials should include adequate sample size calculations and proper blinding processes. Diagnosis, staging, and therapy offered must be according to current recommendations. The primary outcomes should include all-cause mortality. The patients should be stratified according to liver function and ethnicity. Additionally, information about other significant outcomes, particularly anxiety, false positive proportions, and harms including extra operations and other treatments should also be reported. Finally, trials should follow the recommended guidelines for the reporting of clinical trials (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT): <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>).</P>

<P>As acknowledged, this review is the product of a protocol originally prepared by Yuk Tsan Wun et al in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Wun-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wun 2000</LINK>). Since then, while working on the review, several changes have been made and are explained in the following passage.</P>
<P>The original protocol was designed to include non-randomised studies. However, in accordance with the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and the fact that estimates of benefit provided by non-randomised studies vary widely from those of randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Kunz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunz 2007</LINK>), we chose to include only randomised trials. We intended to include both published and unpublished trials on the topic. The original review used the Medcyber database as one of the sources for Chinese language literature. This portal has since become commercial and is used to promote products and to provide information to the general public. This database was therefore ignored and another database, the Chinese Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, was used instead. The outcome measures to be assessed in the original protocol and review included cost, sensitivity and specificity of alpha-foetoprotein and ultrasonography for screening. In this review, we chose to consider all-cause mortality, disease-specific mortality, adverse events, and quality of life indicators as the primary outcomes of interest, in accordance with the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We believe the effectiveness of the screening procedure is best defined by its effect on all-cause mortality, a more patient important outcome. We did not perform cost and economic analyses in this review. Data are too scarce and such analyses would require too many theoretical assumptions rendering such analysis useless for its readers.</P>
<P>We believe that these changes were within acceptable limits and helped us produce a better review.</P>
