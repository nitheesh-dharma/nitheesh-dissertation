<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The liver is an important organ of the body and has various functions including generation of energy from food; production of material necessary for congealing, processing, and excretion of drugs and waste products in blood; and filtering out the harmful bacteria that enter the body through the gut. Alcohol abuse and viral infections can cause damage to the liver usually in an insidious manner. Sometimes, the liver damage can be so severe that the liver is unable to carry out the normal functions, which results in liver failure. Liver transplantation is effective in treating liver failure. However, liver transplantation is major surgical procedure and a significant proportion of people develop infective and wound complications because of the medications given to suppress the recipient body mounting a foreign body response to the liver graft (immunosuppressive regimens). Various interventions have been attempted to prevent the bacterial infective complications and wound complications; however, the effectiveness is unknown. We performed a detailed review of the medical literature (to February 2013) to determine the benefits and harms of different interventions to prevent bacterial infective complications and wound complications in liver transplantation. We sought evidence from randomised clinical trials only. When conducted properly, such trials provide the best evidence. Two review authors independently identified the trials and obtained the information from the trials to minimise error.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified seven trials for inclusion including 614 people. Four trials compared selective bowel decontamination (prolonged use of antibiotics to clear bacteria in the gut) versus placebo (inactive intervention) or no treatment. In one trial, people were randomised to selective bowel decontamination, active lactobacillus with fibres (probiotic with prebiotic), or to inactivated lactobacillus with fibres (prebiotic). In one trial, probiotic with prebiotic was compared with prebiotic. In another trial, different doses of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF; substance that stimulates the immune response) and placebo were compared. Most trials included adults undergoing elective liver transplantation. There were five comparisons: selective bowel decontamination versus inactive control; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics with probiotics; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics; prebiotics with probiotics versus prebiotics; and G-CSF versus control. There was no trial comparing different antibiotics to prevent bacterial infective complications and wound complications in people undergoing liver transplantation.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in proportion of people who died or required retransplantation between the intervention and control groups in any of the five comparisons. There was no significant difference in the graft rejections, intensive therapy unit stay, or hospital stay between the intervention and control groups in any of the comparisons. Overall, 193/611 (31.6%) participants developed infective complications. The proportion of people who developed infective complications and the number of infective complication episodes were significantly higher in the selective bowel decontamination group than prebiotics with probiotics group. There was no significant difference between the proportion of people who developed infection and the number of infective complication episodes between groups in any of the other comparisons. Quality of life and serious adverse events in the groups were not reported in any of the trials. There is no clear evidence that any of the interventions may be of benefit. Selective bowel decontamination may even increase the risk of infection compared to prebiotics with probiotics.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Most of the trials were at high risk of systematic errors (there was a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trial was conducted) and random errors (there was a potential to arrive at the wrong conclusions because of the play of chance). The overall quality of evidence is very low.</P>
<P>
<B>Future research</B>
</P>
<P>Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary in people undergoing liver transplantation. Such trials should include patient-oriented outcomes such as mortality, graft failure, quality of life, length of hospital stay, and serious adverse events related to the treatment.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:21:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>We identified only seven trials for inclusion, including 614 participants. Only one trial was of low risk of bias risk. Overall, the quality of evidence was very low. There were five comparisons in the seven trials: selective bowel decontamination versus inactive control; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics with probiotics; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics; prebiotics with probiotics versus prebiotics; and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) versus control. Four trials compared selective bowel decontamination versus placebo or no treatment. In one trial, participants were randomised to selective bowel decontamination, active lactobacillus with fibres (probiotic with prebiotic), or to inactivated lactobacillus with fibres (prebiotic). In one trial, active lactobacillus with fibres (probiotic with prebiotic) was compared with inactive lactobacillus with fibres (prebiotic). In the remaining trial, different doses of G-CSF and placebo were compared. There was no trial comparing different antibiotic prophylactic regimens in people undergoing liver transplantation. Most trials included adults undergoing elective liver transplantation. There was no significant difference in proportion of people who died or required retransplantation between the intervention and control groups in any of the five comparison groups.</P>
<P>
<B>Mortality</B>
</P>
<P>There were no differences between 190 participants (three trials); 5/87 (adjusted proportion: 6.2%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 7/103 (6.8%) in inactive control group; RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.31 to 2.72); 63 participants (one trial); 0/32 (0%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 0/31 (0%) in prebiotics with probiotics group; RR - not estimable; 64 participants (one trial); 0/32 (0%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 0/32 (0%) in prebiotics group; RR - not estimable; 129 participants (two trials); 0/64 (0%) in prebiotics with probiotics group versus 0/65 (0%) in prebiotics group; RR - not estimable; and 194 participants (one trial); 22/124 (17.7%) in G-CSF group versus 10/70 (14.3%) in placebo group; RR 1.24 (95% 0.62 to 2.47).</P>
<P>
<B>Retransplantation</B>
</P>
<P>There were no differences between 132 participants (two trials); 4/58 (adjusted proportion: 6.9%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 6/74 (8.1%) in inactive control group; RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.85); 63 participants (one trial); 1/32 (3.1%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 0/31 (0%) in prebiotics with probiotics group; RR 2.91 (0.12 to 68.81); 64 participants (one trial); 1/32 (3.1%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 0/32 (0%) in prebiotics group; RR 3.00 (95% CI 0.13 to 71.00); 129 participants (two trials); 0/64 (0%) in prebiotics with probiotics group versus 1/65 (1.5%) in prebiotics group; RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.01 to 7.9); and 194 participants (one trial); 10/124 (7.1%) in G-CSF group versus 5/70 (7.1%) in placebo group; RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.4 to 3.17).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the graft rejections, intensive therapy unit stay, or hospital stay between the intervention and control groups in any of the comparisons. Overall, 193/611 participants (31.6%) developed infective complications. The proportion of people who developed infective complications and the number of infective complication episodes were significantly higher in the selective bowel decontamination group than in the prebiotics with probiotics group (1 study; 63 participants; 15/32 (46.9%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 4/31 (12.9%) in prebiotics with probiotics group; RR 3.63; 95% CI 1.36 to 9.74 and 23/32 participants (0.72 infective complications per participant) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 4/31 participants (0.13 infective complications per participant) in prebiotics with probiotics group; rate ratio 5.58; 95% CI 1.94 to 16.09). There was no significant difference between the proportion of participants who developed infection and the number of infection episodes between the intervention group and control group in any of the other comparisons.</P>
<P>No trials reported quality of life and overall serious adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:21:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Currently, there is no clear evidence for any intervention offering significant benefits in the reduction of bacterial infections and wound complications in liver transplantation. Selective bowel decontamination may even increase the rate of infections compared with prebiotics with probiotics. The confidence intervals were wide and further randomised clinical trials of low risk of bias are necessary.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:24:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:24:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Around 700 liver transplantations are performed annually in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-UK-transplant" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS UK transplant</LINK>). In the USA, the annual incidence of liver transplantation is 21 per one million population (<LINK REF="REF-OPTN_x002f_SRTR-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">OPTN/SRTR 2009</LINK>). Liver transplant is performed mainly for end-stage liver failure arising acutely (e.g., virus, drug overdose) or as a result of chronic liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis due to alcohol consumption, virus), or for tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (based on bilirubin, creatinine, and international normalised ratio (INR)) has been suggested as one of the methods of determining the severity of end-stage liver failure (<LINK REF="REF-Kamath-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamath 2001</LINK>), and is being used as a tool for allocation of donor livers to individual recipients in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-Shiffman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shiffman 2006</LINK>). A liver graft can be harvested from living donors (<LINK REF="REF-Bombuy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bombuy 2004</LINK>), or from deceased donors (<LINK REF="REF-Koneru-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koneru 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cescon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cescon 2006</LINK>). Worldwide, there is a demand for liver transplants in surplus of organ supply. Split liver transplantation (using one deceased donor liver for two recipients, i.e., an adult and a paediatric recipient) has been suggested as a way to decrease the organ shortage for liver transplant (<LINK REF="REF-Corno-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corno 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Between 33% and 68% of liver transplant recipients develop bacterial infections (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 1997</LINK>). Immune dysfunction in people with cirrhosis may contribute to the increased infections after liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Bonnel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonnel 2011</LINK>). Bacterial sepsis and wound complications may result in mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Garbino-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garbino 2005</LINK>), and are common causes of significant morbidity, prolonged hospitalisation or hospital readmission, reoperation, and are likely to increase overall transplant costs (<LINK REF="REF-Mehrabi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehrabi 2006</LINK>). Gastrointestinal infections affect postoperative mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Blair-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:24:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Various methods have been attempted to decrease bacterial sepsis and wound complications. These include selective bowel decontamination, which involves reducing the aerobic gram-negative bacterial and yeast populations of the gastrointestinal tract, without elimination of the anaerobic microbial flora (<LINK REF="STD-Hellinger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hellinger 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Safdar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safdar 2004</LINK>); prebiotics (fibres) (<LINK REF="STD-Rayes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rayes 2005</LINK>); probiotics (living lactobacillus) to restore the physiological gastrointestinal flora (<LINK REF="STD-Rayes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rayes 2005</LINK>); and different methods of wound closure (<LINK REF="REF-Diener-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diener 2010</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:24:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Selective bowel decontamination, prebiotics, and probiotics are aimed at decreasing the harmful bacteria thereby decreasing bacterial translocation (<LINK REF="STD-Rayes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rayes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rayes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rayes 2005</LINK>). Different methods of wound closure are aimed at decreasing wound complications thereby improving the outcomes of liver transplantation.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:24:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>This is an update of a previous Cochrane systematic review assessing the role of the different interventions in preventing bacterial sepsis and wound complications in liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2008</LINK>). Since the role of antiviral and antifungal agents in liver transplantations are considered in different Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Playford-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Playford 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2006</LINK>), we have excluded these interventions from this review. While sepsis and wound complications are some of the issues in the choice of the immunosuppressive agents after liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Kato-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kato 2005</LINK>), the main outcomes that affect the choice of the immunosuppressive agents are different (<LINK REF="REF-Haddad-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddad 2006</LINK>), and hence we have excluded the comparisons of immunosuppressive agents with regards to the reduction in sepsis or wound complications from this review. We have also excluded the trials assessing the role of enteral nutrition and surgical interventions (such as method of suturing) in decreasing infections and incisional hernias as these interventions should be considered in separate reviews. By including all the other interventions aimed at preventing bacterial sepsis and wound complications in this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the different methods aimed at preventing these complications in liver transplantation. Since immunosuppression and the transient anhepatic phase during liver transplantation may have a role in the incidence of sepsis and wound complications, we have considered only publications related to liver transplantation.</P>

For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous variables, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. For count data outcomes such as infection episodes, we calculated the rate ratio (RaR) with 95% CI using the methods shown in Section 9.4.8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Such a calculation needs the time that the participants were exposed to the risk of infection in each of the groups. We considered that both groups were exposed to the risk of infection for the same time period, which is a reasonable assumption considering that the participants were followed up for the same time in both groups. For time-to-event outcomes, we planned to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI.</P>

If it was not possible to calculate the standard deviation from the P value or the CIs, we imputed the standard deviation as the highest standard deviation in the other trials included under that outcome, fully recognising that this form of imputation would decrease the weight of the study for calculation of MDs and bias the effect estimate to no effect in case of standardised mean difference (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:34:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>This systematic review revealed that there is no clear evidence supporting any of the evaluated interventions and that selective bowel decontamination may increase infections compared with a combination of prebiotics with probiotics.</P>
<P>Previous systematic reviews assessing the role of selective bowel decontamination in critical care found a benefit of selective bowel decontamination in decreasing chest infection and hospital mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Selective bowel decontamination appears to be of no significant benefit in people undergoing liver transplantation. In addition, people need very high motivation if they have to take the antibiotics continuously for many months or even years, while they are waiting for the availability of donor. Even in the trial that started the selective bowel decontamination just at the time of organ donor availability, the medicines frequently reached expiry date and had to be continually replaced (<LINK REF="STD-Bion-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bion 1994</LINK>). Thus, selective bowel decontamination requires highly motivated healthcare providers and participants. Poor patient compliance could be one reason for the lack of beneficial effect from selective bowel decontamination. Patient compliance was not reported in any of the trials. Other possible reasons for the lack of beneficial effect of selective bowel decontamination include development of microbial tolerance to these antibiotics due to prolonged use (assuming good patient compliance) and lack of efficacy of antibiotics. The only quasi-randomised trial identified reported six participants with diarrhoea out of the 18 participants who received selective bowel decontamination (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1993</LINK>). None of these people had pseudomembranous colitis. The prevalence of diarrhoea in the control group was not stated and so the outcome could not be included in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The use of prebiotics with probiotics appears to decrease the number of people with any bacterial infection compared with selective bowel decontamination. However, only one trial assessed this comparison. Using lactobacillus in addition to fibres (prebiotics with probiotics) did not increase the abdominal cramps or diarrhoea (adverse effects due to the use of fibres) when compared with fibres alone. However, there was no comparison of these adverse effects with placebo. Therefore, it is unclear whether the use of prebiotics with probiotics causes discomfort to the patients. There are no direct comparisons of prebiotics either alone or in combination with probiotics versus placebo. Because of the heterogeneity in the treatments used to achieve selective bowel decontamination, it is not possible to use indirect comparisons to provide an estimate of the beneficial effect due to prebiotics alone or in combination with probiotics over no intervention. It should also be pointed out that there have been reports about infective complications such as abscesses due to Lactobacillus as a result of the use of probiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Rautio-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rautio 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Groote-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groote 2005</LINK>). Therefore, the use of probiotics in people undergoing liver transplantation who receive immunosuppression should be further evaluated before such routine recommendations are given.</P>
<P>There was no beneficial effect of G-CSF in reducing infections. Rejection and retransplantation are relevant in this comparison, as G-CSF modulates the immune system. Although there was no significant difference in rejection after G-CSF versus placebo, the CIs were wide and it was impossible to determine whether this lack of significant observed difference was because of lack of effect or lack of evidence of effect. G-CSF does not appear to be safe and in the absence of any evidence of decreased complications, there appears to be no reason in using G-CSF.</P>
<P>None of the trials investigated the relationship between the incidence of the infective complications and patient variables (such as pre-operative MELD score, reason for liver transplantation, duration of pre-operative hospital stay) or donor variables (such as donor instability at retrieval, donor infections at retrieval) that could potentially influence the results. It is possible that some interventions work in some groups of people and not in others.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:34:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Most of the trials included adults undergoing elective liver transplantation. Therefore, this evidence is applicable only in adults undergoing elective liver transplantation. It should be noted that the selection of participants undergoing liver transplantation was based on the pre-MELD era, and it is not clear whether the evidence is applicable for people in the MELD era. However, it must be pointed out that some studies state that there is no significant difference in the prediction of prognosis between MELD and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores (<LINK REF="REF-Cholongitas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cholongitas 2006</LINK>), while other studies showed that the results were better in the post-MELD era (<LINK REF="REF-Agopian-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agopian 2013</LINK>). Most of the trials included in this review are more than 10 years old and the survival has improved significantly since the mid-2000s despite riskier patients receiving transplants (<LINK REF="REF-Agopian-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agopian 2013</LINK>). Therefore, it is unclear whether the results of this review are applicable in the current era of liver transplantation. It should also be noted that all the participants in the trials included in this review received antibiotics, and so the findings of this review are applicable only to people who receive antibiotic prophylaxis when they undergo liver transplantation. In addition, none of the trials compared different antibiotic regimens or compared antibiotic prophylaxis versus no antibiotic prophylaxis. While trials comparing different antibiotic regimens can be conducted, the ethical nature of antibiotic prophylaxis versus no antibiotic prophylaxis in people undergoing liver transplantation is debatable since people undergoing liver transplantation routinely receive immunosuppression and the intact digestive tract is breached (the donor bile duct is anastomosed to the recipient bile duct) and antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in both these situations (<LINK REF="REF-Bratzler-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bratzler 2013</LINK>). Even with antibiotic prophylaxis, about one-third of people develop infective complications.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:34:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Most of the trials were of high risk of bias. Many of the trials had significant withdrawals or drop-outs. For some interventions that require prolonged period of the intervention (such as prolonged period of antibiotics for selective bowel decontamination) and a long wait for liver transplantation, there will be withdrawals or drop-outs. It is debatable whether to use intention-to-treat analysis or available-case analysis for deaths during the waiting period or during the operation (with both methods of analysis having advantages and disadvantages), particularly if the deaths (unrelated to intervention) were more in one group. However, intention-to-treat analysis should be used if the withdrawal is due to intolerance to the intervention. Most of the trials in this review excluded these participants from the analysis. Future trials should perform intention-to-treat analyses.</P>
<P>In many of the trials, it is possible to blind the participants, healthcare providers, and outcome assessors to the intervention being administered. However, only four of the seven trials performed this (<LINK REF="STD-Winston-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellinger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hellinger 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zwaveling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zwaveling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rayes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rayes 2005</LINK>). Blinding should be performed to obtain a better estimate of the true effect of the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovi_x0107_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovi&#263; 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovi_x0107_-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovi&#263; 2012a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, the quality of evidence was very low as indicated in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. However, it must be pointed out that this is the best evidence available on this topic currently.</P>

<P>This review broadly agrees with the previous version of our review (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2008</LINK>). We do not agree with another systematic review, which suggested that selective bowel decontamination is beneficial in decreasing gram-negative infections (<LINK REF="REF-Safdar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safdar 2004</LINK>). However, the review also mentioned that selective bowel decontamination can increase gram-positive cocci and suggested a cautious approach (<LINK REF="REF-Safdar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safdar 2004</LINK>). In our review, we gave more importance to the clinical implications of infections rather than the presence or absence of an infective microorganism in order to arrive at our conclusion.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:34:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Currently, there is no evidence for any intervention offering significant benefits in the reduction of bacterial infections and wound complications in liver transplantation. All trials used antibiotic prophylaxis. In spite of this, infective complications were still prevalent.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-03-05 11:34:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Further randomised clinical trials are necessary to assess interventions to prevent bacterial sepsis and wound complications for liver transplantation. Such trials should include patient-oriented outcomes such as mortality, graft failure, quality of life, length of hospital stay, and serious adverse events related to the treatment. Trials need to be designed according to the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-SPIRIT-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPIRIT 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SPIRIT-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPIRIT 2013a</LINK>), and conducted and reported according to the CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>).</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality (selective bowel decontamination versus inactive control)</B>
<BR/>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 9753 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 6.8%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing 190 participants in three trials, only 1.95% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality (prebiotics with probiotics versus prebiotics)</B>
<BR/>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 9753 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 6.8%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing 129 participants in two trials, only 1.32% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of retransplantation (selective bowel decontamination versus inactive control)</B>
<BR/>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 8086 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 8.1%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing 132 participants in two trials, only 1.63% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality (prebiotics with probiotics versus prebiotics)</B>
<BR/>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 46,458 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 1.5%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing 129 participants in two trials, only 0.28% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of infection (selective bowel decontamination versus inactive control)</B>
<BR/>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 2639 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 44.9%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accruing 256 participants in four trials, only 9.7% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the futility area. The cumulative Z-curve (blue line) does not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundaries (continuous red line) or the conventional boundaries (dotted red line).</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of infection (prebiotics with probiotics versus prebiotics)</B>
<BR/>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 3745 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 41.5%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 71.51%. After accruing 129 participants in two trials, only 3.44% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve (blue line) after two trials although the conventional boundary was crossed favouring probiotics with prebiotics after the first trial.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of intensive therapy unit stay (prebiotics with probiotics versus prebiotics)</B>
<BR/>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 8005 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 1 day, a variance (VAR) of 254.96, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 0%. After accruing 129 participants in two trials, only 1.61% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve (blue line).</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of hospital stay (prebiotics with probiotics versus prebiotics)</B>
<BR/>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 11,621 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 1 day, a variance (VAR) of 370.14, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 0%. After accruing 129 participants in two trials, only 1.11% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve (blue line).</P>
