It would be very useful if the 3 new studies could be named and a brief overview be given of which outcomes incorporate new data and whether the results or conclusions have changed.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References ; Larraine needs year and journal sorting out please. Laursen reference is missing (excluded)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Great&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: The labels for Outcome 5 and 7 suggest these are bad outcomes but the graphs are labelled as treatment preference so please could the title or label be corrected. (?Is it the proportion who are less happy with the intervention that have been entered?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: See comment on Abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: What is the evidence that sub-groups may benefit? (I see this comes from some trials showing significant benefit in some patients????)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Comment is needed on the fact that RevMan cannot properly handle cross-overs. At the least if there are paired t-tests reported in the original studies these should be compared with the RevMan CI for individual trials as a safety check. I note that you mention in the results that unpaired analysis has been carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Jadad maximum score is 5 so I do not understand how you have results higher than this! Have you modified his method? No reference for Jadad method given?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion:  &amp;quot;A further problem is insufficient sample size in the pooled studies to detect a clinically significant treatment effect. It is therefore possible that current studies are negative because of a type 2 error. Using the estimates of sample variance from the meta-analysis of PEF data, a sample size of 506 subjects would be required to detect a difference in PEF of 20 litre/min with alpha at 0.05 and power of 80%.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is helpful but would apply to parallel studies so I would add a note of caution in relation to cross-overs here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next action : 29/11 return to Toby to send back to authors for consideration of the above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESPONSE TO EDITOR  9/1/02&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankyou for your comments and suggestions. The following changes have been made:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT'S NEW:  This has been expanded to give an overview of the 3 new studies. Dates for the least search have been addded but there is no record of the date of the original review and protocol&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Thankyou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REFERENCES: Laursen reference added and year and journal for Larraine&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;METAVIEWS: Outcomes 5 and 7 were originally entered as those less happy with the intervention to conform with revman having a good outcome to the left of the axis. These data have been reentered with the good outcome to the right of the axis.  For outcome 5 the Gustaffson trial had a third option for treatment preference of neither treatment or placebo. The Ford trial stated that 7 subjects prefered treatment and no subject preferred placebo -it was not stated if the remaining four subjects preferred neither.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Labels are now fine. I have switched off the totals as it is not valid to pool this data in view of the fact that the outcomes are not truly dichotomous and come from cross-over studies (confidence intervals may not be reliable). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;The sentence in the discussion section referring to this has been modified to &amp;quot;Treatment preference was significantly in favour of active treatment in two studies, but there is a major limitation with this outcome factor in that it is likely that the patient preference reflected an improvement in the reflux rather than an improvement in asthma.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;METHODS:Comment has been made in the analysis methods that  CI's would be compared for the crossover studies where reported. However we were unable to do this with the data available in the studies&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS:  Our reference for the Jadad score has been added. This is the same scoring system as the 5 point score but instead of taking off points, extra points are added when there is a full description of randomisation and double blinding. We can fax you a copy of this scale if you would like.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This creates confusion as most of the Airways reviews use normal Jadad scores. Is the modified scale validated? How do we know what is an acceptable score. Could you fax me the scale on +44 1923 213270 please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;DISCUSSION: We have added the that the sample size calculated would be needed for a parallel study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heather Powell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;21_1_03 Final look by CJC.&lt;br&gt;Heather,&lt;br&gt;Please see my comments above with &amp;gt;&amp;gt; before them.  I will chat to Paul about the modified scale.  If you are happy with my changes to the preference graphs, I will send this on for the final sign off with Paul.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;28_1_03&lt;br&gt;Heather,&lt;br&gt;I have talked to Paul and he suggests just saying what the overall lumped percentages are for the preference results as they are not dichotomous and should not really go into revman. They should come out of Metaview. I will send you this version to do this. Thanks for the fax about the modified Jadad. Perhaps this could be discussed in Edmonton.  Can you send back the review to Toby for Paul (with a copy to me) when you have adjusted the preferences.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11/2/03 &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;TREATMENT PREFERENCE:&lt;br&gt;A significant preference for treatment was found in two studies  (Goodall 1981; Ford 1994). In the first of these (Goodall 1981) 14/17 preferred active  treatment compared to 3/17 preferring placebo , whilst in the second (Ford 1994) 7/11 preferred active treatment and none preferred placebo.  A third study (Gustafsson 1992) which reported this outcome did not show a sigificant difference, with 5/18 preferring active treatment and 4/18 placebo.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have reworded this to show the actual data (as it has gone from Metaview) and renumbered the outcomes in Metaview.&lt;br&gt;This is ready for Paul.  Given to Toby today.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-09-30 10:55:57 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="GAS-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.16" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="4.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>People with asthma also often have gastro-oesophageal reflux (where acid from the stomach comes back up the gullet (esophagus)). Reflux is very common in people with asthma. It may be a trigger for asthma, or alternatively, asthma may trigger reflux. Treatments that can help reflux include antacids and drugs to suppress stomach acids or empty the stomach. This review of trials found that using reflux treatments does not generally help ease asthma symptoms. While asthma may be improved in some people, it was not possible to predict who might benefit.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma and gastro-oesophageal reflux are both common medical conditions and often co-exist. Studies have shown conflicting results concerning the effects of lower oesophageal acidification as a trigger of asthma. Furthermore, asthma might precipitate gastro-oesophageal reflux. Thus a temporal association between the two does not establish that gastro-oesophageal reflux triggers asthma. Randomised trials of a number of treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in asthma have been conducted to determine whether treatment of reflux improves asthma. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in terms of their benefit on asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Airways Group trials register, review articles and reference lists of articles were searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of treatment for oesophageal reflux in adults and children with a diagnosis of both asthma and gastro-oesophageal reflux.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trial quality and data extraction were carried out by two independent reviewers. Authors were contacted for confirmation or more data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twelve trials met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included proton pump inhibitors (n=6), histamine antagonists (n=5), surgery (n=1) and conservative management (n=1). Treatment duration ranged from 1 week to 6 months. A temporal association between asthma and gastro-oesophageal reflux was investigated in 4 trials and found to be present in a proportion of participants in these trials. Anti-reflux treatment did not consistently improve lung function, asthma symptoms, nocturnal asthma or the use of asthma medications.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In asthmatic subjects with gastro-oesophageal reflux, (but who were not recruited specifically on the basis of reflux-associated respiratory symptoms), there was no overall improvement in asthma following treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux. Subgroups of patients may gain benefit, but it appears difficult to predict responders.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-30 10:54:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is the passage of gastric contents through the gastric cardia into the oesophagus. This can be a normal physiological event that occurs mainly after meals during the day in healthy people. Abnormal reflux occurs when there is significant acid exposure (pH&lt; 4.0) to the distal oesophagus for more than 1.2 hours (cumulative time &gt; 5%) over a twenty-four hour period as established by intra-oesophageal pH monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnsson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnsson 1987</LINK>). Abnormal reflux is associated with upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. It is also reported to be associated with non-gastro-intestinal symptoms including chest pain, cough, wheezing and with worsening asthma. </P>
<P>Asthma and GOR are both common medical conditions and recent studies show that they often co-exist. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Sontag-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sontag 1990</LINK> studied 104 adult asthmatics and found that more than 80% had abnormal gastro-oesophageal reflux on 24 hour pH monitoring. Compared with control subjects, asthmatic individuals with reflux had significantly decreased lower oesophageal sphincter pressures, greater oesophageal acid exposure times, more frequent reflux episodes, and longer acid clearance irrespective of body position and bronchodilator therapy. They also found oesophagitis or Barrett's oesophagus on endoscopy in 73 out of 186 consecutive and unselected asthmatics who consented to the procedure. Paediatric studies similarly show a high prevalence of significant gastro-oesophageal reflux in children with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Andze-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andze 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tucci-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tucci 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>The role of GOR as a trigger factor in asthma is an important issue. Several mechanisms by which oesophageal reflux may trigger asthma have been proposed. These include: acid aspiration (<LINK REF="REF-Klotz-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klotz 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mays-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mays 1976</LINK>), direct acid stimulation of the oesophagus or stimulation of vagal nerves which heightens bronchial responsiveness to extrinsic allergens (<LINK REF="REF-Mansfield-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansfield 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tuchman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuchman 1984</LINK>). However, studies in humans with asthma have shown conflicting results concerning the effects of lower oesophageal acidification as a trigger of asthma. Furthermore the possibility also exists that asthma might precipitate GOR (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1983</LINK>). Thus a temporal association between the two does not conclusively establish that GOR triggers asthma.</P>
<P>Therapy of gastro-oesophageal reflux can involve a number of measures. These include anti-reflux measures, histamine (receptor type 2) antagonists either in standard dose or high dose, proton pump inhibitors, cisapride, and surgical therapy including Nissen fundoplication and partial posterior hemi-fundoplication (Toupet and Lind techniques). Narrative reviews have identified the high frequency of gastro-oesophageal reflux in people with asthma, the clinical features and diagnosis and the spectrum of therapy available. They have also identified that randomised trials have been conducted on each form of therapy with conflicting results (<LINK REF="REF-Winter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Choy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choy 1997</LINK> ; <LINK REF="REF-Kahrilas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahrilas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Field-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1998</LINK>). A systematic review of antireflux surgery on asthmatics found that surgery may improve asthma symptoms but not pulmonary function (<LINK REF="REF-Field-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the literature concerning treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux in asthma, and its effect on asthma.</P>

<P>IDENTIFICATION OF RELEVANT STUDIES:<BR/>All identified abstracts were assessed independently by two reviewers. The full text version of each potential article was obtained for assessment by two independent reviewers to establish whether it met the inclusion criteria. The percentage agreement for inclusion/exclusion of studies was 100%.</P>
<P>QUALITY: Study quality was assessed independently and scored by two reviewers using two instruments. The first, the Jadad system, allows for a score between 0 and 8 with higher scores indicating a better description of the study (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1995</LINK>). The Jadad system measures the clarity of the description of: inclusion criteria, randomisation, adverse effects, blinding, treatment of withdrawals and dropouts and statistical analysis. Studies were further assessed as "Adequate", "Inadequate" or "Unclear" according to the actual methods used for randomisation and concealment of allocation. In this assessment, if studies are either not truly randomised (e.g. alternated) or if allocation to treatment or control groups is not truly blinded, studies are considered "inadequate". If the author does not fully state these methods, the study is characterised as "unclear" until the author is contacted and clarification can be made.</P>

<P>STUDY DESIGN:<BR/>Nine of the twelve studies were randomised controlled cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodall-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goodall 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meier-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nagel 1988</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Teichtahl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Teichtahl 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 1999</LINK>) with the other three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Larrain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Larrain 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kjellen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kjellen 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boeree-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boeree 1998</LINK>) conducted as parallel randomised controlled trials without crossover.</P>
<P>PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS:<BR/>Number of participants:<BR/>The number of participants randomised ranged from 11 (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1994</LINK>) to 90 (<LINK REF="STD-Larrain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Larrain 1991</LINK>). The mean completion rate was 90% for the eleven studies reporting this statistic.<BR/>
<BR/>Age:<BR/>With the exception of Gustafsson who studied children and adolescents aged between 10 and 20 years, all trials investigated adults. In the adult studies, mean ages ranged from 42 years (<LINK REF="STD-Nagel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nagel 1988</LINK>) to 63 years (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1994</LINK>). Overall the mean age was 48 years and ranged between 22 to 80 years.</P>
<P>Recruitment:<BR/>Subjects were primarily outpatients recruited from respiratory or asthma/allergy clinics. <LINK REF="STD-Teichtahl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Teichtahl 1996</LINK> was the only study to recruit from both respiratory and gastroenterology outpatient clinics.</P>
<P>Diagnostic criteria for asthma:<BR/>The following methods were reported as the methods used to diagnose asthma for inclusion of subjects into the respective studies:<BR/>American Thoracic Society criteria:- <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meier-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kjellen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kjellen 1981</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 1999</LINK>

</P>
<P>Baseline severity of asthma:<BR/>The severity of asthma was documented in different ways. Where baseline data were not reported, the inclusion criteria for the study have been substituted as an indicator of asthma severity. Two studies did not specify the severity of asthma nor report specific criteria of asthma severity for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1992</LINK>). However, the asthma medications used by subjects in the Gustafsson trial indicate the inclusion of subjects with moderate to severe asthma. The severity of asthma in the other studies was reported in the following manner:<BR/>Boeree:- &gt;=20% fall post methacholine challenge, ICS &gt;= 0.4mg/day, mean baseline PEF 329/321 l/min,<BR/>Ford:- mean baseline PEF 253-300 l/min,<BR/>Goodall: nocturnal wheezing present in all subjects,<BR/>Kiljander:- &gt;15% reversibility post bronchodilator or &gt;=20% PEF diurnal variation or PD20 methacholine,<BR/>Kjellen: stated that their subjects suffered 'more severe' asthma,<BR/>Larrain: 56/81 had reactive airways and 35/81 used corticosteroids,<BR/>Levin:- &gt;=15% reversibility post bronchodilator, mean baseline FEV1 1.9 L<BR/>Meier: &gt; 15% reversibility after bronchodilator (FEV1 &amp; PEF),<BR/>Nagel: &gt; 25% reversibility after bronchodilator (FEV1 &amp; PEF),<BR/>Teichtahl: &gt;15% reversibility after bronchodilator (FEV1) and diurnal variation of PEF of &gt; or = 20% in PEF documented in past 6 months.</P>
<P>Diagnostic criteria of GOR:<BR/>The methods used to diagnose GOR included:<BR/>history of symptoms<BR/>endoscopy<BR/>manometry<BR/>acid perfusion test<BR/>24 hour pH monitoring<BR/>oesophageal motility<BR/>All studies employed more than one of the above methods to confirm GOR.</P>
<P>Baseline severity of GOR:<BR/>Baseline severity of GOR was described in the following ways:</P>

<P>INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS:<BR/>Interventions were characterised according to the type of intervention (Medical or Surgical). For medical interventions, we further noted the type of pharmacological agent (and dose) or type of conservative therapy. We also documented the length of time of exposure to the treatment.</P>
<P>A Medical Interventions:<BR/>i) Histamine antagonist studies<BR/>Trial Agent Dose/day Treatment Duration<BR/>Ekstrom ranitidine 300 mg 4 weeks<BR/>Goodall cimetidine 1000 mg 6 weeks<BR/>Gustafsson ranitidine 150 or 300 mg 4 weeks<BR/>Larrain cimetidine 1200 mg 26 weeks<BR/>Nagel ranitidine 450 mg 1 week</P>
<P>ii) Proton Pump Inhibitor studies:<BR/>Trial Agent Dose/day Treatment Duration<BR/>Boeree omeprazole 80mg 12 weeks<BR/>Ford omeprazole 20 mg 4 weeks<BR/>Kiljander omeprazole 160mg 8 weeks<BR/>Levin omeprazole 20mg 8 weeks<BR/>Meier omeprazole 40 mg 6 weeks<BR/>Teichtahl omeprazole 40 mg 4 weeks</P>
<P>iii) Conservative anti-reflux therapy study:<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Kjellen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kjellen 1981</LINK> was the only study to investigate non-pharmacological conservative reflux therapy. The intervention included raising the head of the bed, drinking warm water after meals, not eating for 3 hours prior to bed time, anti-reflux medication as required, refraining from aspirin and anticholinergic preparations and avoidance of procedures which increase intra-abdominal pressure. This was a parallel study where outcome measures were taken over six weeks.</P>
<P>B. Surgical Interventions:<BR/>There was only one surgical intervention study (<LINK REF="STD-Larrain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Larrain 1991</LINK>) which randomised subjects to either a medical therapy (cimetidine above) or an identical placebo or surgery. The surgical approach used was a posterior gastropexy. Outcomes were measured after 26 weeks in a parallel study design.</P>
<P>OUTCOMES:<BR/>No studies measured or reported hospitalisations or emergency room visits. Only one author provided data for unscheduled visits to the doctor for asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Teichtahl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Teichtahl 1996</LINK>). Lung function, symptoms and use of asthma medications were the most popular outcomes investigated. However, these outcomes were reported in several different ways which has limited our capacity to combine the data in a meta-analysis. The data have been requested from the authors, in a form that will enable combination.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Each study was scored according to the 0-8 point scale of Jadad accompanied by a separate rating of the allocation procedure where A indicates appropriate blinding, B unclear and C, an inadequate allocation procedure.</P>
<P>All studies were appropriately randomised except for <LINK REF="STD-Kjellen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kjellen 1981</LINK> which used alternation to allocate subjects into treatment or control groups.</P>
<P>Nine of the twelve studies used blinded allocation procedures. The range of Jadad ratings was (4-7), the mode 7 and the mean 6.4 indicating only minimal opportunity for bias among these studies.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-09-30 10:54:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The twelve RCTs investigated the treatment of GOR on asthma in 432 patients of whom 396 completed. The studies were inconsistent in reporting outcomes, and this has prevented quantitative data synthesis (meta-analysis) for many outcomes. No studies reported hospitalisations or emergency room visits resulting from asthma. Lung function was reported in several different ways (see Table). Overall, there was no consistent benefit of anti-reflux treatment on lung function in asthmatics with GOR.</P>

<P>FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (FEV1): </P>
<P>Ten trials of eleven interventions (five proton pump inhibitor, four H2 antagonist, one conservative therapy and one surgical intervention) reported FEV1. One study reported a 20% improvement in FEV1 favouring omeprazole in four of 14 subjects (<LINK REF="STD-Meier-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 1994</LINK>). The mean percentage change in FEV1 was 10% (p&lt;0.05). No other studies reported a significant improvement in FEV1 in either the proton pump inhibitor (<LINK REF="STD-Boeree-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boeree 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Levin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Teichtahl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Teichtahl 1996</LINK>), histamine antagonist (<LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodall-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goodall 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larrain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Larrain 1991</LINK>), conservative therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Kjellen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kjellen 1981</LINK>) or surgical (<LINK REF="STD-Larrain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Larrain 1991</LINK>) groups.</P>
<P>PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW (PEF):</P>
<P>An improvement in morning PEF was reported in only one of the eight studies that reported this variable (<LINK REF="STD-Levin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1998</LINK>). Treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux with either omeprazole (<LINK REF="STD-Boeree-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boeree 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Teichtahl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Teichtahl 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1994</LINK>) or histamine antagonists (<LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodall-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goodall 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nagel 1988</LINK>) had no significant effect on morning PEF in the seven remaining studies. A significant improvement in evening PEF, measured as percentage of predicted, was reported after treatment with omeprazole 40 mg/day for four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Teichtahl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Teichtahl 1996</LINK>) and after treatment with cimetidine 1000 mg/d for six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Goodall-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goodall 1981</LINK>). However, no effect of treatment on evening PEF was seen in five other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boeree-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boeree 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nagel 1988</LINK>).

<P>Asthma symptoms were measured and reported in all of the included studies. The variety of ways in which symptoms were reported using several different scales, has precluded meta-analysis except for nocturnal symptom scores. Overall, the majority of studies failed to demonstrate an improvement in asthma symptoms.</P>
<P>Asthma Symptoms:<BR/>Three studies of adults reported a significant improvement in asthma symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larrain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Larrain 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kjellen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kjellen 1981</LINK>, reported a significant reduction in the proportion of subjects experiencing respiratory symptoms (dyspnoea, cough, wheeze and expectoration) in a study of conservative therapy for GOR. A subgroup analysis showed that subjects with "endogenous asthma" improved significantly in all symptom outcomes but subjects with "exogenous asthma" did not. <LINK REF="STD-Larrain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Larrain 1991</LINK> found significant improvement in both treatment groups (cimetidine and surgical p&lt;0.001) as well as the placebo group (p&lt;0.02) when comparing the change in asthma symptoms from baseline to follow-up. The cimetidine (p&lt;0.03) and surgical (p&lt;0.01) groups showed significant improvement in asthma symptoms over the placebo group after six months with 13 of the 27 cimetidine-treated patients and nine of the 26 surgically treated patients reporting a total abolition of symptoms compared with only one of the 28 control subjects. <LINK REF="STD-Levin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1998</LINK> reported an improvement in asthma related quality of life for subjects receiving omeprazole. The remaining nine trials did not demonstrate a benefit of GOR treatment on asthma symptoms</P>
<P>Nocturnal Asthma:<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1989</LINK> reported a significant, but clinically modest, improvement in nocturnal asthma symptom scores after treatment with a histamine antagonist (p&lt;0.02). When sub grouped into subjects who had a history of reflux associated respiratory symptoms and those without, the former showed a statistically significant ranitidine related improvement (p&lt;0.001). <LINK REF="STD-Goodall-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goodall 1981</LINK> also demonstrated a positive effect of a histamine antagonist on nocturnal asthma (p&lt;0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 1999</LINK> reported a significant improvement in night-time asthma symptoms for high dose omeprazole (p&lt;0.04). <LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1992</LINK> reported significant positive correlations between the improvement of nocturnal, morning and total asthma symptoms and the degree of pathological GOR at oesophageal pH monitoring in children and adolescents.

<P>TREATMENT PREFERENCE:<BR/>A significant preference for treatment was found in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goodall-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goodall 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1994</LINK>). In the first of these (<LINK REF="STD-Goodall-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goodall 1981</LINK>) 14/17 preferred active treatment compared to 3/17 preferring placebo , whilst in the second (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1994</LINK>) 7/11 preferred active treatment and none preferred placebo. A third study (<LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1992</LINK>) which reported this outcome did not show a significant difference, with 5/18 preferring active treatment and 4/18 placebo.</P>
<P>GASTRO-OESOPHAGEAL REFLUX INDUCED ASTHMA<BR/>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodall-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goodall 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meier-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nagel 1988</LINK>) identified subjects in whom reflux appeared to trigger asthma. In these subjects, although gastro-oesophageal reflux was temporally associated with asthma, no consistent benefit of gastro-oesophageal reflux therapy was demonstrated on asthma outcomes.</P>
<P>EFFECT OF TREATMENT ON GASTRO-OESOPHAGEAL REFLUX<BR/>The effect of study treatment on gastro-oesophageal reflux was reported in 11 of 12 trials. Symptoms were assessed in 10 studies and study treatment improved reflux symptoms in only five of them. The effect of treatment on oesophageal pH was assessed in three studies and was improved by high dose omeprazole (<LINK REF="STD-Boeree-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boeree 1998</LINK>) and surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Larrain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Larrain 1991</LINK>) but not by H2 antagonists <LINK REF="STD-Larrain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Larrain 1991</LINK>) or low dose omeprazole <LINK REF="STD-Teichtahl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Teichtahl 1996</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>In this systematic review of twelve trials, the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux did not reveal a consistent benefit on asthma. There was no clear effect on lung function, airway responsiveness or asthma symptoms. Although nine of the twelve trials reported at least one significant outcome, there was no consistency in these effects. </P>
<P>Most studies assessed the effect of GOR treatment on lung function. Only two studies found improved evening peak expiratory flow (<LINK REF="STD-Goodall-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goodall 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teichtahl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Teichtahl 1996</LINK>). One might anticipate that if treatment of GOR were beneficial in asthma, the morning PEF would be more likely to improve (as a manifestation of managing nocturnal symptoms). However only one trial found improved morning PEF (<LINK REF="STD-Levin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1998</LINK>). Overall comparisons of medical treatment of GOR versus placebo did not find better morning or evening PEF.</P>
<P>Other measurements of lung function were reported. Although two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Meier-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larrain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Larrain 1991</LINK>) showed improved FEV1 with medical therapy, eight other trials found no beneficial outcome. Unfortunately the different ways reporting FEV1 (such as change from baseline, means without a measure of variance, medians and ranges, mean percentage predicted as opposed to mean litres per minute) precluded a meta-analysis. In four trials which measured airway hyper responsiveness, no benefit of therapy was observed. In summary, lung function tests failed to reveal consistent advantages of treatment for GOR in asthmatics. A limitation of this conclusion is that we were unable to combine the data in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Asthma or respiratory symptoms were outcomes in all twelve studies. Six studies used nocturnal symptoms as an outcome, with positive findings reported by <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kiljander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kiljander 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goodall-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goodall 1981</LINK>. Meta analysis showed a tendency for benefit from histamine antagonists but this failed to reach statistical significance. Both the <LINK REF="STD-Larrain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Larrain 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kjellen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kjellen 1981</LINK> studies reported an improvement in wheezing. Of the seven trials that reported the use of beta agonists, only the Ekstrom and Kjellen papers reported positive results.</P>
<P>Treatment preference was significantly in favour of active treatment in two studies, but there is a major limitation with this outcome factor in that it is likely that the patient preference reflected an improvement in the reflux rather than an improvement in asthma.</P>
<P>In general, the participants in these studies were selected on the basis of having a diagnosis of asthma and GOR. Not all subjects demonstrated symptomatic GOR. Furthermore, a requirement to demonstrate that GOR precipitated asthma was an entry criterion in only two studies. An association was found to be present in a subset of subjects in four of the trials. As such, the appropriate conclusion is that in unselected asthmatics no consistent improvement in asthma is seen with GOR treatment. It remains possible that GOR therapy may improve asthma in a subgroup of asthmatics in whom GOR precipitates asthma. Two reports (<LINK REF="STD-Meier-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Nagel 1988</LINK>) studied participants in whom GOR was objectively demonstrated to precipitate asthma. Although FEV1 improved in one study, other outcomes were negative. This finding contrasts with prior uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="REF-Harding-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harding 1986</LINK>) which demonstrate good response of GOR treatment in this subgroup of asthmatics.</P>
<P>Although twelve good quality studies were available for this systematic review, the interventions used and the outcomes assessed were not consistent. There was a wide variation in the treatment of GOR used (ranitidine in three, cimetidine in two, omeprazole in six, non pharmacological in one and surgery in one), their dosages and the duration of therapy. Similarly the outcomes varied widely. Even when the outcomes appeared similar, they were often reported in several ways, which limited our capacity to combine studies.</P>
<P>The duration of drug therapy was often short, and it might be argued that a longer period of observation would be necessary before improved control of GOR resulted in benefits for asthma. Indeed, when treatment was given for 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-Larrain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Larrain 1991</LINK>), the results were positive. Studies consistently averaged the results over the entire treatment period for symptom scores, PEF, and medication use. If the effect of treatment were delayed, or required time to be manifest, then averaging results over the entire treatment period would bias against finding a treatment effect. The likely implication is that these studies might underestimate the response to GOR therapy.</P>
<P>A further problem is insufficient sample size in the pooled studies to detect a clinically significant treatment effect. It is therefore possible that current studies are negative because of a type 2 error. Using the estimates of sample variance from the meta-analysis of PEF data, a sample size of 506 subjects in a parallel study would be required to detect a difference in PEF of 20 litre/min with alpha at 0.05 and power of 80%. </P>
<P>Our original intention had been to look at the effect of treatment of GOR in both adults and children with asthma. The paucity of appropriate paediatric studies limited the scope of the final review, with the Gustafsson paper the only one that included children (age range for patients in this study 10-20 years, mean age 14.2 years). There is no way of determining whether the observations made in this systematic review are generalisable to children with asthma and GOR.</P>
<P>The relationships between asthma and GOR have been well recognised. Both conditions are common and would be expected to coexist, purely on the basis of chance. Studies in children (<LINK REF="REF-Andze-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andze 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Tucci-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tucci 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Martin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1982</LINK>) and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Sontag-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sontag 1990</LINK>) have found a high prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with asthma suggesting that the relationship may be causal. A number of mechanisms could be invoked to explain how GOR would trigger asthma. Aspiration of gastric contents into the airways is an obvious possibility. Similarly acid stimulation of vagal nerve fibres in the mid-oesophagus can result in wheeze (<LINK REF="REF-Mansfield-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansfield 1989</LINK>). On the other hand, large intrathoracic pressure swings associated with acute exacerbations of asthma might result in asthma promoting reflux. Clinical observation suggests that there are individuals in whom GOR is an important trigger to asthma. However, it is unclear as to whether or not this is a common phenomenon.</P>
<P>In order for treatment for GOR to have a beneficial effect on asthma, it needs to be effective in controlling reflux. This review found a variety of treatments for reflux, with surgical, medical and non pharmacological therapies. The duration and dosage of medication varied between studies. It is also not clear from the available data whether the therapies treated the reflux successfully, because the outcomes were not reported with sufficient consistency. In three studies, use of a proton pump inhibitor (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1994</LINK>) or a histamine antagonist (<LINK REF="STD-Goodall-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goodall 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 1992</LINK>) was associated with a treatment preference over placebo, which suggests that the patients in these studies were experiencing a decrease in symptoms of reflux. An optimal study design would establish that the reflux was controlled as a prerequisite to an assessment of the effect on the asthma.</P>
<P>Future research is warranted to examine the effects of therapy for GOR on asthma control. A parallel group RCT using a proton pump inhibitor for up to 6 months would be appropriate. Subjects with symptomatic asthma and symptomatic GOR in whom GOR was documented to precipitate episodes of asthma should be studied. Such trials should include assessment and standardised reporting of asthma symptoms, quality of life, lung function, symptom and PEF diary, and an assessment of the effects of therapy on GOR. The data should be evaluated as change from baseline, or data during the last few weeks of therapy should be compared between groups.</P>
<P>This systematic review found a heterogeneous group of trials with a variety of outcomes. Although the majority of studies reported at least one statistically significant response, the overall findings from the twelve studies are inconsistent. Treatment of GOR will not help all patients with asthma; the possibility remains that a subgroup will receive benefit, however this requires evaluation in further studies. It is not possible to recommend medical treatment of GOR as a means to improve asthma. Clearly, if GOR exists it should be managed appropriately in order to control the symptoms and complications of GOR. There are opportunities for further research to evaluate the role of surgical therapy for GOR, and to establish if treatment of GOR improves asthma in those patients in whom objective tests show that GOR triggers asthma.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In subjects who had both asthma and GOR, treatment for GOR did not produce a consistent improvement in asthma symptoms. A subgroup of subjects was reported to gain benefit but it appears difficult to predict responders. At present it is not possible to recommend medical treatment of GOR as a means to control asthma.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>It is recommended that future studies should be performed to identify the optimal therapy for GOR in asthma, the optimal drug dosages and duration of therapy. Such studies should be of adequate duration and measurements should be made in the later period on therapy rather than during the entire treatment course. Consideration should also be given to recruitment of participants with proven GOR-induced asthma.</P>
