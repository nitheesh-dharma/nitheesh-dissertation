<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-11 09:53:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare disorder of the neuromuscular junction that causes muscle weakness (most commonly in the upper arms and legs). It is an autoimmune disease in which the body's own antibodies prevent the release of the chemical acetylcholine. This interferes with transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. One of the main treatments is 3,4-diaminopyridine which increases the release of acetylcholine. Four small randomised controlled trials involving 54 participants in total showed that 3,4-diaminopyridine improves muscle strength. This was determined by measuring the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) which is a test that records the amount of electrical activity generated in a muscle when it is stimulated by its nerve. Although the number of trials is relatively small, the quality of evidence from these trials is moderate to high, which supports the findings of this review. The changes are measured over days only. A single trial involving nine participants showed that intravenous immunoglobulin also improved muscle strength up to 8 weeks from treatment. Other possible treatments such as plasma exchange, steroids and immunosuppressive agents have not been tested in randomised controlled trials. Further trials of these treatments are needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-17 15:53:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-11 11:09:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a presynaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission characterised by impaired quantal release of acetylcholine that causes proximal weakness, depressed tendon reflexes and post-tetanic potentiation; additionally, autonomic changes are present (<LINK REF="REF-Lambert-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambert 1956</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lambert-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambert 1971</LINK>). Approximately 60% of people with LEMS have a small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 1988</LINK>). Evidence that LEMS is an autoimmune disease mediated by antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) at motor nerve terminals includes the clinical response to plasma exchange (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1981</LINK>), the passive transfer of the pathophysiological and morphological changes to mice by injection of patients' immunoglobulin (<LINK REF="REF-Fukunaga-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukunaga 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1987</LINK>), and the detection by radioimmunoassay of serum antibodies in people with LEMS to P/Q-type VGCC (<LINK REF="REF-Lennon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Motomura-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Motomura 1995</LINK>). The antigenic stimulus for anti-VGCC autoantibody production in people with SCLC-LEMS appears to be tumour VGCC (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1985</LINK>).The trigger for the production of anti-VGCC antibodies in people with LEMS with no detectable lung cancer (non-SCLC-LEMS) is unknown.</P>
<P>Symptomatic treatment for LEMS include drugs that increase neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction. Guanidine was first recommended for use in LEMS by Lambert (<LINK REF="REF-Lambert-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambert 1966</LINK>) but has not been used in large randomised controlled trials because of serious side effects of marrow suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Oh-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oh 1973</LINK>) and renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Blumhardt-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumhardt 1977</LINK>). Low dose guanidine (less than 1000 mg/day) was used in conjunction with pyridostigmine in nine participants with LEMS in an open trial (<LINK REF="REF-Oh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oh 1997</LINK>). Mean treatment duration was three years, during which three participants stopped taking guanidine due to persistent gastrointestinal side effects. Combination treatment was beneficial in terms of muscle strength and electrophysiological compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude measurements in all nine participants. There were no reported serious side effects.</P>
<P>The quaternary ammonium compound, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), was also found to increase the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction (<LINK REF="REF-Lundh-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundh 1978</LINK>), and was subsequently used for the symptomatic treatment of two patients with LEMS (<LINK REF="REF-Agoston-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agoston 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lundh-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundh 1977</LINK>). A larger open study of the use of oral 4-AP in people with LEMS resulted in clinical and electrophysiological improvement in all four participants tested, but one participant suffered a single tonic clonic seizure on a dose of 120 mg 4-AP per day (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1981</LINK>). The threat of serious central nervous system side effects has thus limited the use of 4-AP, a drug known to cross the blood-brain barrier and result in epileptogenic effects in animals (<LINK REF="REF-Lemeignan-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemeignan 1971</LINK>).</P>
<P>The related aminopyridine 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) has become the mainstay of symptomatic treatment of LEMS in Europe. It has been shown in animals to be more potent in improving neuromuscular transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Molgo-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molgo 1980</LINK>) and less convulsant (<LINK REF="REF-Lechat-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lechat 1968</LINK>) than 4-AP. In addition, it has the advantage over 4-AP of crossing the blood-brain barrier less readily (<LINK REF="REF-Lemeignan-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemeignan 1982</LINK>), resulting in fewer central nervous system side effects. The first use of 3,4-DAP was in three people with LEMS without lung cancer who all derived significant clinical and electrophysiological benefit from intravenous and then oral preparations of 3,4-DAP (<LINK REF="REF-Lundh-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundh 1983</LINK>). Follow-up data collected after a mean treatment duration of five years demonstrated prolonged beneficial clinical effects with minimal side effects at daily doses less than 60 mg of 3,4-DAP (<LINK REF="REF-Lundh-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundh 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>There have subsequently been four randomised placebo-controlled trials of 3,4-DAP in people with LEMS (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>). A cross-over trial of 12 participants conducted by McEvoy et al (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>) showed a significant improvement in isometric muscle strength and a parallel increase in resting CMAP amplitudes following 3,4-DAP treatment in all participants compared with placebo. Sanders et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) found a significant improvement in mean Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score and median CMAP amplitude in people with LEMS treated with 3,4-DAP compared with placebo. In a subsequent open-label phase of the trial, only one of 25 participants had no symptomatic improvement on 3,4-DAP. Wirtz et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>) in a cross-over trial of nine participants showed that isometric muscle testing and mean CMAP amplitude improved with 3,4-DAP treatment, and that pyridostigmine in isolation was no better than placebo, and failed to confer any additional benefit when used in conjunction with 3,4-DAP. A further cross-over trial of seven participants showed that CMAP amplitude, QMG score, subjective symptom score, muscle strength score and LEMS classification all improved with 3,4-DAP when compared to baseline and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence indicating that LEMS was an autoimmune disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1981</LINK>) prompted the use of immunosuppressive treatments. Prednisolone, given in conjunction with azathioprine, following a course of plasma exchanges in three LEMS participants resulted in a marked improvement in clinical and electromyographic measurements in two of them (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1981</LINK>). Eight of nine participants in a subsequent open study (<LINK REF="REF-Newsom_x002d_Davis-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newsom-Davis 1984</LINK>) showed a short-term clinical and electromyographic response to plasma exchange. However, three of these participants developed lung cancer during the course of the study. Of the remaining six people with LEMS without lung cancer, three subsequently achieved almost complete remission of symptoms within a year of beginning treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine. The remaining three participants also improved but to a lesser degree (two were intolerant of azathioprine and received prednisolone alone). Similar improvements were seen in resting CMAP amplitudes. To date, there have been no randomised controlled trials of prednisolone or other oral immunosuppressive agents in LEMS patients.</P>
<P>Since treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been shown to benefit patients with other autoimmune diseases, and because of a single case report of a person with LEMS improving following IVIg (<LINK REF="REF-Bird-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bird 1992</LINK>), a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial was conducted in nine people with LEMS (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>). There were significant improvements in myometric strength measures associated with a significant decline in serum VGCC antibody titres.<BR/>

The risk of bias process takes into account sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, addressing incomplete outcome data, selective reporting or any other forms of bias. These items were graded according to the established Cochrane scale of 'Yes', 'No' or 'Unclear', with 'Yes' indicating a low risk of bias, and 'No' indicating a high risk of bias.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-01-11 10:28:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We performed all statistical calculations using the Cochrane statistical package 'Review Manager 5.1'. We expressed results as mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous variable outcomes. Due to the cross-over design of the studies, we pooled data with the generic inverse variance (GIV) method. This takes the MD between treatment and control, with standard error of the mean (SEM) for the difference. Wherever possible, we have used the published SEM; when this was not available, we used the published P value or original data obtained from the authors to estimate SEM.</P>
<P>For one trial when no other means of obtaining the variance were possible, we had to assume a known within-subject correlation between the treatment effect in the two periods of the cross-over study. We then used the subsequent calculated values in a GIV analysis.</P>

<P>For this update, a search of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register revealed 13 papers (2 new), 138 papers (53 new) through MEDLINE, 100 (30 new) through EMBASE, and 23 through CENTRAL. After review of the new studies and removal of duplicates, we found two new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>) for this update, resulting in a total of five included randomised controlled trials. We found no other trials despite contact with the authors of previous trials. There were no exclusions. The five eligible trials included a total of 54 participants with LEMS treated with 3,4-DAP (or placebo), and nine participants treated with IVIg (or placebo). One patient with complete stable remission was studied in the trial by Oh et al. No healthy participants were studied.</P>
<P>The first trial was a cross-over study of 12 participants with LEMS that compared the effect of maximum dose oral 3,4-DAP (100 mg/day) for six days with placebo, using a muscle strength score and electrophysiological testing at three and six days (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>A second trial with a parallel group design compared oral 3,4-DAP (60 mg/day) with placebo (oral lactose capsules) in 26 participants (12 received 3,4-DAP, 14 placebo). A QMG muscle strength score and electrophysiological measurements were taken on days five and six (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The third trial was a placebo-controlled, double dummy, double blind, randomised cross-over study of nine participants. They compared 10 mg of intravenous 3,4-DAP against placebo infusion, IV pyridostigmine (varying doses), and a combination of 3,4-DAP and pyridostigmine. Muscle strength and electrophysiological testing between 10 and 170 minutes post infusion were measured endpoints (<LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>A fourth trial was a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of seven participants. The treatment protocol varied for two groups of participants. The first group of three cases received an initial daily dose of 15 mg increased to 80 mg per day by the end of the eight day period. A second group received 30 mg per day increased to 75 mg/day over a three day study period due to time constraints. Endpoints assessed subjective symptoms scores, LEMS classification, Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength score, QMG score and CMAP (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The fifth trial compared the effects of IVIg (total 2 g/kg body weight over two days) with placebo infusion (0.3% albumin) in nine participants with LEMS in a cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>). An interval of eight weeks was left before administration of the second reciprocal infusion. Myometric limb muscle strength scores and anti-VGCC antibody concentrations were measured at two-weekly intervals over both eight-week study periods.

<P>Sequence generation was considered acceptable in all five trials. Participants were assigned treatment or placebo by either random allocation table (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>) or random number table (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Allocation concealment was on the whole infrequently described in significant detail. In three trials, insufficient information was given about the process of concealment to permit full judgement (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Participant blinding was intended in all five trials. However, only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) clearly stated that the active drug was identical in appearance to the placebo preparation. The details of the compound used for the placebo in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>) were not stated. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) recorded the effectiveness of blinding in terms of the side effects noted when taking active drug (3,4-DAP) rather than placebo. Perioral or digital paraesthesiae were noted after active treatment (3,4-DAP) in 4 out of 14 participants in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) and 10 out of 12 participants in another (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>). The observers were described as being blinded in all five trials; however, the methods by which this was achieved was again infrequently outlined. Discussions with the clinicians involved in one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>) revealed that the blinding of participants and observers was excellent. The only exceptions to this were one participant who had an acute meningitic reaction following active treatment (IVIg), and another who had cellulitis but was withdrawn from the study.</P>
<P>The five trials detailed full clinical and electrophysiological diagnostic criteria, which fulfilled accepted diagnostic guidelines for LEMS, for all participants (<LINK REF="REF-AAEM-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAEM 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAEM-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAEM 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Explicit outcome criteria were detailed adequately in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>), but in the fifth study (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>), all outcome measures were simply listed, and it was not clear which of these were primary and which were secondary outcome measures. The only trial of the five that was parallel in design, and not cross-over, detailed full baseline characteristics for the LEMS participants receiving either 3,4-DAP or placebo. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of participant age, sex, presence of SCLC, CMAP amplitudes or QMG scores (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>). Incomplete outcome data were well explained and accounted for in all studies.</P>
<P>Follow-up was complete for the short, intended time period for all five trials. Three of the trials reported on an extended period of follow-up, but the long-term effect of treatment was not a planned endpoint. Extended follow-up of 12 to 21 months by McEvoy et al (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>) showed sustained benefit in favour of 3,4-DAP. Almost all (22 of 25) participants studied by Sanders et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) gained sustained benefit from 3,4-DAP treatment over a six-month follow-up period. Oh et al (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>) described patients choice for long-term treatment at the cessation of the trial, and gave a subjective or objective account of their progress.</P>
<P>The baseline difference gradings were not applicable to the four cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>), because the participants acted as their own controls.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome measure: the score on a muscle strength scale (QMG score, or limb muscle strength measured by myometry)</HEADING>
<P>Four trials used a muscle strength scale as an outcome measure, and this was explicitly listed as a primary outcome measure in three (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>). All trials reported a significant improvement in either muscle strength score, or myometric limb measurement following treatment. However, a meta-analysis of the results was not possible because of marked differences between these trials regarding primary outcome measures. Sanders et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) and Oh et al (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>) both used the QMG score as a primary outcome.The trials by McEvoy et al (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>) and (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>) used a different muscle strength score from the QMG score and the isometric muscle strength reported by Wirtz et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>). The scoring system and isometric limb measurements used by McEvoy (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>) or Wirtz (<LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>) were not detailed enough to calculate an equivalent QMG score. We failed to obtain individual participant data from the authors (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>The QMG scores in both trials (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) were taken at the end of the treatment periods. In the trial by Sanders et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) 3,4-DAP was given three times a day for six days, with QMG scores being recorded on days five and six of the administration phase. In the trial by Oh et al, a mixture of an eight-day and three-day treatment phases were used, with QMG scores assessed at the end of each of these treatment periods.</P>
<P>We were therefore able to compare the overall treatment effect by looking at the change in QMG score from baseline with either 3,4-DAP treatment, or placebo treatment from the trials by Oh et al and Sanders et al (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>). A GIV analysis of these two trials showed that QMG scores decreased (improved) by 2.24 points (95% CI 1.22 to 3.65 points) after treatment with 3,4-DAP (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcome measure: improvement in the amplitude of the resting CMAP(s) (mean of all muscles tested)</HEADING>
<P>All trials recorded changes in the amplitude of resting CMAPs after active treatment or placebo. Resting CMAP values in both one arm and one leg muscle, obtained before and after treatment with 3,4-DAP, were available for each participant in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>). Oh et al (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>) also gave before, during and after CMAP abductor digiti quinti values in their results section. An averaged CMAP obtained from one foot and two hand muscles was used in the trial by Sanders et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>), and the averaged change in CMAP amplitude was given for the participant cohort by Wirtz et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>). The original CMAP data were subsequently kindly provided by Sanders et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) and Wirtz et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>) in order to be able to include this in the analysis. All trials recorded significant improvement in resting CMAP amplitudes following 3,4-DAP treatment compared with placebo.</P>
<P>We were able to compare overall treatment effect by using an averaged overall (or hand muscle) CMAP amplitude response. As three trials were a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>), and the other used a parallel protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>), it was necessary to employ a GIV analysis. Original data provided by the authors of three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>) were used to used in this analysis. For the paper by McEvoy et al the standard error (SE) of the mean difference was deduced by assuming that the CMAP values for individual patients, both before and after treatment had a correlation of r = 0.5. These results were then used in conjunction with the data from the three other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>) and included in the GIV analysis to assess the overall effect of treatment.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of the CMAP secondary endpoint showed a significant overall benefit in CMAP amplitude after treatment with 3,4-DAP. The overall mean improvement on GIV analysis was 1.36 mV (95% CI 0.99 to 1.72) in favour of the treatment (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>All trials assessed CMAPs at one specific time point during their trial, with only the trial by McEvoy et al also providing three month follow up results. Each trial assessed CMAPs after different periods of exposure to 3,4-DAP. Sanders et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) assessed CMAPs on day five or six of their six-day treatment regime, though the time period post 3,4-DAP dose administration was not recorded. McEvoy et al (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>) assessed CMAPs on the final day of their three-day trial period, though again, the time the electrophysiology was performed in relation to the last dose was not stated. Oh et al (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>) also measured CMAPs on the final day of their three or eight day treatment protocol. The study by Wirtz et al performed electrophysiological testing after only one dose, and measured CMAPs in 20 minute intervals for three hours post administration of 3,4-DAP. The values used in this analysis were the mean of all values recorded after 3,4-DAP was given.</P>
<P>Testing for heterogeneity (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 2.88, (three degrees of freedom), P value = 0.41) suggested that the significant meta-analysis finding for the secondary endpoint may have been due to chance.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-01-17 15:53:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>There have been only five randomised controlled trials of treatment for Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: four of 3,4-DAP and one of IVIg.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effects of 3,4-diaminopyridine</HEADING>
<P>All primary endpoint measures of isometric muscle strength (<LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>), neurological disability score (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>) and QMG score (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) improved significantly following the administration of oral 3,4-DAP.</P>
<P>We were able to perform a meta-analysis on QMG scores based on the data provided in the papers by Sanders et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) and Oh et al (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>). Sanders et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>) was the first trial to use the QMG muscle score and showed that there was a 2.23 point improvement between the placebo and 3-4-DAP treated group. In the study by Oh et al (<LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>), QMG score improved in four of the six participants treated with 3,4-DAP, with a mean improvement of 3.00 points. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The QMG scoring system ranges from a score of 0 to 39. A score of zero implies that speech, swallowing, vital capacity, facial muscle strength, external ocular muscles, and all limb muscles are normal. Barohn et al (<LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1998</LINK> ) tested for inter-rater reliability of the QMG score, and found that if the QMG score is to be used as a primary efficacy measure, then a treatment must produce more than 2.6 units of change to be of clinical significance.</P>
<P>Our analysis shows that QMG score does indeed appear to improve with 3,4-DAP treatment compared to baseline QMG values; however, with a mean overall improvement of 2.44 points, and 95% CI of 1.22 to 3.65 points. Therefore, this apparent improvement must be placed into the context of the reliability of the QMG score as a primary efficacy measurement in clinical trials as outlined by Barohn et al <LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1998</LINK>, who determined that a treatment must produce more than 2.6 units of change in QMG score to be of clinical significance. It therefore remains inconclusive as to whether 3,4-DAP treatment of LEMS definitively improves QMG muscle score. The authors believe that the QMG score should remain as the preferred measure of muscle strength testing in future trials of treatment in LEMS. The use of a uniform primary outcome measure, and data from further trials would enable a more definitive effect to be delineated. The authors also believe that in keeping with previous studies, it is appropriate to continue to assess the effect of 3,4-DAP treatment by performing a QMG assessment 3-4 days after the initiation of treatment.</P>
<P>Although we were able to demonstrate (with meta-analysis) a significant improvement in the secondary endpoint of mean CMAP amplitude following treatment with 3,4-DAP, some statistical assumptions had to be employed in the analysis. This was because one of the four trials (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>) had a cross-over design and we did not have access to individual patient data to help determine within-patient treatment effects in the two cross-over periods. However, we were able to use original data from the other three trials directly in the analysis, which revealed a significant overall improvement of CMAP to be determined on GIV testing. Therefore, change in mean CMAP amplitude following treatment seems to be an ideal, objective, and reproducible secondary endpoint for trials of treatment in LEMS. The authors believe that due to the short duration of action of 3,4-DAP CMAPs should be recorded three to six hours after a dose of 3,4-DAP, and that future studies should record the timing of CMAP assessment in relation to doses of the drug.</P>
<P>The results of the four trials of 3,4-DAP treatment for LEMS showing significant benefit concur with earlier reports of 3,4-DAP being beneficial for LEMS, and mirror current practice of using this drug for symptomatic first-line treatment for people with LEMS.</P>
<P>Adverse events reported from 3,4-DAP treatment during the trials (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>) included brief perioral tingling and digital paraesthesiae, insomnia, and epigastric discomfort, and Wirtz et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wirtz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wirtz 2009</LINK>) described a case of cellulitis following 3,4-DAP infusion. In one study, a participant suffered from a seizure at a daily dose of 100 mg 3,4-DAP (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 1989</LINK>). No other major side effects have been reported.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effects of IVIg</HEADING>
<P>A single randomised placebo-controlled cross-over study showed a significant improvement in limb strength measured by myometry following IVIg treatment, compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>). Aside from the single randomised controlled trial detailed in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>), there are very little data regarding the use of IVIg treatment for LEMS. Evidence from case reports (<LINK REF="REF-Bird-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bird 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muchnik-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muchnik 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takano-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takano 1994</LINK>) and expert opinion would suggest that this is a potentially useful short-term and long-term treatment. However, it is likely that people with LEMS who have not responded favourably to IVIg have not been reported widely in the literature.</P>
<P>Adverse events reported from IVIg treatment during the single randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>) include acute meningism in one participant and self-limiting headache in four other participants. Other side effects have previously been reported in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Dalakas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalakas 1999</LINK>) and include neutropenia, leukopenia, cerebral or cardiac infarction due to hypercoaguable state, renal tubular damage, eczema, erythema multiforme and skin vasculitis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Cost benefit considerations</HEADING>
<P>Until recently, oral 3,4-DAP was available as an unlicensed formulation as 3,4-DAP base. However, a phosphate salt formulation of oral 3,4-DAP (amifampridine) has recently been licensed in the UK for the treatment of LEMS in adults (<LINK REF="REF-BioMarin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">BioMarin 2010</LINK>).The original 3,4-DAP base preparation cost approximately UK 1 for a 20 mg tablet, and with the average dose used in one trial with long-term follow-up being 40 mg per day (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>), the yearly expenditure for each person with LEMS equated to UK 730. The new licensed medication, amifampridine, is however far more expensive. Currently, the cost of one hundred 10 mg tablets in the UK is 2,017, and therefore using a 40 mg per day average dose would result in a yearly expenditure of 29,448 per patient (<LINK REF="REF-UKMi-Pharmacists-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKMi Pharmacists 2010</LINK>). The increased cost of amifampridine may provide significant cost pressures for organisations.</P>
<P>The average cost of a two-day course of IVIg using a dose of 1 g/kg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>) is currently approximately UK 2,800. The muscle strength measurements recorded in the single randomised trial of IVIg in LEMS (<LINK REF="STD-Bain-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bain 1996</LINK>) showed that the beneficial effect had dissipated by approximately eight weeks. If ongoing IVIg treatment were to be used for people who responded favourably, they would possibly require six similar treatment courses per year, at a total cost of UK 16,800. There are no direct comparison data regarding IVIg and 3,4-DAP, but our standard deviation analysis (see above) would suggest no significant difference between the two treatments, and with the introduction of amifampridine and its increased cost, it may now potentially be a more viable treatment economically than amifampridine. However, it must be noted, that in the IVIg trial, participants were still weak despite treatment with 3,4-DAP and immunosuppression, so the use of IVIg in these people was as a second (or third) line option for resistant muscle weakness. By contrast, 3,4-DAP was the first line option in most of the participants in the two trials of that agent.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-10-24 15:38:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Limited but moderate to high quality evidence from randomised controlled trials showed that either 3,4-DAP or IVIg improved muscle strength scores and compound muscle action potential amplitudes in people with LEMS. There are insufficient data at present to quantify this treatment effect.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-10-23 15:14:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further trials of treatment for LEMS should use the QMG score as the primary outcome, and change in CMAP amplitude as the secondary outcome. The possible beneficial effect of IVIg should be validated in a further trial. Other possible treatments, such as plasma exchange, steroids and immunosuppressive agents should be tested in RCTs.</P>

<SUP>2</SUP> A previous study (Barohn et al, 1998 - see references) showed that due to the variability of repeated observations when using the QMG scoring system, a treatment must produce score changes of 2.6 or greater to be considered of significance. Hence further studies are needed to truly determine any significant effect.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> Although only 54 patients in total were recruited into all 4 trials of 3,4-DAP, in 3 of the 4 studies a cross-over design was used resulting in patients acting as their own controls. In one study (Sanders et al), 14 patients received placebo only.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP> In total 42 patients received 3,4-DAP. Serious side effects were extremely rare. One patient had a generalised seizure using high dose 3,4-DAP (McEvoy et al). Minor side effects of limb or perioral paraesthesia occurred in 19 participants, with insomnia and headache occurring in 5.<BR/>
