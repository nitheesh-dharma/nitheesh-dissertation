<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-04-30 13:38:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Migraine is a common condition that can significantly impair people's quality of life. Individuals who experience frequent or severe migraine may benefit from preventive medications taken prior to an attack and before the pain starts. Studies have suggested the potential role of neurotransmitters in the genesis of headache. Accordingly, drugs that inhibit the passage of neurotransmitters in brain cells and, therefore, increase their levels, have been examined for their potential benefit in preventing migraine. Two classes of inhibitors, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), typically used to treat depression, are evaluated in this review.</P>
<P>This is an update of a previous review that included studies on migraine and tension-type headache. This original review has been split in two separate reviews: this update addresses only studies on migraine, while a second focuses on tension-type headache. In November 2014, we identified three new studies. Eight studies were already included in the previous version of the review. Overall, we analysed a total of 585 participants. All the studies had a small number of participants and were conducted over a period of two to three months. Only a few were of high quality.</P>
<P>The results suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs are no better than placebo (sugar pill) for reducing the number of migraine attacks. There were no differences in minor side effects between participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs versus those treated with placebo. SSRIs and SNRIs seem not to offer advantages when compared to other active treatments, specifically the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline. The participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs suffered fewer minor side effects than those who took amitriptyline, however the number of people who stopped taking one drug or the other due to side effects was approximately equal. These results are based on short-term trials (no more than three months), which are not properly sized and feature serious methodological deficiencies. We did not find studies comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with pharmacological treatments other than antidepressants (e.g. antiepileptics and anti-hypertensives).</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-30 13:39:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2005 on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for preventing migraine and tension-type headache. The original review has been split in two parts and this review now only regards migraine prevention. Another updated review is under development to cover tension-type headache.</P>
<P>Migraine is a common disorder. The chronic forms are associated with disability and have a high economic impact. In view of discoveries about the role of serotonin and other neurotransmitters in pain mechanisms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been evaluated for the prevention of migraine.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-07-15 07:54:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rita Banzi">
<P>To determine the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs and SNRIs compared to placebo and other active interventions in the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-27 12:09:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the original review, we searched MEDLINE (1966 to January 2004), EMBASE (1994 to May 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2003, Issue 4), and <I>Headache Quarterly</I> (1990 to 2003). For this update, we applied a revised search strategy to reflect the broader type of intervention (SSRIs and SNRIs). We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2014), EMBASE (1980 to November 2014), and PsycINFO (1987 to November 2014). We also checked the reference lists of retrieved articles and searched trial registries for ongoing trials.<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-04-10 16:45:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rita Banzi">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with any type of control intervention in participants 18 years and older of either sex with migraine.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-10-21 13:30:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data (migraine frequency, index, intensity, and duration; use of symptomatic/analgesic medication; days off work; quality of life; mood improvement; cost-effectiveness; and adverse events) and assessed the risk of bias of trials. The primary outcome of this updated review is migraine frequency.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-30 15:15:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original review included eight studies on migraine. Overall, we now include 11 studies on five SSRIs and one SNRI with a total of 585 participants. Six studies were placebo-controlled, four compared a SSRI or SNRI to amitriptyline, and one was a head-to-head comparison (escitalopram versus venlafaxine). Most studies had methodological or reporting shortcomings (or both): all studies were at unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. Follow-up rarely extended beyond three months. The lack of adequate power of most of the studies is also a major concern.</P>
<P>Few studies explored the effect of SSRIs or SNRIs on migraine frequency, the primary endpoint. Two studies with unclear reporting compared SSRIs and SNRIs to placebo, suggesting a lack of evidence for a difference. Two studies compared SSRIs or SNRIs versus amitriptyline and found no evidence for a difference in terms of migraine frequency (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.72 to 0.80; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 72%), or other secondary outcomes such as migraine intensity and duration.</P>
<P>SSRIs or SNRIs were generally more tolerable than tricyclics. However, the two groups did not differ in terms of the number of participants who withdrew due to adverse advents or for other reasons (one study, odds ratio (OR) 0.39, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.50 and OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.34).</P>
<P>We did not find studies comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with pharmacological treatments other than antidepressants (e.g. antiepileptics and anti-hypertensives).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-27 12:11:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the last version of this review, the new included studies have not added high quality evidence to support the use of SSRIs or venlafaxine as preventive drugs for migraine. There is no evidence to consider SSRIs or venlafaxine as more effective than placebo or amitriptyline in reducing migraine frequency, intensity, and duration over two to three months of treatment. No reliable information is available at longer-term follow-up. Our conclusion is that the use of SSRIs and SNRIs for migraine prophylaxis is not supported by evidence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-30 13:38:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated systematic review considers the evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for the prevention of migraine. It is an update of a systematic review on SSRIs for the prevention of migraine and tension-type headache previously published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Cusi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cusi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moja-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moja 2005</LINK>). Another review is under development to cover the prevention of tension-type headache (in press).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-27 12:13:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Migraine is a common neurological disorder with episodic manifestations that may persist or progress in frequency over time as a function of biologic, psychologic, and environmental influences (<LINK REF="REF-Lipton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipton 2004</LINK>). The Global Burden of Disease Survey 2010 ranked migraine as the third most prevalent disorder and seventh-highest specific cause of disability worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Vos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2012</LINK>). Published estimates of migraine prevalence vary widely, with a lifetime prevalence of 20% to 25%; it is reported that 36 million people in the United States suffer from repeated attacks of migraine (<LINK REF="REF-American-Migraine-Foundation-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Migraine Foundation 2013</LINK>). However, according to three epidemiological studies conducted in the United States, the prevalence of migraine is rather stable: migraine occurs in about 12% of people, with an almost three-fold higher prevalence in adult women compared to adult men (<LINK REF="REF-Buse-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buse 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steward-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steward 1992</LINK>). An episodic migraine tends to evolve into a chronic form, often in relation to an overuse of drugs for acute treatment or in the absence of adequate preventive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Colas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colas 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiendels-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiendels 2006</LINK>). According to a systematic review of population-based studies the prevalence of chronic migraine is 0% to 5.1%, with estimates typically ranging from 1.4% to 2.2% (<LINK REF="REF-Natoli-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Natoli 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Migraine is defined as a recurrent primary headache disorder. Migraine without aura is the most common subtype. It is characterised by attacks lasting four to 72 hours, with a unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity, and association with nausea and/or photophobia and phonophobia. Migraine with aura is primarily characterised by focal neurological symptoms that usually precede or sometimes accompany the headache. The premonitory phase may occur hours or days before the migraine and includes symptoms such as hyperactivity, hypoactivity, depression, craving for particular foods, and repetitive yawning. As one or a few migraine attacks may be difficult to distinguish from symptomatic migraine-like attacks, at least five attacks are required to confirm the diagnosis. Migraine frequency is often classified as episodic or chronic. Chronic migraine occurs when the headache lasts 15 or more days per month for more than three months, and has the features of migraine on at least eight days per month. The most common risk factor for episodic migraine to progress to chronic migraine is medication overuse (<LINK REF="REF-IHS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">IHS 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Migraine is associated with significant burden, including functional impairment, disability, and reduced quality of life and well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Buse-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buse 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2012</LINK>). Costs of the disease for patients and healthcare systems are also an issue. The substantial economic cost and social impact of migraine has been documented across diverse settings (<LINK REF="REF-Bloudek-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloudek 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cull-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cull 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Serrano-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serrano 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Von-Korff-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Korff 1998</LINK>). The estimates vary across countries due to differences in available therapies and they way in which they are delivered, and structural differences in healthcare systems. A recent cost-of-illness survey conducted as part of the Eurolight project in six European countries reported an annual direct and indirect cost of migraine per person of Euro 1222, and a total annual cost for the European countries of Euro 111 billion for adults aged 18 to 65 years (<LINK REF="REF-Linde-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 2012</LINK>). A survey conducted in the US reported a similar figure for episodic migraine and costs up to more than USD 7000 for chronic migraine (<LINK REF="REF-Munakata-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munakata 2009</LINK>). More than 50% of working persons with migraine report a loss of at least two days of work per month and, among people with chronic migraine, a daily use of analgesic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Zwart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwart 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recognition of the social and economic burden of migraine calls for an accurate analysis of the efficacy and safety of preventive and treatment options currently available, as well as the development of new effective strategies.</P>
<P>While migraine is no longer considered a vascular-based phenomena, the pathogenesis is still uncertain. The importance of sensitisation of pain pathways and the possibility that attacks may originate in the central nervous system have gained increasing attention over recent decades. Messenger molecules such as nitric oxide (NO), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) may be involved (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffmann-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffmann 2014</LINK>). Highly receptor-specific acute medications such as the triptans have demonstrated efficacy in the acute treatment of attacks. They have high receptor specificity, therefore their mechanism of action provides new insight into migraine mechanisms and it is now clear that migraine is a neurobiological disorder (<LINK REF="REF-IHS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">IHS 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-03-27 12:13:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The pharmacological therapy of migraine includes the treatment of acute attacks, usually using simple analgesics, triptans, and antiemetics, and a prophylactic approach that aims to reduce the frequency, severity, and duration of migraine attacks. Preventive treatment is especially well-suited to patients with very frequent or severe migraine. It encompasses both episodic and chronic forms, causing significant headache-related disability, and that are resistant to acute therapy (<LINK REF="REF-IHS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">IHS 2013</LINK>). For instance, migraine prophylactic therapy can be appropriate if, despite appropriate use of acute medications and trigger management/lifestyle modification strategies, patients still experience attacks that highly affect daily activities, or when the frequency of migraine attacks is such that patients are at risk of medication overuse (rebound) migraine (<LINK REF="REF-Pringsheim-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pringsheim 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although epidemiologic studies suggest that approximately 38% of migraineurs need preventive therapy, only 3% to 13% currently use it (<LINK REF="REF-Lipton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipton 2007</LINK>). Several pharmacological strategies are currently approved or used off-label for migraine prevention and thought to affect various aspects of migraine pathophysiology (<LINK REF="REF-Sprenger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprenger 2009</LINK>). Preventive treatments aim to eliminate headache pain without intolerable harms and they are also expected to reduce the use of acute drugs and improve quality of life. In clinical practice the choice of a drug over another is based on many drug-related factors such as familiarity, efficacy, and adverse effects, as well as many patient characteristics such as headache frequency, presence of aura, comorbid conditions, and patient preference.</P>
<P>SSRIs and SNRIs are a class of compounds typically used as antidepressants in the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders, and some personality disorders. SSRIs increase the extracellular level of neurotransmitters such as serotonin by inhibiting its reuptake into the presynaptic cell. Depending on their chemical structure, these compounds have varying degrees of selectivity for the other monoamine transporters, with pure SSRIs having only weak affinity for the noradrenaline transporter and non-selective compounds also blocking the reuptake of noradrenaline and dopamine.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-27 12:14:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The serotonergic system from the brainstem raphe nucleus seems to be implicated in migraine pathophysiology. Several studies have documented a central neurochemical imbalance and changes in the serotonin metabolism and in the processing of serotonin-mediated responses during and in between migraine attacks. How the abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is linked to the manifestation of head pain and the accompanying symptoms has yet to be fully understood. However, evidence suggests that low serotonin levels facilitate the activation of the trigeminovascular nociceptive pathway, as induced by cortical spreading depression (<LINK REF="REF-Hamel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamel 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similar to migraine, depression is also considered to be a disorder of low brain serotonergic activity, and epidemiological studies have reported comorbidity of migraine with psychiatric disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Buse-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buse 2013</LINK>). Most antidepressant drugs are aimed at enhancing and stabilising 5-HT neurotransmission and some antidepressants have been shown to be effective in migraine prophylaxis at lower doses than those used to treat depression.</P>
<P>In view of the discoveries about the role of serotonin and other neurotransmitters in pain mechanisms, SSRIs and SNRIs have also been evaluated for their potential benefit in the treatment of migraine.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-03-27 12:14:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical guidelines often mention SSRIs and SNRIs as possible preventive treatments for migraine. However, the role of these antidepressants for migraine prophylaxis is not completely established. The American Society of Internal Medicine recommends the use of some SSRIs (paroxetine and fluvoxamine) to prevent migraine, while emphasising that this recommendation is based on expert consensus and clinical experiences (<LINK REF="REF-Snow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2002</LINK>). According to the American Headache Society (AHS) and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) data from migraine prevention guidelines to support or refute the use of SSRIs such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine for migraine prophylaxis are insufficient (<LINK REF="REF-Loder-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loder 2012</LINK>). More recent guidelines by the European Federation of Neurological Societies and Canadian Headache Society do not consider venlafaxine and other antidepressant drugs as effective treatments for migraine prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Evers-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pringsheim-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pringsheim 2012</LINK>).</P>

Where no such criteria were specified, the diagnosis of migraine had to be based on at least some of its distinctive features, (e.g. nausea/vomiting; severe pain; pulsating/throbbing pain; mainly unilateral pain; and the presence of photophobia, phonophobia, and/or aura). Patients with episodic migraine usually have it two to eight times per month. Chronic migraine is defined as that occurring with a frequency of at least 15 days/month (180 days/year) for at least a three-month period.</P>

<P>Two authors independently abstracted information on study methods (design, duration, randomisation, blinding, withdrawals), participants (age, sex, type of headache, duration of disease, co-existing depression and other psychiatric illnesses, and concomitant drugs), interventions (type of drug, route of administration, and dosage), outcomes, and adverse events using specially designed, pre-tested, electronic extraction forms.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-03-27 12:17:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors assessed the risk of bias for each of the included studies using the 'Risk of bias' tool developed by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This includes five domains of bias: selection, performance, attrition, detection and reporting, as well as an 'other bias' category to capture other potential threats to validity.</P>
<P>Selection bias included an assessment of adequate sequence generation as well as allocation concealment. We assessed sequence generation to be at low risk when studies clearly specified a method for generating a truly random sequence. We assessed allocation concealment to be at low risk if the method used to ensure that investigators enrolling participants could not predict group assignment was described. Performance and detection bias were incorporated under the blinding domain in the 'Risk of bias' tool: we did not consider them separately as the large majority of outcomes were self reported by the patients (i.e. using diaries). We assessed this to be low risk for studies that reported blinding of participants and study personnel. We assessed studies as low risk for attrition bias if an adequate description of participant flow through the study was provided, the proportion of missing outcome data was relatively balanced across groups, and the reasons for missing outcome data were provided, relatively balanced between groups, and considered unlikely to bias the results.</P>
<P>We assessed studies as having low risk of reporting bias when a published protocol was available and all specified outcomes were included in the study report; we assessed studies without a published protocol as unclear. When an outcome measure was specified and the results were not reported either at baseline or at follow-up, we considered the study to be at high risk of reporting bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>In randomised cross-over studies, individuals receive each intervention sequentially in a random order. Cross-over studies usually contain a washout period, which is a stage after the first treatment but before the second treatment, where time is given for the active effects of the first treatment to wear off before the new treatment begins (that is to reduce the carryover effect). A concern with the cross-over design is the risk of a carryover effect when the first treatment affects the second. Inadequate washouts are seen when the carryover effect exceeds the washout period. For this review, we considered an adequate washout period for cross-over studies to be a minimum of one week. When including cross-over studies with an inadequate washout period we used only the first arm data. Even though this method does not consider all of the information provided it avoids inappropriate consideration of correlated information.</P>

<P>We have particular doubts about one study, which reported extremely positive results in favour of fluoxetine but was characterised by a general lack of detail in reporting (<LINK REF="STD-Polisca-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Polisca 1992</LINK>). Our concerns include the following: (1) lack of any clear evidence that the patients were truly randomised; (2) 100% of patients (N = 60) completed the study; (3) the adopted statistical analysis is insufficiently described; and (4) identical means and standard deviations are reported for two different outcomes (frequency and symptomatic/analgesic medication use).</P>
<P>Only one study reported an adequate sample size calculation (<LINK REF="STD-Steiner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 1998</LINK>), with most of the studies clearly underpowered and, therefore, more prone to be inconclusive (e.g. not enabled to find a statistically significant difference that is true) (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hotopf-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hotopf 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hotopf-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hotopf 1999</LINK>). The median sample size was 53 and ranged from 27 to 105. The mean drop-out rate was 22% of all randomised patients, leading to much smaller sample size across studies.</P>
<P>With respect to the previous version of this review, the median sample size per arm increased by 20% (from 25 to 30). However, concerns remain about the fact that many studies are likely to be underpowered to detect any difference (<LINK REF="REF-Moja-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moja 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The lack of statistical power is reflected in the use of a large number of rating scales to measure outcomes. Furthermore the majority of trials analysed the multiple outcomes at many different time intervals (four weeks, eight weeks, etc.), increasing exponentially the number of comparisons. Performing multiple comparisons easily leads to detect statistically significant differences that are spurious (<LINK REF="REF-Thornley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one trial stated that the analysis was done by intention-to-treat but no additional details were provided (<LINK REF="STD-Tarlaci-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tarlaci 2009</LINK>). The number of patients in the final analysis (when reported) rarely matched that which was reported at baseline. Only two studies analysed the patients on the basis of the randomised group, but this was related to the fact that there were no drop-outs (<LINK REF="STD-Colucci-d_x0027_Amato-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Colucci d'Amato 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polisca-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Polisca 1992</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-30 15:15:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence supporting the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) to ameliorate the most relevant clinical outcome in adult patients with migraine - frequency - is scarce. The only new study included in this update that analysed a SNRI, venlafaxine, versus placebo, reported a decrease of migraine frequency. However, it is questionable to rely on the evidence originated by a single sponsored study with poor reporting. SSRIs and SNRIs may be useful, not useful, or detrimental for attacks of migraine. Our analysis does not exclude any of these possibilities. However, the interpretation most likely to emerge in revising all the evidence is that, when compared to placebo, the SSRIs and SNRIs did not seem to reduce migraine frequency at two- or three-month follow-up. Neither SSRIs nor venlafaxine were better than amitriptyline. Among other secondary outcomes, again SSRIs or SNRIs did not ameliorate migraine intensity, duration, or migraine index, and did not reduce the consumption of analgesic drugs when compared to placebo. Amitriptyline appeared to be similar to venlafaxine in reducing migraine intensity and duration. The data on the safety profiles of SSRIs and SNRIs derived from the included studies are also limited. No differences in terms of withdrawals due to adverse events or minor adverse events were detected, but the number of events were few and their reporting generally unclear. SSRIs and SNRIs appear to be better tolerated than amitriptyline but no firm conclusions can be drawn on the basis of the included trials.</P>
<P>We included three new trials in this update, which did not provide any substantial new evidence in the field. Overall, these results are based on 10 studies comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with placebo or other antidepressants (amitriptyline), and one head-to-head comparison. We did not find studies comparing SSRIs and SNRIs with non-antidepressant drug treatments for preventing migraine (beta-blockers, antiepileptics, etc.) or with physical or behavioural treatments for migraine.</P>
<P>Many indexes, scales, and sub-scales were used in this relatively small number of trials. The clinical relevance of some of these rating tools is questionable (<LINK REF="REF-Thornley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 1998</LINK>). The only scales that have been formally evaluated are those that assess patients for depressed mood (e.g. Zung Depression Scale or Montgomery and Asberg Depression Scale), a secondary outcome in the management of chronic pain conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Snow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, the working hypothesis of these trials is that the overall effect of SSRIs or SNRIs is not due to a direct antidepressant effect (<LINK REF="REF-Sindrup-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sindrup 2000</LINK>). Thus, SSRIs or SNRIs need to be compared with non-antidepressant prophylactic drugs or non-pharmacologic preventive treatments in order to avoid the confounding effects of the antidepressant therapy.</P>
<P>Only two studies considered symptomatic/analgesic medication use as an outcome of interest (<LINK REF="STD-Ozyalcin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozyalcin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 1998</LINK>). Medication use may be more difficult to interpret than migraine frequency (as measured by daily self report) because it is based on a behavioural response on the part of the patient (taking medication for acute relief) to the occurrence of a headache, which introduces an extra layer of variability. Accordingly, while the use of medications may be a less direct measure of their effect on migraine compared to attack frequency, we believe it is a desirable secondary outcome, particularly since the overuse of acute medication may perpetuate or increase chronic migraines (<LINK REF="REF-Kaniecki-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaniecki 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pain associated with migraine affects many aspects of an individual's life, including both social and occupational roles. We did not find any mention of workdays lost or any data pertaining to cost-effectiveness or quality of life. Workdays lost is a specific, strong measure to assess headache improvement from a more social-economic perspective. Several quality of life scales have been validated and are now available. They assess the impact of migraine on daily activities and include many items related to individuals' general well-being such as pain and mood states. Many headache indexes replicate a sub-scale or items already included in quality of life scales. Finally, quality of life is a global measure capable of making useful comparisons between adverse events of drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Hotopf-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hotopf 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one study compared a SSRI to a SNRI and it reported no difference between escitalopram and venlafaxine in terms of migraine frequency (<LINK REF="STD-Tarlaci-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tarlaci 2009</LINK>). We cannot draw any conclusion about the fact that differences in selectivity (serotonin or nor adrenaline reuptake) could be related to differences in efficacy.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-27 13:49:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The data that inform this review are few and generally poor, in terms of the quality of the trials that originated them. Only five studies reported data on the most relevant clinical outcome, migraine frequency (two placebo- and three amitriptyline-controlled) for a total of fewer than 300 participants. Reporting was often incomplete, making some studies uninformative. The applicability of this scarce evidence is also an issue, mainly because the analysed studies used short follow-up and outcomes with a small clinical value. However, the findings of this review suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs do not show benefits for the outcomes that may matter to patients.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-03-30 15:15:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The majority of the included trials can be considered to be at unclear risk of bias (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>). None of the trials reported any information on allocation concealment, or the blinding of the treatment allocation. Blinding of participants and study personnel was described in only a few studies. Many trials were likely to be underpowered, had missing intention-to-treat analysis and had a strong inclination to perform multiple testing. The small study size is a consistent marker of overestimation of treatment effects. Finally, there were frequently ambiguities in the presentation of the results of the analyses, emphasising within-group comparisons. Some readers may find these methodological problems surprising; we did not. Previous methodological work showed that these are common problems in studies of SSRIs and related antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Hotopf-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hotopf 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hotopf-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hotopf 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thornley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 1998</LINK>) and, more generally, can be found across many medical specialties (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1990</LINK>). Methodological quality did not seem to have improved in the more recent trials.</P>
<P>Even though we did not formally explore outcome reporting bias, the use of multiple outcomes without a predefined primary outcome, with no prespecified priorities among outcomes, and without knowing whether outcomes are equally correlated, may have increased the risk of data dredging and distorted reporting in an attempt to demonstrate post hoc differences between interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Pocock-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 1997</LINK>). This problem is magnified by the limited size of most included trials.</P>
<P>We rated the overall quality of the evidence for clinically relevant efficacy and safety outcomes as 'low' or 'very low' (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). We downgraded the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome because of limitations in the study designs and imprecision. We also downgraded the outcomes 'migraine index' and 'withdrawals (for any reasons and due to adverse events)' for indirectness. Our choice was driven by the fact that migraine indexes, as well as the definitions of adverse events, varied among the trials, and their applicability and appropriateness to the clinical context might be questionable.</P>

<P>Other systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Tomkins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomkins 2001</LINK> and its update in <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2010</LINK>) have examined antidepressant medication for migraine prophylaxis. On the basis of four studies, which were also included in our review, the authors concluded that tricyclic antidepressants reduced the pain from migraine, citing some evidence about their superiority over SSRIs. The studies included in our review suggested a similar trend, however we cannot conclude that one class of drug is a better option than the other.</P>
<P>Recent clinical guidelines from the USA considered the role of antidepressants in migraine prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Silberstein-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silberstein 2012</LINK>). It was suggested that SSRIs and venlafaxine were probably effective, although the authors cautiously assessed the overall evidence supporting this recommendation as either negative or equivocal. This recommendation, possibly favouring the use of SSRIs and SNRIs as a preventive strategy, seems to be generous. A more balanced message is provided by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Canadian guidelines in which SSRIs and SNRIs are either not considered at all or are not indicated as a suitable option (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pringsheim-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pringsheim 2012</LINK>), in preference to more effective strategies (e.g. topiramate or propranolol). Even in patients with migraine, concomitant depression, and/or anxiety, the role of SSRIs and SNRIs should be considered as limited given the paucity of evidence.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-03-27 13:50:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the last version of this review, we included three new relevant studies, which have provided little new evidence on the effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in patients with migraine. SSRIs or SNRIs are no more effective than placebo and are likely to be less effective than amitriptyline in preventing migraine. Fluoxetine was the most studied SSRI, while venlafaxine was the only SNRI under investigation.</P>
<P>The usefulness of SSRIs or SNRIs for preventing migraine is obscure and the best guess is that these drugs are unlikely to be effective for the majority of patients. When compared to placebo or amitriptyline, SSRIs and SNRIs did not show any superiority on relevant outcomes (migraine frequency, intensity, duration). There was some evidence that SSRIs are better tolerated than amitriptyline and venlafaxine. The issue of long-term treatment (more than three months) with respect to efficacy and tolerability should still be addressed because in real-life conditions, patients with chronic migraine receive treatment for more than a few weeks.</P>
<P>No conclusion can be drawn on the use of antidepressants with respect to other prophylactic pharmacological treatments, such as antihypertensives (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists) or antiepileptics.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-30 15:16:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the standards in terms of design and reporting of randomised clinical trials still need to be improved. For example, open designs are not acceptable in this context. Migraine frequency should be the primary outcome measure in any new trial. Migraine is a recurrent condition that persists over long periods of time/whole parts of the lifespan, therefore longer follow-up is needed and harder outcomes that relate to real-life should be assessed (e.g. migraine frequency, acute medication use, days off work, and quality of life) (<LINK REF="REF-Tfelt_x002d_Hansen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tfelt-Hansen 2012</LINK>). This will also avoid the use of non-validated indexes, discouraging multiple comparisons at different time points, with the warning that multiple data testing easily results in misleading statistically significant findings that appear by chance (<LINK REF="REF-Moja-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moja 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thornley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 1998</LINK>). Standardised collection of outcomes as suggested by the COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) Initiative, which is engaged in developing, applying, and promoting core outcomes sets (COS), using rigorous consensus methods, for effectiveness trials (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2012</LINK>) could be helpful. The sample size should be carefully estimated on the basis of the available evidence and the expected effect, in order to protect the study against random error.</P>
<P>During the current update, we noticed a clear reduction in the number of publications testing SSRIs and SNRIs in the prophylaxis of migraine. For several clinically relevant outcomes, we reported a low level of evidence. This indicates that "further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate" (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>). Under this assumption, amitriptyline could still be suggested as a reference comparator to be used in clinical trials comparing antidepressants for prevention of migraine. The limited number of studies on SNRIs retrieved by this review may suggest that further exploration of the role of these drugs, such as duloxetine, is needed in migraine prevention. However, overall, we think that the value of new studies comparing different antidepressants in this setting is questionable. A randomised controlled trial comparing a SSRI or a SNRI versus another drug or another non-pharmacological intervention is not a priority in the migraine research pipeline and might not exert a significant impact on the overall evidence. Other preventive strategies are likely to be the target of future research. In the field of antidepressants, exploring the efficacy and safety SSRIs or SNRIs in depressed patients with migraine might be of greater interest, as optimal treatments and the role of weak antidepressants are still debatable.</P>
