Risk-reducing mastectomy could include either surgically removing both breasts to prevent breast cancer (bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy or BRRM), or removing the disease-free breast in women who have had breast cancer in one breast to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in the other breast (contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy or CRRM). The evidence is current to July 2016.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>The BRRM studies reported that it reduced the incidence of breast cancer or the number of deaths or both, but many of the studies have methodological limitations. After BRRM, most women are satisfied with their decision, but reported less satisfaction with cosmetic results, body image, and sexual feelings. One of the complications of RRM was the need for additional unanticipated surgeries, particularly in women undergoing reconstruction after RRM. However, most women also experienced reduced worry of developing and dying from breast cancer along with diminished satisfaction with body image and sexual feelings</P><P>In women who have had cancer in one breast, removing the other breast (CRRM) may reduce the incidence of cancer in that other breast, but there is insufficient evidence that this improves survival because of the continuing risk of recurrence or metastases from the original cancer.</P><P>While published observational studies demonstrated that BRRM was effective in reducing both the incidence of, and death from, breast cancer, more rigorous prospective studies are suggested. BRRM should be considered only among those at high risk of disease, for example, carriers of mutations in the breast cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. CRRM was shown to reduce the incidence of contralateral breast cancer (CBC), but there is insufficient evidence that CRRM improves survival, and studies that control for multiple variables that can affect results are recommended. It is possible that selection bias in terms of healthier, younger women being recommended for or choosing CRRM produces better overall survival numbers for CRRM.</P><P><B>Quality of evidence</B></P><P>Just over half of the studies were found to have a low risk of selection bias, that is, studies adjusting for systematic differences in prognosis or treatment responsiveness between the groups, and similarly, 60% had a low risk of detection bias, that is, studies considered systematic differences in the ways the outcomes were measured and detected. The primary cause for both selection bias and detection bias was not controlling for all major confounding factors, e.g., risk factors or having bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (BRRSO - surgery to remove fallopian tubes and ovaries) in the subject and control groups. Performance bias (validation of the risk-reducing mastectomy) was not problematic, as most studies were based on surgical reports; three relied on self-reports and eight were unclear because of multiple sources of data and/or broad timeframe. Attrition bias was at high risk or unclear in approximately 13% of the studies. The mean or median follow-up period reported was from 1 - 22 years.</P><P><B>Conclusions</B></P><P>Given the number of women who may be over-treated with BRRM/CRRM, it is critical that women and clinicians understand the true risk for each individual woman before considering surgery. Additionally, thought should be given to other options to reduce breast cancer risk, such as BRRSO and chemoprevention, when considering RRM.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-02-10 03:08:38 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-12-07 07:46:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Recent progress in understanding the genetic basis of breast cancer and widely publicized reports of celebrities undergoing risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) have increased interest in RRM as a method of preventing breast cancer.

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy worldwide for women, with an estimated number of incident cases in 2012 of around 1.7 million, and is the most common cancer in women in both high-income, and middle- and lower-income regions in the world (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2012</LINK>). For those with BRCA1/2 mutations, the risks are higher than for the average woman; <LINK REF="REF-Kuchenbaecker-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuchenbaecker 2017</LINK> reported that "the cumulative breast cancer risk to age 80 years was 72% (95% CI 65% to 79%) for BRCA1 and 69% (95% CI 61% to 77%) for BRCA2 carriers" in a large study with subjects from multiple western countries. The Global Cancer Observatory data as of 2012 show that the estimated age-standardized rate of incident cases of breast cancer has been increasing across most countries that submit data to it; however, at the same time, the estimated age-standardized rate of deaths from breast cancer has been decreasing for most countries that submit data to the Global Cancer Observatory.</P><P>More recent data for selected countries show that breast cancer is still a major issue. The American Cancer Society estimates for 2017 that new cases of breast cancer for both sexes combined in the USA will be about 255,000, which will be the highest for all cancer types. The estimated deaths for 2017 in the USA will be about 41,000, which will be the fourth highest among all cancer types (<LINK REF="REF-ACS-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACS 2017</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-02-10 04:25:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Recent progress in understanding the genetic basis of certain breast cancers has led to increased interest in predicting breast cancer development and identifying women at high risk through the use of molecular methods. Women at high risk are particularly interested in preventing or reducing the risk of the subsequent development of breast cancer. Risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) is among the alternatives usually offered for this purpose. The most relevant change since this review was originally published is the widespread availability and increase in use of genetic testing for women seeking information on their breast cancer risk.</P><P>High-risk women, who have no previous personal history of breast cancer, may consider bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM) as a means of primary prevention of the disease. A woman's decision to have BRRM is found to be strongly correlated with her BRCA1 or 2 mutation test results and with a physician's recommendation to have genetic testing or BRRM (<LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 2004</LINK>).</P><P>Likewise, women who were previously diagnosed with a breast cancer in one breast and thus are at higher risk of developing a primary cancer in the other (contralateral) breast, may consider risk-reducing mastectomy of that breast (CRRM) as an option to prevent the occurrence of a second breast cancer. The risk of contralateral breast cancer in women with hereditary/familial non-BRCA1/2 primary breast cancer is five times greater than the expected incidence based on SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results collected in the USA) data (<LINK REF="REF-Shadehi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shadehi 2005</LINK>). In addition, a study of 6294 participants diagnosed under 50 years of age reported, &#8220;Age at first breast cancer is a strong risk factor for cumulative contralateral breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers." and "Those diagnosed before age 41 years had a 10-year cumulative contralateral breast cancer risk of 23.9% (BRCA1: 25.5%; BRCA2: 17.2%) compared with 12.6% (BRCA1: 15.6%; BRCA2: 7.2%) for those 41 to 49 years of age (P = .02)&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Broek-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Broek 2016</LINK>). However, if there is no family history of breast cancer, the incidence of contralateral breast cancer is a rare event estimated to occur in 2.7% of women with breast cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Herrinton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Herrinton 2005</LINK>) after 4.8 years of follow-up.</P><P>In the past, RRM has been performed on women with any family history of breast cancer, painful breasts, cancer phobia, and history of breast biopsies (with or without proliferating disease). Recently, consideration for the procedure has tended to focus on women at high risk as determined by the identified presence of genetic mutations of the BRCA1 or 2 genes, both of which are associated with increased risk of breast cancer, or by statistical models of risk such as the Gail model (<LINK REF="REF-Gail-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gail 1994</LINK>) or other methods of estimating susceptibility. Much of the data used in this review did not allow subset identification by genetic testing.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-02-10 03:21:17 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>As a preventive measure, risk-reducing mastectomy remains controversial. Potential benefits include a reduction of risk of breast cancer and increase in psychological peace of mind. Potential disadvantages include the invasiveness of the procedure and consequent morbidity, as well as diminished satisfaction with body image and reduced tactile sensations in the breast. A paradox now exists in which the surgical management of invasive breast cancer has become less radical, with many women opting for breast-conserving surgery, while removal of the breast is used for breast cancer prevention. Furthermore, no mastectomy can remove all breast tissue, and therefore cannot eliminate all risk of breast cancer, even if this surgery is shown to be effective in reducing one's risk. In addition, RRM may cause significant physical morbidity or affect women's quality of life, or both. Because no test is available that can determine which women will actually develop breast cancer in the absence of RRM, it is likely that many individuals will undergo RRM needlessly. Also, RRM is not the only alternative for women at high risk of breast cancer. Other possible options of variable demonstrated efficacy include one, or a combination of chemoprevention with drugs such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, close surveillance with frequent clinical examinations and imaging studies, or oophorectomy (removal of ovaries) (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heemskerk_x002d_Gerritsen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Heemskerk-Gerritsen 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ingham-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ingham 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Metcalfe-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metcalfe 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Sprundel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Van Sprundel 2005</LINK>).</P><P>Given the drastic and irreversible nature of RRM, it is essential that women contemplating this procedure be able to make informed decisions based upon the best available evidence, consider both the benefits and limitations of the procedure, and weigh the risks and benefits of other alternatives. RRM can have a negative impact on self-esteem, sexual relations and satisfaction with body appearance (<LINK REF="STD-Brandberg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Brandberg 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brandberg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandberg 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bresser--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bresser 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frost-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Frost 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frost-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Frost 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gahm-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gahm 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gopie-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gopie 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unukovych-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Unukovych 2012</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-01-31 20:13:44 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review evaluates the existing research literature on the effectiveness of RRM in terms of overall mortality, breast cancer mortality, breast cancer incidence, disease-free survival, physical morbidity, and quality of life among both disease-free women and women with disease in one breast who had elective RRM in the other, non-diseased breast.

We obtained copies of the reports that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria for closer examination, and two members of the group examined each one.

Therefore, we presented information separately on these groups.</P></DATA_EXTRACTION><QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2018-03-20 20:30:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson"><P>There were no randomized studies included in this review. Therefore, three domains of bias typically included in a Cochrane Review - adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding - are not applicable to this review (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Rather, three review authors assessed the methodological quality of the included studies to determine whether or not the methods used sufficiently minimized selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, and attrition bias (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2002</LINK>). We defined selection bias as systematic differences between comparison groups in prognosis or responsiveness to treatment. Typically, randomization is the method used to reduce selection bias. However, in observational studies, controlling for variables that may influence the results is the major way to reduce selection bias. We defined performance bias as systematic differences in care provided apart from the intervention being evaluated and detection bias as systematic differences between comparison groups in how outcomes were ascertained, diagnosed or verified. We defined attrition bias as systematic differences between comparison groups in withdrawals or exclusions of participants from the results of a study.</P><P>For studies with a comparison group (cohort studies or case series with a statistically modeled comparison group), we used the following questions to operationally apply the above definitions.</P><OL><LI>Selection bias: were key risk/protective factors (confounders/co-interventions) adjusted for to ensure comparability between groups? We identified key risk/protective factors from review articles on the topic. For breast cancer incidence, <LINK REF="REF-Lise-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lise 1997</LINK> proposed the following as important factors: age, number of biopsies and histological status of previous biopsies, family history, use of other preventive options such as tamoxifen or oophorectomy, BRCA (breast cancer gene mutation) status, LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ) status. For mortality, <LINK REF="REF-Chang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2003</LINK> proposed the following as important prognostic variables: age, stage at diagnosis, treatment, ER (estrogen receptor) status, HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) status, and number of positive nodes. For incidence in contralateral studies, which is substantially affected by the features of the previous cancer, <LINK REF="REF-Eisen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisen 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 1996</LINK> considered the following to be important variables: stage of the previous carcinoma and the presence of multifocal (two or more individual cancers in one breast) breast cancer in the ipsilateral (same) breast, carcinoma in situ, atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia in the remaining breast, strong family history of breast cancer, and BRCA mutation status, if known. For psychosocial studies, in which there are fewer known factors associated with RRM and outcome, we deemed the pre-existence of psychological morbidity as the major variable.</LI><LI>Performance bias: was the intervention (RRM) confirmed in an objective way (i.e. medical or surgical records) and not determined exclusively by self-report?</LI><LI>Detection bias: was the outcome assessed in a valid way (e.g. validated pre/post instruments for psychosocial measures, medical records for incidence, medical/death records for vital status) and in the same way for both groups? Were the outcome assessors masked to the treatment that each participant received?</LI><LI>Attrition bias: was there a low dropout rate or were dropouts/withdrawals sufficiently accounted for, or both, so that the reviewer was convinced that differential reasons for dropping out did not occur?</LI></OL><P>For studies without a comparison group (convenience samples or case series without statistically modeled comparison groups), assessment questions for performance bias, detection bias and attrition bias remained the same. However, selection bias is a term that specifically pertains to assessing comparability between groups. Because there were no comparison groups in these studies, we used the term 'preferential selection' for selection bias, so as not to confuse the terminology with 'selection bias' used in studies with a comparison group. Item 1, preferential selection, asked the following question: was there evidence of a consecutive sample, or a clearly defined patient population (e.g. patients at a particular clinic at a particular time period) or some other method to minimize the chance that clinicians preferentially selected patients with favorable outcomes or that patients with better outcomes volunteered (healthy volunteer bias)?</P><P>From these checklists representing the four possible sources of bias, at least two review authors rated all studies on all items.

It should be noted that the women selecting CRRM may have had less comorbidity, as they had a 27% lower risk of death from other causes than the women who did not select CRRM. CRRM compared to no CRRM was associated with improved disease-specific survival and greater overall survival in <LINK REF="STD-Kruper-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kruper 2014</LINK>. Removing the contralateral breast cancer cases from the analysis had little impact on CRRM disease-specific survival and overall survival, suggesting that prevention of contralateral breast cancer by CRRM does not explain the observed survival benefit. Also, differences across groups in overall survival were greater than group differences in disease-free survival, consistent with selection bias. Therefore, it is possible that the observed survival benefits might be the result of healthier people choosing or being recommended for CRRM rather than the actual benefit of CRRM over single-treatment mastectomy. <LINK REF="STD-Jatoi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jatoi 2014</LINK> found that CRRM was associated with lower all-cause, breast-cancer specific, and non-cancer mortality, which persisted after adjusting for stage.

Therefore, although women with CRRM had apparently reduced breast-cancer and non-breast-cancer mortality, the result is potentially confounded by concomitant BRRSO and the differences in median follow-up (8.8 years for the CRRM group and 7.3 years for the non-RRM group). <LINK REF="STD-Heemskerk_x002d_Gerritsen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Heemskerk-Gerritsen 2015</LINK> found mortality was lower in the CRRM group (19 in CRRM versus 65 in controls), and Cox analysis yielded a HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.82) adjusted for BRRSO.</P><P>Thus, most CRRM studies failed to control for most prognostic factors regardless of the differences in baseline prognostic factors that were noted between CRRM and non-CRRM participants.

Dissatisfaction with the decision to have BRRM was correlated in two studies with either the discussion being initiated by the physician or the physician's advice to have BRRM being the primary deciding factor for the woman. Again, because decision satisfaction data were only collected postsurgically, we do not know the extent to which recall bias or cognitive dissonance influenced dissatisfied participants' recollections of the physician's role in decision-making. This correlation between regret and physician's role was not found to be true in the one CRRM study (<LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 1999</LINK>) that looked at regrets.

Two older studies included women who would no longer be considered high risk (<LINK REF="STD-Horton-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Horton 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennisi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pennisi 1989</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Borgen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Borgen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 1999</LINK>) recruited participants from adverts in the public press, and therefore posed the risk of healthy volunteer bias. The selection criteria for controls in a study by <LINK REF="STD-Rebbeck-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rebbeck 2004</LINK> had a risk for selection bias; 25 women were excluded from <LINK REF="STD-Geiger-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Geiger 2007</LINK> because their physicians declined to give approval for their recruitment. A study by <LINK REF="STD-Pennisi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pennisi 1989</LINK> had a 30% attrition rate, posing the possibility of attrition bias; participant numbers responding to questionnaires in <LINK REF="STD-Brandberg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Brandberg 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gahm-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gahm 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Geiger-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Geiger 2007</LINK> were variable for unknown reasons. <LINK REF="STD-Brandberg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Brandberg 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klijn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klijn 2004</LINK> (a follow-up to <LINK REF="STD-Meijers_x002d_Heijboer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Meijers-Heijboer 2001</LINK>), and <LINK REF="STD-Skytte-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Skytte 2011</LINK> all included patients with BRRSO, which posed a risk for detection bias. However, this possible bias was adjusted for in <LINK REF="STD-Ingham-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ingham 2013</LINK> by using matched analysis, so that the effects of BRRSO on survival could be accounted for.

Much of the data used in this review did not allow subset identification by genetic testing, although a number of studies included participants who had been or considered being tested for BRCA1/2 mutations. As expected, our systematic review on BRRM did not identify any randomized controlled trials, nor is it likely that there will be any in the future, as probably few women would agree to be randomized to either BRRM or surveillance. Although not optimal in terms of the reliability and validity of the information collected, a number of non-randomized studies were available to assist women in assessing the effectiveness of the procedure.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy incidence and mortality</HEADING><P>Studies of CRRM were also subject to methodological limitations leading to selection, detection, or attrition bias.

The CRRM cohort in <LINK REF="STD-Boughey-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Boughey 2010</LINK> all had a family history of breast cancer, but only 34.8% of the non-CRRM cohort did, and the proportion of those with first-degree family history was also skewed (46.2% in the CRRM cohort versus 21.6% in the non-CRRM cohort). <LINK REF="STD-Zeichner-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zeichner 2014</LINK> had significant differences in the length of follow-up in the two groups, with 95.2% of CRRM participants followed for three to 13 years versus 30% of the no-CRRM participants.</P><P>There is potential selection bias in <LINK REF="STD-Metcalfe-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Metcalfe 2014</LINK>, as some of the contralateral breast cancer cases were diagnosed within one to two months (0.01 years) of original diagnosis of breast cancer, less than the commonly used second new breast cancer diagnoses at six months or less, and more correctly should be classified as bilateral breast cancer.

The state of the science is far from exact in predicting who will develop or die from breast cancer. By one estimate, most high-risk women (determined by strong family history but not necessarily BRCA1/2 mutation carriers) who had BRRM would not have died from breast cancer even without the surgery.</P><P>BRRM is a radical surgical procedure to be considered only by those women at high risk, as it is not a procedure that should be routinely considered by women with an average risk of breast cancer. Even for BRCA mutation carriers, BRRM needs to be presented as an option along with other risk-management strategies including risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), chemoprevention and breast screening. BRRM clearly reduces the incidence of breast cancer, but women also need to understand the risks, including psychological and physical harms.</P><P>Given the number of women who may be overtreated with BRRM or contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy (CRRM), it is critical that women and clinicians understand the true risk for each individual woman before considering surgery, especially in consideration of comorbidities or lifestyle choices, or both. The paradox is that many women with breast cancer have breast-conserving surgery, while BRRM removes the breasts of those who do not have breast cancer.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy</HEADING><P>For women who have already been diagnosed with a primary tumor, the data show a reduction of incidence of contralateral breast cancer following CRRM. While it appears that CRRM reduces the incidence of cancer in the contralateral breast, there is limited evidence about whether, and for whom, CRRM may actually improve survival. There is increasing evidence that the survival data may be skewed by the evidence that women who have CRRM may be younger and healthier, with fewer comorbidities, than those who have unilateral treatment mastectomies only. The amount and quality of information given to women about CRRM should be improved in order to allow women consider properly the risk of mortality from contralateral disease versus from their primary breast cancer and mortality from tumor metastases.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Psychological and physical morbidity</HEADING><P>The women who selected BRRM tended to be more anxious and more likely to believe it was inevitable that they would develop breast cancer. The surgery tended to reduce anxiety in these women. Understanding their true risk may reduce the anxiety and perception of inevitability of some of these women. Genetic counselling about risk can also change risk perception.</P><P>Regarding psychosocial outcomes, women generally reported satisfaction with their decision to have risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM), but were less consistently favorable regarding the cosmetic outcome. Often, diminished cosmetic satisfaction was associated with surgical complications or reconstruction, or both. Therefore, physical morbidity, lifestyle choices and postoperative surgical complications are factors that should not be overlooked when making a decision about RRM.</P><P>With regards to emotional well-being, most women recover well postoperatively, reporting reduced cancer worry and showing reduced psychological morbidity from their baseline measures, but exceptions were also noted. Of the psychosocial outcomes measured, body image and feelings of femininity were the most often adversely affected.</P><P>Beyond the informational needs, there is an emotional dimension to RRM, and <LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 2000</LINK> suggests psychological support should be part of the entire process from decision making to resuming life after surgery. Psychosocial outcomes may have long-term effects, even in women who report satisfaction with their decision. Some of these women may have negative psychosocial outcomes, and this dichotomy should be considered by healthcare professionals when making decisions with individual women. These views are supported by findings that there are some differences between women who select BRRM (acceptors) and those that consider it but do not choose to have BRRM (decliners). Those selecting BRRM exhibited more anxiety-relieving behavior, were more anxious and were more likely to feel it was inevitable that they would get breast cancer than decliners.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Decision making</HEADING><P>Any woman with increased risk of breast cancer should consider having a discussion about the options and benefits of RRM, including her absolute risk of breast cancer, the benefits of RRM, and the potential harms (multiple surgeries, surgical complications, the possibility of chronic pain, impact on sexual function, and possible poor cosmetic outcome). The most important practice implications of these findings are that providers should offer understandable and complete information for women who are making their decision about whether to have RRM, and should ensure psychosocial support for the woman throughout the process. With genetic testing becoming more accessible, it will become even more important for clinicians to help women understand their lifetime risk of breast cancer and to counsel them on the benefits and harms of RRM. Women also need to understand that most women diagnosed with early breast cancer do not die from breast cancer, but the treatment required to achieve a cure can be quite extensive with many side effects.</P><P>Information on RRM and reconstruction is often given to women at the moment that the urge to survive predominates. It is possible that the "urge to reduce anxiety, remain healthy and survive" outweighs the possible negative outcomes of RRM and reconstruction (<LINK REF="STD-Bresser--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bresser 2006</LINK>). Also, &#8220;&#8230;the internet, combined with celebrity endorsements, has made the option of [RRM and] breast reconstruction more socially acceptable and an alternative to lifelong screening for many women&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Barry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barry 2011</LINK>).</P><P>Studies show that many women considering RRM can highly overestimate their risk of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Metcalfe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metcalfe 2002</LINK>). Women considering BRRM should not only understand the risk of breast cancer, but also understand that many women having BRRM would not have died from breast cancer even without having the surgery. Women considering CRRM after a primary diagnosis of breast cancer should understand that there are few, good, long-term data to indicate that CRRM, in and of itself, will improve survival. In a study of why women chose CRRM, <LINK REF="REF-Yao-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yao 2016</LINK> said: &#8220;The most common reason that women choose CPM [CRRM] is based on misperceptions about CPM&#8217;s effect on survival and overestimation of their contralateral breast cancer risk.&#8221; Given the available evidence, if RRM is considered at all, it should only be considered by women at high risk, e.g., BRCA mutation carriers with high-penetrance mutations.".</P><P>There is often confusion about what 'risk' means for those women considering RRM, especially the difference between absolute risk and relative risk. It is important, therefore, that risk is translated into understandable terminology. With the field of breast cancer treatment changing rapidly, knowing her risk of developing the disease in the next 10 years might help a woman decide whether to have RRM now or postpone her decision for a few years to see what new preventions or treatments might become available. Consideration of other possible options of variable demonstrated efficacy, for example, tamoxifen, BRRSO, or simply surveillance, may also play a role in decision making.</P><P>In the end, this is a highly personal decision. Also, because both subcutaneous and total mastectomies result in incomplete removal of all breast tissue, women need to know that breast cancer can still occur after RRM (<LINK REF="REF-Eisen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisen 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Ghosh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghosh 2002</LINK> suggests "risk-reducing mastectomy" is a better term than "prophylactic mastectomy", since 'risk-reducing' implies a reduction of risk rather than elimination of risk as prophylactic does (in the older studies in this review, the term 'prophylactic' is used, but risk-reducing is now considered the proper term). Finally, women need to know that morbidity resulting in unanticipated reoperations is not uncommon with RRM.</P><P>For some women, avoiding the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of breast cancer is just as important as avoiding death from breast cancer. Many women overestimate their risk of dying from breast cancer, and many women underestimate the morbidity from RRM with or without reconstruction; clinicians need to help women understand the risks in order to make informed decisions. A decision aid to help women considering RRM weigh the benefits and harms of the options as they pertain to her, would be of tremendous help to these women.</P></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-20 20:28:03 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson"><P>The benefits of BRRM relative to chemoprevention are unclear because there are no prospective, randomized trials comparing the two. This is also the case for CRRM; <LINK REF="STD-Bedrosian--2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bedrosian 2010</LINK> stated that &#8220;&#8230;despite these efforts, a causal relationship between survival and CRRM cannot be proved, that is only possible in a randomized controlled trial, unlikely to be completed in the foreseeable future.&#8221; While others call for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Palmieri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmieri 1999</LINK>), it is very unlikely that a RCT will ever be conducted given the radical nature of the procedure.</P><P>In the absence of RCTs, research can be improved by the use of population-based, prospective data that are collected on all women, such as in the Scandinavian prospective cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-Meijers_x002d_Heijboer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Meijers-Heijboer 2001</LINK>). Such studies should adequately adjust for other variables that may influence the outcome, include morbidity data, confounding therapies, and have sufficient follow-up time. As a short-term goal, authors of the included studies are encouraged to update their findings and control for major confounders in the analyses, a major limitation of the published studies thus far. Studies of the effectiveness of RRM with and without RRSO need to be conducted, the data separated out and controlled for in future studies or analyses.</P><P>Physical morbidity was not uncommon following RRM, and many women underwent unanticipated reoperations, usually due to problems with reconstruction. These data should be updated to reflect changes in surgical procedures and reconstruction. Patient satisfaction was the least favorable regarding feeling of support provided by healthcare practitioners when providing risk assessment information. Further research needs to focus on how to make this information more understandable and how to minimize patients' stress when receiving it.</P><P>Establishing a RRM registry that includes all cases of RRM and certain details about those undergoing the procedure has been proposed by some as a way to glean important RRM information in the absence of a RCT. Without adequate legal protections, inclusion in such a registry could have adverse consequences for participants (and possibly their families) with respect to insurance and employment discrimination; however, with the establishment of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) regulations, the passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) in 2008, and the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010 in the USA, these concerns have been somewhat addressed and diminished. Similar legal issues could exist for the establishment of a tissue bank in conjunction with a registry that would shed light on whether certain mutations are most likely to manifest in breast cancer in spite of RRM. However, RRM and tissue bank registries could help relieve some of the inconsistencies in reporting of procedures and outcomes in published articles. We have found it difficult in some cases to determine if follow-up reports are truly a continuation of the same participant group or not.</P><P>Prospective studies that collect baseline information prior to the intervention using validated instruments are needed to better understand the psychological impact of RRM. There also needs to be more understanding of the emotional impact on women of having the surgery in order to better support those women who choose it. As <LINK REF="STD-Brandberg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Brandberg 2008</LINK> noted, &#8220;One drawback of this study is that cancer-specific worries were not measured, an important issue when assessing distress among women with hereditary cancer syndromes.&#8221; Future research could also focus on developing a screening tool that can predict those who are at risk for high emotional distress and, hence, may need additional supportive services.</P><P>Little is reported about the psychosocial impact of BRRM and CRRM on the people who have primary relationships with women undergoing the surgery. While a high-risk woman may accept and adjust to the cosmetic and sexuality side effects of RRM because of the peace of mind it offers, how her partner adjusts is unknown. Future studies should include interviews with those in primary relationships with women undergoing RRM. Finally, the study finding by <LINK REF="STD-Josephson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Josephson 2000</LINK> that most women were dissatisfied with the psychological support provided by healthcare personnel during risk counselling demonstrated that little is known about what creates an optimal counselling and decision-making environment.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-02-04 04:12:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Assistance provided to the Review author team for the original review can be viewed in <LINK REF="REF-Lostumbo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lostumbo 2010</LINK>.
