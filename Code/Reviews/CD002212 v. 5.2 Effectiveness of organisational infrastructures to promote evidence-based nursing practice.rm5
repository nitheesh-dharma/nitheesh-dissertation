<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-03 11:27:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nurses and midwives form the bulk of the clinical health workforce, and play a central role in all health service delivery. There is potential to improve health care quality if nurses routinely use the best available evidence in their clinical practice. Since many of the factors perceived by nurses as barriers to the implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP) lie at the organisational level, it is of interest to devise and assess the effectiveness of models to change healthcare organisations in order to promote the use of EBP among nurses successfully.</P>
<P>We defined organisational infrastructures as being "the underlying foundation or basic framework through which clinical care is delivered and supported", which include for example: organisational policies, nurse development units and other types of organisational developments such as organisations developing and implementing evidence-based nursing procedures, standards or guidelines for clinical practice.</P>
<P>We searched the literature for robust evaluations of the effectiveness of organisational interventions in promoting EBP in nursing. We included one study from the USA which involved one hospital and for which the number of nurses was not reported. The study evaluated the effects of a standardised evidence-based nursing procedure on improved nursing care for patients at risk of developing healthcare-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs), as measured by the HAPU rate. If a patient's admission Braden score was lower than or equal to 18, nurses were authorised to initiate a prevention pressure ulcer care bundle, without a physician order. The Braden scale is a tool used to assess a patient's risk of developing pressure ulcers. An adult with a score below or equal to 18 is considered to have a high risk for developing a pressure ulcer.</P>
<P>Re-analysis of the HAPU data, as an interrupted time series, was suggestive of a trend in rates prior to intervention and, if that trend was assumed to be real, there was no evidence of an intervention effect at three months (mean rate per quarter 0.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 3.3; P = 0.457). Given the small percentages post intervention it was not statistically possible to extrapolate effects beyond three months.</P>
<P>Considering the importance placed on organisational change in promoting EBP in nursing, it is surprising that eight years after the previous empty Cochrane review was published, appropriately evaluated organisational infrastructure interventions are still lacking. If policy-makers and healthcare organisations wish to promote evidence-based nursing at an organisational level successfully, they must ensure the funding and conduct of well-designed studies to generate evidence to guide policy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-04 04:33:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nurses, like other health professionals, do not always use the best available evidence in their clinical practice and hence patients do not always receive the best possible care (<LINK REF="REF-Grol-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grol 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schuster-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuster 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seddon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seddon 2001</LINK>). Several large studies, investigating barriers to the implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP), emphasise the importance of changes in the infrastructures of healthcare organisations (e.g. policy and procedure changes) in order to achieve successful promotion of EBP in nursing (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Funk-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Funk 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horsley-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horsley 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pravikoff-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pravikoff 2005</LINK>).There is interest among healthcare providers and policy-makers in knowing how best to support evidence-based nursing at an organisational level, in order to improve the effectiveness and quality of care.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Definitions</HEADING>
<P>We define organisational infrastructures as "the underlying foundation or basic framework through which clinical care is delivered and supported" (<LINK REF="REF-Foxcroft-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foxcroft 2003</LINK>). Organisational infrastructures can take many forms. They include, for example: organisational policies, management frameworks (e.g. shared governance), skill mix (e.g. the proportion of different nursing grades, and levels of qualification, expertise and experience), nurse development units, research and development support systems, clinical supervision programmes (e.g. formal organisation-wide mentoring programmes), clinical effectiveness structures and support systems, continuous quality improvement programmes and, for example, organisations developing evidence-based nursing procedures/standards/guidelines for clinical practice and implementing these.</P>
<P>We adopted a commonly used definition of EBP which describes it as "a problem solving approach to clinical care that incorporates the conscientious use of current best evidence from well-designed studies, a clinician's expertise, and patient values and preferences" (<LINK REF="REF-Melnyk-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melnyk 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sackett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-03 11:28:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most nurses do not routinely implement EBP (<LINK REF="REF-Pravikoff-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pravikoff 2005</LINK>), even though there is evidence that EBP improves patient outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Heater-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heater 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melnyk-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melnyk 2005</LINK>). The reasons why nurses do not always use the best evidence in their clinical practice are manifold and lie at different levels. Twenty years ago, Funk carried out a large study that involved the development and application of a tool for assessing barriers to nurses adopting EBP (<LINK REF="REF-Funk-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Funk 1991</LINK>). Drawing upon ideas by Rogers on innovation diffusion (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2003</LINK>), he clustered barriers to research utilisation into four major themes: characteristics of the adopter; characteristics of the innovation; characteristics of the communication; and characteristics of the organisation. The results of Funk&#8217;s study highlighted two main barriers: nurses had insufficient authority to change patient care procedures, and there was a general lack of awareness of relevant research. The work by Funk, and the importance it places on organisational factors, complements an earlier American initiative, the 'Conduct and Utilization of Research in Nursing' (CURN) project (<LINK REF="REF-Horsley-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horsley 1983</LINK>), which focused specifically on the responsibility of the nursing department for the activities involved in making research-based practice changes. In taking an organisational view of the processes involved in practice change, the authors made it clear that they were not negating the positive impact of individual nurses (<LINK REF="REF-Horsley-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horsley 1983</LINK>). Indeed, they recognised that developments such as policy and procedure changes are of paramount importance and are "generally beyond the control of individuals per se" (<LINK REF="REF-Horsley-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horsley 1983</LINK>, p22). Recent studies agree with previous results, i.e. that organisational factors, such as insufficient authority to change practice, time constraints, lack of support for implementation of research findings (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutchison-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchison 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fineout_x002d_Overholt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fineout-Overholt 2005</LINK>) and the "presence of other goals with higher priority" (<LINK REF="REF-Pravikoff-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pravikoff 2005</LINK>) are perceived by nurses as the greatest barriers to the implementation of EBP.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-03 11:28:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The process of knowledge translation is slow, i.e. the translation of research findings into practice (<LINK REF="REF-Balas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2003</LINK>) and therefore several nursing models aiming to speed up this process have been developed during the last two decades (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The ARCC model (Advancing Research and Clinical Practice through Close Collaboration) (<LINK REF="REF-Melnyk-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melnyk 2002</LINK>), the Clinical Scholar Model (<LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2005</LINK>) and the Iowa model (<LINK REF="REF-Titler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Titler 2002</LINK>) are all organisational models. A central concept in the ARCC model is that of an EBP mentor, an advanced nurse with in-depth clinical knowledge and EBP skills, who provides mentorship in EBP implementation and outcomes management projects, thereby improving quality of care and patient outcomes. The Clinical Scholar Model reinforces the intellectual process of EBP, building a cadre of mentors who foster an environment in which staff nurses are encouraged to continuously ask questions, and for whom the Clinical Scholar is a role model (<LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2005</LINK>). The Iowa model suggests a team-based approach in the implementation of EBP (<LINK REF="REF-Titler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Titler 1994</LINK>). Other models, e.g. the Rosswurm and Larrabee model (<LINK REF="REF-Rosswurm-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosswurm 1999</LINK>) and the Stetler model (<LINK REF="REF-Stetler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stetler 2001</LINK>), may be used both at an individual and an organisational level. However, all these models have yet to be rigorously evaluated.</P>
<P>In addition to the nursing models, specific factors that may be used to speed up the knowledge translation process have been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Melnyk-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melnyk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melnyk-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melnyk 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Omery-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omery 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2005</LINK>). The factors, which may be used within healthcare organisations as well as within academic or research environments, have been summarised by Fineout-Overholt and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Fineout_x002d_Overholt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fineout-Overholt 2005</LINK>). These include EBP mentors in healthcare settings, partnerships between clinical and academic settings, EBP champions within the environment, clearly written research support, time and resources, and administrative support. Building on the ARCC model, the authors also suggest some specific strategies for accelerating the use of EBP: development and implementation of EBP rounds, plans for outcomes evaluation, evidence-based journal clubs, a written organisational philosophy, professional advancement systems, as well as awards for successful EBP implementation. These strategies, however, have not yet been evaluated.</P>

<P>Nurses and midwives form the bulk of the clinical health workforce and play a central role in all health service delivery (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). There is therefore potential to improve health care quality if nurses routinely use the best available evidence in their clinical practice. Since many of the factors perceived by nurses as barriers to the implementation of EBP in patient care lie at the organisational level (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Funk-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Funk 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horsley-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horsley 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pravikoff-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pravikoff 2005</LINK>), it is of great interest to devise and assess the effectiveness of models to change healthcare organisations in order to promote the use of EBP among nurses successfully.</P>
<P>Many systematic reviews of the effectiveness of professional interventions on clinical practice have already been undertaken by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. Although this work has included nursing, most of it has not been specific to nursing (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Flodgren-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flodgren 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGowan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGowan 2009</LINK>). Among nursing-specific studies, one review evaluated the introduction of clinical practice guidelines in professions allied to medicine, but its focus was on professional interventions rather than organisational infrastructures (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2009</LINK>). Another review focused on a single aspect of organisational infrastructures, i.e. on nursing record systems (<LINK REF="REF-Urquhart-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urquhart 2009</LINK>). There is, therefore, a need to look more broadly at organisational infrastructures that promote EBP in nursing as a whole, and to summarise the existing evidence base in order to inform healthcare providers and policy-makers of the best ways to promote EBP at an organisational level.</P>

<P>We developed new search strategies for this update because the strategy published in 2003 (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) omitted a number of key concepts. Strategies for English language databases (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) were developed by information specialists M Fiander and N Roberts; author MX Rojas developed strategies for Spanish language resources (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).

For the next update of this review, we will combine strategies A and B into a single strategy in order to improve precision and sensitivity.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Since the search strategies for this update changed significantly from those in the original review, we conducted retrospective searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE (e.g. from 1948 and 1950, respectively). Searches in other databases were limited from 1990 forward. We applied no language limits. We used two methodological search filters to limit retrieval to appropriate study designs in Strategy A: the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (<I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 6.4d (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2011</LINK>)) and the Cochrane EPOC Group Methodological Filter version 2.2; Strategy B used only portions of these filters, but the full filters per Strategy A are recommended for future updates.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study design, participants and settings</HEADING>
<P>We found only one low-quality study (re-analysed as an ITS) from the USA for inclusion in this review. The study involved the Washington hospital in Fremont, serving the whole of California. The number of nurses recruited to the study was not reported. No details of hospital or participant characteristics, or the number of patients affected by the study were provided.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Targeted behaviour</HEADING>
<P>The study evaluated the effects of a standardised evidence-based nursing procedure on nursing care provided to patients at risk of healthcare-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs), as measured by the HAPU rate. If a patient's admission Braden score (<LINK REF="REF-Bergstrom-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergstrom 1987</LINK>) was equal to or lower than 18 they were judged to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers.</P>
<P>The Braden scale is a tool used to assess a patient's risk of developing pressure ulcers by examining six criteria: sensory perception, the degree to which the skin is exposed to moisture, the individual's level of activity, the individual's ability to change positions, nutrition and the exposure to situations that can result in friction and shear to the skin. Each category is rated on a scale of 1 to 4, excluding the 'friction and shear' category which is rated on a 1 to 3 scale. This combines for a possible total of 23 points, with a higher score meaning a lower risk of developing a pressure ulcer. An adult with a score below 18 is considered to have a high risk for developing a pressure ulcer.</P>
<P>Nurses were authorised to initiate a pressure ulcer prevention bundle (i.e. a set of three to five evidence-based interventions/practices that when used together may result in significant improvement in patient outcomes), without waiting for a physician order (<LINK REF="STD-Shih-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shih 2010</LINK>). Strategies were developed to increase compliance in the implementation of the evidence-based nursing procedures to reduce the HAPU rate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>One outcome was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Shih-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shih 2010</LINK>: the quarterly HAPU rate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection</HEADING>
<P>HAPU data were collected by quarterly CALNOC (Collaborative Alliance for Nursing Outcomes) pressure ulcer prevalence study. CALNOC is a nursing quality database which measures patient outcomes to advance standards in patient care (<A HREF="https://www.calnoc.org/globalPages/mainpage.aspx">https://www.calnoc.org/globalPages/mainpage.aspx</A>). The main outcome (HAPU rate) was measured from January 2008 to September 2008 (pre-intervention period) and from October 2008 to March 2010 (post intervention period).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>After reviewing the literature, an evidence-based standardised nursing procedure was developed and implemented using different strategies to improve its use (i.e. staff education through posters, one to one peer teaching, elevator speech and documentation audits). The nursing procedure authorised nurses to initiate a pressure ulcer prevention bundle if a patient's Braden admission score was below or equal to 18 (<LINK REF="REF-Bergstrom-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergstrom 1987</LINK>), without waiting for a physician order. The pressure ulcer prevention bundle consisted of: (i) turning every two hours, (ii) utilising an air mattress overlay, (iii) assessing the patient&#8217;s pre-albumin level, (iv) initiating a wound care referral and/or a dietitian referral, and (v) ordering heel pressure relief devices and/or wheel chair cushion. Nurses were authorised to initiate these preventive actions without waiting for a physician order.</P>

<P>For the one included study (<LINK REF="STD-Shih-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shih 2010</LINK>) we judged the risk of bias as 'unclear' for most of the criteria due to the absence of information provided in the abstract (see 'Risk of bias' table within the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table). For one item there was high risk of bias: already before the intervention there was a statistically significant decrease in HAPU rate and therefore the intervention cannot be considered independent of other changes. One item was not applicable: the intervention effect was not pre-specified, since nothing was mentioned about what effect (a step change or change in slope) was expected for the outcome measure (HAPU rate). However, as the study authors did not specify this analysis, and the data were re-analysed by the review authors, this criteria cannot be reasonably applied.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-01-03 11:34:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Stefanie Linklater">
<P>Re-analysis of the HAPU data as an interrupted time series showed no statistically significant difference in slopes between the regression lines for the pre-intervention period (January 2008 to September 2008) and the post intervention period (October 2008 to March 2010) (mean rate per quarter 0.73%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to 1.84; P = 0.151).</P>
<P>The re-analysis was suggestive of a trend in rates prior to intervention (-1.1 %; 95% CI -2.1 to -0.03; P = 0.046) and, if that trend is assumed to be real, there was no evidence of an intervention effect at three months (mean rate 0.7%; 95% CI -1.7 to 3.3; P = 0.465). Given the small percentages post intervention it was not statistically possible to extrapolate effects beyond three months.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-01-06 09:56:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Stefanie Linklater">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-06 09:56:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Stefanie Linklater">
<P>We performed an extensive search of the literature for studies evaluating the effectiveness of organisational infrastructures to promote evidence-based nursing, including RCTs, ITSs, CBAs and CCTs. However, we found only one study from the USA that met our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Shih-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shih 2010</LINK>). Shih and colleagues evaluated the effects of introducing an evidence-based standardised nursing procedure at one hospital, aimed at improving the care provided to patients at risk of developing healthcare-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs). The results for the one participating hospital showed no evidence of an intervention effect at three months after implementation of the intervention.</P>
<P>Considering the importance placed on organisational change in promoting evidence-based nursing, it is surprising that eight years after the previous empty Cochrane review was published, appropriately evaluated organisational infrastructure interventions are still lacking. If policy-makers and healthcare organisations wish to promote evidence-based nursing at an organisational level successfully, they must ensure the funding and conduct of well-designed studies to generate evidence to guide policy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-01-03 11:34:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Stefanie Linklater">
<P>The evidence is incomplete and of very limited generalisability. With only one included study it is impossible to draw any clear conclusions about the effectiveness of organisational infrastructures in promoting evidence-based nursing. Shih et al reported only one outcome measure, the HAPU rate, when evaluating the effectiveness of the evidence-based standardised nursing procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Shih-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shih 2010</LINK>). No outcomes related to processes of care, to health care resource utilisation (e.g. length of stay), unintended/adverse effects (e.g. sepsis, mortality) or costs were reported.</P>
<P>A better description of the implementation strategies, the number of participating nurses and patients, as well as hospital and participant characteristics would have been useful not only for the interpretation of results, but to understand how the intervention was implemented.</P>
<P>Within the excluded studies there are many examples of researchers using inappropriate study designs in their attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of different organisational infrastructure interventions. Either the study includes too few intervention and control groups for it to be judged as eligible, or too few pre-intervention and post intervention data points to allow for an appropriate time series analysis. Some studies were not eligible due to only reporting self reported outcomes. Since the previous review was published in 2003, a number of new conceptual nursing models on organisational processes to promote evidence-based practice (EBP) have been added to the existing list of non-evaluated nursing models (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Censo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Censo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melnyk-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melnyk 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stetler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stetler 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Titler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Titler 2002</LINK>). The problem is thus not a lack of nursing models, or lack of studies aiming to evaluate the effects of different organisational interventions based on these models, but that the studies are at a high risk of bias or have not been designed to generate effectiveness data.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-10-25 05:52:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The little evidence we included in this review is at risk of bias. The re-analysed ITS scored unclear on the ITS risk of bias criteria, in part because the authors never intended it to be analysed as an ITS, but also because of the little information provided in the conference abstract.</P>

<P>We found only one eligible paper for inclusion in the review and therefore the review question remains unanswered. Healthcare organisations considering implementing and evaluating interventions aimed at changing organisational infrastructure should consider using a robust design (e.g. interrupted time series), preferably with at least two intervention and control sites, and at least three data points before and three data points after the intervention (i.e. complying with the Cochrane EPOC group quality criteria).</P>

<P>We only identified one eligible study, which was eligible only after the data were re-analysed as a time series. We excluded many studies due to inappropriate study design. If policy-makers and healthcare organisations wish to promote evidence-based nursing at an organisational level successfully, they must ensure that well-designed studies evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions. Below we outline key aspects of study design to be considered.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the 'gold standard' study design, should be used when possible</LI>
<LI>Controlled before and after studies (CBAs) should include at least two intervention and two control sites</LI>
<LI>Interrupted time series (ITSs) should have at least three data points before and three data points after the intervention to permit a time series analysis</LI>
<LI>ITSs should include at least two intervention sites</LI>

<P>
<B>Description of the intervention:</B>
</P>
<P>- After literature synthesis an evidence-based standardised nursing procedure (including a pressure ulcer prevention bundle) was developed and implemented</P>
<P>- Strategies used to improve the implementation of the intervention consisted of staff education through posters, one to one peer teaching, elevator speech and documentation audits</P>
<P>- If the patient's admission Braden score was &#8804;18, a prevention bundle could be initiated: nurses were authorised to initiate these preventive actions without waiting for a physician order</P>
<P>The Braden scale is a tool used to assess a patient's risk of developing pressure ulcers by examining 6 criteria: sensory perception, the degree to which the skin is exposed to moisture, the individual's level of activity, the individual's ability to change positions, nutrition and the exposure to situations that can result in friction and shear to the skin. Each category is rated on a scale of 1 to 4, excluding the 'friction and shear' category which is rated on a 1 to 3 scale. This combines for a possible total of 23 points, with a higher score meaning a lower risk of developing a pressure ulcer and vice versa. An adult with a score below 18 is considered to have a high risk for developing a pressure ulcer.</P>
<P>
<U>The pressure ulcer prevention bundle consisted of</U>: (i) turning every 2 hours, (ii) utilising an air mattress overlay, (iii) assessing the patient&#8217;s pre-albumin level, (iv) initiating a wound care referral and/or a dietitian referral, and (v) ordering heel pressure relief devices and/or wheel chair cushion</P>

<P>The Clinical Scholar Model: this model reinforces the intellectual process of EBP, building a cadre of mentors who foster an environment in which staff nurses are encouraged to continuously ask questions. Clinical scholars are bedside clinicians who challenge nurses practices through inquiry, observation, analysis and synthesis of internal data and published evidence, application of synthesised evidence, and evaluation of subsequent outcomes. Clinical scholars serve as role models in the ownership of their clinical practice. Inherent in the model is the final step, dissemination of findings from the projects and research accomplished by the clinic scholar team to team members and the healthcare public. Intrinsic to the model are collaboration, consultation and mentorship by a nurse scientist through every step of the educational and application processes.</P>
