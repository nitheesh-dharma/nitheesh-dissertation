<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Propentofylline is a novel putatively neuroprotective agent that acts by inhibiting the uptake of adenosine and blocking the enzyme phosphodiesterase. Although a number of randomized controlled trials have been undertaken, data were available from only a very limited number of these studies. These limited data suggest that propentofylline may have a beneficial effect on measures of cognitive and global function of people with Alzheimer's or vascular dementia. The unavailability of data, due to failure of Aventis, the manufacturing pharmaceutical company, to release information about unpublished studies prevented a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-04-16 14:37:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Propentofylline is a novel therapeutic agent for dementia that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and acts by blocking the uptake of adenosine and inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase. In vitro and in vivo its mechanism of action appears to be twofold; it inhibits the production of free radicals and reduces the activation of microglial cells. It therefore interacts with the inflammatory processes that are thought to contribute to dementia, and given its mechanism of action is a possible disease modifying agent rather than a purely symptomatic treatment.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of propentofylline for people with dementia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), <I>The Cochrane Library,</I> MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 10 January 2008 using the terms: propentofylline OR hextol OR karsivan. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources.</P>
<P>Aventis, the manufacturing pharmaceutical company, was asked for data from unpublished studies but declined to enter into correspondence. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Unconfounded double-blind randomized controlled trials of propentofylline compared with a placebo or another treatment group.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>There were detailed reports of only four of the nine included studies. The efficacy of propentofylline was reviewed for undifferentiated dementia as there were not enough data to attempt a subgroup analysis for the types of dementia.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-04-16 14:37:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>The following statistically significant treatment effects in favour of propentofylline are reported.<BR/>Cognition at 3, 6 and 12 months including MMSE at 12 months. [MD 1.2, 95%CI 0.12 to 2.28, P=0.03]<BR/>Severity of dementia at 3, 6 and 12 months including CGI at 12 months [MD -0.21, 95%CI -0.39 to -0.03, P=0.03].<BR/>Activities of Daily Living (NAB) at 6 and 12 months [MD -1.20, 95%CI -2.22 to -0.18, P=0.02].<BR/>Global Assessment (CGI) at 3 months [MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.21, P=0.0006], but not at later times.<BR/>Tolerability<BR/>There were minimal data on adverse effects and drop-outs. There were a statistically significant treatment effects in favour of placebo at 12 months, for the number of dropouts [OR=1.43, 95%CI 1.04 to 1.90, P=0.03].</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is limited evidence that propentofylline might benefit cognition, global function and activities of daily living of people with Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia. The meta-analyses reported here are far from satisfactory as a summary of the efficacy of propentofylline, considering the unpublished information on another 1200 patients in randomized trials that exists. Unfortunately Aventis has been unwilling to correspond with the authors, significantly limiting the scope of this review.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-16 14:41:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Dementia is a degenerative disease of the brain, resulting in a progressive disintegration of memory, intellect and personality. It may also be associated with psychiatric morbidity such as depression, anxiety and paranoid thoughts. Dementia is a disease of mid to late life, affecting 5% of people over 65 years increasing to 20% over the age of 80 years. Alzheimer's disease, the commonest cause of dementia, accounts for 70% of cases, while vascular dementia the second commonest cause, accounts for 20%. </P>
<P>The cholinergic deficit theory of Alzheimer's disease is well established. Cholinesterase inhibitor drugs are being developed to increase acetylcholine levels in the brain on the assumption that it may improve cognitive function. Donepezil and rivastigmine are two such drugs currently on the market. However, for vascular dementia, treatment to date has focused on reducing the risk factors for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Although the pathology of Alzheimer's disease appears to be distinct from that of vascular dementia, there are a number of features such as microglial proliferation and neuronal death, underlying both. A number of studies have suggested that inflammatory and vascular processes may be important in the pathogenesis of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Snowdon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snowdon 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bowen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Banati-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banati 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Propentofylline, a xanthine derivative, is an adenosine uptake inhibitor and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. It exerts inhibitory activity on the proliferation of microglial cells, the formation of oxygen free radicals and the release of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, it increases the secretion of nerve growth factor by astrocytes. It has been suggested that propentofylline may improve both global function and cognitive performance, in addition to slowing the decline in ability to perform activities of daily living. </P>
<P>The initial application for a license for propentofylline in Europe was unsuccessful. This was because of concern about its indication for mixed, vascular and Alzheimer's dementia, and also because effects on disease progression were being evaluated using novel clinical trial designs. Propentofylline remains in development although this review evaluates existing data.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of propentofylline in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type, vascular dementia, mixed dementia, dementia in other diseases (such as Pick's disease, Parkinson's disease and organic cognitive impairment) and unspecified dementia, hereafter referred to as dementia.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>The following trials were considered for inclusion: unconfounded double-blind randomized controlled trials of propentofylline compared with a placebo or another treatment group. </P>
<P>Trials in which the allocation to treatment was not randomized, or in which treatment allocation was not concealed were excluded. This is because prior knowledge of treatment allocation may lead to biased patient allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>All studies in which patients with Alzheimer's disease, vascular, mixed or unspecified dementia are treated with propentofylline were considered for inclusion. Diagnosis was made according to internationally accepted criteria such as <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK> and NINCDS-ADRDA (<LINK REF="REF-McKhann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKhann 1984</LINK>)</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies in which propentofylline was given at any dose for a period of more than one day were considered for inclusion. The following comparisons were considered for inclusion<BR/>(i) Propentofylline vs placebo<BR/>(ii) Propentofylline vs other treatment <BR/>(iii) Propentofylline + other treatment vs other treatment alone (add-on study)</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcomes of interest are:<BR/>1. Cognitive Function<BR/>2. Functional Performance<BR/>3. Global Impression (measuring severity of illness, and improvement compared to previous assessment)<BR/>4. Behaviour Disturbance<BR/>5. Quality of Life<BR/>6. Effect on Carer<BR/>7. Safety as measured by incidence of adverse effects (including side effects) leading to withdrawal<BR/>8. Institutionalization (including time to institutionalization)<BR/>9. Acceptability of treatment as measured by withdrawal from trials<BR/>10. Death<BR/>11. Cost (to National Health Service and carers)<BR/>12. Biological Disease Progression</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>A single reviewer (MAF) eliminated irrelevant citations based on the title of the article and its abstract. If the article was possibly relevant, it was retrieved for further assessment. Three reviewers (MAF, VK and RJH) independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review from the culled citation list. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The same 3 reviewers (MAF, VK and RJH) assessed the methodological quality of each trial. The quality of the methodology of each selected trial was rated using the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Category A (adequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by:<BR/>(i) some form of centralized randomized scheme, such as having to provide details of an enrolled participant to an office by phone to receive the treatment group allocation;<BR/>(ii) some form of randomization scheme controlled by a pharmacy;<BR/>(iii) numbered or coded containers, such as in a pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administered sequentially to enrolled participants;<BR/>(iv) an on-site or coded computer system, given that the allocations were in a locked or unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant; or<BR/>(v) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes;<BR/>(v) other combinations of described elements of the process that provides assurance of adequate concealment.</P>
<P>Category B (intermediate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by:<BR/>(i) use of a list or table to allocate assignments;<BR/>(ii) use of envelopes or sealed envelopes;<BR/>(iii) stating the study as randomized without further detail.</P>
<P>Category C (inadequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by:<BR/>(i) alternation;<BR/>(ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of week, or any other such approach;<BR/>(iii) any allocation procedure that is entirely transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random numbers or assignments.<BR/>Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias. Trials with unclear concealment measures have been shown to yield more pronounced estimates of treatment effects than trials that have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation schedules, but less pronounced than inadequately concealed trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Thus trials were included if they conformed to categories A or B, and those falling into category C are excluded.</P>
<P>The influence of the quality of randomization on the results was assessed by pooling studies on these characteristics.<BR/>Other aspects of trial quality were not assessed by a scoring system although details were noted of blinding, whether intention-to-treat analyses were extractable from the published data, and the number of patients lost to follow-up.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Data were extracted independently by 2 reviewers (MAF and VK) and cross-checked. Any discrepancies were discussed.</LI>
<LI>Data were sought on every patient with each outcome measure. To allow an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. Where dichotomous data were missing, the patients were assumed to have suffered the least favourable outcome. If ITT data were not available in the publications, data for an on-treatment analysis were extracted and indicated as such.</LI>
<LI>For continuous or ordinal variables, the main outcomes of interest were the final assessment score and the change in score from baseline (i.e. pre-randomization or at randomization) to the final assessment. For binary outcomes such as dependency, institutionalization and death, the outcome itself was of relevance. The baseline assessment score were the first available score, no longer than two months prior to the randomization.</LI>
<LI>Data on adverse effects (AE) and dropouts were recorded.</LI>
<LI>In studies where a cross-over design was used, only data from the first treatment phase were eligible for inclusion.</LI>
<LI>Data from studies including a titration period prior to the randomization phase were not used to assess safety or efficacy since patients were usually not randomized nor were treatment or dose allocations concealed.</LI>

<LI>For continuous or ordinal variables (such as psychometric test scores and rating scales of functional and quality of life scales) the main outcomes of interest were the final assessment score and the change in score from baseline (i.e. pre-randomization or at randomization) to the final assessment. If ordinal scale data appeared to be approximately normally distributed or if the analysis that the investigators performed suggested parametric tests were appropriate, then the outcome measures were treated as continuous data.</LI>
<LI>For binary outcomes (such as institutionalization and death), the end-point was of interest and the Peto method of the typical odds ratio were used.</LI>

The three earliest studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mielke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mielke 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mielke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mielke 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saletu-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Saletu 1990</LINK>) were smaller than later studies, and of shorter duration, all 12 weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Saletu-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Saletu 1990</LINK> is reported in another paper to be a phase II trial. The company reports four phase III studies, called study 1-4, in various papers. The results from study 1 and 2 are reported briefly in <LINK REF="STD-Kittner-_x0028_EPSG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kittner (EPSG)</LINK>, which includes brief results of a pooled analysis. Study 2 is reported in detail in <LINK REF="STD-Marcusson-_x0028_EPSG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Marcusson (EPSG)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kittner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kittner 1997</LINK> reports a meta-analysis of all four phase III studies, and this paper is the only mention of the Study 3. <LINK REF="REF-Rother-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rother 1998</LINK> also reviews all four phase III studies, and reports results from study 2 and study 4 in some detail. In this paper study 4 is identified as the Karlsson study, and although it remains unpublished we keep this name. <LINK REF="REF-Kittner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kittner 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Kittner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kittner 2000</LINK> report two disease specific trials, 304 (Alzheimer's disease) and 305 (vascular dementia). </P>
<P>Despite a number of publications there are few or no data available from four studies. Attempts were made to obtain more information about the trials. Authors and the pharmaceutical company were contacted, but either they did not reply or would not release any further information. </P>
<P>Data from the two studies reported in <LINK REF="REF-Kittner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kittner 2000</LINK> could not be analysed because of insufficient information presented. No data from the trial reported in <LINK REF="REF-Bachynsky-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachynsky 2000b</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Bachynsky-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachynsky 2000b</LINK>) could be analysed either, mainly because the focus of the article was on the cost-effectiveness of propentofylline and inadequate information was given on outcome measures. </P>
<P>The sample sizes of the included studies ranged from 30 to 550 patients. The mean age of subjects ranged from 64.8 to 72.4 years. All of the trials compared placebo with propentofylline 900mg per day. </P>
<P>The following instruments were used to measure treatment effects: <BR/>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): This measures cognitive function in the domains of orientation, attention and calculation, registration and recall, language and praxis. It is a 30-point scale where a higher score indicates better cognitive function (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical Global Impression (CGI): This is an eight-point scoring system ranging from 0-7. The CGI I measures severity of illness and CGI II global improvement. A score of one indicates very much improved and seven very much worse. A score of zero indicates that no assessment was made (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gottfries-Brane-Steen (GBS): This instrument assesses cognitive and noncognitive functions rated on 26 items of which 11 are cognitive . Categories include intellectual function, depression, anxiety, initiative for activities, motor activity, agitation, confusion and performance of everyday tasks. The score ranges from 0-156 points, where a lower score denotes improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Gottfries-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottfries 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Syndrome Short Test (SKT): This test, with nine subtests, measures impairment of memory, attention, speech and mental agility by means of a 4-step scoring system that is standardized for age and premorbid IQ. Scores range from 0-27 where a lower score denotes improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Erzigkeit-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erzigkeit 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Digital Symbol Substitution Test (DSST): Cognitive performance is assessed through the copying of combinations of numbers and symbols. The sum of correct answers obtained within 90 seconds represents the total score, the maximum being 67. A higher score denotes better function (<LINK REF="REF-Oswald-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oswald 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nurberger-Alters-Beobachtungs-Skala (NAB): With this scale carers/nurses rate the patient's performance on 15 activities of daily living, each measured by a 3-step scoring system. The total score ranges form 15-45 points with a lower score indicating improved function. This is a subsection of the Nurenberg gerontopsychological inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Oswald-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oswald 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nurnberger-Alters-Alltags-Skala (NAA): This scale assesses activities of daily living. There are 20 items, each measured by a 3-step scoring system. The total score ranges from 20-60 points with a lower score indicating improved function. This is a subsection of the Nuremberg gerontopsychological inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Oswald-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oswald 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>Zerssen Adjective Mood Scale (BfS): The 28 items in this scale evaluate treatment induced changes of mood by a 3-step scoring system. The total score ranges from 0-56 points with a lower score indicating improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Zerssen-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zerssen 1970</LINK>).</P>
<P>Selective Reminding Procedure (SRT): The short- and long-term components of verbal memory are determined by the recall of a series of 10 unrelated words presented over five trials. The score ranges from 0-10 and a higher score indicates better functioning. Delayed recall (SRT-DR) is then assessed after 15 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Schaaf-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaaf 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Incomplete Picture Test (IPT): Five versions of a drawing at different stages of completion are presented to the patient who is asked to identify it at its most fragmented level (identification score). This is then repeated after 15 minutes (re-identification score). Both scores range from 10-50 with a lower score denoting improvement. There are 10 sets of drawings (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>FAS-test: Patients are asked to produce as many words as possible beginning with the letter 'F' in 60 seconds. This is then repeated with the letters 'A' and 'S'. The score is given as the sum of all admissible words. Proper nouns, variations and repetitions are not counted (<LINK REF="REF-Spreen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spreen 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>Other outcome measures included electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) and psychometric tests, including the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), Assessment of Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Disability Assessment in Dementia (DAD), Caregiver's Activity Survey (CAS). These outcome measures could not be included in this analysis because either they were not measures identified as part of the protocol (EEG, PET), or they were used in the trials for which insufficient data were presented.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All included studies were double-blind and controlled. None of them described the randomization procedures utilised. Two trials did not have a wash-out period (<LINK REF="STD-Mielke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mielke 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mielke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mielke 1998</LINK>). One trial did not mention obtaining consent (<LINK REF="STD-Mielke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mielke 1998</LINK>) and another trial did not mention obtaining ethical approval (<LINK REF="STD-Saletu-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Saletu 1990</LINK>). Most of the studies described drop-outs although one did not specify from which group drop-outs occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Mielke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mielke 1996</LINK>). All studies described exclusion criteria and the diagnostic system used. One trial did not specify type of dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Saletu-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Saletu 1990</LINK>). Two trials did not perform an ITT analysis. One trial reported eight additional psychometric tests, but these were not reported in our meta-analyses which contain several cognitive tests (<LINK REF="STD-Saletu-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Saletu 1990</LINK>). In one trial the number of patients analysed differed between variables because different numbers of assessments were performed and where variables were missing the last observation was carried forward (<LINK REF="STD-Marcusson-_x0028_EPSG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Marcusson (EPSG)</LINK>). </P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-04-16 14:41:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>There were only detailed reports of four of the nine included studies. We had to extract the minimal data available in review articles in order to obtain any results for the other studies. The meta-analyses reported here are far from satisfactory as a summary of the efficacy of propentofylline, considering the unpublished information that exists.</P>
<P>The first objective is to review the efficacy of propentofylline for undifferentiated dementia. Although one study reported separate results for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, there were not enough data to attempt a subgroup analysis for the types of dementia.</P>
<P>All results apply to dementia undifferentiated by type.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The very limited data available suggest that propentofylline might have benefits for people with Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia, however, with very limited published data the effect is very difficult to assess. The reviewers have found it frustrating to know that substantial additional data have been collected but are not available in the public domain and so cannot contribute to an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of propentofylline. <BR/>It is also known that propentofylline was submitted to the European Medicines Evaluation Agency. On 20 October 1998 the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) voted not to recommend marketing authorization in the European Union (<LINK REF="REF-Press-release-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Press release 1998</LINK>). Since this press release was made there has been no further public information on the future development of propentofylline. The existence of so much withheld data raises the possibility of publication bias in that the published studies may be unrepresentative and selected for their positive results.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Propentofylline remains an unlicensed drug under commercial development. There is very early evidence that it may have benefits for people with Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia, however, full publication of existing data and further research would be required before any recommendation could be made for its use in clinical practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Release of the unpublished data by Aventis Pharmaceuticals (Hoechst-Marion-Roussell) would facilitate an update of this systematic review. A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis might help determine whether further clinical trials would be justified.</P>
