<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-10-08 10:52:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>
<B>Background: </B>In people who have just had a stroke (a sudden brain attack due to either blockage or rupture of an artery in the brain), very high and very low blood pressures may be harmful. Therefore, drugs that raise low blood pressure or lower high blood pressure might be beneficial. Up to 50% of people admitted with acute stroke are taking blood pressure tablets on hospital admission and it is not clear whether these medications should be continued or discontinued in the acute situation. This review looked at those trials that deliberately altered blood pressure or compared continuing or stopping blood pressure-lowering tablets taken before stroke.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>This review is up-to-date to May 2014. We included 26 trials involving 17,011 participants: 24 trials assessed lowering blood pressure, one trial tested raising blood pressure, and two trials assessed what to do with drugs taken before stroke. All studies took place in hospitals that were used to treating people with stroke. Not all trials contributed information to all outcomes, and we have used data that were available in publications.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>There is insufficient evidence to say that lowering blood pressure saves lives or reduces disability in people with acute stroke. Immediately restarting blood pressure-lowering drugs taken before the stroke may increase disability.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion:</B> More research is needed to identify those people who are most likely to benefit from altering blood pressure in acute stroke, the time window in which the treatment is likely to be of benefit, what types of stroke are likely to respond favourably, and the environment in which such treatment may be best given in routine practice.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-07 15:09:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We included 26 trials involving 17,011 participants (8497 participants were assigned active therapy and 8514 participants received placebo/control). Not all trials contributed to each outcome. Most data came from trials that had a wide time window for recruitment; four trials gave treatment within six hours and one trial within eight hours. The trials tested alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (A2AA), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARA), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), nitric oxide (NO) donors, thiazide-like diuretics, and target-driven blood pressure lowering. One trial tested phenylephrine.</P>
<P>At 24 hours after randomisation oral ACEIs reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP, mean difference (MD) -8 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -17 to 1) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP, MD -3 mmHg, 95% CI -9 to 2), sublingual ACEIs reduced SBP (MD -12.00 mm Hg, 95% CI -26 to 2) and DBP (MD -2, 95%CI -10 to 6), oral ARA reduced SBP (MD -1 mm Hg, 95% CI -3 to 2) and DBP (MD -1 mm Hg, 95% CI -3 to 1), oral beta blockers reduced SBP (MD -14 mm Hg; 95% CI -27 to -1) and DBP (MD -1 mm Hg, 95% CI -9 to 7), intravenous (iv) beta blockers reduced SBP (MD -5 mm Hg, 95% CI -18 to 8) and DBP (-5 mm Hg, 95% CI -13 to 3), oral CCBs reduced SBP (MD -13 mmHg, 95% CI -43 to 17) and DBP (MD -6 mmHg, 95% CI -14 to 2), iv CCBs reduced SBP (MD -32 mmHg, 95% CI -65 to 1) and DBP (MD -13, 95% CI -31 to 6), NO donors reduced SBP (MD -12 mmHg, 95% CI -19 to -5) and DBP (MD -3, 95% CI -4 to -2) while phenylephrine, non-significantly increased SBP (MD 21 mmHg, 95% CI -13 to 55) and DBP (MD 1 mmHg, 95% CI -15 to 16).</P>
<P>Blood pressure lowering did not reduce death or dependency either by drug class (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.05), stroke type (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.05) or time to treatment (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.05). Treatment within six hours of stroke appeared effective in reducing death or dependency (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.99) but not death (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.26) at the end of the trial. Although death or dependency did not differ between people who continued pre-stroke antihypertensive treatment versus those who stopped it temporarily (worse outcome with continuing treatment, OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.24), disability scores at the end of the trial were worse in participants randomised to continue treatment (Barthel Index, MD -3.2, 95% CI -5.8, -0.6).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-09-17 15:24:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is insufficient evidence that lowering blood pressure during the acute phase of stroke improves functional outcome. It is reasonable to withhold blood pressure-lowering drugs until patients are medically and neurologically stable, and have suitable oral or enteral access, after which drugs can than be reintroduced. In people with acute stroke, CCBs, ACEI, ARA, beta blockers and NO donors each lower blood pressure while phenylephrine probably increases blood pressure. Further trials are needed to identify which people are most likely to benefit from early treatment, in particular whether treatment started very early is beneficial.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-08 11:08:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-08 11:06:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is the third most common cause of death and the most common cause of disability in the western world. Acute stroke, whether due to infarction or haemorrhage, is associated with high blood pressure in 75% of patients, of whom 50% have a previous history of high blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 1992</LINK>). After a stroke, blood pressure falls in most patients over a week although a third of patients remain hypertensive (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Britton-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harper-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 1994</LINK>). A number of small studies have assessed the relationship between blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Droller-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Droller 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bourestom-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourestom 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marquarsden-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marquarsden 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carlberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlberg 1993</LINK>) and outcome. A meta-analysis of these studies found that elevated blood pressure was associated with a poor outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Willmot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willmot 2004</LINK>). Data from 17,398 participants in the International Stroke Trial identified a U-shaped relationship such that both low and high blood pressure were associated independently with increased early death and later death or dependency (<LINK REF="REF-Leonardi_x002d_Bee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonardi-Bee 2002</LINK>), a finding that has been replicated by others (<LINK REF="REF-Castillo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castillo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vemmos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vemmos 2004</LINK>). High blood pressure is also associated with an increased early recurrence of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Leonardi_x002d_Bee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonardi-Bee 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sprigg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprigg 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mechanisms underlying high blood pressure in stroke are complex but pre-existing hypertension, hospitalisation stress, activation of the sympathetic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, cortisol and natriuretic peptide neuroendocrine systems, and the Cushing reflex (raised blood pressure secondary to raised intracranial pressure) all contribute (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 1982</LINK>). In ischaemic stroke, high blood pressure also appears to adversely affect outcome through increasing the risk of cerebral oedema, but not haemorrhagic transformation (<LINK REF="REF-Leonardi_x002d_Bee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonardi-Bee 2002</LINK>). Haematoma expansion is related to high blood pressure in people with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) although this relationship may be confounded by stroke severity and time to presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Fujii-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujii 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kazui-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazui 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fujii-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujii 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bath-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bath 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-08 10:53:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Although debated more than 29 years ago, it still remains unclear whether high blood pressure should (<LINK REF="REF-Spence-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spence 1985</LINK>) or should not (<LINK REF="REF-Yatsu-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yatsu 1985</LINK>) be treated acutely following stroke. Recent guidelines recommend that acute lowering of blood pressure should be delayed for several days or even weeks unless blood pressure is greater than 220/120 mmHg, blood pressure is greater than 200/100 mmHg with end organ involvement (hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection, cardiac ischaemia, pulmonary oedema, acute renal failure), or blood pressure is greater than 200/120 mmHg with primary ICH, are present (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EUSI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUSI 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002d_HS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA-HS 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002d_IS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA-IS 2013</LINK>). Though the evidence is weaker, guidelines now recommend that patients who have elevated blood pressure and are otherwise eligible for treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator may have their blood pressure lowered so that systolic blood pressure (SBP) is less than or equal to 185 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is less than or equal to 110 mmHg before thrombolysis using intravenous labetalol, nitroprusside or nicardipine and it should be maintained below 180/105 mmHg for at least the first 24 hours after therapy (<LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002d_IS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA-IS 2013</LINK>). Unfortunately, such guidelines are inconsistent and are based on theoretical arguments and individual case reports, and not on the results of systematic overviews or large intervention trials of blood pressure manipulation in acute stroke. Nevertheless, a number of case reports and series have suggested that active lowering of blood pressure in people with primary intracranial haemorrhage and ischaemic stroke may improve (<LINK REF="REF-Dandapani-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dandapani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chamorro-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamorro 1998</LINK>) or worsen (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Britton-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischberg 2000</LINK>) outcome.</P>
<P>Low blood pressure is not common in acute stroke but it, like high blood pressure, is associated with a poor outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Leonardi_x002d_Bee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonardi-Bee 2002</LINK>). Possible reasons for low blood pressure include potentially reversible conditions such as hypovolaemia, sepsis, impaired cardiac output secondary to cardiac failure, arrhythmias or cardiac ischaemia, and aortic dissection (<LINK REF="REF-Sprigg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprigg 2005</LINK>). Guidelines recommend that causes of hypotension in the setting of acute stroke should be sought with the view to correcting reversible causes such as hypovolaemia and cardiac arrhythmias (<LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002d_IS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA-IS 2013</LINK>). Since cerebral autoregulation is lost following stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Strandgaard-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strandgaard 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burke-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paulson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paulson 1990</LINK>), such that cerebral blood flow becomes dependent on systemic blood pressure, some researchers have hypothesised that blood pressure should be increased to improve cerebral perfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 1992</LINK>) and a case series (<LINK REF="STD-Rordorf-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rordorf 1997</LINK>) and a pilot randomised trial of phenylephrine (<LINK REF="STD-Hillis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hillis 2003</LINK>) reporting this approach have been published.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Part 1: this review</HEADING>
<P>Assessment of trials in which the primary aim of the intervention was to alter blood pressure in people with acute stroke with the aim of improving clinical outcome.</P>
<P>A Cochrane review of blood pressure intervention in stroke published in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-BASC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">BASC 2001</LINK>) updated the original review published in 1997. It was again updated in 2008 to include more information from 13 trials published between 2003 and 2008 including a total of 1153 participants (<LINK REF="REF-BASC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">BASC 2009</LINK>). With a relatively small amount of data, there was insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of altering blood pressure during the acute phase of stroke.</P>
<P>The present review includes all new trials completed and published since 2008. The total number of participants is now 17,011, a 14-fold increase since the review in 1997 and 2008. Although many of the data are from trials testing blood pressure alteration in the acute phase (&#8804; 48 hours), some recent trials have examined specific questions such as lowering blood pressure in ICH (<LINK REF="STD-INTERACT-pilot-2008" TYPE="STUDY">INTERACT pilot 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-INTERACT_x002d_2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">INTERACT-2 2013</LINK>), with angiotensin receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="STD-SCAST-2011" TYPE="STUDY">SCAST 2011</LINK>), or glyceryl nitrate (<LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2014" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2014</LINK>) or in the pre-hospital setting (<LINK REF="STD-PIL_x002d_FAST-2013" TYPE="STUDY">PIL-FAST 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RIGHT-2013" TYPE="STUDY">RIGHT 2013</LINK>). Furthermore, two trials (<LINK REF="STD-COSSACS-2010" TYPE="STUDY">COSSACS 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2014" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2014</LINK>) have investigated whether to continue or stop temporarily pre-stroke antihypertensive therapy. This systematic review includes these data and provides up-to-date evidence.</P>

<P>Assessment of trials where vasoactive drugs were administered to people with acute stroke and where clinical outcome was measured. Drugs include: alpha receptor antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor inhibitors (ARA), beta receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers (CCB), diuretics, magnesium, naftidrofuryl, nitric oxide donors (nitrates), papaverine, pentoxifylline, prostacyclin, serotonin receptor antagonists, sympathomimetics, theophylline (and mimetics), thromboxane A2 antagonists, vinpocetine, and their derivatives. Aggregated patient data are analysed separately for drugs which lower and elevate blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-BASC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">BASC 2000</LINK>). Work on this analysis is ongoing.</P>

The magnitude of blood pressure reduction varied between -4.6/-2.5 mmHg for oral ARA (primarily candesartan and telmisartan) and -13.7/-7.9 mmHg for ACE-Is. When assessed by stroke type, heterogeneity was present; slightly larger reductions in blood pressure were seen in participants with ICH (-11.8/-5.1 mmHg) with mixed stroke intermediate (-7.9/-3.0 mmHg) and ischaemic stroke least (-7.0/-3.1 mmHg) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.30" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.30</LINK>).

<P>Twenty-six trials, involving 17,011 participants with stroke, assessed the effects of deliberate blood pressure alteration.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blood pressure lowering</HEADING>
<P>The results come from 24 trials that studied 15,432 participants.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Overall, lowering blood pressure did not improve outcome, whether assessed as death, combined death or dependency, neurological deterioration or quality of life. These findings were maintained irrespective of type of intervention (drug class, intensity of lowering) or type of stroke. However, when assessed by time to treatment, very early blood pressure lowering (before hospital presentation or within six hours of stroke onset) was associated with reduced death or dependency, and improved quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-INTERACT_x002d_2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">INTERACT-2 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RIGHT-2013" TYPE="STUDY">RIGHT 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Haemodynamic effects</HEADING>
<P>All the studied antihypertensive drug classes lowered blood pressure during the period of treatment. Reductions in blood pressure after the first treatment varied between -4.6/-2.5 mmHg for oral ARA and -21.0/-7.9 mmHg for ACE-I. Slightly larger reductions in blood pressure were seen in participants with ICH (-11.8/-5.1 mmHg) than in those with ischaemic stroke (-7.0/-3.1 mmHg). The largest reductions were seen if treatment was started very early before hospital presentation (-16.0/-15.0 mmHg); smaller reductions occurred if treatment was started beyond 48 hours after stroke onset (-7.3/-4.9 mmHg).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Discussion</HEADING>
<P>A variety of hypotheses can be postulated for why functional outcome was better if blood pressure lowering was started very early after stroke. First, the magnitude of blood pressure lowering may be important since the greatest improvement in outcome occurred when treatment was started early. Second, the type of intervention may be important since improved outcome was seen with early intensive blood pressure lowering (<LINK REF="STD-INTERACT_x002d_2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">INTERACT-2 2013</LINK>), and early nitrate administration (<LINK REF="STD-RIGHT-2013" TYPE="STUDY">RIGHT 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2014" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2014</LINK>). Conversely, apparent hazard was seen with ARA drugs (<LINK REF="STD-SCAST-2011" TYPE="STUDY">SCAST 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jusufovic-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jusufovic 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Perhaps surprisingly, stroke type may not be particularly relevant since differential effects on outcome were not seen for ischaemic stroke versus ICH.</P>
<P>In summary, very early treatment with an appropriate agent or target blood pressure may be the most important strategy to test in the future, irrespective of stroke type. Importantly, systolic blood pressure should not be lowered excessively (&gt; 20%), at least in ischaemic stroke, since trials of intravenous CCBs found that these worsened outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Bridgers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bridgers 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wahlgren-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wahlgren 1994</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinical outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The findings were mixed with some comparisons, in particular dependency (mRS), death, and neurological deterioration, neutral for the comparison of continue versus stop pre-stroke antihypertensive drugs. In contrast, measures of disability (BI) and quality of life (EQ-5D, transformed into a Health Utility Status) were worse in participants randomised to continue treatment immediately.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Haemodynamic effects</HEADING>
<P>Immediately continuing antihypertensive drugs taken before stroke was associated with a lower blood pressure by -7.9/-1.2 mmHg at the first measurement after randomisation, and -11.3/-6.4 mmHg by end-of-treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Discussion</HEADING>
<P>The discrepancy in findings for two measures of functional outcome, mRS and BI, is challenging to explain. First, it may represent chance such that no difference exists between the interventions. Second, it could reflect outcome bias since it is not possible to test this question in a double-blind placebo-controlled design. Nevertheless, both trials used blinded outcome assessment for both mRS and BI. Further, since a majority of stroke physicians tend to continue treatment in routine practice (<LINK REF="REF-Bath-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bath 2000b</LINK>), the result seen across the two results is counter-intuitive. Last, the difference may be real in which case mRS, usually considered to be the optimal functional outcome in stroke trials (<LINK REF="REF-Lees-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lees 2012</LINK>), failed to detect a difference in contrast to a comparison of BI scores.</P>
<P>If continuing drugs immediately is, indeed, hazardous, then the two trials do not identify the cause. Drugs that attenuate stress hormones, in particular that down-regulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) were commonly taken before stroke, e.g. ACE-I, ARA and ß-receptor antagonists. Initiating these drugs in the acute phase of stroke has been associated with harm (<LINK REF="STD-BEST-1988" TYPE="STUDY">BEST 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SCAST-2011" TYPE="STUDY">SCAST 2011</LINK>), so it can be postulated that continuing these during the acute phase of stroke is potentially harmful. Alternatively, continuing drugs in people who are dysphagic and who do not have safe enteral access for feeding may be hazardous through aspiration of these drugs and then the development of pneumonia. The ENOS trial gives some support for this hypothesis (<LINK REF="STD-ENOS-2014" TYPE="STUDY">ENOS 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main implication for clinicians is that it is reasonable to withhold BP-lowering drugs until patients are medically and neurologically stable, and have suitable oral or enteral access, after which drugs can then be reintroduced.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">General</HEADING>
<P>An important problem with some of the trials was the absence of detailed information on how blood pressure was measured. Hence, the quality of blood pressure readings is unknown. It is essential that future trials describe in detail how blood pressure is measured by including the following information.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Equipment: manufacturer, model, measurement method (mercury, anaeroid or oscillometry, and manual or automatic), and whether the equipment has been independently validated, and if so by whom.</LI>
<LI>Measurer: who measured blood pressure, and how they were trained, assessed, re-trained and re-assessed.</LI>
<LI>Measurements: the number of readings at each time point, site of measurement (brachial, finger, etc) and what position the person was in (supine, sitting, standing).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Little is known about the effect of blood pressure altering in older people with acute stroke, who comprise the largest group of patients, including those with ischaemic stroke who need thrombolysis. Of the trials, only two had mean age over 75 years contributing to a total of 98 participants (<LINK REF="STD-CHHIPS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CHHIPS 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RIGHT-2013" TYPE="STUDY">RIGHT 2013</LINK>). The number and proportion of older people is likely to increase with population ageing. As the variation in response by individuals to blood pressure modulating agents increases with age, e.g. related to concurrent isolated systolic hypertension or cardiac dysfunction, it may be inappropriate to assume that the effects of changing blood pressure seen in younger populations will necessarily be the same in older ones.</P>
<P>This review is Part 1 of the Blood pressure in Acute Stroke Collaboration and reports only those trials that specifically set out to alter blood pressure in people with acute stroke. Part 2 of the project assesses all RCTs in acute stroke where vasoactive drugs were administered and includes all those studies covered in Part 1. Although progress has been made in the number and quality of stroke trials in the last few years, a substantial number of questions remain. The number of participants included in this review is very small in comparison to the global burden of stroke (about 15,000,000 per year worldwide). At present, any benefit of treatment is small, and additional data are required to recommend changes to routine clinical practice. The centres that took part in the trials were interested and familiar with the management of acute stroke. To extrapolate these results in routine clinical practice to less specialist centres could result in greater hazard or completely negate any potential benefit. Therefore, there is a need for new centres to participate in trials. Further evidence is needed on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>how to select participants;</LI>
<LI>the influence of age, time of onset, stroke subtype, severity, choice of drug, dose, route of administration and blood pressure variability, on response to active changes in blood pressure.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Recent guidelines based on the non-systematic analysis of (largely) observational data recommend that hypertension should not be treated for up to two weeks after an ischaemic stroke unless severe hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy, heart failure, cardiac ischaemia, aortic dissection, or continued intracerebral bleeding are present (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EUSI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUSI 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002d_HS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA-HS 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AHA_x002d_IS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA-IS 2013</LINK>). Persistent hypertension after two weeks should be treated since the risk of stroke in people with cerebrovascular disease is dependent on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 1996</LINK>). In <LINK REF="REF-PROGRESS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">PROGRESS 2001</LINK>, perindopril (with or without indapamide) reduced the risk of stroke among both hypertensive and non-hypertensive participants with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Further, evidence from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial suggests that an ACE-I may reduce stroke and other vascular events in people with prior cerebrovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-HOPE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">HOPE 2000</LINK>). Overall, lowering blood pressure in people with chronic stroke reduces the subsequent risk of recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Rashid-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rashid 2003</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-17 10:43:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In this updated review, blood pressure lowering did not improve functional outcome. However, early initiation of treatment might be beneficial, and further studies are required to test this specific question. Immediately continuing pre-stroke antihypertensive drugs appears to be associated with a worse functional outcome and lower quality of life; hence, it is reasonable to delay treatment until patients are stable and have oral or enteral access to allow safe administration of drugs.</P>

<P>The quality of the included studies was variable. Methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were not always clear. Not all trials contributed to each outcome. Details of blood pressure recording including equipment, number of readings and patient positioning were not provided in some studies. Trials in the last decade were more standardised compared with earlier ones when reporting baseline stroke characteristics, primary and secondary outcomes. Outcome assessment was blinded in recent large RCTs and clearly reported in trial protocols. Trials were largely not representative of unselected stroke populations around the world - participants tended to be younger, have fewer comorbidities and be conscious, so that poor outcomes were less common than might be expected.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The 'Beta-blockade in acute stroke trial (BEST)' done in Nottingham in the 1980s (which compared atenolol, propranolol and placebo) is not included in this review. Although lowering blood pressure was not the major aim of the trial, lower blood pressures did occur in the intervention group. Should the study not be included in the review, or be explicitly excluded?</P>
<P>Reference: Barer DH, Cruickshank JM, Ebrahim SB, Mitchell JR. Low dose beta blockade in acute stroke ("BEST" trial): an evaluation. Br Med J 1988;296:737-741.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2014-06-21 17:19:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The BEST trial was not included since the trial's primary aim was not about altering blood pressure, but rather assessing the effect of beta blockers in acute stroke. However, BEST is included in our related review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews: Vasoactive drugs for acute stroke. We have drawn this distinction since there are methodological differences between studies which aim to alter blood pressure, and those which may, or not, have measured blood pressure as part of their protocol.</P>
