<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-04 08:18:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Acute middle ear infection (acute otitis media) is a very common disease in children and may cause pain and hearing loss. Delayed or ineffective treatment may lead to serious complications such as ear drum perforation, sensorineural hearing loss or the disease becoming chronic. Amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is the most commonly used antibiotic for treating acute otitis media. Currently, a reduction in the dosing interval to one or two daily doses is being used, in preference to the conventional three or four daily doses, to aid compliance.</P>
<P>We identified five randomised clinical studies with 1601 children comparing two dosing schedules. Participants were aged 12 years or younger with AOM. The primary outcome was clinical cure rate in terms of resolution of otalgia and fever at the end of antibiotic therapy (days seven to 15). The secondary outcomes were clinical cure rate in terms of middle ear effusion during therapy, clinical cure rate post-treatment (one to three months) in terms of resolution of middle ear infection, AOM complications and adverse events to medication. The results showed that treating acute middle ear infection with either once/twice daily or three times daily amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, has the same results using our outcome measures, including adverse events such as diarrhoea and skin reactions.</P>
<P>The evidence is current to March 2013.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-05 21:18:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common problem in children, for which amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is frequently prescribed as a treatment of choice. The conventional recommendation is either three or four daily doses. However, nowadays it is frequently prescribed as once or twice daily doses. If once or twice daily amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is as effective for acute otitis media as three or four times a day, it may be more convenient to give the medication once or twice a day to children and hence improve compliance.</P>

<P>To compare the effectiveness of one or two daily doses with three or four daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, for the treatment of AOM in children; and to compare complication rates and adverse reactions.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-06-10 08:20:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (January 1950 to March week 1, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013) and the Science Citation Index (2001 to March 2013).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-04-15 07:13:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children aged 12 years or younger with AOM, diagnosed by acute ear pain (otalgia) and inflamed ear drum (confirmed by positive tympanocentesis or tympanogram of type B or C).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-11-05 21:14:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data on treatment outcomes from individual trials and assessed trial quality based on selection bias, performance bias and detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. We defined the quality grading as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias. We summarised the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-02 14:48:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included five studies with 1601 children in the review. Pooled analysis demonstrated that the following outcomes were comparable between the two groups: clinical cure at the end of therapy (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.07); during therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.33) and at follow-up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09); recurrent AOM (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.81); compliance rate (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10) and overall adverse events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.63). When we performed subgroup analysis separately for trials with amoxicillin only and amoxicillin/clavulanate only, it showed that all important outcomes were comparable between once or twice daily groups and the three times daily group. The risk of bias amongst the five included studies was as follows: for random sequence generation we graded two studies as low and three unclear risk of bias; for allocation concealment all studies were at unclear risk of bias; for blinding (performance and detection bias) we graded four as high and one as unclear risk of bias; for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) we graded two low, two high and one as unclear risk of bias; for reporting bias four were at low and one at high risk; and for &#8216;other&#8217; bias four were at low and one at unclear risk of bias.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-17 02:40:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-06-17 02:40:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in children. During the first six months of life about 48% of infants have one episode of AOM or otitis media with effusion (OME) and about 20% have two or more episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Daly-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daly 1999</LINK>). The peak incidence of AOM occurs between 6 and 12 months of age. It has been found that by the end of the first year of life 62.4% of infants have had one or more episodes of AOM and 17.3% have had three or more episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Teele-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teele 1989</LINK>). The risk of developing another episode within one month after the onset of the primary infection is estimated at 35% (<LINK REF="REF-Carlin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlin 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>The common bacterial pathogens of AOM are <I>Streptococcal pneumoniae</I> (<I>S. pneumoniae</I>), <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> (<I>H. influenzae</I>) and <I>Moraxella catarrhalis</I> (<I>M. catarrhalis</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1998</LINK>). These bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Barnett-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnett 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1995</LINK>). Systematic reviews have demonstrated that in uncomplicated AOM, about 20 children must be treated with antibiotics to prevent one child having some pain after two days (<LINK REF="REF-Venekamp-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venekamp 2013</LINK>) and about eight children must receive antibiotics to avoid one clinical failure (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2001</LINK>). A study by <LINK REF="REF-Rovers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rovers 2006</LINK> demonstrated that antibiotics seemed to have most benefit in children younger than two years of age with bilateral AOM, and in children with both AOM and otorrhoea. However, the emergence of multiple-drug resistant strains, particularly <I>S. pneumoniae</I>, complicates the management of AOM and increases the risk of treatment failure. Antibiotics are frequently used for AOM in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Froom-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Froom 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Venekamp-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venekamp 2013</LINK>), where it is the most frequent disease that antibiotics are used to treat in outpatient departments (<LINK REF="REF-McCaig-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCaig 1995</LINK>). In contrast, the national Dutch guidelines recommend that children be treated for symptoms but do not receive antibiotics unless fever or pain persists (<LINK REF="REF-Froom-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Froom 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-09-23 09:39:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to growing bacterial resistance, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics promotes the judicious use of antibiotics in the treatment of AOM. Antibiotic therapy remains an appropriate treatment option for most children with AOM because spontaneous cure rates are lower in complicated AOM and AOM secondary to <I>S. pneumoniae</I> infection. When amoxicillin, the treatment of choice in AOM, is not effective or not tolerated in children, an alternative antibiotic such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, or second- and third-generation cephalosporins, which can cover beta-lactamase producing bacteria, should be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Pichichero-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pichichero 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of antibiotics does not depend solely on their antimicrobial activity against the suspected pathogens, but also on characteristics such as dosage, appropriate dosing intervals, tolerability and palatability, which promote compliance and adherence. A convenient once- or twice-daily dosing schedule increases the likelihood of compliance with a full course of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Leibovitz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leibovitz 2003</LINK>). The traditional dosing interval for prescribing amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is every six to eight hours. These dosing intervals may result in poor compliance especially for children at school or daycare centres, which necessitates the involvement and co-operation of a third person.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-12-08 13:48:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The length of time that antibiotic serum levels are above the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), or time above the MIC, has been demonstrated to be a major determinant in predicting successful clinical outcomes for beta-lactam antimicrobial agents (<LINK REF="REF-Cars-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cars 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drusano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drusano 1997</LINK>). This finding denotes that the dosing frequency of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents could be reduced by increasing the dose, in order to maximise time above the MIC. An increased dose, instead of three times daily dosing, will enhance compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Grob-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grob 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Urquhart-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urquhart 1992</LINK>). However, these studies relate to conditions other than otitis media.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-06-30 03:47:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>In recent years, an increased dosing interval of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, has been more frequently used to treat AOM (<LINK REF="REF-AAPS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAPS 2004</LINK>). It is therefore reasonable to assess clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of reduced dosing intervals (one or two daily doses) with traditional dosing intervals (three or four daily doses) of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, for the treatment of AOM in children.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-11-05 21:14:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common infections for which antibacterial agents are prescribed for children in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Rovers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rovers 2004</LINK>). The diagnosis and management of AOM has a significant impact on the health of children, the cost of providing health care and the use of antibiotics. Although there has been much discussion surrounding the treatment of uncomplicated AOM using antibiotics or observation, antibiotics are still widely used. The first-line antibiotic of choice for AOM is amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate (<LINK REF="REF-AAPS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAPS 2004</LINK>). The effectiveness of antibiotics does not depend solely on their antimicrobial activity against the suspected pathogens, but also on factors such as dosage, appropriate dosing intervals, tolerability and palatability. One or two daily doses of oral antibiotics have a higher compliance rate than doses taken three times daily (<LINK REF="REF-Kardas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kardas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pechere-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pechere 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review demonstrated that when pooling all data from published trials of treatment with amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate for uncomplicated AOM in children, the results are comparable for all outcomes when comparing a once or twice daily dose with thrice daily doses. These results may show that both dosages have the same effectiveness or that uncomplicated AOM can self resolve.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-05 21:14:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified five RCTs reporting clinical outcomes in children treated with one or two daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, compared to three daily doses. No trial used four daily doses. There were no significant statistical differences in the effectiveness of the two different dosages of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-11-05 21:14:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>This review demonstrates that both one or two daily doses of amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate have comparable effectiveness for the treatment of uncomplicated AOM in children. One or two daily doses might increase compliance in daily practice.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-08-06 14:52:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In routine practice amoxicillin with/without clavulanate has been used as a twice daily dose for the treatment of AOM and other infectious diseases of the upper respiratory tract. Our findings confirm that using twice daily doses has the same effectiveness as thrice daily doses for uncomplicated AOM.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-01 03:21:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>More than 90% of AOM cases occur in children less than two years of age. However, in all of the included studies the age ranges were between two months and 12 years, with few cases less than two years of age. A good quality equivalence or non-inferiority trial should be performed to see whether the treatments are either equally effective or whether a lower dosage scheme is as effective as a higher dosage scheme. Children less than two years of age should also be included in the study and a microbiological study of middle ear fluid should be performed.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2014-09-09 10:22:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>The new version of the systematic review &#8220;Once or twice daily versus three times daily amoxicillin with or without clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media&#8221; (last assessed as up-to-date: 15 March 2013) includes the same 5 randomized controlled trials (1601 children) that were included in the previous one (last assessed as up-to-date: 10 July 2010). In the Publication History it is reported &#8220;New search for studies and content updated (no change to conclusions)&#8221;.</P>
<P>We believe this is incorrect; in the 2010 version in fact there was not pooling of the data, as it was judged to be not appropriate, and the authors&#8217; conclusions were: &#8220;This review showed insufficient evidence to judge whether once or twice daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, were comparable with three or four daily doses for the treatment of AOM. The evidence appears to be biased and therefore no firm conclusions can be drawn&#8221;. On the contrary, in the last updated version of the systematic review data were pooled and conclusions reported: &#8220;This review showed that the results of using once or twice daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, were comparable with three doses for the treatment of AOM&#8221;.</P>
<P>This change is very relevant for clinicians, policy makers and the public; thus, it should be supported by a thorough discussion, explaining the rationale behind the change. Moreover, we suggest to state clearly in the Publication History: &#8220;New search for studies and content updated, no new trials identified, conclusions changed&#8221;, highlighting the change accordingly using the [CC] dark blue flag (There has been an important change to the conclusions of the review published in the most recent issue).</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2013, Issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to July 2010), EMBASE (1974 to July 2010), the Science Citation Index (2001 to July 2010) and NLM Gateway (HSRProj) (July 2010).</P>
<P>We used the following terms to search MEDLINE and CENTRAL. We combined the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision): Ovid format (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>). We adapted the search strategy to search other databases. See <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> for the EMBASE search strategy; <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> for the Science Citation Index search strategy; and Appendix 4 for the NLM Gateway search strategy.
