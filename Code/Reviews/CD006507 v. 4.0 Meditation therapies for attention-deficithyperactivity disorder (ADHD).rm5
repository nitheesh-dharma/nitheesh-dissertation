<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-03 07:27:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thawatchai Krisanaprakornkit">
<P>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder that affects a significant number of children and adults in a variety of ways. It is characterized by chronic levels of inattention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity. Meditation therapy could be a beneficial treatment for those diagnosed with ADHD. The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of this treatment. As a result of the small number of studies that we were able to include in this review and the limitations of those studies, we were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of meditation therapy for ADHD. No adverse effects of meditation in children have been reported. More trials are needed on meditation therapies for ADHD so that conclusions can be drawn regarding its effectiveness.</P>

<P>Four studies, including 83 participants, are included in this review. Two studies used mantra meditation while the other two used yoga compared with drugs, relaxation training, non-specific exercises and standard treatment control. Design limitations caused high risk of bias across the studies. Only one out of four studies provided data appropriate for analysis. For this study there was no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the drug therapy group on the teacher rating ADHD scale (MD -2.72, 95% CI -8.49 to 3.05, 15 patients). Likewise, there was no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the standard therapy group on the teacher rating ADHD scale (MD -0.52, 95% CI -5.88 to 4.84, 17 patients). There was also no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the standard therapy group in the distraction test (MD -8.34, 95% CI -107.05 to 90.37, 17 patients).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-02-12 14:57:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thawatchai Krisanaprakornkit">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-02-03 07:27:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thawatchai Krisanaprakornkit">
<P>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental problems experienced in childhood and can persist into adulthood. The major symptoms are inconsistent development and chronic levels of inattention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity (<LINK REF="REF-Scahill-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scahill 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prevalence estimates vary according to the diagnostic criteria used and the population sampled. These estimates can be further affected by influences on the diagnosis, such as the cultural environment and the differing attitudes of parents, clinicians and society towards acceptable children's behavior (<LINK REF="REF-Dwivedi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dwivedi 2005</LINK>). According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th<SUP> </SUP>edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>), prevalence estimates among school children in the US are between 3% and 7% (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>), but other estimates range from 1.7% to 16.0% (<LINK REF="REF-Pritchard-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pritchard 2005</LINK>). Boys are diagnosed with ADHD three times more often than girls. Evidence attests to the strong influence of genetic factors on the expression of symptoms, however psychosocial, environmental and cultural factors also play a role (<LINK REF="REF-Swanson--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanson 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>An independent diagnostic test for ADHD does not exist, thus the diagnosis of ADHD is clinically based. The essential criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD are a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is more frequently displayed and more severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development, and is not better explained by the presence of another mental disorder. Symptoms evolve over time. In adolescence, signs of excessive gross motor activity (e.g. excessive running and climbing, not remaining seated) are less common, and hyperactivity symptoms may be confined to fidgeting or an inner feeling of jitteriness or restlessness. In adulthood, restlessness may lead to difficulty in participating in sedentary activities and to avoiding pastimes or occupations that provide limited opportunity for spontaneous movement (e.g. desk jobs) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>). Other adults may retain only some of the symptoms, in which case the diagnosis should be ADHD in partial remission.</P>
<P>In order to qualify for a diagnosis of ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive or inattentive symptoms must have presented before the age of seven, with some impairment from the symptoms present in at least two settings (e.g. at home and at school). There must be clear evidence of interference with developmentally appropriate social, academic or occupational functioning. Care must be taken to ensure that the disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder and is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The DSM-IV-TR provides subtypes for specifying the predominant symptom presentation: predominantly inattentive type, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive type and combined type. In the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>) the disorders are defined under the category of 'Hyperkinetic Disorders' and are characterized by early onset, a combination of overactive, poorly modulated behavior with marked inattention and lack of persistent task involvement, pervasiveness across situations and persistence over time (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Children with ADHD have pronounced impairments and can experience enduring adverse effects in their academic performance, vocational success and social-emotional development. These impairments, in turn, can have a profound impact on individuals, families, schools and society (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1998</LINK>). Moreover, studies indicate that children diagnosed as having ADHD and a comorbid anxiety or depressive disorder have higher levels of coexisting life stresses and parental symptoms than children who have the single diagnosis of ADHD (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1993</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-02-12 14:57:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thawatchai Krisanaprakornkit">
<P>Non-pharmacological treatment of ADHD in childhood can be divided into three categories: parent- or family-focused strategies, child-directed interventions and school-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-ICSI-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICSI 2005</LINK>). Psychostimulant medications are considered first-line therapy as they are effective in 70% to 80% of children with ADHD, although their use may be limited both by tolerability and acceptability (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2001</LINK>). Augmentation of psychostimulant treatment with psychosocial interventions provides no advantage over medication alone for the core symptoms of ADHD, but appears to have an advantage for associated problems such as anxiety disorders, social skills difficulties, consumer satisfaction and possibly academic achievement (<LINK REF="REF-MTA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MTA 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to an increase in scientific evidence, clinical experience and community attitudes are encouraging a shift towards more natural and holistic forms of therapy as alternatives or adjuncts to pharmacological approaches in a variety of conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Arias-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arias 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krisanaprakornkit-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krisanaprakornkit 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mansky-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansky 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meditation is becoming increasingly popular as a treatment for psychological conditions and has a wide range of applications. A psychologically-oriented definition states that "meditation is a set of attentional practices leading to an altered state or trait of consciousness characterized by expanded awareness, greater presence, and a more integrated sense of self" (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1998</LINK>), which suggests that meditation might be a useful tool for attentional training in the ADHD population. In addition to increased attention, meditation may produce a state of calmness and contentment which is generally lacking in the ADHD population (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK>). Adequately trained practitioners who have first-hand experience can easily adapt meditation to the general medical setting (<LINK REF="REF-Hassed-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassed 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meditation originated in India more than three thousand years ago and has played a prominent role in the ritual practice of major religions and secular organizations alike. Meditation can be divided into two general types: concentrative meditation and mindfulness meditation (<LINK REF="REF-Barrows-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrows 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Concentrative meditation</B> is best represented in modern medicine by two programs: Transcendental Meditation® (TM®) which was introduced to the West during 1960s and the 'Relaxation Response' developed subsequently by Benson (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 1975</LINK>). Concentrative meditation involves focusing attention on an object and sustaining attention until the mind achieves stillness. A diverse range of items could be chosen as the focal object, for example words, light, colors, geometric forms, ideas etc. Continuous practice should result in relaxation, clarity of mind and calmness.</P>
<P>
<B>Mindfulness meditation</B> emphasizes an open awareness to any contents of the mind that are emerging. After a period of practice the patient should develop a sustainable attentive observational capability, without reacting to their own thoughts and emotions. Achieving this state of mindfulness and equanimity helps to retrain or decondition previous patterns of reaction which are usually poorly adapted to external reality. This form of meditation is commonly represented by mindfulness-based stress reduction programs (<LINK REF="REF-Kabat_x002d_Zinn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabat-Zinn 1992</LINK>). The techniques of mindfulness meditation, with their emphasis on developing detached observation and awareness of the contents of consciousness, may represent a powerful cognitive behavioral coping strategy for transforming the ways in which we respond to life events (<LINK REF="REF-Astin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astin 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meditation, either concentrative or mindfulness, is able to enhance the attentional ability of the practitioners. Whilst concentrative meditation emphasizes sustained attention, mindfulness meditation aims to improve self-control and inhibitions to various internal and external stimuli, thereby helping to relieve the core symptoms of ADHD. However, any single meditation program will usually use both concentrative and mindfulness together.</P>
<P>Recently, five broad categories of meditation practices were identified by a group of experts using modified Delphi methodology (<LINK REF="REF-Ospina-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ospina 2007</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Mantra meditation (comprising the Transcendental Meditation® technique (TM®), Relaxation Response (RR) and Clinically Standardized Meditation (CSM)).</LI>
<LI>Mindfulness meditation (comprising Vipassana, Zen Buddhist meditation, Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)).</LI>
<LI>Yoga (various yogic meditative techniques).</LI>
<LI>Tai Chi (encompassing Chinese traditional exercises that promote posture, flexibility, relaxation, well-being and mental concentration).</LI>
<LI>Qi Gong (a category of 'energy healing', including Reiki, therapeutic touch and the Korean practice of Chundosunbup).</LI>
</UL>
<P>However, in this review we adhere to the old classification since it is generally well accepted and commonly used in the literature, although both classifications substantially overlap.</P>
<P>Thus, the operational definitions of meditation are the specific techniques of mind training which have two fundamental attentional strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Barrows-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrows 2002</LINK>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Concentrative meditation entails sustained attention directed towards a single object or point of focus. The aim is one-pointed attention to a single perception without distraction in order to produce concentration or a one-minded state.</LI>
<LI>Mindfulness meditation (opening-up, insight meditation) involves the continual maintenance of a specific perceptual-cognitive mind set towards objects as they spontaneously arise in ones awareness with a non-reactive attitude. The salient features are full awareness or mindfulness of any contents of consciousness with equanimity.</LI>
</OL>
<P>There are many methods which represent meditation in the above definitions, i.e. insight meditation, mindfulness-based meditation, Vipassana, Qiqong therapy, yoga (Asana, Pranayama, Raja yoga, Asthanga yoga, Laya yoga, Sahaj Marg etc), Tai Chi, Transcendental Meditation, Kundalini yoga, Anapanasathi (Buddhist breathing meditation), Zen and ChunDoSupBup. It is noted that Asana yoga (yoga of posture) and Tai Chi are also considered to be dynamic aspects of concentrative meditation.</P>
<P>Although historically meditation is associated with religious or spiritual movements, this is no longer always the case. It is now necessary to confirm the effectiveness of these meditation techniques by using non-cult, faith-free and specifically designed methods to treat patients. Nowadays there are increasing numbers of organizations which use scientific-based, less mystical terms to identify their techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Krisanaprakornkit-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krisanaprakornkit 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-02-12 14:56:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thawatchai Krisanaprakornkit">
<P>Some reports exist which detail the usefulness of meditation for children with ADHD. Grosswald (reported in <LINK REF="REF-Micucci-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Micucci 2005</LINK>) conducted a study in April 2004 at Chelsea School in Silver Spring, Maryland, a private school for children with learning disabilities. The study compared ten students with ADHD before and after they learned and practiced Transcendental Meditation for ten minutes twice daily for three months. Participants reported being calmer, less distracted, less stressed and better able to control their anger and frustration. However, there was no control/comparison group in this study.</P>
<P>Preliminary bibliographic searching has not identified many studies using meditation therapy for ADHD. Jensen et al conducted a randomized controlled trial of the effect of yoga on boys with ADHD (n = 11) (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK>). This program consisted of respiratory training, postural training, relaxation training and concentration training and involved a technique called Trataka where participants focused on a word or shape, followed by seeing the image with their eyes closed and continuing to see the image on a blank piece of paper. The results only slightly supported the use of yoga for ADHD and there were some limitations of this study, such as low statistical power and inconsistency of home practices.</P>
<P>Hassasiri et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hassasiri-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hassasiri 2002</LINK>) developed a meditation program for children with ADHD in Thailand based on neo-humanist concepts which comprised meditation and imagery. The program was tested in a before-after design and found a statistically significant difference in change scores (P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>In terms of adverse effects, reports exist suggesting that meditation can cause temporary depersonalization and derealization (<LINK REF="REF-Castillo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castillo 1990</LINK>), and there are several reports of a possible association between meditation and psychotic state (<LINK REF="REF-Chan_x002d_Ob-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan-Ob 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-French-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lazarus-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazarus 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1979</LINK>). Studies of meditation in pediatric populations are still limited. It is not considered advisable for children to sit for extended lengths of time with closed eyes, which might in any case 'go against the grain' of the active nature of children. Different meditation techniques have different recommended practices for children, e.g. Sahaj Marg Meditation, a system of Raja yoga, recommends a minimum age of 18 before beginning the practice of meditation, implying that this technique is not suitable for younger people. In Transcendental Meditation, it is recommended that children of five years old meditate twice a day for five minutes at a time and thereafter add one minute for each year of their age until reaching 20-minute sessions when aged 20 and above. Reports of adverse effects of meditation in children are lacking.</P>

KT entered all relevant data into RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) and NC checked data for correctness. The reliability of data extraction and data entry were examined throughout the process.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-03-30 05:26:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Thawatchai Krisanaprakornkit">
<P>We assessed risk of bias in the included studies using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool, which is based on multiple domain evaluation (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). There are six domains as follows:</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation</P>
<P>Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment</P>
<P>Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel, outcome assessors</P>
<P>Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?</P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data</P>
<P>Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting</P>
<P>Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>6. Others sources of bias</P>
<P>Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>The review authors' judgments involved answering these questions for each entry, i.e. 'Yes' indicates low risk of bias; 'No' indicates high risk of bias; 'Unclear' indicates insufficient detail is reported or the risk of bias is unknown.</P>
<P>The risk of bias is presented in the 'Risk of bias' table with two additional figures: a 'Risk of bias graph' (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) and a 'Risk of bias summary' (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>To determine selective outcome reporting we planned to compare the study with its protocol, which might be registered in trial registries, however no included studies were registered in any trial registries. Two out of four included studies, however, came from PhD dissertations which had an extensive published report which could be used to determine the completeness of reporting indirectly (<LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>The summary assessment of risk of bias used the authors' judgment for primary outcomes (symptoms of ADHD, quantitative laboratory assessment measures of ADHD symptoms, overall incidence/severity of the problem behaviors) both within and across studies.</P>

Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK>) mentioned the meditation room, which was a quiet room with low lighting and comfortable chairs. Both studies of mind-based meditation (<LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK>) used a padded, straight-back chair. <LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK> did not give details about their settings.

<P>All participants were children with ADHD, with an age range between six and 13 years old. Three of the studies indicated that participants must be boys in the inclusion criteria; only (<LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK>) included girls. Three studies reported that they used the DSM diagnostic system (DSM-III, DSM-IV). One study, which was carried out in Germany (<LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK>), used the Diagnostic System for Psychic Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence, which corresponded to ICD-10 diagnosis. <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK> used Conners&#8217; Parent Rating Scales: Long (CPRS: R (L)) that demonstrated scores (over 70 t-score) to confirm the diagnosis of ADHD in all participants. <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK> used a multidisciplinary intake committee to confirm the diagnosis. In the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK>) no diagnostic re-confirmation procedures were used.</P>

<P>Two studies used mantra meditation, which is mind-based. <LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK> used the word "Ahnam", a Sanskrit word which means "nameless". <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK> used "One", with the aim that by repeating the word the participants would learn to focus and re-focus their attention. These techniques were adapted from the well-known concentrative meditation developed by <LINK REF="REF-Benson-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 1975</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Carrington-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrington 1975</LINK>, which has some roots in the Hindu religion. Apart from the different mantra used in their studies, other aspects of the intervention (duration, frequency, sitting position, passive attitude) were almost the same.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK> used Hatha yoga, which is more physical-based. However, <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK> also used a visualization technique to accompany Hatha yoga and <LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK> used breathing meditation combined with postures. They claimed that their yoga program was a standardized program and developed by a yoga instructor. The yoga program consisted of multiple components (respiratory, postural, relaxation concentration training). The details of each program are described below.</P>
<P>Concerning the qualification and skills of the meditation instructors, only <LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK> used a well-trained yoga teacher while in the other three included studies the subjects were taught by the investigators themselves.</P>
<P>The intervention program ranged from four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK>), to eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK>) to 20 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK>). The frequency of visits varied from one session per week (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK>) to three sessions per week (<LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK>). Some studies used the parents to assist and supervise their children while practicing meditation at home (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK>), while <LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK> just let the children practice yoga freely on their own at home or at school during the intervention period.</P>
<P>The intensity of meditation is determined from the duration of practice. <LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK> used a one-hour training session but do not mention the exact time spent in meditation. <LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK> state that the actual meditation duration was gradually increased from one minute to eight minutes by the end of the four-week training period.</P>

The method of allocation concealment was not reported in any trial but because <LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK> used the drawing of lots we have assumed that allocation concealment automatically occurred because the sequence cannot be known in advance.

In <LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK> the randomization method was modified to equalize the medicated children evenly between each group.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-21 03:42:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Thawatchai Krisanaprakornkit">
<P>Four studies were included in this review. Two studies were dissertations submitted to the faculty of the Department of Psychology at St. John's University, New York in 1983 and 1987 (<LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK>). One study was carried out in Sydney, Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK>) and the other in Heidelburg, Germany (<LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK>). The first randomized controlled trial using meditation for ADHD was the study of <LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK>, which took place 25 years ago. Further studies have followed Kratter's trial but many of these have used a before-after design which has several methodological limitations. These studies were excluded from the review (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hassasiri-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hassasiri 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zylowska-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zylowska 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK> were randomized controlled trials with different comparators: 1) meditation therapy versus drug therapy, 2) meditation therapy versus standard treatment without drugs, 3) meditation therapy versus relaxation training versus waiting list controls with drugs and 4) Hatha yoga versus non-specific physical exercise.</P>
<P>The type of meditation used in these trials can be differentiated into two groups according to the different characteristics of meditation. Mind-based meditation (mantra meditation) was used in the <LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK> studies. Physical-based meditation was used in <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK>. Mind-based meditation emphasizes the cognitive process which focuses on the use of selective deployment of attention: the participants learned to focus and re-focus their attention (<LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK>). Physical-based meditation (Hatha yoga, moving meditation) focuses on behavioral control. However, due to the complexity of body-mind interaction, and the concept of holistic approach, it is hard to differentiate body and mind and each meditation technique usually incorporates both components together. Due to the variety of theories and practices of meditation the inclusion of different techniques under the same umbrella of meditation is inappropriate. Five broad categories of meditation practice were identified by a group of experts using modified Delphi methodology: mantra meditation (comprising the Transcendental Meditation® technique (TM®), Relaxation Response (RR) and Clinically Standardized Meditation (CSM)), mindfulness meditation (comprising Vipassana, Zen Buddhist meditation, Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)), yoga, Tai Chi and Qi Gong (<LINK REF="REF-Ospina-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ospina 2007</LINK>)). The classifications in this system are more suited to defining the broad range and variety of meditation than the previously used classification (concentrative meditation and mindfulness meditation). The four included studies in this review fell into the categories of mantra meditation and yoga by this classification.</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK> used a well-trained yoga teacher while participants in <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK> were taught by the investigators themselves. Qualification and experience in teaching meditation are important to guarantee proper teaching. When applying meditation therapy in clinical settings, the knowledge, attitude and skill of the therapist should be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Krisanaprakornkit-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krisanaprakornkit 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were only two studies from which the data were appropriate for meta-analysis. Due to the limited number of studies, small sample size in each trial, apparent risk of bias and skew-ness of data we found no consistent evidence that meditation (either mind-based or physical-based) had a significant effect on core ADHD symptoms or psychological tests of attention, impulsivity and distraction. Mind-based meditation did not yield any significantly different effects compared to drugs and standard therapy controls. While physical-based meditation (Hatha yoga) showed some positive effects (parent rating attention-deficit, attention test), it did not show consistent results.</P>
<P>All of the included studies had differences in the number of meditation sessions and the amount and quality of home practice, which could affect the treatment effects. Some studies used the parents to assist and supervise their children while practicing meditation at home (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK> just let the children practice yoga freely on their own at home, at school and during lessons. Therefore the intensity of practice differed widely among participants and studies. There were no descriptions of monitoring of practice at home in any studies, therefore the quality and quantity of self-practice could not be guaranteed. This might be affected the results of each studies.</P>
<P>Data for the side effects of meditation and quality of life were not reported in any trials. Randomized trials usually focus on intended effects and focus less on possible adverse effects. Data on adverse effects are often sparse but the absence of information does not mean that the intervention is safe (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). The issue of side effects should therefore be addressed in any future meditation trials.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of any types of meditation for ADHD at present given that only four randomized controlled trials have been carried out, and all were relatively small in size and limited in design, with inconsistent results across the outcomes.<BR/>
</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-05-12 14:00:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>We considered the parent rating, teacher rating and self-rating ADHD symptoms scales to be the most important outcomes for patients. Quantitative laboratory assessment measures of ADHD symptoms, psychological testing etc. are surrogate outcomes which are less important. In the included studies all the participants were children with ADHD, therefore a self-rating scale is not necessary to measure outcomes because it is difficult for school-age children to rate their symptoms accurately.</P>
<P>No studies gave details of adverse effects, but this is an important outcome to be considered in every study, especially in trials in children. Despite this, a well-structured meditation program is considered safe and is promoted for children in many settings, including schools (<LINK REF="REF-Helen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In our protocol for this review we defined 'Overall severity of problem behaviors' and 'Quality of life' as outcome measures because these outcomes provide a broader perspective on the patient's life rather than merely focusing on symptoms. Meditation can not only improve attention but also the quality of mind (calmness, equanimity, contentment), all of which can affect the life of a patient as a whole (<LINK REF="REF-Ospina-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ospina 2007</LINK>). Outcomes which are measured at the end of a program cannot detect intermediate-term and long-term changes in personality profile. Data will be more complete if trials can follow up outcomes for six months to 12 months afterwards.</P>
<P>Due to the lack of consistent evidence to support the use of meditation for ADHD in the present review, we cannot comment on applicability and generalizability at this time. In some countries, for example Thailand, meditation is accepted as a means to improve attention, temperament, discipline, school performance, character, morals and for religious purposes (<LINK REF="REF-Krisanaprakornkit-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krisanaprakornkit 2006</LINK>). The included studies were carried out in the USA, Germany and Australia. As the effects of globalization and the holistic view of health expand, meditation may become more accepted and widely used in the clinical setting. Therefore, if the effectiveness of meditation can be established, it may be used more widely as a therapy in the future.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-02-04 06:28:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thawatchai Krisanaprakornkit">
<P>In a Cochrane Review the quality of evidence reflects the extent to which we are confident that an estimate of the effect is correct. We therefore rate the quality of evidence for each outcome separately.</P>
<P>Two included studies were dissertations submitted to the faculty of the Department of Psychology at St. John's University, New York in 1983 and 1987 (<LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK>). We have assumed that the dissertations were generally supervised and verified by the committee. The inclusion of dissertations may mean more balanced results as they are less likely to overestimate treatment effects, as can occur in published trials (<LINK REF="REF-McLeod-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trial quality is discussed in the '<LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>' section, with graphical presentations in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. We then assessed the risk of bias for an outcome across studies using the GRADE system. We judged the quality of the evidence by assessing limitations in design, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias.</P>
<P>As such a limited number of trials was found, we suspect the possibility of publication bias. Concentrative meditation (mantra meditation) was introduced to the West during the 1960s and many pioneers in the field have developed modified forms of meditation suitable for use in the clinical setting, for example the 'relaxation response' of Herbert Benson (Bensonian meditation) (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 1975</LINK>). Mindfulness meditation has emerged as a new approach to stress reduction and is an important innovation in the treatment of psychiatric disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Baer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baer 2003</LINK>). The Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction Program (<LINK REF="REF-Kabat_x002d_Zinn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabat-Zinn 1992</LINK>) has subsequently been researched in ADHD adults and adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Zylowska-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zylowska 2008</LINK>). A Google search results in more than 1,170,000 hits for "meditation AND ADHD". This issue has also appeared in the news (e.g. 'Meditation helps kids with ADHD' (<LINK REF="REF-Helen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helen 2004</LINK>)) and meditation has gained acceptability in many primary and junior school in England (<LINK REF="REF-Eliaz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eliaz 2008</LINK>). Another reason for the small number of studies might be that meditation trials are less supported than medication trials, which may be funded by drug companies.</P>
<P>The graphical risk of bias presentations (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) show the serious limitations in design (high risk of bias) in the included studies overall. Randomization methods are not mentioned, therefore we cannot assess the adequacy of allocation concealment. Only the study of <LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK> described the use of the drawing of lots, which automatically concealed the allocation. There was no mention of blinding. In <LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK>, the yoga instructors themselves carried out the assessment of the participants in both the yoga and control group; detection bias was therefore inevitable. Only <LINK REF="STD-Haffner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haffner 2006</LINK> described the reason for drop-out of one participant (moved home). The attrition rate of the other three studies was unclear or not described. The drop-out rate might be related to adverse effects or to some discomfort with meditation.</P>
<P>The consistency of results across studies could not be determined because there was only one study to provide data for each comparison. However, when checking the direction of the result in any one study the inconsistency of outcomes in each study was obvious. Each study measured many outcomes. Some outcomes were considered to be important, while others were surrogate outcomes (e.g. attention test, distractibility test). When many outcomes are used in one study this will increase the possibility of a significant difference which occurred by chance. The authors may also selectively accentuate the significance of positive outcomes while omitting to clarify the negative outcomes (reporting bias).</P>
<P>Most of the means differences had wide confidence intervals reflecting the small sample size, differences in baseline characteristics of study samples and different treatment effects in individuals.</P>
<P>No studies had problems of indirectness of evidence.</P>
<P>We therefore summarized quality for each comparison as follows.</P>
<P>
<I>Meditation therapy compared to drug therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder</I>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was "very low" according to the GRADE classification for 'Teacher rating ADHD overall scale' (see Summary of findings table 1).</P>
<P>
<I>Meditation therapy compared to standard treatment without drug for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder </I>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was "very low" according to the GRADE classification for 'Teacher rating ADHD overall scale' (see Summary of findings table 2).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-02-03 07:27:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thawatchai Krisanaprakornkit">
<P>Meditation for ADHD has been reviewed as a psychological treatment along with other psychosocial interventions. At this time there is no specific systematic review of meditation for ADHD only. <LINK REF="REF-Arnold-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 2001</LINK> was a narrative review on alternative treatment for adults with ADHD. This review included the two studies of <LINK REF="STD-Kratter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kratter 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moretti_x002d_Altuna-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti-Altuna 1987</LINK>, which were carried out in children with ADHD. The authors concluded that meditation showed some benefit and warrants further study for both children and adults. The recent narrative review by <LINK REF="REF-Greydanus-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greydanus 2007</LINK> emphasized medication and meditation was only mentioned under the heading of psychological management, which included many types of psychological interventions (psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, support groups, parent training, educator/teacher training, biofeedback, meditation and social skills training). The authors stated that empirical evidence regarding these interventions was inconsistent (<LINK REF="REF-Greydanus-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greydanus 2007</LINK>). These narrative reviews commonly failed to assess the methodological quality of the primary studies, therefore the results tend to overestimate the effects.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-02-03 07:27:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Thawatchai Krisanaprakornkit">
<P>There is a lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of meditation for ADHD. This review has highlighted the need for further research. Meditation therapy research protocols need to be rigorous in design and delivery, and use standardized meditation therapy programs which can be replicated by other researchers. The operational definition of meditation techniques used should be specified and relate to ADHD core symptoms. The trainers should be skilled or be experts in the meditation methods used. The monitoring of meditation practice at home in addition to the therapy sessions is a crucial element of adherence. The involvement of parents in practice should be considered and controlled. The concomitant use of medication should be distributed evenly between comparison groups. All the outcomes should be validated and described, including adverse effects. We plan to update this review within 24 months to incorporate any new studies and respond to any comments or criticisms.</P>

<P>We changed some sources of databases to be searched. We searched LILACS through the Virtual Health Library (VHL) in BIREME: Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which incorporates many bibliographic databases in general health science (LILACS, MEDLINE, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, SciELO), specialized areas (ADOLEC, BBO, BDENF, DESASTRES, HISA, HOMEOINDEX, LEYES, MEDCARIB, REPIDISCA) and international agencies (PAHO, WHOLIS).</P>
<P>The CISCOM database of The Research Council for Complementary Medicine was closed, therefore we searched other complementary and alternative medicine databases, i.e. CAM on PubMed, the web-site of the Cochrane Complementary and Alternative Health field, the Complementary Medicine Resources for Health Professionals and Researchers, and the Complementary and Alternative Therapies databases of Bandolier.</P>

<P>Intervention 1: body-oriented yoga exercise program</P>
<P>A standardized program consisting of elements of Hatha yoga (postures, breathing exercises, meditative exercises) especially developed for children with ADHD, consisting of 16 exercise units for children and documented in a therapy manual</P>
<P>Individual practice of yoga at home or school was carried out by each participant independently, without schedule</P>
<P>Intervention 2: conventional motor training exercises</P>
<P>A program of various well-known active games was put together. These contained all the elements that occur in normal grade school and leisure-sport activities (running games, throwing and catching games, agility games, ball games, concentration games, social games) and are thus fundamentally different from the yoga exercises.</P>
<P>Using a cross-over study design, both groups received 2 consecutive 8-week intervention/training sessions (each with 2 training sessions of 1 hour per week), separated by a training break of 6 weeks</P>

<P>Participants were also required to be fluent in English and free from serious family pathology (e.g. parental clinical depression or substance abuse, criminality in one or both parents, or domestic violence). Families with these characteristics were excluded because they were unlikely to be compliant with the extensive time commitment required.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dichotomous outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We will pool dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) as the summary statistic. In cases where the numbers of participants and numbers of events are not available, but results calculated from them are (risk ratio, odds ratio, adjusted odds ratio), we will include the data in meta-analyses only if they are accompanied by measures of uncertainty such as 95% confidence intervals or exact P values. We will then pool the study-specific effect sizes using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan 5.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Continuous outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We will analyze data for continuous outcomes in RevMan 5.0 using either mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) if continuous outcomes are measured with similar, but not identical, instruments across studies. If the studies provide another statistic other than means and standard deviations (e.g. standard error, t-value, P value) we will perform the proper mathematical transformation to obtain standard deviations.</P>
<P>To ensure the appropriateness of meta-analysis, the following standards will be applied to all data before inclusion. To check for skewed data we will compare the mean to the standard deviation. If the mean is smaller than twice the<SUP> </SUP>standard deviation the data is probably skewed (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). For data with finite limits, such as endpoint data, the observed mean minus the lowest possible value (or the highest possible value minus the observed mean), and dividing by the standard deviation. If the ratio is less than 1 there is strong evidence of a skewed distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). We will reveal the skewed data in additional tables. The endpoint score with standard deviation will be considered first in analysis if both endpoint score and change score are available. In cases where only change score is reported, we will contact authors of studies for endpoint figures. If only the change score is available, standard deviation of change score is needed for analysis and, if available, we will combine the data with endpoint scores (unless the standardized mean difference is used). If the available data cannot be managed by the above methods, we will present the data in 'other data' tables and use a narrative approach to synthesis.</P>
<P>If adjusted estimates of mean differences are presented from multiple regression analyses and analyses of covariance, the process of data extraction and analysis using the generic inverse variance method will be performed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>For cross-over studies, to exclude the potential additive effect in the second or further stages of these trials, we will only use data from the first stage in analysis. In studies with multiple treatment groups, we will carry out the analysis for each pair between meditation and other treatments. In studies with cluster-randomization (e.g. randomization by clinician or treatment settings), unless the cluster effect was accounted for, analysis and pooling of clustered data will result in unit of analysis error and overestimate statistical significance. In these cases, we will contact the authors of studies will be contacted to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) of their clustered data and adjust by using accepted methods after consulting the Cochrane Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems Group. Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-clustered randomized study. If the cluster effect was not accounted for in primary studies and the ICC was not available, we will present the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. The imputation of appropriate effect will be done by using the 'design effect' to calculate effective sample size. The design effect is 1+(m - 1)r, where m is the average cluster size and r is the intra-cluster correlation coefficient. If the ICC was not reported it will be assumed to be 0.05 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In studies with repeated measures, we will carry out the analysis by separating the outcomes into short-term (up to three months), intermediate-term (three to 12 months) and long-term (more than 12 months).<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>For included studies which used an intention-to-treat analysis by filling in or imputation of data for missing cases (such as last observation carried forward method or assumed no changes), we will contact authors for available data.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out a test for homogeneity and calculate the I<SUP>2</SUP>statistic, which provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity, using Review Manager 5.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heterogeneity can occur from many sources. An important aspect of every meta-analysis is to consider and emphasize the existence of heterogeneity and to take account of this in the interpretation of results. Sources of heterogeneity (clinical heterogeneity) can be divided in to two groups: clinical data and type of meditation.</P>
<P>Clinical data:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Subtypes of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders, etc.</LI>
<LI>Disorder severity and chronicity: mild, moderate, severe.</LI>
<LI>Comorbidity of emotional/psychiatric problems, speech /language problems, learning problems, psychosocial problems, conduct disorder.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Type of meditation:</P>
<P>(a) Techniques:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Concentrative, mindfulness meditation or combination.</LI>
<LI>Combination of different techniques of meditation (physical and mental practice, such as yoga).</LI>
<LI>Other ingredients of treatment: group activities, prayer, recreational activities, etc.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(b) Intensity and frequency of practice: duration of meditation per treatment session, frequency of practice, duration of practice.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Different follow-up periods: at the end of trial, any specified period after trial, repeated follow-up measures.</LI>
<LI>Multi-component intervention: drugs, counseling, biofeedback, parent training, psychotherapy, family therapy, etc.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analysis should only be considered when a group of trials is sufficiently homogeneous in terms of participants, interventions and outcomes to provide a meaningful summary. We will use a fixed-effect model for all analyses if there is no statistical heterogeneity. We may use a random-effects meta-analysis to incorporate heterogeneity among trials only after exploring the causes of heterogeneity or when heterogeneity cannot readily be explained.</P>
<P>The data analysis will seek to answer the following questions.</P>
<OL>
<LI>What is the direction of effect of meditation?</LI>
<LI>What is the size of the effect of meditation?</LI>
<LI>Is the effect of meditation consistent across studies?</LI>
<LI>What is the strength of evidence for the effect of meditation?</LI>
</OL>
<P>Any meta-analysis will consider the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Different types of outcome (dichotomous, continuous, survival data).</LI>
<LI>Study design.</LI>
<LI>Follow up length (short-term, intermediate, long-term).</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Due to clear differences in characteristics, rather than undertaking an overall pooled analysis, we will analyze the data in subgroups according to the following categories.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Childhood (under 13 years).</LI>
<LI>Adolescence (13 to 18 years).</LI>
<LI>Adult ADHD (age more than 18 years).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We will only undertake subgroup analyses if a sufficient number of studies is identified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We will use a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of effects of assumptions by examining the influence of the following on the results of the statistical analyses:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the effect of the quality criteria (determine the effect of studies with high risk of bias on the overall effect); and</LI>
<LI>blinding (masking) of raters.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
