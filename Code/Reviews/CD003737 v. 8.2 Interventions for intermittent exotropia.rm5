<P>The updated version of this review includes a broader spectrum of intermittent exotropia: initially we restricted inclusion to studies specifying intermittent distance exotropia. However in many cases distance and basic types of intermittent exotropia are not differentiated from each other and are pooled together. This is consistent with clinical observations which often show an individual to change from distance to basic from visit to visit.</P>
<P>In light of the amended inclusion criteria, one study previously excluded, now qualifies for inclusion.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-04-06 11:39:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Strabismus is a condition in which the eyes are not normally aligned, that is one eye looks straight ahead whilst the other eye turns inwards, outwards, up or down. Most cases of childhood onset strabismus are present constantly, but some types are intermittent that is only present sometimes. In intermittent exotropia (X(T)) an eye intermittently turns outwards (exotropia), typically more when looking into the distance, when tired or day-dreaming. When the child focuses on something close, the eye usually moves back to the centre. The eyes typically work together normally when the exotropia is controlled. When the exotropia occurs, the image from one eye is usually switched off or 'suppressed'. Treatment for X(T) may be sought to improve the appearance of misalignment or if there is concern that it is affecting the ability of the eyes to work together. Treatment typically consists of surgery on the muscles around the eye, either on the outside muscle of both eyes or on the inside and outside muscle of one eye. Exercises to strengthen the muscles may sometimes be used; sometimes patching or glasses for short or near sightedness can be tried. There is currently not a clear understanding of which treatments work most effectively and at what point any treatment should be given. We searched for studies where participants with X(T) had been randomised to receive treatment. The aim was to understand which treatments are most effective at correcting the exotropia without causing any harm. The one study included in this review was conducted by a single surgeon in the USA and compared surgery on one eye to surgery on both eyes in 36 children with the basic type of X(T). Success was defined as no exotropia (or other strabismus) one year following surgery. The study found that surgery on one eye was more effective (82% success) than surgery on both eyes (52% success). There are many studies of X(T) in the current literature but the methods used make it difficult to reliably interpret the results. Furthermore, there is a worrying lack of evidence regarding the natural history of X(T) and poor validation of measures of severity. There is a clear need for further randomised studies to provide more reliable evidence for the management of this condition.</P>

<P>The clinical management of intermittent exotropia has been discussed extensively in the literature, yet there remains a lack of clarity regarding indications for intervention, the most effective form of treatment and whether or not there is an optimal time in the evolution of the disease at which any treatment should be carried out.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-04-06 11:30:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The objective of this review was to analyse the effects of various surgical and non-surgical treatments in randomised trials of participants with intermittent exotropia, and to report intervention criteria and determine the significance of factors such as age with respect to outcome.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-03-26 11:03:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (<I>The Cochrane Library, </I>Issue 4, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2012), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to May 2012), the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT) (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/">www.controlled-trials.com</A>), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en">www.who.int/ictrp/search/en</A>). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 4 May 2012. We are no longer searching the UK Clinical Trials Gateway (UKCTG) for this review. We manually searched the British Orthoptic Journal up to 2002, and the proceedings of the European Strabismological Association (ESA), International Strabismological Association (ISA) and American Academy of Paediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus meeting (AAPOS) up to 2001. We contacted researchers who are active in the field for information about further published or unpublished studies.</P>

<P>The available literature consists mainly of retrospective case reviews, which are difficult to reliably interpret and analyse. The one randomised trial included found unilateral surgery more effective than bilateral surgery for basic intermittent exotropia. However, across all identified studies, measures of severity and thus criteria for intervention are poorly validated, and there appear to be no reliable natural history data. There is therefore a pressing need for improved measures of severity, a better understanding of the natural history and carefully planned clinical trials of treatment to improve the evidence base for the management of this condition.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Ocular misalignment (strabismus) develops in approximately 5% of developmentally normal children (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1974</LINK>). Of these approximately 25% present with an outward turning ocular deviation or exotropia (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1992</LINK>). The most common type of childhood onset exotropia is intermittent exotropia (X(T)) (<LINK REF="REF-Mohney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohney 2003</LINK>), with a reported incidence rate of 32.1/100,000 in children under 19 years of age in the United States of America (<LINK REF="REF-Govindan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Govindan 2004</LINK>) and occurring more frequently in Asian populations (<LINK REF="REF-Chia-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chia 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matsuo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuo 2005</LINK>), in latitudes with greater sunlight (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1992</LINK>) and in females (<LINK REF="REF-Nusz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nusz 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The term 'intermittent exotropia' may be used to describe any non-constant exotropia but it is typically (and throughout this review) used to describe the type of exodeviation that is present predominantly at distance fixation with or without deviation at near fixation. Pseudonyms include distance exotropia, divergence excess exotropia, periodic exotropia and exotropia of inattention. Intermittent exotropia is sometimes subdivided into 'basic' and 'distance' subtypes but clinical characteristics are very similar for these subtypes of X(T) and, as investigation and management are also essentially the same (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1977</LINK>), they are considered together in this review and jointly referred to as 'intermittent exotropia' or X(T).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Natural history</HEADING>
<P>The natural history of X(T) is not well documented. An early study by von Noorden (<LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 1966</LINK>) is quoted (<LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 2002</LINK>) as finding 75% of patients progressing over an average of three years, but the original report is unavailable. Conversely, a contemporary report by Hiles (<LINK REF="REF-Hiles-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiles 1968</LINK>) reported six year follow-up angle data on X(T) patients who 'for various reasons' were not operated upon and found that 81% showed no change. Findings vary among more recent studies also, some reporting that most cases improve over time (<LINK REF="REF-Rutstein-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutstein 2003</LINK>), some that most remain stable (<LINK REF="REF-Chia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kii-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kii 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Romanchuk-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romanchuk 2006</LINK>) and others that most will deteriorate (<LINK REF="REF-Nusz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nusz 2005</LINK>). However, all these studies are retrospective reviews of participants who did not have surgery (or follow up until surgery was performed) and criteria for surgical intervention were not standardised, biasing results. Most current teaching texts describe X(T) as generally being progressive (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Santiago-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santiago 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 2002</LINK>), but in the absence of rigorous studies the true natural history of X(T) remains uncertain. A multicentre, randomised controlled trial that aims to report natural history data is currently underway in the United States (http://ClinicalTrials.gov/show/NCT01032330). The completion date is 2015 and results will be included in updates of this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Clinical characteristics</HEADING>
<P>The onset of X(T) is thought to be in the first year of life (<LINK REF="REF-Costenbader-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costenbader 1950</LINK>). The aetiology is unknown although various anatomical, innervational, sensory and genetic factors have been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Burian-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burian 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jampolsky-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jampolsky 1962</LINK>). The characteristic features of X(T) are unique: one eye deviates outward, typically when viewing a distant object, during periods of inattention, in bright sunlight or when the person is tired (<LINK REF="REF-Burian-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burian 1966</LINK>). Closure of one eye in bright sunlight, sensitivity to sunlight (<LINK REF="REF-Campos-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campos 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiggins-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiggins 1990</LINK>) and panoramic viewing (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Costenbader-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costenbader 1950</LINK>) are other common features of X(T). Diplopia (double vision) appears to be rarely noticed as suppression occurs when the deviation is manifest (<LINK REF="REF-Parks-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parks 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pratt_x002d_Johnson-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt-Johnson 1969</LINK>).</P>
<P>Normal use of the eyes together at near fixation (binocular single vision (BSV)) and normal near stereoacuity (three dimensional vision or depth perception) can usually be demonstrated when the exotropia is controlled (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neal-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neal 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stathacopoulos-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stathacopoulos 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yildirim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yildirim 2000</LINK>). However, a proportion of people with X(T) demonstrate subnormal BSV and reduced near stereoacuity due to monofixation syndrome (23% <LINK REF="REF-Baker-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1979</LINK>; 31% <LINK REF="REF-Beneish-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beneish 1994</LINK>; 11.3% <LINK REF="REF-Yildirim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yildirim 2000</LINK>; and in another study, between 36% and 55% depending on the test used <LINK REF="REF-Hatt-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatt 2010a</LINK>), a feature that is recognised to be part of the spectrum of the disease.</P>
<P>Visual acuity is typically normal in both eyes. A United States study reported amblyopia present only rarely (4.5%) and a normal distribution of refractive errors (<LINK REF="REF-Mohney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohney 2003</LINK>). Other studies report a higher prevalence of myopia in children with X(T) compared to the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Caltrider-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caltrider 1983</LINK>). In Asian populations there is a preponderance of myopia (43%) in children with X(T) compared to children with esotropia (inward turning strabismus) (<LINK REF="REF-Chia-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chia 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intermittent exotropia may be associated with other eye movement anomalies, mainly overaction of the inferior oblique muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1989</LINK>) and lateral incomitance (a decrease in amount of exodeviation on side gaze) (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Repka-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Repka 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 2002</LINK>). The reported incidence of lateral incomitance varies (9% <LINK REF="REF-Repka-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Repka 1991</LINK>; 22% <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1969</LINK>; 60% <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1981</LINK>) and, importantly, may be erroneously induced as an artifact of testing (<LINK REF="REF-Repka-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Repka 1991</LINK>). Systemic associations with X(T) include mental illness, with a recent study reporting a higher incidence of mental illnesses in patients with X(T) compared to patients with esotropia and compared to the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Mohney-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohney 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Diagnostic tests</HEADING>
<P>A diagnosis of X(T) is made using the cover test and by measuring the magnitude of exodeviation, typically using the prism cover test. These tests are performed with the individual fixing on an accommodative target at distance fixation and then at near fixation. The cover test shows an intermittent or constant exotropia either at distance fixation only or also at near fixation. Additional measurement of the exodeviation with the individual fixing on a far distance target has been recommended to uncover the maximum misalignment (<LINK REF="REF-Burian-1971b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burian 1971b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knapp-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knapp 1960</LINK>; Kushner 1998b).</P>
<P>Measurement of the exodeviation using the prism cover test at distance and near provides information regarding the degree of misalignment and subtype of X(T). The basic type of X(T) shows a similar angle of deviation at distance and near, and the distance type of X(T) shows a greater deviation at distance fixation. The distance type (or 'divergence excess') was originally described as an exodeviation measuring at least 10 prism dioptres greater at distance than near (<LINK REF="REF-Burian-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burian 1965</LINK>). The distance type has been subdivided into 'simulated' (pseudo) or 'true' types based on the presence or absence of fusion (motor control of eye position) or focusing mechanisms at near: in the 'simulated' distance X(T) the near angle of deviation increases, either when fusion is disrupted (by occlusion of one eye) or focusing is relaxed (with plus lenses) (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kushner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushner 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walklate-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walklate 1998</LINK>) so that, under those conditions, the deviation appears more like the basic type of X(T). In the 'true' type of distance X(T) the angle remains smaller at near despite manipulation of focusing and fusing mechanisms. When assessed in this way, &#8216;true&#8217; distance X(T) appears to be relatively uncommon (<LINK REF="REF-Kushner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushner 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walklate-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walklate 1998</LINK>). Determining whether or not a patient has basic X(T), simulated distance X(T), or true distance X(T) is considered important prior to any surgery because different surgical approaches have been recommended depending on the subtype (<LINK REF="REF-Burian-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burian 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardesty-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardesty 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kushner-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Kushner 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 2002</LINK>). However, some have suggested that surgery should be based on the distance deviation alone (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoller-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoller 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Severity of X(T)</HEADING>
<P>Determining the severity of X(T) relies principally on evaluating: 1) angle of exodeviation, 2) ability to control the exodeviation, and 3) stereoacuity (as an indicator of the quality of BSV). Traditionally, patients with a large angle of exodeviation, poor control or reduced stereoacuity, or a combination, are considered more severe. However, quantification of severity is poorly standardised.</P>
<P>1. Angle of deviation: there is no clearly defined threshold at which the angle of exodeviation is recognised as more severe. In addition, the angle cannot be considered in isolation from the ability to control, with a small but nearly constant exodeviation presenting a greater threat to binocularity than a large but well controlled exodeviation. There does not appear to be a strong correlation between angle of deviation and ability to control. Test-retest data on angle of deviaton were recently reported (<LINK REF="REF-Hatt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatt 2012</LINK>) and at distance were 3.4 prism dioptres for angles &lt; 20 prism dioptres and 7.2 prim dioptres for angles &gt; 20 prism dioptres. These data provide guidelines for evaluating change in angle over time. Data in children with esotropia have been reported (PEDIG 2008) but may not translate to children with X(T) as there may be greater variability in the underlying condition.</P>
<P>2. Control: recently developed control scales enable quantification of ability to control the exodeviation at a given point in time (<LINK REF="REF-Chia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haggerty-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haggerty 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohney 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petrunak-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrunak 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stathacopoulos-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stathacopoulos 1993</LINK>). However considerable variation in control is now known to occur (<LINK REF="REF-Hatt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatt 2007</LINK>). Parental observations are often used and are incorporated into some control scales (<LINK REF="REF-Haggerty-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haggerty 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stathacopoulos-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stathacopoulos 1993</LINK>). However these non-standardised observations will vary depending on how much time a parent spends with their child etc. Recently, the average of three measures of control during an examination has been shown to be superior to single or double (average of two) measures of control, as it more closely represents the patient's control over the whole day (<LINK REF="REF-Hatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatt 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>3. Stereoacuity: deterioration of near stereoacuity to below normal thresholds, or loss of near stereoacuity, is taken to be a sign of increasing severity, although this is rarely reported. A recent study by Holmes et al (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2011</LINK>) reported infrequent deterioration of near stereoacuity in a cohort of children with X(T). More recently, distance stereoacuity testing has increasingly become part of clinical assessment, with deterioration in or loss of distance stereoacuity suggested as a sign of increased severity (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neal-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neal 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stathacopoulos-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stathacopoulos 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yildirim-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yildirim 1999</LINK>). Of note, distance stereoacuity may measure as either normal or subnormal in patients with X(T) depending on the test used (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2007</LINK>). Children with X(T) seem to show greater test-retest variability than patients with constant strabismus (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008</LINK>). It is important to remember that some patients with X(T) have reduced or no measurable stereoacuity at baseline due to monofixation syndrome.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-04-07 12:23:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As children with X(T) do not generally report symptoms such as asthenopia (frontal headaches and eyestrain) or diplopia, the aim of treatment is often to normalise or improve ocular alignment whilst maintaining or improving binocular functions and stereoacuity. For this majority of children with X(T) who are asymptomatic, criteria for intervention are poorly defined. Generally treatment may be offered if the physician or parents, or both, estimate the amount of time the eyes are misaligned (exotropic) to be equal to or greater than the amount of time they are aligned and working together. That is, exotropia present greater than or equal to 50% of waking hours (<LINK REF="REF-Santiago-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santiago 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 2002</LINK>) is often used as a guideline and is based on concerns that in children extended periods of misalignment cause suppression to become established resulting in loss of BSV (<LINK REF="REF-Pratt_x002d_Johnson-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt-Johnson 1969</LINK>). Intervention may also be instigated when the appearance of the exotropia is causing problems socially, or when there is a desire to avoid such social problems. Recent studies have explored the role of measuring health-related quality of life in children with X(T) to more formally measure these potential social and function concerns (<LINK REF="REF-Hatt-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatt 2010b</LINK>). Treatment may also be indicated if or when there is evidence of loss of stereoacuity, but this appears to be extremely rare.</P>

<P>Treatment may be either surgical, non-surgical or a combination of both.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Surgical treatment</HEADING>
<P>Surgery involves adjusting the position or length of the horizontally acting eye muscles. Surgery should result in a complete correction of the exotropia and restoration of normal binocular alignment at distance and near fixation. Most commonly one of the following procedures is undertaken.</P>
<P>1. Two muscle unilateral surgery: the medial rectus muscle (rotates the eye inwards) is strengthened and the lateral rectus muscle (rotates the eye outwards) is weakened.<BR/>2. Bilateral surgery: the lateral rectus muscle is weakened on both eyes.<BR/>3. One muscle unilateral surgery: one lateral rectus muscle is weakened.</P>
<P>The degree of muscle adjustment is usually tailored to the size of the strabismus although published surgical tables vary. It has been suggested that the effect of a given surgical dose may be influenced by factors such as magnitude of deviation preoperatively, the difference between distance and near deviation, and age at time of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1975</LINK>). A randomised trial by Kushner (<LINK REF="STD-Kushner-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Kushner 1998b</LINK>) concluded that surgery should aim to correct the maximum horizontal deviation, elicited either at far distance or following a period of occlusion, rather than the initial distance measurement. Prism adaptation or vergence after-effect testing is considered by some to be useful in determining the target angle for surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Dadeya-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dadeya 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohtsuki-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohtsuki 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical success rates often appear to be disappointing, with both undercorrection (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richard-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richard 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1981</LINK>) and overcorrection (<LINK REF="REF-Dunlap-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunlap 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edelman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelman 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ing-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ing 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pratt_x002d_Johnson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt-Johnson 1977</LINK>) recognised as causes of surgical failure. Recurrence of X(T) postoperatively appears a more common cause of failure than overcorrection (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1985</LINK>) and may occur more frequently over longer periods of follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Ekdawi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekdawi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maruo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maruo 2001</LINK>). Surgical failure due to persistent overcorrection (inward turning deviation) may cause diplopia, loss of normal BSV, reduction in stereoacuity and development of amblyopia (lazy eye). Reports of this complication range from 1.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Beneish-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beneish 1994</LINK>) to 27% (<LINK REF="REF-Edelman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelman 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some authors have suggested that successful alignment is more likely when there is an initial overcorrection of the deviation (<LINK REF="REF-Hardesty-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardesty 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keech-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keech 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raab-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raab 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1981</LINK>) that should resolve in the first six weeks following surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2000</LINK>). Others report that a planned initial overcorrection is of no benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Ing-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ing 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maruo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maruo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pratt_x002d_Johnson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt-Johnson 1977</LINK>). The age at surgery is thought by some to influence success; some authorities advocate early intervention to avoid entrenched suppression and achieve an optimal result (<LINK REF="REF-Abroms-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abroms 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Asjes_x002d_Tydeman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asjes-Tydeman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pratt_x002d_Johnson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt-Johnson 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pratt_x002d_Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt-Johnson 1994</LINK>), others suggest that surgery should be delayed until the child is older (<LINK REF="REF-Edelman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelman 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wickens-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wickens 1984</LINK>), and others have concluded that age at surgery makes no difference to the outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Beneish-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beneish 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Folk-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folk 1956</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ing-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ing 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richard-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richard 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoller-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoller 1994</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Non-surgical treatment</HEADING>
<P>Non-surgical treatment aims to encourage use of the eyes together by eliminating suppression (making the brain aware of the visual input from both eyes simultaneously), aiding recognition of diplopia when the eyes are misaligned, and building fusional reserves (motor control of the eyes) in order to aid control of the exodeviation.</P>
<P>Non-surgical treatment may consist of the following.</P>
<P>1. Exercises may be used to improve control of the deviation, usually in older children (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freeman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldrich-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldrich 1980</LINK>).<BR/>2. Part-time occlusion regimes (<LINK REF="REF-Flynn-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flynn 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freeman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spoor-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spoor 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suh 2006</LINK>) may result in improved control of the deviation, although long-term success is unknown with some reports noting only a temporary benefit.<BR/>3. Minus lens therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Caltrider-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caltrider 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watts 2005</LINK>) can be used to induce convergence (inward turning) and therefore reduce the amount of exodeviation. This treatment may be difficult in children with X(T) who do not otherwise need to wear glasses. Concerns that minus lens therapy may cause or increase myopia (near sightedness) appear to be unfounded (<LINK REF="REF-Kushner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutstein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutstein 1989</LINK>).<BR/>4. Prisms may be used to correct or overcorrect the exodeviation but often large amounts of prism are required and compliance may be difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Hardesty-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardesty 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pratt_x002d_Johnson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt-Johnson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ravault-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravault 1972</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other less commonly used non-surgical treatments are:</P>
<P>1. botulinum toxin injection into the lateral recti, with varying success (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 1997</LINK>); and<BR/>2. biofeedback, although this does not seem to have been adopted clinically (<LINK REF="REF-Goldrich-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldrich 1982</LINK>).</P>

Two authors independently reviewed the remaining references and identified one trial awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN04267774" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN04267774</LINK>) and four ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN44114892" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN44114892</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-IXT1-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IXT1 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-IXT2-2012" TYPE="STUDY">IXT2 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ACTRN12610001053011" TYPE="STUDY">ACTRN12610001053011</LINK>). The trial awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN04267774" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN04267774</LINK>) was completed in year 2003 but there was no published report yet. We contacted the trial investigator and did not receive any feedback. We did not identify any other completed studies that could be included.</P>

<P>In the included study (<LINK REF="STD-Kushner-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Kushner 1998a</LINK>) 36 patients with basic X(T) were randomised to two different surgical procedures: bilateral lateral rectus recession or unilateral lateral rectus recession with medial rectus resection. These groups were compared to each other and also to a non-randomised group of 68 patients with simulated distance exotropia who all underwent bilateral lateral recession surgery. The randomised comparison of those with basic X(T) was reported in this review.</P>
<P>Outcomes were assessed at least one year post surgery and recorded as either satisfactory or unsatisfactory. A satisfactory outcome was recorded if there was no tropia and between 10 dioptres exophoria and five dioptres esophoria at any distance on cover and prism cover testing. Any degree of tropia, phoria greater than that stated above (by implication) or any additional treatment was considered an unsatisfactory outcome. Stereoacuity was not reported pre- or postoperatively. The amount of surgery performed was standardised by using surgical formula tables.</P>

As it was unclear why or how participants were included in this study rather than the other study, and at what point participants were randomised, we contacted the author for further information. Dr Kushner clarified that 29 patients were excluded from the <LINK REF="STD-Kushner-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Kushner 1998a</LINK> study because, according to a predetermined protocol, if they were eligible for the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Kushner-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Kushner 1998b</LINK>) they were automatically selected for recruitment to it.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-04-08 19:01:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The management of X(T) is unlike most other types of childhood onset strabismus as most individuals already possess binocular single vision (BSV). The current literature contains a large body of retrospective case reviews and prospective non-randomised studies which, while useful for describing certain aspects of the condition and its management, generally do not help establish reliable guidelines for intervention or enable interpretation of treatment effectiveness. We found one randomised trial eligible for inclusion in this review, and a summary of the main results and implications are presented below. For an overview of current practice and the evidence on which it is based, the reader is referred to the background section of this review.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-07 12:06:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The included trial by <LINK REF="STD-Kushner-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Kushner 1998a</LINK> studied the effects of two different surgical approaches for correcting the basic type of X(T). A higher proportion of satisfactory outcomes was reported with unilateral recess resect surgery compared to bilateral lateral rectus recession surgery. This finding is consistent with the concept that surgery on the medial and lateral rectus muscles of one eye is appropriate in strabismus where there is little or no near distance disparity.</P>
<P>Criteria for 'success' following surgery were limited to motor alignment and therefore it is not possible to comment on the effect of surgery on sensory function (stereoacuity). As discussed in earlier sections of this review, surgery can sometimes result in reduction in or loss of stereoacuity. Nevertheless, any manifest strabismus was considered an 'unsatisfactory' outcome and therefore it is unlikely that any patient was classified a success in the presence of loss of stereoacuity. Unsuccessful treatment of X(T) is due to either overcorrection, causing an esodeviation, or undercorrection, causing a residual exodeviation. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Kushner-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Kushner 1998a</LINK> 'unsatisfactory' outcomes were more often due to undercorrection of the exodeviation than overcorrection. Some have suggested that a planned, temporary overcorrection in the initial postoperative period will reduce the possibility of undercorrection. However, the initial postoperative eye position was not reported in the included trial so it is unclear whether or not overcorrection played a role in those who were successfully aligned. There do not appear to be rigorous studies assessing the long-term effects of initial surgical overcorrection on postoperative alignment.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-04-08 19:01:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The basic type of X(T) constitutes a reasonably well defined subgroup of X(T), but it remains unclear how findings from the included trial may or may not apply to other subgroups of X(T). If simultaneous surgery on the medial and lateral recti of one eye is indeed more effective where there is little or no difference between the near and distance angle of deviation (near-distance disparity), it may be expected that in true X(T) where the near-distance disparity persists (larger distance deviation) surgery to both lateral recti would be more effective than unilateral recess or resect surgery. However, we did not find any trials comparing surgical or non-surgical treatments for the true type of X(T). We also did not find any studies comparing treatments for simulated X(T) so it remains unclear whether or not simulated X(T) may be treated as basic X(T), or whether different surgical or non-surgical treatments may be more effective.</P>
<P>The included trial contributes improved evidence for the management of X(T), but there remain several major questions and areas in need of further research.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Which clinical measures should be used to define severity?</HEADING>
<P>Possible measures include angle of deviation, stereoacuity at near or distance, control, motor fusion reserves, and health-related quality of life.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. What is the natural history of X(T)?</HEADING>
<P>It remains unclear what proportion of patients are likely to deteriorate, improve, remain stable over time, and whether there are prognostic indicators of deterioration, improvement, or stability. Is the current classification of X(T) appropriate?</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. What are appropriate intervention criteria?</HEADING>
<P>Popular options include reduction in or loss of stereoacuity (at near or distance), deteriorating fusional control, large angle of deviation, or a combination; but potential thresholds remain poorly defined and current recommendations are not well validated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. Which criteria should be used to define &#8216;success&#8217; following treatment?</HEADING>
<P>Various criteria are used in the current literature: i) motor alignment only (e.g. within 10 prism dioptres of orthotropia), ii) motor alignment with stereoacuity, or iii) motor alignment with stereoacuity and other motor and sensory capabilities such as awareness of diplopia when tropic and a normal amplitude of positive motor fusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">5. What are realistic long-term treatment outcomes?</HEADING>
<P>The high rates of recurrence reported in some studies raise the question whether it is possible to &#8216;cure&#8217; X(T). It also remains unclear at what point treatment outcomes should be recorded: six months, one year, two years etc. following treatment?</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6. What is the role of non-surgical treatment?</HEADING>
<P>It has been variously suggested that surgical outcomes are optimised if combined with non-surgical treatment, that non-surgical treatments may be as effective as surgery with less risk, and that non-surgical treatment is appropriate only in small angle exodevations. The role of non-surgical treatment and the effectiveness of different types of non-surgical treatment are unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">7. Is early surgery better than late surgery?</HEADING>
<P>The controversy regarding the optimum age for surgery remains unresolved. The risks associated with early surgery are overcorrection leading to loss of stereoacuity and the development of amblyopia, but the benefits are that successful surgery may be more likely to restore normal binocular alignment. It may be that age at onset or the duration affect the outcome more than age at surgery, or it may be that each of these does not greatly affect outcome. As yet these issues remain unanswered.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">8. Is unilateral surgery or bilateral surgery more effective?</HEADING>
<P>It has been suggested that simulated distance exotropia and basic X(T) should be treated with a unilateral recess resection, and that true distance exotropia should be treated with bilateral lateral rectus recessions. Only one clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kushner-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Kushner 1998a</LINK>) has addressed this issue, and only for the basic type of X(T).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">9. Is initial postoperative overcorrection advantageous?</HEADING>
<P>Retrospective studies are divided on whether or not an initial postoperative overcorrection is advantageous. It may be that initial overcorrection plays a role in lasting binocular stability, or initial overcorrection may simply delay inevitable postoperative drift and recurrence of X(T).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">10. What is the optimal treatment for small angle X(T)?</HEADING>
<P>Non-surgical treatment has been advocated, as has a single lateral rectus recession. What constitutes a 'small' angle and whether or not and how it should be treated remain unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">11. What are the effects of X(T) on health-related quality of life?</HEADING>
<P>These potential effects are not well described. Such data may be important for guiding the management of the condition and for more clearly defining the benefits versus the risks of surgery.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-04-07 12:31:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall methodological quality of the included trial was good. However, although most of the domains were assessed as low risk of bias the author did not perform masked assessment of the outcome. The outcomes were assessed by the surgeon who performed surgery, which might lead to potential biases. This weakens the credibility of the results. In addition, as mentioned above, the evidence can only be applied to a specific subgroup of X(T) and its applicability to other subgroups of X(T) remains unclear.</P>
<P>Across all identified studies, measures of severity and thus criteria for intervention are poorly validated, and there appear to be no reliable natural history data. There is, therefore, a pressing need for improved measures of severity and a better understanding of the natural history, and carefully planned clinical trials of treatment to improve the evidence base for the management of this condition.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-04-07 12:31:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The one randomised study eligible for inclusion in this review found unilateral recess or resect surgery to be more effective than bilateral recession surgery in correcting basic X(T). This provides some guidance for this subgroup of X(T) but generally there remains a significant lack of reliable evidence to help inform practice. In the absence of good evidence of treatment effectiveness, the potential to do harm by correcting the appearance of misalignment but disrupting the ability to maintain BSV should be seriously considered when managing this condition.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-07 12:47:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intervention 1:</P>
<P>Bilateral lateral recti recession or recession/resection. the recession of the lateral rectus muscle involves weakening the muscle by pulling it back few mm (each mm will weaken the muscle by 3 dioptres) so the amount will depend on the degree of divergent squint. e.g to correct 30 dioptres of divergent squint will need to weaken each lateral recti muscle by 5 mm on each side so in total 10 mm = 30 dioptres.</P>
<P>For the medial rectus resection means strengthening the muscle by cutting it (each mm will strengthen the muscle by 4 mm) and that is again dependent on the amount of squint.</P>
<P>The duration of each procedure will be approximately 20 min/muscle.</P>
<P>Intervention 2:</P>
<P>Active control, lateral recti recession procedure is the standard procedure for the intermittent divegernt squint. However some advocate recession/ resection procedure. So the aim is to compare the outcome of both techniques.</P>

<P>Primary outcome:</P>
<P>Comparison between two techniques for intermittent exotropia. Bilateral lateral recti reccession or medial/ lateral rectus recession/ resection regarding the success rate and this is measured by dioptre (the surgery considered successful if the residul squint is less than 10 dioptres at 2 years after randomisation).</P>
<P>Secondary outcome:</P>
<P>To test whether the patch alter the distance measurements and therefore the surgical target the effect of patch test at 2 years after randomisation. We patch the involved eye for 20, 40 ,60 min at different intervals and measure amount of squint in dioptres.</P>

<P>Final outcomes were measured 'at least one year' following surgery and varied from 12 to 15 months across the entire study population. Further to communication with the author, we clarified that the follow up was 12 to 15 months for each randomised group.</P>
<P>Patients selected for recruitment to this study were those who did not fulfil inclusion criteria for another randomised study running concurrently (<LINK REF="STD-Kushner-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Kushner 1998b</LINK>). Therefore the group who were eligible for inclusion in <LINK REF="STD-Kushner-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Kushner 1998a</LINK> were those whose exodeviation did not increase after patching or while looking outdoors, representing a subset of the entire basic X(T) population.
