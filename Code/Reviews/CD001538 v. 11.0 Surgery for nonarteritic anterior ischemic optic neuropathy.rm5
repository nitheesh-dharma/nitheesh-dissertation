<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-03-04 20:14:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>This review looked at the evidence about the safety and effectiveness of surgery (optic nerve decompression surgery) compared with no treatment on the vision of people with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>NAION is a sudden and painless loss of vision in the eye attributed to swelling of the area inside the eye where the optic nerve connects to it. The swelling of the tissue puts pressure on the optic nerve, and it is believed that this pressure interrupts the blood supply to the optic nerve, causing loss of vision. The cause of NAION is not known. No treatment has been proven to help.</P>
<P>A proposed treatment for NAION is called optic nerve decompression surgery. This surgery makes two slits or a window in the swollen eye tissue surrounding the optic nerve. These slits allow fluid building up around the optic nerve to escape. The hope is that this would reduce the pressure on the optic nerve and vision would improve.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>The search for studies was done on 23 October 2014. One study (a randomized controlled trial) was found. There were 258 participants in the trial. These 258 people were randomly divided into two groups. One group received the optic nerve decompression surgery along with careful follow-up. The other group received careful follow-up alone. Careful follow-up included an ophthalmologic examination at each study visit and visual field testing at 12 months and as needed. The technician performing the follow-up tests did not know to which group the participants belonged (surgery or no surgery). Funding for this trial was provided by National Eye Institute, USA.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>The trial was stopped early because the surgery was not helping the participants more than careful follow-up alone. The trial found no evidence of benefit from the surgery, but there were several harms caused by the surgery, such as further vision loss. Pain and double vision were harms experienced by some participants in the surgery group at one week after the surgery. The trial investigators reported that continued enrollment would be unlikely to produce results in favor of surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence </B>
<BR/>The quality of evidence in this one trial is considered high.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-04 17:42:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is characterized by sudden and painless loss of vision in the eye, accompanied by pallid swelling of the optic disc. Its etiology is unknown and no medical therapy has been proven effective in treating this condition. Optic nerve decompression surgery, a proposed treatment for NAION, involves making two or more slits or a window in the tissue surrounding the optic nerve, thereby allowing cerebrospinal fluid to escape, and theoretically reducing the pressure surrounding the optic nerve.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-04 20:22:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The one included trial, in which 258 participants were randomized, was stopped early for futility. At the time of the 24-month report the follow-up rate was 95.3% for six months and 67.4% for 24 months (174 participants; 89 careful follow-up and 85 surgery). There was no evidence of a benefit of surgery on visual acuity. Measurements of visual acuity and visual fields were performed by a technician masked to the treatment received. At six months 32.0% of the surgery group had improved visual acuity by 3 or more lines compared with 42.6% of the careful follow-up group (unadjusted risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.04). At 24 months 29.4% of the surgery group had improved compared with 31.0% of the careful follow-up group (unadjusted RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.49). Participants who underwent surgery more often lost 3 or more lines of visual acuity in the study eye, although the increased risk was not statistically significant. At six months 18.9% in the surgery group had worsened visual acuity in the study eye compared with 14.8% in the careful follow-up group (RR 1.28; 95% CI 0.73 to 2.24). At 24 months 20.0% in the surgery group had worsened visual acuity in the study eye compared with 21.8% in the careful follow-up group (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.64). Participants who received surgery experienced both intraoperative and postoperative adverse events, including central retinal artery occlusion during surgery and light perception vision at six months (one participant); and immediate loss of light perception following surgery and loss of vision that persisted to the 12-month visit (two participants). In the careful follow-up group, two participants had no light perception at the six-month follow-up visit; one of these had improved to light perception at 12 months. Pain was the most common adverse event in the surgery group (17% in surgery group versus 3% in the careful follow-up group at one week). Diplopia (double vision) was the next most common complication (8% in the surgery group versus 1% in the careful follow-up group at one week); at three months there was no statistically significant difference in proportion of participants with diplopia between the two groups.</P>

<P>The only eligible trial provided no evidence of a beneficial effect of optic nerve decompression surgery for NAION. Future research should focus on increasing our understanding of the etiology and prognosis of NAION. New treatment options should be examined in the context of randomized clinical trials.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-04 17:44:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is a common cause of acute optic nerve disease in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Hayreh-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayreh 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hayreh-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayreh 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hayreh-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayreh 1990</LINK>) and results in visual loss. NAION is clinically characterized by sudden and painless loss of vision in one eye, accompanied by pallid swelling of the optic disc (optic nerve head). Estimates of the annual incidence rate of NAION in the United States range from approximately 2.3 per 100,000 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>) to 10.3 per 100,000 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Hattenhauer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hattenhauer 1997</LINK>). Its etiology is unknown. Visual function of the affected eye may be impaired through decreased central visual acuity, peripheral visual field loss, or both.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-03-04 17:45:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although various medical interventions, such as corticosteroids and phenytoin sodium, have been used to treat NAION, no therapy has been proven effective. <LINK REF="STD-Sergott-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sergott 1989</LINK> suggested that optic nerve decompression surgery might improve vision in people with NAION. Optic nerve decompression surgery involves making two or more slits or a window in the tissue surrounding the optic nerve, thereby allowing cerebrospinal fluid to escape and, theoretically, reducing the pressure surrounding the optic nerve.</P>

The types of bias examined were selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment before randomization), performance bias (masking of participants and trial personnel), detection bias (masking of outcome assessors), attrition bias (intent-to-treat analyses and losses to follow-up), and reporting bias (selective outcome reporting). Two authors independently judged each included trial for each type of bias as having low risk, high risk, or unclear risk.</P>

<P>We analyzed the primary outcome, change in vision from baseline, classified as either improved vision or worsened vision, as a dichotomous outcome. We reported the measure of effect as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the proportion of participants with the event in each group. We also reported the risk ratio reduction (RRR), calculated as the RR &#8722; 1 = (risk in surgery group &#8722; risk in control group)/risk in control group.

<P>From the original search in 1999, we obtained eight potentially relevant full-text reports and examined the corresponding trials for eligibility. We excluded seven reports (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table) and identified one eligible trial. An updated search in 2005 identified 381 new reports. We obtained full-text reports for six potentially relevant records and examined them for eligible trials. These six reports described details of the single trial already included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK>). An updated search in July 2007 yielded a further 71 records of studies. The Trials Search Coordinator scanned the search results and removed any references which were not relevant to the scope of the review. The search did not identify any new trials which met the inclusion criteria for the review. Another updated search in November 2011 yielded 272 additional records. After duplicate review by two review authors, only one new report was added to the review which was an additional publication of the already included trial. The search also identified 18 clinical trial registrations, two of which were for the <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=02379588924457853312111102154959&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-IONDT">IONDT</A> study (one for the original trial and one for the follow-up study) and 16 which were not relevant to this review. Another updated search in October 2014 yielded 566 additional titles and abstracts and 73 clinical trial registrations (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Two review authors independently screened all records and identified no new studies; however, two additional reports from the <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=02379588924457853312111102154959&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-IONDT">IONDT</A> study were included. These two reports were conference abstracts of baseline trial data presented at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) annual meetings (one in 1995 and one in 2006) and did not provide any information additional to what has been reported in the trial's journal publications.<BR/>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> was a randomized trial comparing optic nerve decompression surgery plus careful follow-up to careful follow-up without treatment (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table). Participants were people 50 years of age or older who had been diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) within 14 days before enrollment and had best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/64 or worse in the affected eye at baseline. Participants in the surgery and careful follow-up groups were examined at one week, one month, three months, six months, and 12 months after randomization and at six-month intervals thereafter. Careful follow-up included an ophthalmologic examination and measurement of BCVA at all follow-up visits and a visual field test at 12-months follow-up and as needed. The <LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> also included follow-up of a non-randomized cohort.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> enrolled 258 participants (258 eyes) randomized to optic nerve decompression surgery plus careful follow-up to careful follow-up without treatment. Enrolment into this trial was stopped earlier than planned and preliminary results were published (<LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> 1995). The preliminary article reported outcomes on all participants with six months of follow-up at the time the trial was stopped for futility; subsequent papers reported outcomes at 24 months or longer.</P>
<P>Visual field data presented in this review were taken from the visual field follow-up reports (<LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> 2000; <LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> 2008). All other data presented in this review were taken from the 24-month report unless otherwise stated (<LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> 2000). Of those randomized, 124/131 careful follow-up and 122/127 surgery participants completed six months of follow-up; 89/131 and 85/127 participants in each group, respectively, completed 24 months of follow-up. The analysis was based on participants with data for both baseline and the follow-up visit; two participants in the careful follow-up group and one participant in the surgery group without baseline visual acuity data were not included in the analysis. Comparison of participants with baseline data and 24-month data were similar between groups (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2015-03-04 20:24:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Visual acuity</HEADING>
<P>At six months, 42.6% (52/122) of participants in the careful follow-up group had BCVA that had improved by 3 or more lines from baseline; a further 42.6% (52/122) of study eyes had little or no change in vision from baseline. In the surgery group 32.0% (39/122) of eyes had improved BCVA by 3 or more lines and 49.2% (60/122) had little or no change from baseline BCVA.</P>
<P>At 24 months, the BCVA of 31.0% (27/87) of participants in the careful follow-up group had improved by 3 or more lines and 47.1% (41/87) had little or no change. In the surgery group the BCVA of 29.4% (25/85) of eyes had improved by 3 or more lines and 50.6% (43/85) had little or no change from baseline.</P>
<P>Using all participants randomized as the denominator, 39.7% (52/131) of careful follow-up and 30.7% (39/127) of surgery participants had BCVA in the study eye improved by 3 or more lines at six months. At 24 months 20.6% (27/131) of careful follow-up and 19.7% (25/127) of surgery participants had improved BCVA in the study eye.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in improvement by 3 or more lines of BCVA between surgery and careful follow-up groups at three, six, 12, or 24 months of follow-up. The unadjusted risk ratio (RR) was 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.10) at three months, 0.75 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.04) at six months, 0.84 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.18) at 12 months, and 0.95 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.49) at 24 months (fewer eyes in the surgery group had improvement in BCVA than in the careful follow-up group).</P>
<P>We calculated the risk ratio reduction (RRR), and its 95% confidence interval, for BCVA improvement by 3 or more lines at six months follow-up as RRR = RR &#8722; 1 = (risk in surgery group &#8722; risk in control group)/risk in control group (<LINK REF="REF-Detsky-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Detsky 1985</LINK>). In this case, RRR represents the relative increase/decrease in proportion of participants with improvement in BCVA in the surgery group compared with that in the careful follow-up group. A RRR greater than zero means that a greater proportion of participants improved in BCVA by 3 or more lines in the surgery group compared with the careful follow-up group, i.e., surgery was beneficial compared with careful follow-up for people with NAION. Conversely, a RRR less than zero indicates that careful follow-up is beneficial compared to surgery for people with NAION. Data from the <LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> yield a RRR of 0.25 in favor of careful follow-up (RR &#8722; 1 = 0.75 &#8722; 1 = &#8722;0.25, 95% CI &#8722;0.46 to 0.04).</P>
<P>In addition, participants undergoing surgery experienced a greater risk of losing 3 or more lines of BCVA. At three months, 18.3% of study eyes in the surgery group had BCVA worse than baseline BCVA compared with 9.1% of eyes in the careful follow-up group (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.97). At six months, 18.9% in the surgery group had worsened BCVA compared with 14.8% in the careful follow-up group (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.24). At 12 months, 15.9% of eyes in the surgery group had worsened BCVA compared with 15.8% of eyes in the careful follow-up group (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.85). At 24 months, 20.0% of eyes in the surgery group had worsened BCVA compared with 21.8% of eyes in the careful follow-up group (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.64).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Experience of surgeon</HEADING>
<P>According to the preliminary report there was no evidence of apparent benefit to participants operated on by more experienced surgeons, regardless of how experience was defined (<LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> 1995). There was insufficient evidence to support the theory that participants defined as having 'progressive' NAION fared better than other people in either group. Findings of no evidence of benefit and possibly greater visual loss in the surgery group were consistent across subgroups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Visual field</HEADING>
<P>Visual field measurement was the basis of a secondary outcome of <LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK>, with mean deviation from normal sensitivity as the parameter of interest. According to the preliminary report from the IONDT, there was no evidence of an effect of surgery compared with careful follow-up in terms of change in mean deviation of visual field at three, six, or 12 months. The treatment effect (change in mean deviation in the surgery group minus change in mean deviation in the careful follow-up group), adjusted for mean deviation at randomization in a multiple linear regression model, was &#8722;1.00 (standard error (SE) 0.93; P = 0.29) at three months; &#8722;0.18 (SE 1.01; P = 0.86) at six months; and &#8722;0.56 (SE 1.17; P = 0.63) at 12 months. Thus, there was more loss of sensitivity in the surgery group.</P>
<P>At 12-months follow-up, shifts in visual field defects (patterns) were compared to baseline by visual field location. No pattern shifts were observed for superior (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) or inferior (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) defects, either overall (P = 0.22 and 0.68 for superior and inferior locations, respectively; Stuart Maxwell test for homogeneity); or between surgery and careful follow-up groups (P = 0.61 and 0.66 for superior and inferior locations, respectively; Score test for trends of odds). A statistically significant pattern shift toward improvement was found in the central location (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>) for all randomized participants (P = 0.02; Stuart Maxwell test for homogeneity); however, this change did not differ between surgery and careful follow-up groups (P = 0.68; Score test for trends of odds). Similarly, there was no difference in defect density (severity) in the surgery group compared with the careful follow-up group. Among all randomized participants, superior altitudinal and inferior altitudinal defect classifications were less severe at 12-months follow-up compared with baseline to a statistically significant degree (P = 0.008 and 0.001 for superior altitudinal and inferior altitudinal defects, respectively).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Participants who received surgery experienced both intraoperative and postoperative adverse events, as reported in the preliminary paper (<LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> 1995). These included central retinal artery occlusion during surgery and light perception vision at six months (one participant); and immediate loss of light perception following surgery and loss of vision that persisted to the 12-month visit (two participants).</P>
<P>In the careful follow-up group, two participants had no light perception at the six-month follow-up visit; one of these had improved to light perception at 12 months.</P>
<P>Pain was the most common adverse event in the surgery group (17% in surgery group versus 3% in the careful follow-up group at one week). Diplopia (double vision) was the next most common complication (8% in the surgery group versus 1% in the careful follow-up group at one week); at three months there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in proportion of participants with diplopia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incidence of NAION in the fellow eye</HEADING>
<P>Over the course of participant follow-up, the incidence of second eye NAION was evaluated in both randomized (258) and non-randomized (160) participants. Non-randomized participants were people with NAION and vision better than 20/64 at baseline, as well as eligible participants who refused randomization. Occurrence of NAION in the fellow eye was assessed based on the best clinical judgement of the study neuro-ophthalmologist, surrogate provider, or particpant report. Overall, 14.7% of people at risk for NAION (48/326) experienced new NAION in the fellow eye over approximately five years. Incidence was greater for the randomized compared to the non-randomized participants (17.4% (35/201) versus 10.4% (13/125)).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-04 20:24:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> investigators found no evidence of benefit of optic nerve decompression surgery compared with careful follow-up without treatment in terms of improvement in visual acuity by 3 or more lines at six, 12 or 24 months. Spontaneous improvement in visual acuity was higher than expected in the careful follow-up group. At three and six months of follow-up, more participants who had surgery in the study eye lost 3 or more lines of visual acuity compared with those assigned to careful follow-up alone, although the difference in risk was not statistically significant three months after randomization.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-04 20:24:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Data from the <LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> yielded a RRR of 0.25 in favor of careful follow-up at six months. The 95% CI for RRR of improvement in vision indicates that the data from the <LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> are compatible with a RRR of as much as +0.04 (in favor of surgery) or &#8722;0.46 (in favor of careful follow-up). Thus, data from the <LINK REF="STD-IONDT" TYPE="STUDY">IONDT</LINK> indicate that surgery is unlikely to be associated with a clinically meaningful beneficial effect.</P>
<P>Thus, we believe that a clinically-meaningful beneficial effect with surgery (improvement in vision by 3 or more lines) in people undergoing optic nerve decompression surgery for NAION at six-month follow-up can be ruled out with reasonable confidence.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-02-23 20:06:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence of a beneficial effect on visual acuity or the visual field from optic nerve decompression surgery in people with NAION, including people with progressive disease. People who receive careful follow-up alone may improve spontaneously (about 31% at 24 months). An estimated 14.7% of participants at risk experienced new NAION in the fellow eye over the five-year follow-up period. Along with the observation of immediate loss of light perception in two participants in the surgery group and other adverse events summarized above, a lack of a clinically meaningful benefit with surgery argues against prescribing optic nerve decompression surgery for people with NAION.</P>
