<TITLE>Intermittent pneumatic compression for treating venous leg ulcers.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-03-27 16:51:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous leg ulcers (open sores) can be caused by a blockage or breakdown in the veins of the leg. Compression, using bandages or hosiery (stockings), can help heal ulcers. However, they do not always work, and some people are not willing or able to wear them. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) uses an air pump to inflate and deflate an airtight bag wrapped around the leg. This technique is also used to stop blood clots developing during surgery. However, the review of trials found conflicting evidence about whether or not IPC is better than compression bandages and hosiery. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is better for healing leg ulcers than no compression. . Some studies suggest IPC might be a beneficial addition to bandages for some ulcers, but these studies might be biased. Delivering the IPC therapy in a rapid manner by inflating and deflating the IPC device more quickly resulted in more ulcers being healed than with a slower deflation regime.</P>

<P>In April 2014, for this third update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL.</P>

<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of IPC with control (sham IPC or no IPC) or made comparisons between IPC treatment regimens, in venous ulcer management.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-03-27 16:51:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P> Two review authors reviewed titles and abstracts and agreed on full studies to be retrieved. One review author extracted data and assessed studies for risk of bias and this was checked by a second review author.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-27 16:51:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified nine randomised controlled trials (including 489 people in total). Only one trial was at low risk of bias overall having reported adequate randomisation, allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment.<BR/>
<BR/>In one trial (80 people) more ulcers healed with IPC than with dressings (62% vs 28%; p=0.002). Five trials compared IPC plus compression with compression alone. Two of these (97 people) found increased ulcer healing with IPC plus compression than with compression alone. The remaining three trials (122 people) found no evidence of a benefit for IPC plus compression compared with compression alone.</P>
<P>Two trials (86 people) found no difference between IPC (without additional compression) and compression bandages alone.</P>
<P>One trial (104 people) compared different ways of delivering IPC and found that rapid IPC healed more ulcers than slow IPC (86% vs 61%).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-03-27 16:56:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>IPC may increase healing compared with no compression. It is unclear whether it can be used instead of compression bandages. There is some limited evidence that IPC may improve healing when added to compression bandages. Rapid IPC was better than slow IPC in one trial. Further trials are required to determine the reliability of current evidence, which patients may benefit from IPC in addition to compression bandages, and the optimum treatment regimen.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-04 11:11:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous leg ulcers are a common chronic complaint affecting some 3% of the population over the age of 65 years (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1985</LINK>). They are caused by chronic venous insufficiency, secondary to leg veins being blocked or incompetent. Compression, using roller bandages or hosiery, has been shown to improve ulcer healing rates compared with no compression (<LINK REF="REF-Cullum-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullum 1997</LINK>). Bandages or hosiery heal around 70% of venous leg ulcers after 3 to 6 months of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Cullum-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullum 1997</LINK>), but a substantial proportion of patients are not helped by compression bandaging, or are unwilling or unable to wear it. Alternative methods of treating venous leg ulcer patients are required.</P>
<P>Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) uses an air pump to periodically inflate/ deflate bladders incorporated into sleeves which envelop legs or arms. There are a number of ways of applying intermittent pneumatic compression, using single or multiple chambers / bladders, or by using different types of pumps and compression cycles, for example, variation of inflation and deflation times. IPC has been used to prevent the development of blood clots during long periods of rest, for example, during surgery. It has also been used to treat limb swelling, for example, lymphoedema, and venous leg ulcers. The purpose of this review is to examine the effectiveness of IPC as a treatment of venous ulcers, and to analyse the evidence for the effectiveness of different IPC regimens.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-04-28 21:33:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the update of this review one review author (KT or AH) assessed each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias and this was checked by a second review author (EAN) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>This tool addresses seven specific domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other bias (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance) (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for details of criteria on which the judgement is based). We assessed blinding and completeness of outcome data for each outcome separately. We completed a 'Risk of bias' table for each eligible study and discussed any disagreement to achieve a consensus.</P>
<P>We presented an assessment of risk of bias using a 'Risk of bias' summary figure (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), which presents all of the judgements in a cross-tabulation of study by entry. This display of internal validity indicates the weight the reader may give the results of each study.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-01-04 14:55:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were entered into and analysed using Cochrane RevMan software. Results are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Estimates for dichotomous outcomes (e.g. number of ulcers healed - yes or no) were reported as risk ratio (RR). Continuous data (e.g. total area healed, or changes in volume of ulcers) were converted to the standardised mean difference (or a weighted mean difference, when plausible) and overall effect size (with 95% CI) calculated. Time to wound healing and time to return to work were analysed as survival (time to event) data, using the appropriate analytical method (as per the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook version 5.0.2). Methods of synthesising the studies depend on their quality, design and heterogeneity. Both clinical and statistical heterogeneity were explored. Clinical heterogeneity was explored by examining potentially influential factors such as parameters of IPC used, care setting, co-interventions such as the use of compression therapy. In the absence of clinical and statistical heterogeneity a fixed effect model was applied to pool data. In the presence of statistical heterogeneity (as estimated by the I<SUP>2</SUP> where values greater than 50% indicate the presence of substantial heterogeneity) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) a random effects model was applied for meta-analysis. Where synthesis is inappropriate we undertook a narrative overview.</P>

<P>One trial evaluated whether adding IPC to a dressing regimen increased healing rates. (<LINK REF="STD-Nikolovska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolovska 2002</LINK>). Nikolovska randomised 80 people (by coin toss) to a hydrocolloid dressings and either standard care (no compression) or IPC: multi-chamber, sequential device with 50 mmHg at ankle and 40 mmHg at thigh, with 3 minute inflation time, 30 seconds at full pressure and 60 second deflation time; 1 hour, five days a week, for up to six months.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">IPC plus continuous compression compared with continuous compression alone (5 trials, 219 participants)</HEADING>
<P>Five trials evaluated the effect of adding IPC to a standard regimen of compression bandages or stockings (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coleridge-Smith-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Coleridge Smith 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCulloch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McCulloch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2012</LINK> compared IPC plus standard compression therapy with compression therapy alone in 52 patients. Compression therapy consisted of a non-adherent primary wound dressing plus a 4-layer compression bandage. IPC was performed using a 4-chamber pneumatic leg sleeve and gradient, sequential pump. All pumps were calibrated to a pressure setting of 40-50mmHg, with treatment lasting one hour, twice daily. Inflation and deflation time is not reported. Wounds were measured using a 3 mega pixel digital camera and photo-digital planimetry software. Randomisation was by a computer random number generator.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Coleridge-Smith-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Coleridge Smith 1989</LINK>, in a trial of 45 people, assessed the addition of IPC to a standard regimen in which ulcers were dressed identically and legs compressed with stockings designed to exert 30 to 40 mmHg graduated compression. A sequential compression device was used to deliver IPC (number of cells is not stated) with higher pressures exerted distally and reducing up the leg. Randomisation was determined by coin tossing. Pre-trial assessment included measurement of ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI), Duplex ultrasound and plethysmographic assessment of venous insufficiency. The 21 participants in the IPC group inserted the ulcerated, stockinged limb into the IPC foot-sleeve daily for up to 4 hours. All patients in the study were advised to elevate their legs while resting, and to avoid standing. Dressings were changed weekly. Ulcer area was measured, by tracing, at the start and at 2 weekly intervals during dressing changes, but the baseline comparability of the median ulcer area was poor, the IPC group having larger ulcers than the control group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2002</LINK> compared IPC plus four-layer bandaging with four-layer bandaging alone in 47 people. Allocation was by coin toss and data collectors were unblinded. The IPC was a below-knee, single chambered device, with 90 second inflation and 90 second deflation, at 60 mmHg, used for 60 minutes, twice a day, for up to 4 months. This trial recruited 47 people (54 ulcers) but only reported outcomes on the 41 people (48 ulcers) who completed the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2002</LINK> randomised people but included and reported on the number of ulcers healed, some participants had more than one ulcer. This raises concern of a unit of analysis error.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McCulloch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McCulloch 1994</LINK> compared IPC plus Unna's Boots with Unna's Boots alone on 22 patients with venous leg ulcers. IPC was delivered twice a week using a single cell device which compressed the limb uniformly, with care delivered at home. Fifty mmHg of pressure was applied for 90 seconds followed by 30 seconds of relaxation after which legs were dressed in Unna's Boots. Co-interventions were the same in both groups. "Randomisation" was by case note number. No objective assessment of venous insufficiency was reported. Ulcer area was measured by tracing at dressing changes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schuler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 1996</LINK> compared IPC ("HomeRx" sequential gradient compression device) plus elastic stockings with Unna's Boot therapy alone in 53 participants. The ulcers of people in both groups were dressed with hydrocolloid dressings. All patients were advised to elevate their legs twice daily. The experimental group was supplied with elastic stockings, graded to deliver 30 mmHg at the ankle. These stockings were removed for IPC therapy ("HomeRx") for 1 hour/am and 2 hours/pm. The "HomeRx" was an IPC device different from those described in other studies and was used to deliver a constant pressure of 10 mmHg to feet, and sequentially 50 mmHg to ankles, 45 mm Hg to calves and 40 mm Hg to thighs. Sequential pressure was delivered at 2.5 second intervals for a total compression time of 10 seconds followed by 60 seconds of no compression. The control group received compression from Unna's Boots which were changed twice weekly. The method of randomisation was not described. Pre-trial assessment included ABPI measurement and plethysmographic studies of venous insufficiency measuring venous refilling times and venous filling index. Three patients in the control group experienced adverse reactions; cellulitis (1), allergies (2) and were withdrawn from the study. Ulcer area was measured by tracing the outline onto acetate sheets at the start of the trial and at alternate visits. Leg volumes, amount of wound exudate and pain levels were assessed by direct measurement, subjective grading (light, moderate and heavy) and visual analogue scores respectively.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dolibog-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Dolibog 2013</LINK> compared IPC with two separate compression treatments. 22 people were allocated to 12 chamber IPC, from foot to groin. Pressure was set to 60mmHg at the ankle reducing to 40mmHg at the groin. Ventricular filling time was 60 seconds, with a discharge time of 30 seconds. This was delivered daily with each treatment session lasting for 60 minutes. 23 people were allocated an ulcer stocking system delivering pressure of 30-40mmHg, put on each morning for 10-12 hours and removed at night. 25 people were allocated to two layer short-stretch bandaging. Pressure was standardised at 30-35mmHg or 35-40mmHg. These were applied each morning for 10-12 hours and removed at night. All treatments were given for a period of 15 days. In addition, all participants received 2 months of standard drug therapy and gauze dressings saturated in 0.9% sodium chloride changed daily. For the purposes of our analysis all patients receiving either form of continuous compression were grouped together.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2000</LINK> compared IPC with highly extensible compression bandages worn continuously (Setopress, SSL). Sixteen people with venous leg ulcers were recruited from a wound care outpatient clinic. Randomisation was based on the toss of a coin in this cross-over trial (data are only included until the point of cross-over). IPC was delivered using a pump, with pressure set at 50 mmHg, but it was unclear whether a single or multiple cell device was used. Patients were advised to use the IPC device for one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening. People in the control group were treated with high compression, elastomeric bandages. Co-interventions were the same in each group, ulcers were managed according to a local protocol. Ulcer area was measured by tracing at dressing changes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparison of different IPC regimens (1 RCT, 104 participants)</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nikolovska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolovska 2005</LINK>) of 104 people compared 'rapid' with 'slow' IPC. 'Rapid' IPC has a sleeve inflation time of 0.5 seconds, a 6 second pressure plateau and 12 seconds deflation. The 'slow' IPC has an inflation time of 60 seconds, a 30 second pressure plateau and 90 seconds deflation time. The IPC device had 7 chambers covering the foot ankle, calf, knee and thigh. Pressure was 45 mmHg at the foot and 30 mmHg at the thigh, for 1 hour daily. Randomisation was by computer generation of a random number sequence, and opening of a sealed opaque, numbered envelope. All patients were treated with a hydrocolloid dressing. Follow up was blinded and was for 6 months. The patients were not treated with compression therapy between IPC sessions. Baseline differences in risk of healing occurred in <LINK REF="STD-Nikolovska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolovska 2005</LINK>, where patients in the rapid IPC group tended to have larger ulcers and were of longer duration than those in the slow IPC group (ulcer area mean: 4.47 cm² vs 4.70; ulcer duration mean 4.2 vs 5.4 months). This was the only trial reported using a CONSORT flowchart (<LINK REF="STD-Nikolovska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolovska 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sequence generation:</HEADING>
<P>All nine studies were described as randomised controlled trials, but only seven reported an adequate method of sequence generation and were at low risk of bias for this domain.

One study (<LINK REF="STD-McCulloch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McCulloch 1994</LINK>) randomised patients depending on the last digit of their case note number. This was judged to be at high risk of bias as it is a systematic rather than a truly a random allocation.

<LINK REF="STD-Schuler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 1996</LINK> reported pain, stating that pain scores, as measured on a visual analogue scale (0-10) were 3.1 (SD 2.3) with Unna's boot and 2.0 (SD 1.4) with IPC, but that this difference was not statistically significant. The use of different compression systems in this trial, however, confounds the comparison as it is not clear if any difference in pain would be associated with the IPC or the different compression system used. <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2002</LINK> stated that comfort was high in both four-layer and IPC groups (8 to 10 on a 0 to 10 scale which was not validated).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2012</LINK> reported pain, measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (0-10) every week from 0 to 6 weeks.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-05-01 13:26:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With a total of nine trials there are 489 participants who contributed data to this review. The studies are on the whole small, and differ in the type (single-cell compared with sequential: below knee or above knee) and duration of IPC delivered, which does not allow the results to be compared easily. Although one moderately sized trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nikolovska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolovska 2002</LINK>) reported that IPC increased healing compared with a dressing alone, this finding is not applicable to the majority of modern settings where compression bandaging is widely used and effective. Were the study to be repeated with people who were intolerant to compression bandaging, then this might provide useful information on a treatment for people who fail to reap the benefit of compression bandages and remain a challenge to practitioners. One small trial reported more ulcers healed with 'fast' IPC therapy when compared with 'slow' IPC therapy. Further trials are needed. The small number of trials means that in-depth analysis of heterogeneity cannot be explored.</P>
<P>Seven studies described here were undertaken in the community / home care setting and it is unclear whether the place of treatment might have an impact on effectiveness. The other two were undertaken in 'outpatient and inpatient settings at the Clinic of Dermatology, in Skopje in Macedonia.</P>
<P>None of the studies offers a rationale for the chosen dose or duration of IPC although each paper describes potential benefits of the specific method of IPC chosen.</P>
<P>Four trials assessed the impact of adding IPC to a continuous compression regimen - one added IPC to graduated compression stockings (<LINK REF="STD-Coleridge-Smith-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Coleridge Smith 1989</LINK>), one to Unna's Boot (<LINK REF="STD-McCulloch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McCulloch 1994</LINK>), and two studies compared IPCto four-layer compression (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2002</LINK>). At three months, <LINK REF="STD-Coleridge-Smith-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Coleridge Smith 1989</LINK> found a statistically significant difference in the percentage of ulcers healed, whilst at four and six months respectively, <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McCulloch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McCulloch 1994</LINK> found no statistically significant difference in the percentage of ulcers healed. At 12 months <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2012</LINK> found a statistically significant difference in the percentage of ulcers healed. It is not clear whether the differences in outcomes between studies is due to the length of follow-up, the type of IPC used, the compression therapy used, or chance. <LINK REF="STD-Coleridge-Smith-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Coleridge Smith 1989</LINK> reported very poor outcomes in the control group. Kumar suggested that as compression bandaging alone achieves high healing rates there is little benefit to be gained from adding IPC. The study conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 1996</LINK> does not allow the independent effect of IPC to be reliably estimated due to the differences in the methods of compression used in the two groups.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCulloch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McCulloch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 1996</LINK>) assessing the impact of adding IPC to a continuous compression regimen which minimised statistical heterogeneity shows a statistically significant difference in the number of patients healed (RR 1.41 95% CI 1.06 to 1.63). It should be noted that two of these three studies were rated as being at high risk of bias for random sequence generation. </P>
<P>Meta-analysis of the two trials reporting pain scores (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 1996</LINK>) evaluating the impact of adding IPC to a continuous compression regimen on pain shows a small but statistically significant difference in the average pain score, lower pain being associated with IPC (-1.03, 95% CI -1.56, -0.49).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-03-27 17:18:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>IPC improved healing in a poor quality trial, when compared with dressings alone, and this reinforces the finding that continuous compression is better than no compression for venous ulcer healing. There is some evidence that the addition of IPC to standard compression may be beneficial. This, however, is based on a small number of small to medium sized studies, which are open to bias. These studies also used different IPC regimens, and there is no evidence as to how long IPC is indicated for, and no evidence as to the optimum IPC regimen. Having said this, there is some evidence that more ulcers healed when a 'fast' IPC therapy was used, which delivers IPC inflation and deflation of the compression quicker, than with a 'slow' IPC therapy. There is also some evidence of lower pain scores using IPC over compression. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-03-27 16:51:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Larger, well designed RCTs comparing IPC in both hospital and home settings are indicated. Questions that remain to be answered are:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Is IPC beneficial in people with venous ulcers who cannot tolerate compression bandages or hosiery ?</LI>
<LI>Is IPC useful as an adjuvant to compression therapy (bandages or hosiery) ?</LI>
<LI>Is IPC an effective alternative to compression bandages / hosiery for some patients who would prefer not to wear compression 24 hours a day ?</LI>
<LI>If IPC is beneficial in any of the above circumstances, what is the optimum IPC regimen?</LI>
</OL>
<P>Studies must measure cost data as well as patient outcomes such as quality of life, pain and acceptability of IPC treatment.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.  Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No&#8217;.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non­ opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No&#8217;. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>

<UL>
<LI>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others unlikely to introduce bias.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</LI>

<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported.</LI>
<LI>One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified.</LI>
<LI>One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect).</LI>
<LI>One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis.</LI>
<LI>The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; or</LI>
<LI>stopped early due to some data-dependent process (including a formal-stopping rule); or</LI>
<LI>had extreme baseline imbalance; or</LI>
<LI>has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or</LI>
<LI>had some other problem.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>There may be a risk of bias, but there is either:</P>
<UL>
<LI>insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists; or</LI>
<LI>insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias.</LI>
