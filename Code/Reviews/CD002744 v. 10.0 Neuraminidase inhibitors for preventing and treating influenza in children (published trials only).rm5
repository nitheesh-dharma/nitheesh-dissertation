<TITLE>Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-11-14 21:28:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Influenza (true 'flu) is an infection of the airways caused by the Influenza group of viruses. Influenza occurs most commonly during winter months and can result in symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle aches and fatigue. These are usually self limiting but may persist for one to two weeks. The most common complications of influenza are secondary bacterial infections including otitis media (ear infections) and pneumonia. Influenza infection is also highly contagious and is spread from person-to-person by droplets produced when an infected individual coughs or sneezes.</P>
<P>This update reviews the randomised controlled trial evidence of a class of drugs called the neuraminidase inhibitors in treating and preventing influenza in children. Neuraminidase inhibitors work against influenza by preventing viruses from being released from infected cells and subsequently infecting further cells. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), an oral medication, and zanamivir (Relenza), an inhaled medication, are currently licensed, whilst laninamivir is undergoing Phase III clinical trials. Neuraminidase inhibitors are usually prescribed to patients presenting with flu-like symptoms during epidemic periods to reduce symptoms or prevent spread of the virus.</P>
<P>We included six treatment trials involving 1906 children with clinically suspected influenza and 450 children with influenza diagnosed on rapid influenza testing. Of these 2356 children, 1255 had proven influenza infection confirmed on laboratory testing. We also included three trials of neuraminidase inhibitors for the prevention of influenza, which involved 863 children who had been exposed to influenza.</P>
<P>This review found that treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors was only associated with modest clinical benefit in children with proven influenza. Treatment with oseltamivir or zanamivir shortened the duration of illness in healthy children by about one day. One trial demonstrated that the new neuraminidase inhibitor drug laninamivir reduces duration of illness by almost three days in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza. The effect of neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing transmission of influenza was also modest; 13 children would need to be treated to prevent one additional case. Neuraminidase inhibitors are generally well tolerated but there will be one extra case of vomiting for every 17 children treated with oseltamivir. Other side effects such as diarrhoea and nausea were no more common in children treated with neuraminidase inhibitors compared to placebo. There is currently no high-quality evidence to support targeted treatment of 'at risk' children (with underlying chronic medical conditions) with neuraminidase inhibitors.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-09-30 23:01:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six treatment trials involving 1906 children with clinical influenza and 450 children with influenza diagnosed on rapid near-patient influenza testing were included. Of these 2356 children, 1255 had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Three prophylaxis trials involving 863 children exposed to influenza were also included. In children with laboratory-confirmed influenza oseltamivir reduced median duration of illness by 36 hours (26%, P &lt; 0.001). One trial of oseltamivir in children with asthma who had laboratory-confirmed influenza showed only a small reduction in illness duration (10.4 hours, 8%), which was not statistically significant (P = 0.542). Laninamivir octanoate 20 mg reduced symptom duration by 2.8 days (60%, P &lt; 0.001) in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/H1N1. Zanamivir reduced median duration of illness by 1.3 days (24%, P &lt; 0.001). Oseltamivir significantly reduced acute otitis media in children aged one to five years with laboratory-confirmed influenza (risk difference (RD) -0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.24 to -0.04). Prophylaxis with either zanamivir or oseltamivir was associated with an 8% absolute reduction in developing influenza after the introduction of a case into a household (RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.05, P &lt; 0.001). The adverse event profile of zanamivir was no worse than placebo but vomiting was more commonly associated with oseltamivir (number needed to harm = 17, 95% CI 10 to 34). The adverse event profiles of laninamivir octanoate and oseltamivir were similar.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-03-07 20:14:11 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oseltamivir and zanamivir appear to have modest benefit in reducing duration of illness in children with influenza. However, our analysis was limited by small sample sizes and an inability to pool data from different studies. In addition, the inclusion of data from published trials only may have resulted in significant publication bias. Based on published trial data, oseltamivir reduces the incidence of acute otitis media in children aged one to five years but is associated with a significantly increased risk of vomiting. One study demonstrated that laninamivir octanoate was more effective than oseltamivir in shortening duration of illness in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/H1N1. The benefit of oseltamivir and zanamivir in preventing the transmission of influenza in households is modest and based on weak evidence. However, the clinical efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in 'at risk' children is still uncertain. Larger high-quality trials are needed with sufficient power to determine the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing serious complications of influenza (such as pneumonia or hospital admission), particularly in 'at risk' groups.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-14 22:48:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-11-14 22:48:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Influenza virus is an important cause of illness among children and during seasonal epidemics, influenza attack rates often exceed 40% in preschool children (<LINK REF="REF-Glezen-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glezen 1978</LINK>). Influenza viruses are transmitted primarily through droplet transmission and contact with infected respiratory secretions. School age children are the main source of introducing influenza into the household (<LINK REF="REF-Longini-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Longini 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>The unique epidemiology of influenza is due to the ability of the virus to change its antigenic coat either slowly by mutation driven drift or suddenly by re-assortment driven antigenic shift (usually within duck and pig reservoirs in Southern China). It is the latter phenomenon that may give rise to a pandemic such as the recent H1N1.</P>
<P>In some epidemic years, up to a quarter of emergency department admissions will be children with fever or respiratory symptoms with laboratory evidence of influenza (<LINK REF="REF-Poehling-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poehling 2006</LINK>). Although hospitalisation rates attributable to influenza are<SUP> </SUP>important, outpatient visits associated with influenza are some five to 250 times as common. For instance, in the 2003 to 2004 season, the estimated burden of USA outpatient visits associated with influenza was 95 clinic visits and 27 emergency department visits per 1000 children under the age of five (<LINK REF="REF-Poehling-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poehling 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Complications of influenza are common in children and include upper respiratory tract infections (otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, croup), febrile convulsions and exacerbations of asthma. For example, acute otitis media occurs after influenza in 20% to 50% of children under six, with the highest incidence in children less than two years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Belshe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belshe 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neuzil-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuzil 2002</LINK>). In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, almost one in three cases of influenza in the UK were in children aged under 10 (<LINK REF="REF-HPA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">HPA 2009</LINK>). In addition, children with certain chronic medical conditions are at greater risk of developing complications of influenza and children born prematurely are considerably more likely to be hospitalised with respiratory complications than healthy children during influenza seasons (<LINK REF="REF-Izurieta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Izurieta 2000</LINK>). Influenza causes substantial burden on health care and socioeconomic resources. Nationally in the US, the total number of workdays missed yearly by caregivers of children who attended Emergency Department for influenza infections approaches quarter of a million days (<LINK REF="REF-Bourgeois-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourgeois 2009</LINK>). Influenza vaccination is recommended in individuals considered to be at increased risk of serious illness as a result of influenza infection (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2007</LINK>). However, vaccine coverage may be low, especially during the early stages of an influenza pandemic. In children with asthma, vaccine coverage has been reported to be as low as 15% to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many simple and low-cost interventions, such as handwashing and wearing masks, reduce the transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2009b</LINK>). Antiviral medications have been used to reduce transmission and treat infected individuals. Neuraminidase inhibitors are recommended for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza because the efficacy of other antivirals, such as amantadine and rimantadine, are limited by drug resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2009a</LINK>)<I>. </I>Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) is administered orally and is licensed for the treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in children aged over one and who have been symptomatic for no more than two days. Zanamivir (Relenza®) is inhaled as a dry powder and is licensed for treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in children aged five and over within 36 hours of onset of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>). Laninamivir octanoate (CS-8958) is currently being developed by Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). It is the pro-drug of laninamivir, a long-acting neuraminidase inhibitor, which has been shown to have in vitro neuraminidase-inhibitory activity against various influenza A and B viruses, including subtypes of N1 to N9 and oseltamivir resistant viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Yamashita-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamashita 2009</LINK>). Laninamivir octanoate is administered as a single inhaled dose.</P>

<P>Zanamivir (GlaxoSmithKline), administered by inhalation via a Diskhaler(R), is indicated in the UK for the treatment of influenza in children aged five years and older who present with symptoms of influenza when influenza is known to be circulating in the community. It is also indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis in the same age group and for seasonal prophylaxis in children aged over 12 years.</P>
<P>Oseltamivir (Roche), administered orally, is indicated in the UK for the treatment of influenza in children aged one year and older who present with influenza-like symptoms when influenza is known to be circulating. It is also indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis and seasonal prophylaxis in the same age group.</P>
<P>Development of peramivir (BioCryst) was discontinued following initial findings from a phase III clinical trial in adults which demonstrated no statistical difference in relief of influenza symptoms between peramivir (<LINK REF="REF-BioCryst-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BioCryst 2002</LINK>). No paediatric patients were enrolled in trials of the drug (A.K. Schleusner, BioCryst, personal communication, 2002).</P>
<P>Recently, a newer drug, laninamivir octanoate (CS-8958, Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) has undergone studies for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B in children (<LINK REF="STD-Sugaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugaya 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamashita-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamashita 2009</LINK>).

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-11-14 21:31:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The last update of this Cochrane review was in 2005 and included three treatment trials and one prophylaxis trial (<LINK REF="REF-Matheson-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matheson 2007a</LINK>). In addition to this we published an update in 2009 in the BMJ (<LINK REF="REF-Shun_x002d_Shin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shun-Shin 2009</LINK>), including four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of treatment of influenza (two with oseltamivir, two with zanamivir) involving 1766 children (1243 with confirmed influenza, of whom 55% to 69% had influenza A) and three RCTs for prophylaxis (one with oseltamivir, two with zanamivir) involving 863 children. None of these trials tested efficacy with the H1N1 pandemic and at the time of the BMJ review we were aware of seven RCTs currently underway, six being treatment trials and one a prophylaxis trial.</P>
<P>As children have a differing burden of disease and a number of trials of neuraminidase inhibitors are due to report with potentially differing efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, this review will appraise trials of zanamivir, oseltamivir and laninamivir in children aged 12 years and under.</P>

<P>Our primary outcome measure (time to resolution of influenza illness) does not follow a normal distribution: the majority of people get better within a certain time frame and few have persisting symptoms for many more days. Therefore, the median provides a better assessment of clinical effect (a specified percentage will be better within a certain number of days).

The study included 222 contacts aged one to 12 years, for whom a separate subgroup analysis of prophylactic efficacy was conducted. As well as randomising contacts to receive oseltamivir prophylaxis or expectant management, all index cases (including 134 children aged one to 12 years) were treated with a five-day course of twice-daily oral oseltamivir and contacts randomised to the control arm were given a standard treatment course if illness subsequently developed. Limited safety data were available for this population. This was an open-label study, which raises the possibility of bias in outcomes. However, the composite primary endpoint was based on objective measures (laboratory confirmation of infection; temperature greater than or equal to 37.8 °C) as well as subjective (clinical symptoms of influenza). Overall, it was felt that the data were likely to be reliable. Therefore, although not meeting one of our pre-specified inclusion criteria (double-blinding), it was felt that the study should nonetheless be included in the review (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>).</P>

As some of the studies used were unpublished, with the results and methods published on a trial registry, a low score may reflect the limitation of the available data rather than that of the study. The overall risk of bias is presented graphically in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK> an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was used and the primary analysis included participants with incomplete or missing data. In <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK>, appropriate censoring and statistical tests were used. Three children who were randomised but withdrew before taking any medication were excluded from all analyses. In the children with confirmed influenza, there was no efficacy data on 18 and missing data in 28; these participants were censored. Median time to alleviation of all symptoms was presented in both the ITT and confirmed-influenza populations. In <LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK> one child who was randomised to receive oseltamivir withdrew before taking any medication and was excluded from all analyses. The trial also only reported the primary outcome measures for the intention-to-treat infected population (i.e. participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza and the per-protocol population (i.e. participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza who had no major protocol violations or deviations). As <LINK REF="STD-NAI30028" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30028</LINK> has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, the description of the methodology is less detailed compared to that in the other trials included in this review. However, the number of withdrawals from the trial was minimal: only 6/266 participants withdrew (five in the zanamivir group and one in the placebo group). We therefore assessed the risk of bias from incomplete outcome data in this trial to be low.</P>
<P>The numbers of participants who withdrew from or were lost to follow-up in the <LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK> trial were also low. Of the 202 participants in the oseltamivir group, one was lost to follow-up, two discontinued treatment early due to refusal to take study medication and nine discontinued treatment early due to adverse events including vomiting (five children), diarrhoea (two children), vomiting and diarrhoea (one child) and streptococcal tonsillitis (one child). In the placebo group (n = 204), one participant was lost to follow-up and five discontinued treatment early due to adverse events including vomiting (one child), diarrhoea (two children), vomiting and diarrhoea (one child) and insomnia (one child). It is therefore likely that the risk of bias from incomplete outcome data on adverse events in the trial safety (ITT) population was low. However, the study only reported data in the subgroup of children with laboratory-confirmed influenza detected by any laboratory method on any nasal swabs taken during any clinic visits occurring during the course of the study (n = 91). We therefore assessed the overall risk of bias from incomplete outcome data to be unclear.</P>

<P>However, there was significant variation between different trials in terms of the proportion of children who had been vaccinated against influenza at baseline. In <LINK REF="STD-Sugaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugaya 2010</LINK> 47% (86/184) of children had been vaccinated compared to only 19% (65/334) in <LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK>, 13% (13/98) in <LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK>, 5% (34/695) in <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> and 2% (11/471) in <LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK>.</P>

Participants were advised to refrain from taking relief medications unless their symptoms were severe. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK> did not provide participants with relief medications but advised parents to give children analgesics and antipyretics as needed. <LINK REF="STD-Sugaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugaya 2010</LINK> did not report whether or not participants were permitted or advised to use relief medications. Only <LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK> reported relief medication use as an outcome.</P>
<P>Variations in the duration of participant follow-up between different trials may have affected detection rates of secondary complications and adverse events. <LINK REF="STD-NAI30028" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30028</LINK> only presented data on secondary complications and adverse events occurring during the five days on treatment. However, <LINK REF="STD-Sugaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugaya 2010</LINK> followed participants up for 15 days, <LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK> for 21 days, <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK> for 28 days and <LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK> for 14 to 28 days depending on persistence of symptoms.</P>

<P>We were unable to pool data on time to resolution of illness and were only able to summarise data on time to resolution of symptoms across two studies. The pooled estimates of time to alleviation of symptoms and time to return to normal activities provided in the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report by <LINK REF="REF-Turner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2002</LINK> was based on an approximation using mean and median data to account for censoring and assuming an exponential distribution for the survival function.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Otitis media</HEADING>
<P>Treatment with oseltamivir was associated with a small reduction in the incidence of otitis media in children aged one to five years with laboratory-confirmed influenza (risk difference (RD) -0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.24 to -0.04). One placebo-controlled trial of zanamivir (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30028" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30028</LINK>) did not demonstrate any difference in the incidence of otitis media between children treated with zanamivir or placebo. This may be explained by the low incidence of otitis media among participants in this trial, the lower prevalence of otitis media in children over the age of five years, the trial's relatively short follow-up period (five days) compared to those of <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> (28 days) and <LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK> (21 days) and difficulties with administration of inhaled zanamivir. In children, less than 8% of inhaled zanamivir is systemically absorbed (10% to 20% in adults), with the highest concentrations occurring in lung tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Peng-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peng 2000</LINK>). In contrast, oseltamivir provides 80% systemic bioavailability of its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, after oral dosing in adults, with good penetration to middle ear and sinus secretions (<LINK REF="REF-Bardsley_x002d_Elliot-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bardsley-Elliot 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hayden-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayden 2001</LINK>). The benefits of the two drugs in treating extra-pulmonary complications may therefore not be equivalent, owing to the markedly different levels of drug exposure in extra-pulmonary tissues.</P>
<P>Based on data from <LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> (Winther 2010), 12 children with laboratory-confirmed influenza would need to be treated with oseltamivir to prevent one case of otitis media, regardless of whether or not acute otitis media was present at enrolment (95% CI 7 to 34). Amongst children aged one to five years, in whom acute otitis media is more common, the number needed to benefit (NNTB) is only eight (95% CI 5 to 25). Benefits may be maximised further by targeting children at high risk of developing acute otitis media, such as the very young (less than two years old) or children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media (<LINK REF="REF-Lindbaek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindbaek 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK> reported a non-significant reduction in acute otitis media in children with clinical influenza treated with oseltamivir (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.03).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Children with asthma</HEADING>
<P>Only one study directly investigated the efficacy of oseltamivir in reducing the time to recovery from illness and asthma-related symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK>). Whilst the study reported a trend to benefit in the primary endpoint of median time to freedom from illness this was not statistically significant and of a small magnitude (10 hours). Furthermore, whilst the median improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> by Day 6 (secondary endpoint) showed a statistically significant benefit with oseltamivir, its magnitude was also small at 6.1% (10.8% versus 4.7% improvement with placebo); similar results were found when measuring the incidence of asthma exacerbations.</P>
<P>A study of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in 329 children and adolescents aged six to 17 years with asthma (<LINK REF="STD-NV16871" TYPE="STUDY">NV16871</LINK>; not eligible for this review as no data were separately reported for children aged up to and including 12 years) also observed no difference in time to resolution of symptoms in children with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Furthermore, the clinical significance of the reduction in asthma endpoints is unknown. Studies with a better control of the "step-up" therapy for the illness are required.</P>
<P>In children with asthma who experience a viral-induced exacerbation, the clinical scenario which is most likely to present and concern the primary care physician, the probability of it being caused by an influenza virus is actually less than in the general population of children who present with a fever. Consequently, under such circumstances and prescribing on a clinical case definition, the overall average efficacy (or number needed to treat to benefit) will be lower. Therefore, we found no evidence of benefit in the median time to resolution of illness and a small benefit in a FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and number of asthma exacerbations at Day 7 with oseltamivir in treating children with influenza.</P>
<P>Based on guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Medicine and Healthcare Regulatory Authority (MHRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), zanamivir is not recommended for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in individuals with underlying airways disease (such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) due to risk of serious bronchospasm (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FDA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MHRA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">MHRA 2009</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Children 'at risk'</HEADING>
<P>There is a higher rate of complications of influenza in children with underlying chronic medical conditions than in healthy children (<LINK REF="REF-Meier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meier 2000</LINK>). However, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK> (which involved children with asthma) our included studies either did not report 'at risk' conditions in participating children (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30028" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30028</LINK>) or excluded children with 'at risk' conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugaya 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK>). Consequently, current evidence for the efficacy and safety of neuraminidase inhibitors in 'at risk' children is based on a combination of case reports or series and inference from healthy populations, assuming a fixed-effect for benefit and a constant risk of adverse effects. We found four trials in 'at risk' populations which are still awaiting classification. Two trials have been completed but only summary results have been made available for one (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00412737" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00412737</LINK>) and no results have yet been published for the other (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00298233" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00298233</LINK>). One trial is reported as ongoing but not recruiting participants (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00867139" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00867139</LINK>) and another as still recruiting participants (<LINK REF="STD-NV20234" TYPE="STUDY">NV20234</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylaxis of influenza</HEADING>
<P>Based on data from 648 children in trials treated with either zanamivir or placebo, prophylaxis with zanamivir caused a significant reduction in risk ratio of developing symptomatic influenza in children after the introduction of and index case to the household (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62, P = 0.001).</P>
<P>This efficacy is based on initiating prophylaxis in the rest of the household and, in <LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK>, also in the index case. The latter in theory should reduce secondary exposure, thereby improving the protective efficacy but the individual effect is unknown.</P>
<P>Only one (open-label) trial of oseltamivir for the prevention of influenza transmission in households reported data for paediatric contacts. Where index cases had laboratory-confirmed influenza, a protective efficacy for oseltamivir prophylaxis of 55% was observed, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.089). One reason for this relatively modest effect appeared to be that some contacts were already positive for sub-clinical influenza infection (diagnosed by viral culture of throat and nose swabs) when prophylaxis was commenced - in a retrospective analysis of paediatric contacts who were confirmed to be influenza negative at baseline, protective efficacy rose to 80% (P = 0.021). In clinical practice, it is not possible to make this distinction. On the other hand, in the ITT group (which was not the trial's primary population of analysis) a statistically significant protective efficacy of 64% was seen. As influenza was circulating in the community, there is a high likelihood of a secondary contact source. Consequently, the modest effect in the ITTI population may relate to the low numbers (129 children in total) and the results from the ITT population may be more representative. Therefore, at present, the evidence supporting the use of oseltamivir for the post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in children remains weak.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Serotype of influenza</HEADING>
<P>Although public health surveillance is able to specify the serotype of influenza circulating at a given time many currently available near-patient tests are unable to distinguish between different influenza serotypes. There is considerable variation between the findings of different studies in terms of the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors against different influenza serotypes. Zanamivir produced significant reductions in time to resolution of symptoms in children with influenza A and children with influenza B (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK>). Oseltamivir produced a significant reduction in time to resolution of illness and time to resolution of symptoms in children aged one to three years with influenza A but not in children with influenza B (<LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> reported a non-significant benefit in children with influenza B treated with oseltamivir. Oseltamivir did not produce a significant reduction in incidence of acute otitis media in children with influenza A or children with influenza B when treatment was commenced within 24 hours of symptom onset, although a trend to reduction in children with influenza A was observed when treatment was commenced within 12 hours of symptom onset (<LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK>). Laninamivir octanoate significantly reduced time to resolution of symptoms in children with influenza A/H1N1 (but not influenza A/H3N2 or influenza B) compared to oseltamivir, but this was only based on a small sample of 184 children. Current evidence therefore does not conclusively support targeting neuraminidase inhibitor treatment at specific influenza serotypes. In smaller studies there may have been too few children with influenza B to detect a significant treatment effect.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Safety and tolerability</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events related to study medication can be difficult to separate from symptoms and complications of influenza infection itself when these events are assessed in treatment trials. The markedly different incidences of adverse events reported in the control arms of <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK>, as compared with <LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NAI30028" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30028</LINK> may relate to systematic differences in study design, reporting methods and duration of follow-up, resulting in different sensitivities for detection and reporting of mild events. The adverse event profile of zanamivir was no worse than placebo but vomiting was more common in children treated with oseltamivir than with placebo (number needed to harm = 17). The adverse event profile of laninamivir octanoate was similar to that of oseltamivir. Even so, <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> reported that only 1% of the study population discontinued their study drug because of vomiting.</P>
<P>The adverse event profile of zanamivir was similar to that of placebo. This may relate to the different methods of drug administration and the consequent low absorption of zanamivir into the systemic circulation. Administration via inhalation may also underlie rare reports of bronchospasm in adults treated with zanamivir (but not oseltamivir), many but not all of whom had underlying chronic respiratory conditions (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK> - FDA 2003; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2000</LINK>). However, we did not identify any reports of zanamivir-related bronchospasm in children, and nor was bronchospasm reported in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Lalezari-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lalezari 2001</LINK>) and RCT (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2000</LINK>) examining the use of zanamivir in high-risk patients.</P>

<P>In the only trial we found involving children with asthma (<LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK>), children had asthma severe enough to require regular medical follow-up monitoring or hospital care. We did not find any trials conducted in children with less severe or better-controlled asthma. We also did not find any trials in children in other 'at risk' groups, which met the eligibility criteria for this review. We found one abstract of a randomised placebo-controlled trial studying the safety and tolerability of a 12-week course of oseltamivir prophylaxis in solid organ transplant and haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, including children (<LINK REF="STD-Shapira-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 2010</LINK>). However, we were unable to include this study because data on paediatric cases aged up to and including 12 years were not reported separately.</P>
<P>We found one trial comparing laninamivir octanoate with oseltamivir (<LINK REF="STD-Sugaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugaya 2010</LINK>) but no trials comparing laninamivir octanoate with placebo or comparing zanamivir with oseltamivir.

In two studies, children had to test positive for influenza based on rapid near-patient testing to enter the trial (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30028" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30028</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugaya 2010</LINK>). Two treatment trials (<LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NAI30028" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30028</LINK>) reported outcomes in both the ITT and ITTI populations.

<P>Studies varied both in the outcomes measured and in the consistency of reporting of results, particularly time to resolution of illness and time to resolution of symptoms. We were unable to pool these data from different studies because we did not have access to individual patient data. <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> - Winther 2010 only reported summary data (risk ratios and 95% CIs) on the development of new acute otitis media infections in three age subgroups (one to two years, three to five years and six to 12 years).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Availability of data</HEADING>
<P>We identified several negative results reported by regulatory bodies as part of drug licensing and approval assessments that had, at least initially, not been published in peer-reviewed journal articles or conference presentations (<LINK REF="REF-Symmonds-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Symmonds 2004</LINK>). For example, non-significant primary endpoint data for children with influenza B were only available from the EMEA (<LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> - EMEA 2005).</P>
<P>Whether these omissions represent true publication bias (failure to publish negative or null results) or time-lag bias (trials with positive results are published more quickly than trials with negative or null results) is not clear, although the latter is well known to exaggerate treatment effects in early meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Hopewell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopewell 2006</LINK>). In general, both Roche and GlaxoSmithKline were willing to supply conference abstracts/posters and references to published data but, with the exception of the children subgroup in <LINK REF="STD-NAI30010" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NAI30031-_x0028_Monto-2002_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30031 (Monto 2002)</LINK> and a number of clarifications by Roche, would not provide re-analyses or additional data.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis of influenza</HEADING>
<P>Diagnosing influenza based on clinical features has high sensitivity but limited specificity. In the clinical trials included in this review, this specificity ranged from 24% (<LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK>) to 73% (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK>). However, influenza is usually diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and signs in clinical practice outside of a research trial setting. Amongst children aged 14 years or less attending UK general practices with influenza-like illness (fever, cough and respiratory tract illness) during three successive winter seasons, influenza was detected in only 30% to 39% of nasopharyngeal swabs submitted for virological surveillance (<LINK REF="REF-Zambon-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zambon 2001a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treating children with neuraminidase inhibitors based on a clinical diagnosis of influenza may decrease their overall benefit. Rapid near-patient influenza tests may improve the accuracy with which children with influenza virus infection can be identified. However, some variation in the performance of different tests has previously been demonstrated. In a direct comparison of four rapid diagnostic tests for influenza amongst a predominantly paediatric population, using viral culture and direct immunofluorescence as a gold standard, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 72% to 95% and 76% to 84%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The predictive value of clinical features and near-patient influenza tests improves during periods of high influenza activity. During an influenza epidemic (number of consultations for influenza-like illness &gt; 100 per 100,000 population), the presence of previous influenza-like contacts, cough, expectoration on the first day of illness and fever (&gt; 37.8 °C) increases the likelihood for influenza threefold (<LINK REF="REF-Michiels-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michiels 2011</LINK>). A review evaluating the performance of the QuickVue(R) near-patient influenza test found no consistent relationship between the diagnostic performance of QuickVue(R) and the broadness of clinical diagnostic criteria, although the positive predictive value of QuickVue(R) was higher during influenza seasons and epidemics (<LINK REF="REF-Petrozzino-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrozzino 2010</LINK>). Surveillance data on influenza activity in the community should therefore be considered alongside clinical features and near-patient test results when assessing the likelihood of influenza virus infection and potential benefit from prescribing neuraminidase inhibitors in a clinical setting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Timing of treatment</HEADING>
<P>Successful treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors in adults requires commencement of therapy as soon as possible, when influenza virus replication in the respiratory tract is maximal (<LINK REF="REF-Moscona-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moscona 2005</LINK>). Data reported in this review are for patients treated within 24 (<LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK>) to 48 (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30028" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30028</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK>) hours of symptoms onset. Amongst children aged 14 years or younger attending UK General Practices during a winter influenza season who received a clinical diagnosis of influenza infection, 64% presented within two days of becoming ill (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2000</LINK>). Commencement of therapy is not generally recommended outside this period, although it may be considered for critically ill, hospitalised patients.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK> performed subgroup analyses on participants treated &lt; 24 hours and &gt;= 24 hours after the development of symptoms. Differences in time to return to normal health and activity and time to alleviation of symptoms between children treated with oseltamivir or placebo were not statistically significant in either of these subgroups. Participants who received treatment &lt; 24 hours after symptom onset experienced a larger reduction in time to return to normal health and activity than participants treated &gt;= 24 hours after symptom onset. However, the study did not report whether or not this difference was statistically significant. <LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK> performed a pre-defined subgroup analysis in children treated with oseltamivir within 12 hours of symptom onset. Oseltamivir prevented the development of acute otitis media in this subgroup but no significant reduction in the incidence of acute otitis media in children treated with oseltamivir within 24 hours of symptom onset was observed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Age-related issues</HEADING>
<P>This review includes treatment trials whose participants were children up to and including 12 years of age. One trial was conducted in preschool children aged one to three years (<LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK>), one in children aged nine years and under (<LINK REF="STD-Sugaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugaya 2010</LINK>) and three in children aged five to 12 years (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NAI30028" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30028</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> was conducted in children aged one to 12 years, but Whitley 2001 presented data stratified according to three age groups (up to and including two years, two to five years, older than five years) and Winther 2010 presented summary statistics for the incidence of acute otitis media in children aged one to two years, three to five years and six to 12 years.</P>
<P>Young preschool children with laboratory-confirmed influenza gain the greatest benefit from oseltamivir treatment in terms of reducing the incidence of acute otitis media. <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> (Winther 2010) reported that the benefit of oseltamivir treatment in preventing the development of acute otitis media was most evident in children aged one to two years. In <LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK> oseltamivir treatment within 12 hours of symptom onset significantly reduced the incidence of acute otitis media in children aged one to three years.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> (Whitley 2001) found that oseltamivir significantly reduced median duration of illness in children aged one to 12 years. However, oseltamivir did not significantly reduce duration of illness in any of the three age subgroups (up to and including two years, two to five years, older than five years). The study also did not report whether differences in shortening of illness duration between these subgroups were statistically significant.</P>
<P>Oseltamivir is an oral medication and suitable for children aged one to 12 years. Zanamivir is delivered by inhalation and is only suitable for children aged five years or older. Laninamivir octanoate (CS-8958) is the prodrug of laninamivir, a long-acting neuraminidase inhibitor being developed by Daiichi Sankyo, which is also delivered by inhalation. In <LINK REF="STD-Sugaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugaya 2010</LINK>, the age range of participants was three to nine years. It may be difficult to administer inhaled antiviral medications successfully to children because of problems generating adequate peak inspiratory flow rates. These problems may still occur in older children. <LINK REF="REF-Peng-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peng 2000</LINK> described 16 children aged five to 12 years who received zanamivir by Diskhaler, of whom five had either no detectable serum zanamivir concentrations at any time during the eight hours after dosing or had zanamivir concentrations below quantifiable limits at later time points in the study. Furthermore, FDA 2003 (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK>) states that zanamivir "is indicated only for children seven years of age or older". This evaluation is based on the combination of lower estimates of treatment effect in five and six year olds compared with the overall study population and evidence of "inadequate inhalation through the Diskhaler". Since we do not have access to efficacy data for zanamivir by age group, it is reasonable to agree with the FDA's opinion that zanamivir be limited to children aged seven years or older. Laninamivir octanoate may be easier to administer effectively in younger children than zanamivir because it can be given as a single inhaled dose whereas the treatment regimen of zanamivir involves twice-daily inhaled doses over a five-day period.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Development of resistance</HEADING>
<P>The emergence of strains of influenza resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, with no decrease in virulence, has been well documented. However, resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors can also arise through mutations in haemagglutinin or neuraminidase (<LINK REF="REF-Zambon-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zambon 2001b</LINK>). Increasing oseltamivir resistance has been reported internationally and may be associated with an increased risk of influenza-related complications. During the 2008/2009 influenza season, a total of 30 countries from all WHO regions reported oseltamivir resistance for 1291 of 1362 A(H1N1) viruses analysed. The prevalence of oseltamivir resistance was very high in Canada, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Japan, the Republic of Korea, USA, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden and the UK (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). A recent meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>) reported a pooled incidence rate for oseltamivir resistance of 2.6% (95% CI 0.7% to 5.5%) and found that oseltamivir resistance was significantly associated with pneumonia. However, the pooled incidence rate for zanamivir resistance was 0% and the incidence of peramivir resistance was 0% in one included study. The documented rates of oseltamivir resistance following treatment have been higher in children than in adults, perhaps because children shed virus particles for longer or have a less effective initial immune response to infection (<LINK REF="REF-Moscona-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moscona 2005</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK> no evidence of zanamivir resistance was reported (although this was investigated in a sample of only nine children) and in <LINK REF="STD-Gubareva-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gubareva 1998</LINK> the treatment regimen and clinical circumstances under which emerged a zanamivir-resistant strain of influenza B were both highly atypical.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-14 21:54:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment with oseltamivir or zanamivir is only associated with modest reductions in duration of illness (range 0.4 to 1.5 days) and time to resolution of influenza symptoms (mean difference (MD) 1.36 days, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.95). Based on the findings of one trial, laninamivir octanoate 20 mg produces significantly more rapid alleviation of symptoms than oseltamivir by 2.76 days in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza.</P>
<P>One trial found that oseltamivir produced a small improvement in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>in the first six days of illness in children with asthma. Oseltamivir treatment also produces a small reduction in the development of acute otitis media in children aged one to five years with laboratory-confirmed influenza (RD -0.14, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.04), particularly if treatment is commenced within 12 hours of symptom onset. No benefit has been demonstrated for zanamivir.</P>
<P>A household prophylaxis strategy reduces the absolute risk of developing influenza by 8%. This means that 13 children would have to be treated with a 10-day course of zanamivir or oseltamivir to prevent one additional child from developing influenza.</P>
<P>The adverse event profile of zanamivir was no worse than placebo but vomiting was more common in children treated with oseltamivir than with placebo. Oseltamivir was associated with an additional one in 17 children treated developing vomiting. The adverse event profile of laninamivir octanoate was similar to that of oseltamivir.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-11-14 21:55:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Attrition rates were low among participants in our included studies. However, there was wide variation in the duration of follow-up between different studies, ranging from five days (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30028" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30028</LINK>) to 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK>). The completeness of data collected on clinical efficacy outcomes and adverse events may have been restricted in studies with shorter follow-up periods. <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> (Winther 2010) reported age-stratified data on the development of new acute otitis media infections as risk ratios and 95% CIs. Since no raw data were reported, we were unable to include these participants in <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>.</P>
<P>The findings of this review are mainly applicable to healthy children who are not in 'at risk' groups. We only found one trial (<LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK>) which was conducted in an 'at risk' group of children (children with asthma) even though, as previously mentioned, children in 'at risk' groups with underlying chronic medical conditions are at greater risk of developing complications of influenza (<LINK REF="REF-Meier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meier 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Levels of influenza activity also need to be considered carefully when estimating the likely effect of treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors in a clinical setting. Our findings were based mainly on data from children with either laboratory-confirmed influenza (<LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK>) or influenza diagnosed on rapid near-patient testing (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30028" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30028</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugaya 2010</LINK>). However, rapid near-patient influenza tests are not currently used on a routine basis in clinical settings and influenza is therefore diagnosed on initial presentation based on the presence of clinical features of influenza-like illness. The treatment effect of neuraminidase inhibitors is likely to be less pronounced in patients with influenza-like illness, since only a proportion will have influenza virus infection.</P>
<P>In populations where a high proportion of children are vaccinated against influenza, the apparent efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors may be reduced as the severity of influenza illness is often milder in vaccinated than in unvaccinated children. There was significant variation in the rates of influenza vaccination between trials comparing oseltamivir or zanamivir with placebo, ranging from 2% (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK>) to 19% (<LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK>). In studies involving a high proportion of vaccinated children, the apparent efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors may be reduced as the severity of influenza illness is often milder in vaccinated than in unvaccinated children. In <LINK REF="STD-Sugaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugaya 2010</LINK>, 47% of children had been vaccinated against influenza. Vaccination rates varied between 35.5% in the oseltamivir group and 55.7% in the laninamivir 40 mg group. However, the authors report that the differences in vaccination rates between the three arms of their trial were not statistically significant. No baseline data on other vaccinations against infections which might lead to complications in children with influenza, including <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> b (Hib), Meningococcus group C (MenC) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) were presented in any of the included trials.</P>
<P>Since all our included trials were conducted in the context of seasonal influenza, the applicability of their findings in an influenza pandemic is uncertain.</P>

<P>The methodological quality of our included studies was generally moderate. The risk of bias was rated as low in only one of the nine included studies (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30009" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30009</LINK>). In four studies the risk of selection bias was unclear, as insufficient details were given about how the randomisation sequence was generated and how allocation concealment was performed (<LINK REF="STD-NAI30010" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NAI30028" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30028</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NAI30031-_x0028_Monto-2002_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">NAI30031 (Monto 2002)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK>). One study provided details of the randomisation method used but not of the method used for allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-WV16193" TYPE="STUDY">WV16193</LINK>) was open-label but was still included as we deemed the overall risk of bias to be low. The risk of reporting bias was assessed to be high in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heinonen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Heinonen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WV15759_x002f_WV15871" TYPE="STUDY">WV15759/WV15871</LINK>), which only reported efficacy outcome findings in participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza.

<P>Although we used a comprehensive search strategy for this 2011 update, we only added new published data to this review. As a result, our findings may have been subject to significant publication bias. We added peramivir to our search strategy but did not find any studies involving peramivir which met the eligibility criteria for this review. We found one trial comparing laninamivir octanoate with oseltamivir (<LINK REF="STD-Sugaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sugaya 2010</LINK>) but no trials comparing laninamivir octanoate with placebo.</P>
<P>Studies varied both in the outcomes measured and in the consistency of reporting of results, particularly time to resolution of illness and time to resolution of symptoms. Results were not always reported in sufficient detail for children in preschool and school age groups (<LINK REF="STD-WV15758" TYPE="STUDY">WV15758</LINK> - Winther 2010). These factors severely hampered our ability to pool results from different studies. We pooled together results from placebo-controlled trials of zanamivir and oseltamivir because there were few data available for analysis from our included studies.</P>
<P>None of our included studies was sufficiently powered to determine the effects of neuraminidase inhibitors on serious complications of influenza (such as pneumonia or admission to hospital) and we found no evidence from these trials on efficacy and safety in children aged under one year.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-03-08 07:53:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If near-patient testing is available and economic resources permit, oseltamivir may be considered for the treatment of children aged one to 12 years with influenza infection provided that therapy can be commenced within 48 hours of the start of the illness. However, the benefits of oseltamivir treatment are likely to be relatively modest. Oseltamivir reduces duration of illness by about a day and is associated with a slight reduction in the incidence of acute otitis media, particularly in younger children (children aged one to 12 years number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 12 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7 to 34) to prevent one case; children aged one to five years NNTB = 8 (95% CI 5 to 25) to prevent one case). Oseltamivir is the preferred treatment because a reduction in secondary complications, in particular acute otitis media, has not been demonstrated for zanamivir.</P>
<P>If near-patient testing is not available, the case for oseltamivir is less compelling. Benefits will be reduced on a proportionate basis, corresponding to the specificity of clinical diagnosis for influenza infection. Assuming a specificity of 50%, the NNTB to prevent one case of acute otitis media would be doubled to 24.</P>
<P>Oseltamivir may be considered for use in children aged one to 12 years for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in the household (when another family member is affected), although the evidence supporting this intervention is weak.</P>
<P>There is currently no high-quality evidence to support targeted treatment of 'at risk' children (with underlying chronic medical conditions) with neuraminidase inhibitors, as benefit has not been shown in this population (oseltamivir and zanamivir) and bronchospasm remains a theoretical risk (zanamivir) (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FDA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MHRA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">MHRA 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further Cochrane review on neuraminidase inhibitors in the treatment and prevention of influenza in healthy adults and children was published in December 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2012</LINK>). This subsequent review includes unpublished study data and may therefore result in different conclusions to those reported in our review, the 2011 update of which only included published data. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-05-26 13:54:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More data are needed to clarify the benefits of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza in 'at risk' children (including addressing the potential confounder of prior vaccination) and children with influenza B. In the treatment trials included in this review, children with influenza were identified on a retrospective laboratory basis. Prospective trials are required that use near-patient testing to identify influenza positive children. Greater selectivity in reporting a limited number of clinically relevant outcome measures is also needed to avoid the problems of multiple comparisons. In particular, larger trials are needed to determine the effect of neuraminidase inhibitors on the incidence of serious complications of influenza (such as pneumonia or hospital admission).</P>
<P>Further information on the use of neuraminidase inhibitors for the prevention of influenza in children could be provided directly by future trials, or by re-analysis of data from studies of influenza prophylaxis in households, which included children but did not break-out data for the paediatric population.</P>
<P>Head-to-head comparison of oseltamivir versus zanamivir would allow clarification of the efficacy of these drugs in relation to each other in treating secondary complications and the frequency of drug-related adverse events. Comparing laninamivir against placebo and against oseltamivir in children with oseltamivir-sensitive influenza infection would also help further characterise its efficacy.</P>
<P>Cost-effectiveness studies may help define the role of neuraminidase inhibitors in clinical practice and further data from clinical use in large populations are required to determine the implications of viral resistance in practice.</P>

<P>Search terms used were 'Zanamivir OR Relenza OR Oseltamivir OR Tamiflu OR Laninamivir OR Peramivir OR "Neuraminidase Inhibitor"'.</P>
<P>We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register.</P>
<P>For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2005, Issue 1); MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005); EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2004); the online GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Trials Register; and the online Roche Clinical Trial Protocol Registry and Clinical Trial Results Database (August 2005). A dialogue was established with Roche and GlaxoSmithKline and, if relevant, we contacted first authors of retrieved studies.</P>
<P>We searched MEDLINE and CENTRAL using the following search terms, which were adapted to search the other electronic databases. There were no language restrictions.</P>

Contact was established with the authors of the more recent NHS HTA Report (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Websites of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (http://www.fda.gov), including MedWatch (the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program; http://www.fda.gov/medwatch), and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) (http://www.emea.eu.int) were searched for references to additional trials/data and for post-marketing reports of adverse events (October 2005).</P>
<P>In addition, we contacted the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to retrieve any reports of adverse events by companies or practitioners via the Yellow Card Scheme (August 2005).</P>
