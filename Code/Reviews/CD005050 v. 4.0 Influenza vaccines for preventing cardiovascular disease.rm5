<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-04-15 09:54:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Flu infection may make cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart attack, stroke) and associated death more likely, and flu vaccination may reduce this risk. We included randomised studies comparing people receiving flu vaccine with those receiving no vaccine (placebo or no treatment). For this review update, we found eight trials studying 12,029 participants. Four of these studies examined patients with known heart disease (1682 participants), and the other four focused on the general population or elderly people (10,347 participants). The general population studies reported cardiovascular disease outcomes as part of their safety analyses, but the numbers of cases were too few to allow a judgement on whether flu vaccination was protective in these populations, and no differences were seen between groups. Overall, studies in people with heart disease suggest that flu vaccination may reduce death as a result of cardiovascular disease and may reduce combined cardiovascular disease events (such as heart attacks, strokes, necessity for bypass operations, etc.). However, these studies were small and had some risk of bias, so larger studies of better quality are needed to confirm the results.</P>

<P>We included eight trials of influenza vaccination compared with placebo or no vaccination, with 12,029 participants receiving at least one vaccination or control treatment. We included six new studies (n = 11,251), in addition to the two included in the previous version of the review. Four of these trials (n = 10,347) focused on prevention of influenza in the general or elderly population and reported cardiovascular outcomes among their safety analyses; four trials (n = 1682) focused on prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with established coronary heart disease. These populations were analysed separately. Follow-up continued between 42 days and one year. Five RCTs showed deficits in at least three of the risk of bias criteria assessed. When reported (seven studies), vaccination provided adequate immunogenicity or protection against influenza. Cardiovascular mortality was reported by four secondary prevention trials and was significantly reduced by influenza vaccination overall (risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.76; P value 0.003) with no significant heterogeneity between studies, and by three trials reporting cardiovascular mortality as part of their safety analyses when the numbers of events were too small to permit conclusions. In studies of patients with coronary heart disease, composite outcomes of cardiovascular events tended to be decreased with influenza vaccination compared with placebo. Generally no significant difference was found between comparison groups regarding individual outcomes such as myocardial infarction.</P>

<P>In patients with cardiovascular disease, influenza vaccination may reduce cardiovascular mortality and combined cardiovascular events.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-15 09:56:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of the original review published in 2008.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-15 06:10:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the number one cause of death globally (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011a</LINK>). Cardiovascular disease is the result of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and includes cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease (CHD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011b</LINK>). In 2008, an estimated 17.3 million people died from CVD, representing 30% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, an estimated 7.3 million were due to CHD and 6.2 million to stroke (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011a</LINK>). More than 80% of CVD deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, and the number of CVD deaths is expected to increase to 23.3 million by 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-Mathers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathers 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011a</LINK>). These data demonstrate that new treatment modalities and better preventive strategies are needed.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-15 06:13:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Influenza vaccine is protective against influenza infection in healthy adults (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2007</LINK>), and large cohort studies have shown that influenza vaccination is effective in preventing morbidity and mortality in the community. Influenza vaccination reduces influenza-like disease, pneumonia and risk of death among elderly persons (<LINK REF="REF-Nichol-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichol 2007</LINK>). Furthermore, a possible association has been shown between influenza vaccination and reduced all-cause death, heart attack and stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Nichol-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichol 2003</LINK>). However, given the observational nature of these studies, the results are potentially prone to bias (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simonsen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simonsen 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Generally, influenza vaccine is safe and well tolerated. Local reaction (soreness, redness, tenderness or swelling) at the site of injection is observed in 64% of vaccinated people. Red eyes, fever, runny noise, hoarse voice and cough have occasionally been reported. Rarely, influenza vaccine can cause allergic reactions (immediate hypersensitivity reactions) (<LINK REF="REF-Fiore-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiore 2010</LINK>). No clear link to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has been observed over many years of vaccine use. However, if any risk should occur, no more than one or two cases per million vaccinations would be expected (<LINK REF="REF-ACIP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACIP 2012</LINK>). In the light of all risks and benefits, risk of a serious reaction to influenza vaccine is much less than risk of severe influenza disease, which can be prevented by vaccination. Influenza vaccine is considered a very safe product with many benefits, especially for members of high-risk groups.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-04-15 09:56:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Increased risk of cardiovascular disease during influenza infection has been shown in a large case series that used within-person comparisons (<LINK REF="REF-Smeeth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeeth 2004</LINK>). Smeeth et al included 20,486 persons with first myocardial infarction and 19,063 persons with first stroke from the General Practitioner Database. They showed that, although no increase was seen after influenza vaccination, risk of acute cardiovascular events increased fivefold in the first three days after respiratory tract infection. In addition, risk of stroke increased threefold during this period. These findings suggest a causal role for acute infection triggering cardiovascular events. <LINK REF="REF-Warren_x002d_Gash-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren-Gash 2009</LINK> carried out a systematic review of the evidence that influenza infection triggers acute myocardial infection and cardiovascular death. These review authors included 37 observational studies and two randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Observational studies showed a consistent association between influenza infection and myocardial infarction. Evidence of an association with cardiovascular death was weaker. Investigators found similar associations in two subsequent large observational studies from the UK and Hong Kong (<LINK REF="REF-Warren_x002d_Gash-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren-Gash 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren_x002d_Gash-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren-Gash 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain why influenza infection may trigger cardiovascular events (<LINK REF="REF-Hebsur-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebsur 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2012</LINK>). Although several infectious agents are thought to increase cardiovascular risk through a cascade of systemic infection and subsequent inflammation, the influenza virus may play a more specific role in triggering acute events by exclusively targeting areas of atherosclerosis and destabilising preexisting plaques. Other potential mechanisms include high-density lipoprotein, loss of anti-inflammatory properties, endothelial dysfunction, deposition of immune complexes in atherosclerotic plaques and elevation of macrophage circulation into the arteries.</P>
<P>Several studies have shown that influenza vaccination protects against acute coronary syndromes (<LINK REF="REF-Naghavi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naghavi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nichol-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichol 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siscovick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siscovick 2000</LINK>). In a large cohort study, Nichol and co-workers found that hospitalisation for acute coronary syndromes was reduced among participants who received influenza vaccination (<LINK REF="REF-Nichol-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichol 2003</LINK>). During two consecutive seasons, more than 140,000 members of managed care organisations 65 years of age or older were studied. During two consecutive years, influenza vaccination reduced the risk of hospitalisation for cardiac disease by 19% and reduced the risk of hospitalisation for cerebrovascular disease by 16%. Therefore investigators concluded that influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk of heart disease and cerebrovascular disease during influenza season.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-04-15 06:21:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The observational nature of most studies makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions, and many questions remain. Observational studies in this area may be prone to the following sources of bias: (1) "healthy user bias", whereby 'healthy&#8217; people have higher vaccine uptake than 'unhealthy&#8217; people and are likely to exhibit a range of healthy behaviours and to have better health outcomes regardless of vaccination; (2) "frailty selection bias", by which more frail people who are closer to death may be less likely to receive influenza vaccine than other people; and (3) apparent protective effects of influenza vaccine against death outside the influenza season, which are shown in some observational studies, suggesting residual biases or mechanisms other than influenza prevention.</P>
<P>In addition, the effectiveness of influenza vaccination is dependent on many factors including the age and immunity of recipients and the effectiveness of the vaccine. Indeed, influenza vaccination is most effective when the inactive influenza strains in the vaccine match the circulating strains in the community. In seasons with a poor match, the reduction in hospitalisation and death is smaller than in seasons with a good match (<LINK REF="REF-Nichol-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichol 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because effective influenza vaccines are cheap and widely available, use of influenza vaccination to prevent acute coronary syndromes is an appealing prevention strategy for those at risk. Whether influenza vaccination reduces cardiovascular disease remains not fully established. This systematic review assesses the effects of influenza vaccination in people with and without cardiovascular disease for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Study participants fell within three main groups (n = 12,029 in total). The first group of studies (n = 5267 participants) comprised two RCTs including healthy adults over 18 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Langley-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 2011a</LINK>) or between 18 and 60 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2010</LINK>). In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Langley-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 2011a</LINK>, adults with controlled chronic disease were eligible, but no information was provided as to what proportion of participants had chronic disease. <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2010</LINK> excluded participants with chronic disease. Participants in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Langley-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 2011a</LINK> were between 18 and 91 years of age (mean age of participants younger than 65 years was around 39 years, and 72 years for participants 65 years of age or older), and mean age was around 42 years in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2010</LINK>. Between 40% and 47% of participants were men.</P>
<P>The second group of two studies (n = 5080) included participants of 60 years of age or older (<LINK REF="STD-De-Villiers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">De Villiers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1994</LINK>) with controlled chronic conditions. Participants were between 60 and 98 years of age, mean age was around 70 years in the study by <LINK REF="STD-De-Villiers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">De Villiers 2009</LINK> and most participants were between 60 and 74 years old in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1994</LINK>. Between 39% and 49% of participants were men. Between 13.5% and 16% had cardiac disease (undefined), and 2% to 9% had diabetes mellitus. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-De-Villiers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">De Villiers 2009</LINK>, 50.5% of participants had hypertension.</P>
<P>The third group comprised four studies (n = 1682) including participants with known coronary artery disease (<LINK REF="STD-FLUCAD-2008" TYPE="STUDY">FLUCAD 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FLUVACS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">FLUVACS 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IVCAD-2009" TYPE="STUDY">IVCAD 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phrommintikul-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Phrommintikul 2011</LINK>) with variable age cutoffs (older than 21 to older than 50 years). <LINK REF="STD-FLUCAD-2008" TYPE="STUDY">FLUCAD 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-FLUVACS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">FLUVACS 2002</LINK> reported outcomes for subgroups of participants with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and those undergoing coronary revascularisation procedures. <LINK REF="STD-IVCAD-2009" TYPE="STUDY">IVCAD 2009</LINK> also included these two groups of participants without distinguishing between subgroups, and the study by <LINK REF="STD-Phrommintikul-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Phrommintikul 2011</LINK> included participants admitted to hospital with an acute coronary syndrome. Mean age of participants was between 58 and 67 years, and between 52% and 74% were men. Studies included participants with acute MI (with ST or non-ST segment MI) as well as those with coronary stenosis or angina and those undergoing revascularisation procedures.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Details of the vaccines received can be found in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. Six trials gave single injections of influenza vaccine, and two trials gave a second dose after 21 days (<LINK REF="STD-Langley-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2010</LINK>). Most trials compared one intervention group with a control group, and only <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2010</LINK> included six intervention groups with different doses of whole or split virion vaccines with or without aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. In most trials, the control group received placebo injections; one trial had a 'no intervention' control group (<LINK REF="STD-Phrommintikul-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Phrommintikul 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>For half of the trials, the primary focus was on prevention of influenza infection (influenza/influenza-like illness or immunogenicity) and cardiovascular outcomes were reported among the safety analyses (<LINK REF="STD-De-Villiers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">De Villiers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langley-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2010</LINK>); for the other half, the focus was on secondary cardiovascular prevention (<LINK REF="STD-FLUCAD-2008" TYPE="STUDY">FLUCAD 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FLUVACS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">FLUVACS 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IVCAD-2009" TYPE="STUDY">IVCAD 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phrommintikul-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Phrommintikul 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cardiovascular outcomes reported in safety analyses included cardiovascular death, stroke and angina.</P>
<P>Three of the secondary prevention studies included cardiovascular death in their primary outcomes. Other outcomes were composite outcomes (major adverse coronary event (MACE - composite of cardiovascular death, acute MI, coronary revascularisation); coronary ischaemic event (MACE or hospitalisation for myocardial ischaemia); double or triple endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI or severe recurrent ischaemia; acute coronary syndrome (acute MI or unstable angina)), acute MI, stroke, heart failure and unstable angina or coronary revascularisation (percutaneous cardiac intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Protection against influenza</HEADING>
<P>If cardiovascular adverse events are associated with influenza infection, it is important to show that the vaccines were really effective in preventing infection. Four studies reported that influenza infections were significantly reduced by the vaccination (<LINK REF="STD-De-Villiers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">De Villiers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FLUCAD-2008" TYPE="STUDY">FLUCAD 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IVCAD-2009" TYPE="STUDY">IVCAD 2009</LINK>); three studies reported that the vaccines produced adequate seroprotection (<LINK REF="STD-IVCAD-2009" TYPE="STUDY">IVCAD 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langley-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Langley 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2010</LINK>); one study reported that no cases of influenza were seen over the initial six-month follow-up in the intervention or the comparison group (<LINK REF="STD-FLUVACS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">FLUVACS 2002</LINK>); and one study did not report on the effectiveness of the vaccination against influenza (<LINK REF="STD-Phrommintikul-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Phrommintikul 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cardiovascular death</HEADING>
<P>Cardiovascular death was reported by all secondary prevention studies and by three of the studies reporting mortality as part of their safety analyses. Overall analyses for cardiovascular death are shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.</P>
<P>In the secondary prevention studies, significantly fewer cardiovascular deaths occurred in the vaccine group than in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.76, P value 0.003) with no significant heterogeneity between studies. Cardiovascular death occurred in 2.3% of participants in the vaccine groups and in 5.1% of those in the control groups. Among individual studies, only <LINK REF="STD-FLUVACS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">FLUVACS 2002</LINK> reported a significantly lower cardiovascular death rate in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (6.2% vs 17.7%, P value 0.002) at one year; this was not maintained at two-year follow-up (P value 0.14). Among subgroups of participants with acute coronary syndromes/MI and those with stable angina/percutaneous cardiac interventions in the <LINK REF="STD-FLUCAD-2008" TYPE="STUDY">FLUCAD 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-FLUVACS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">FLUVACS 2002</LINK> studies, no significant difference in cardiovascular death was seen in either of the subgroups overall.</P>
<P>In studies reporting cardiovascular death as part of their safety analyses, no significant difference in cardiovascular death was observed between vaccine and placebo groups. Cardiovascular death occurred in 0.7% of participants in the vaccine groups and in 0.8% of participants in the placebo groups.</P>
<P>The outcome reported by <LINK REF="STD-De-Villiers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">De Villiers 2009</LINK> was death from all causes; the distribution of causes of death was not given for the comparison groups, but study authors stated that the most frequent causes of death were MI, cardiac failure and cerebrovascular disorders, and that these occurred in statistically similar proportions of vaccine and placebo recipients (all P values &#8805; 0.422; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>

<P>Studies targeting a reduction in cardiovascular events reported a range of cardiovascular outcomes.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-FLUCAD-2008" TYPE="STUDY">FLUCAD 2008</LINK> study, no significant differences in major adverse coronary events (MACE - cardiovascular death, MI or coronary revascularisation) over 12 months were reported in the vaccine group compared with the placebo group (3.00% vs 5.87%, P value 0.13; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). However, the rate of coronary ischaemic events (MACE or hospitalisation for myocardial ischaemia) over 12 months was significantly lower in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (6.02% vs 9.97%, P value 0.047; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). This applied to the participant population overall and to the subgroup with an acute coronary syndrome, but no significant difference in coronary ischaemic events was noted in the subgroup with stable angina. No significant difference was reported between groups in terms of individual cardiac events, namely, cardiovascular death, MI (ST segment elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST segment elevation MI (NSTEMI)), coronary revascularisation or hospitalisation for myocardial ischaemia (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>). This applied to the participant population overall and to both subgroups (those with an acute coronary syndrome and those with stable angina). Multi-variate analyses identified female sex (hazard ratio (HR) 2.15, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.15%, P value 0.024) and recent acute coronary syndrome (HR 2.93, 95% CI 1.52 to 5.65, P value 0.001) as predictors of coronary ischaemic events, and influenza vaccination was found to be protective (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.78, P value 0.009). No effects were seen for age, smoking, hypertension, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol or presence of diabetes mellitus.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-FLUVACS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">FLUVACS 2002</LINK> study (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>), the triple endpoint (acute MI, rehospitalisation for recurrent angina, death) was seen less frequently in the vaccine group than in the placebo group for the whole population (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.85, P value 0.009) and in the subgroup with acute MI (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.83, P value 0.008) but not for the PCI stenting subgroup at six months. No significant difference in MI was reported in either subgroup. Also no significant differences in cardiac revascularisation were noted in the PCI stenting group. Among participants with acute MI, significantly fewer were rehospitalised for ischaemia in the vaccine group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.0, P value 0.03), and significantly fewer participants had a double endpoint (of reinfarction, hospitalisation for ischaemia and death) (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.28, P value 0.03). These results were largely maintained at one-year follow-up. In the whole study group, 22% of participants had a triple endpoint in the vaccine group and 37% in the placebo group (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.86, P value 0.004). The difference was also significant in the subgroup with acute MI at one year (19% vs 42%, RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.71, P value 0.0003) but not in the PCI stenting group. Significant benefit of the vaccination for occurrence of the double endpoint was seen only in the MI subgroup (10% vs 28%, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.72, P value 0.002), not in the whole study population. No significant difference in MI or rehospitalisation for ischaemia was seen. Cox regression analyses were done for the combined triple endpoint at one year for the following subgroups: participants older or younger than 65 years, those with ST segment elevation or non-ST segment elevation MI, participants with elevation or no elevation of enzymes at entry, those with diabetes or no diabetes, participants with a history or no history of smoking, those with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk score below or above 6 and participants with a history or no history of revascularisation. Significantly greater benefit with influenza vaccination was seen among participants with non-ST segment elevation MI (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.52, P value 0.004), those older than 65 years (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.92, P value not given), non-smokers (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.57, P value not given) and those at high risk for future ischaemic episodes (TIMI risk score &gt; 6) (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.87, P value not given).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-IVCAD-2009" TYPE="STUDY">IVCAD 2009</LINK> study reported no significant differences between the vaccination group and the placebo group in individual cardiovascular outcomes over one year (CABG, PCI, MI, episodes of unstable angina, cardiovascular death; see <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). Significantly more participants with at least one cardiac adverse event (acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularisation, cardiovascular death) were reported in the placebo group than in the vaccine group at six months, but this finding was not maintained at one-year follow-up (29% in the intervention group vs 26% in the placebo group, P value 0.6; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).

The rate of hospitalisation for acute coronary syndrome was also significantly lower in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (4.5% vs 10.6%, unadjusted HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.91, P value 0.032). Effects for these two outcomes remained significant with adjustments for age, sex, serum creatinine, ACE inhibitor treatment and coronary revascularisation. No significant difference was reported for cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure or hospitalisation for stroke. No significant difference in effects for MACE was observed for the following subgroups: participants younger than 65 years or older than 65 years, male or female participants, those with or without diabetes mellitus, participants with ST segment elevation or non-ST segment elevation MI, those with serum creatinine levels less than 1.1 mg/dL or greater than 1.1. mg/dL and participants with or without revascularisation.</P>
<P>Limited information on non-fatal cardiovascular adverse events was reported by studies that included cardiovascular events in their safety analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1994</LINK> reported three cases of &#8216;intercurrent illness (undefined), cerebrovascular accident&#8217; - two in the placebo group (0.2%) and one in the vaccine group (0.1%) (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.41). <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2010</LINK> reported five cases of angina in the intervention groups (0.8%) and none in the placebo groups (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.1 to 32.85).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-15 10:16:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight trials of influenza vaccination compared with placebo or no vaccination, with 12,029 participants receiving at least one vaccination or control treatment. Four of these trials (n = 10,347) focused on prevention of influenza in general or elderly populations and reported cardiovascular outcomes among their safety analyses, and four trials (n = 1682) focused on prevention of cardiovascular events among participants with established coronary heart disease. Follow-up was between 42 days and one year. When reported (seven studies), vaccination provided adequate immunogenicity or protection against influenza. Cardiovascular mortality was reported by four secondary prevention trials and was significantly reduced by influenza vaccination (risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.76, P value 0.003) with no significant heterogeneity between studies. In three trials reporting cardiovascular mortality as part of their safety analyses, no differences were found between study groups, but numbers of events were too small to permit conclusions. Among studies of participants with coronary heart disease, composite outcomes of cardiovascular events also tended to be decreased with influenza vaccination compared with placebo. Generally no significant difference was observed between comparison groups regarding individual outcomes such as myocardial infarction.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-04-15 08:12:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As the main focus of the general population studies including cardiovascular events in their safety analyses was not cardiovascular prevention, these studies were most likely underpowered for assessing cardiovascular events. Often reporting of cardiovascular death and of details on non-fatal cardiovascular events was very limited. Studies of participants with coronary heart disease generally included small sample sizes (around 100 to 150 participants per comparison group in most), often without power analyses or with clear evidence that they were underpowered.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-04-15 08:13:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Moderate risk of bias was seen, with five RCTs showing deficits in at least three of the risk of bias criteria assessed. This included three studies of participants with coronary artery disease, and only one of these studies was rated as having low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-FLUCAD-2008" TYPE="STUDY">FLUCAD 2008</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-04-15 10:16:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to assess effects of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular events. Given that these events are rare, especially in primary prevention trials, future updates of the review may benefit from more detailed examination of observational data on the association between influenza vaccination and prevention of cardiovascular events.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-15 10:18:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified two other systematic reviews of the association between influenza vaccination and cardiovascular outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Loomba-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loomba 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Udell-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Udell 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Loomba-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loomba 2012</LINK> summarised three RCTs and two observational studies including a total of 292,383 participants. Included studies examined participants with cardiovascular disease and mixed populations with and without cardiovascular disease. Overall, their meta-analyses showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.64), MI (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.93) and major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.74). The review had some quality deficits, and results should be viewed with caution.</P>
<P>The systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Udell-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Udell 2013</LINK> was of higher quality. The review authors included RCTs (sample size of at least 50) of adults comparing experimental or commercially approved influenza vaccinations with placebo, no vaccination or another vaccination strategy. The same four trials of participants with coronary artery disease examining cardiovascular outcomes were included as in the present review (<LINK REF="STD-FLUCAD-2008" TYPE="STUDY">FLUCAD 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FLUVACS-2002" TYPE="STUDY">FLUVACS 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IVCAD-2009" TYPE="STUDY">IVCAD 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phrommintikul-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Phrommintikul 2011</LINK>), along with two of the studies including cardiovascular events in their safety analyses (<LINK REF="STD-De-Villiers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">De Villiers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Govaert-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Govaert 1994</LINK>), as well as safety analyses of six RCTs comparing different vaccine formulations. A meta-analysis of five RCTs (three of participants with coronary artery disease and two with cardiovascular events in their safety analyses) showed a significant reduction in composite cardiovascular events with influenza vaccination compared with control (2.9% vs 4.7%, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86, P value 0.003). When cardiovascular mortality was examined in the same five trials, no significant effect was seen overall (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.83, P value 0.61). The greatest effects of the vaccine were seen among participants at highest risk with more active coronary disease. These results are consistent with those of the present review.</P>
<P>Findings of this review are in line with international recommendations for practice. Patients with chronic heart disease are generally believed to be at high risk for influenza infection, and different guidelines highly recommend use of influenza vaccine in these groups.</P>
<P>The current influenza vaccination guideline in the UK recommends annual influenza vaccination for patients with chronic heart disease, including those with congenital heart disease, hypertension with cardiac complications or chronic heart failure, and for individuals requiring regular medication and/or follow-up for ischaemic heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-UK-Dept-of-Health-2014_x002f_15" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK Dept of Health 2014/15</LINK>). Both the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDPC) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend influenza vaccination for individuals with chronic cardiovascular diseases such as congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-Europe-2014_x002f_15" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC Europe 2014/15</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-USA-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC USA 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) categorises patients with cardiac diseases (atherosclerotic heart disease, cardiomyopathy/chronic congestive heart failure and congenital heart disease) in the high-risk group and recommends annual influenza vaccination in accordance with resources available in each country (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-04-15 10:19:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future studies of primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events by influenza vaccination must be adequately powered to measure these outcomes and must observe other established quality criteria. Studies should be carried out in populations with established cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity) to determine the effects of influenza vaccination in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease - not just among inpatients with established cardiovascular disease. In general population studies, subgroups of participants with cardiovascular risk factors and subgroups of elderly participants (e.g. 65 years or older) should be examined with respect to cardiovascular events.</P>
