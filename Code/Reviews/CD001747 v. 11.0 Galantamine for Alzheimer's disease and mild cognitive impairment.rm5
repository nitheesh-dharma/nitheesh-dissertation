<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative illness, affecting thinking and memory. Galantamine is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor that inhibits the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and may have other actions on nicotinic receptors as well. The review finds that galantamine was more effective than placebo in improving cognitive function. A greater proportion of people taking galantamine than of those taking placebo was rated as improved or not changed after three to six months. There was evidence of improvement on measures of activities of daily living and behavioral symptoms. Longer-term controlled studies have yet to be performed or published.</P>
<P>Data from the two MCI trials suggest marginal clinical benefit, but a yet unexplained excess in death rate. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Galantamine is a specific, competitive, and reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the clinical effects of galantamine in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), probable or possible Alzheimer's disease (AD), and potential moderators of effect.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, last updated on 25 April 2005 using the terms galanthamin*, galantamin* and Reminyl. Published reviews were inspected for further sources. Additional information was collected from unpublished clinical research reports for galantamine obtained from Janssen and from http://www.clinicalstudyresults.org/.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Trials selected were randomised, double-blind, parallel-group comparisons of galantamine with placebo for a treatment duration of greater than 4 weeks in subjects with MCI or AD.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted independently by the reviewers and pooled where appropriate and possible. Outcomes of interest include the clinical global impression of change (CIBIC-plus or CGIC), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive sub scale (ADAS-cog), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Disability Assessment for Dementia scale (DAD) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Potential moderating variables of treatment effect assessed included trial duration, dose, and diagnosis of possible versus probable Alzheimer's disease.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 13:19:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Ten trials with a total 6805 subjects were included in the analysis.<BR/>Treatment with galantamine led to a significantly greater proportion of subjects with improved or unchanged global rating scale rating (k = 8 studies), at all dosing levels except for 8 mg/d . Confidence intervals for the ORs overlapped across the dose range of 16 mg to 36 mg per day, with point estimates of 1.6 - 1.8 when analysed with the intention-to-treat sample.<BR/>Treatment with galantamine also led to significantly greater reduction in ADAS-cog score at all dosing levels (k = 8), with greater effect over six months compared to three months. Confidence intervals again overlapped. Point estimate of effect was lower for 8 mg/d but similar for 16 mg to 36 mg per day. For example, treatment effect for 24 mg/d over six months was 3.1 point reduction in ADAS-cog (95%CI 2.6-3.7, k = 4, ITT).<BR/>ADCS-ADL, DAD and NPI were reported only in a small proportion of trials: all showed significant treatment effect in some individual trials at least. Confidence interval of treatment effect for the one trial recruiting patients with possible AD overlapped with the other seven recruiting patients with probable AD. Galantamine's adverse effects appeared similar to those of other cholinesterase inhibitors and to be dose related.<BR/>Prolong release / once daily formulation of galantamine at 16 - 24mg/d was found to have similar efficacy and side-effect profile as the equivalent twice-daily regime.<BR/>Data from the two MCI trials suggest marginal clinical benefit, but a yet unexplained excess in death rate.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Subjects in these trials were similar to those seen in earlier anti dementia AD trials, consisting primarily of mildly to moderately impaired outpatients. Galantamine's effect on more severely impaired subjects has not yet been assessed.<BR/>Nevertheless, this review shows consistent positive effects for galantamine for trials of three to six months' duration. Although there was not a statistically significant dose-response effect, doses above 8 mg/d were, for the most part, consistently statistically significant. <BR/>Galantamine's safety profile in AD is similar to that of other cholinesterase inhibitors with respect to cholinergically mediated gastrointestinal symptoms. It appears that doses of 16 mg/d were best tolerated in the single trial where medication was titrated over a four week period, and because this dose showed statistically indistinguishable efficacy with higher doses, it is probably most preferable initially. Longer term use of galantamine has not been assessed in a controlled fashion.<BR/>Galantamine use in MCI is not recommended due to its association with an excess death rate.<BR/>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Galantamine (also called galanthamine, marketed as Reminyl by Janssen), an alkaloid extracted from Amaryllidaceae (Galanthus woronowi, the Caucasian snowdrop) and daffodil bulbs, but now synthesized, is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase with very little butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pacheco-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pacheco 1995</LINK>). It has received regulatory approval in at least 29 counties, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Czechia, the European Union (except for The Netherlands), Iceland, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United States.</P>
<P>Galantamine is 10 to 50-fold more selective for acetyl compared to butyryl cholinesterase (<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1990</LINK>). Competitive inhibitors compete with acetylcholine at the acetylcholinesterase binding sites, while non-competitive inhibitors bind to the sites independent of acetylcholine concentration. Because competitive acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are dependent on acetylcholine concentration, they may be less likely to bind to the enzymatic site in areas that have high acetylcholine levels. While in brain areas where acetylcholine is low, there may be a greater amount of binding to acetylcholinesterase. Theoretically, competitive inhibitors will have more effect in areas with low levels of acetylcholine and less effect in areas with higher acetylcholine. This may provide a selective effect in the brain areas affected in AD that have lower acetylcholine levels. In addition, galantamine is an allosteric modulator at nicotinic cholinergic receptor sites, enhancing the effect of acetylcholine at these receptors, and thus may enhance cholinergic transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeney-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeney 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maelicke-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maelicke 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Early open labeled uncontrolled studies have shown mild benefit for patients with Alzheimer's disease, but for the most part were not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Kewitz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kewitz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rainer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rainer 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilcock-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wilcock 1993</LINK>). Since then, a number of large scale double-blind randomised controlled trials have been carried out, providing data needed for this review.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the clinical effect of galantamine in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), probable or possible Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to investigate potential moderators of effect. Additional reasons to undertake this review are to test for significant consensus among trials that may have contradictory findings; to gather potential information about efficacy which can be revealed only by assessing systematic variations in study design, data characteristics, and methodology; and to assess the development of a particular research domain.</P>

</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>1. Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1984</LINK>). This 70 point scale encompasses a broad range of cognitive function typically affected by AD. Higher scores indicate worsening. Positive change scores indicate worsening. The European ADAS and French ADAS (EURO-ADAS and Greco-ADAS, respectively) were also included.<BR/>2. Global Rating/ Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus). These were typically assessed using the process of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC; <LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1997</LINK>). Scores range from 1 to 7, with 4 indicating no change, scores below 4 indicating improvement, and scores above 4 indicating worsening.<BR/>3. Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL; <LINK REF="REF-Galasko-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galasko 1997</LINK>). This ADL scale was specifically designed for Alzheimer's disease and the version used here was scored from 0 to 78; negative change scores normally indicate worsening, but were re coded to be consistent with MetaView.<BR/>4. Disability Assessment for Dementia scale (DAD; <LINK REF="REF-Gelinas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelinas 1999</LINK>). This 46-item scale assesses both basic and instrumental ADLs, leisure activities, initiation, planning and organization, and effective performance. It is administered to an informant and has a total score ranging from 0 to 100.<BR/>5. Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; <LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994</LINK>). This scale assesses the following ten items: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/liability, aberrant motor behavior. The total score ranges from 0 to 120; positive change scores indicate worsening.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>A single reviewer (JO) discarded irrelevant citations, based on the title of the publication and its abstract. Any suggestion that an article could possibly be relevant, caused it to be retrieved for further assessment. This was repeated by another reviewer (CL) for the 2004 and 2005 updates<BR/>
<BR/>A single reviewer independently selected the trials for initial inclusion in the review from the culled citation list. These trials were reviewed by a second reviewer (LS).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality Assessment<BR/>
</B>The reviewers assessed the methodological quality of each trial using the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Category A (adequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) some form of centralized randomised scheme, such as having to provide details of an enrolled participant to an office by phone to receive the treatment group allocation; (ii) some form of randomizations scheme controlled by a pharmacy; (iii) numbered or coded containers, such as in a pharmaceutical trial in which capsules from identical-looking numbered bottles are administrated sequentially to enrolled participants; (iv) an on-site or coded computer system, given that the allocations were in a locked, unreadable file that could be accessed only after inputting the characteristics of an enrolled participant; or (v) if assignment envelopes were used, the report should at least specify that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes; (vi) other combinations of described elements of the process that provides assurance of adequate concealment.</LI>
<LI>Category B (unclear) is where the report describes the study as 'randomised' but no further detail is available.</LI>
<LI>Category C (inadequate) is where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) alternation; (ii) reference to case record numbers, dates of birth, day of week, or any other such approach; (iii) any allocation procedure that is entirely transparent before assignment, such as an open list of random numbers or assignments. </LI>
<LI>Category D (not used) is where randomisation is not used.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias. Trials with unclear concealment measures have been shown to yield more pronounced estimates of treatment effects than trials that have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation schedules, but less pronounced than inadequately concealed trials (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Thus trials will be included if they conform to categories A or B, and those falling into category C were excluded.</P>
<P>Other aspects of trial quality were not assessed by a scoring system although details were noted of blinding, whether intention-to-treat analyses were extractable from the published data, and the number of patients lost to follow-up.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Data were independently extracted by JO, subsequently by the update reviewer (CL), and cross-checked by a second reviewer (LS). Any discrepancies were discussed.</P>
<P>Data were required to provide either: (a) means and standard deviations (or standard error) for pre- and post-tests, (b) means and standard deviations (or standard error) for change scores, (c) individual data for each patient in the trial. For categorical ratings, data were required to provide either: (a) the percentage of improvers for both drug and placebo groups, (b) frequencies of improvers for both drug and placebo groups, or (c) individual data for each patient in the trial. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Data analysis</B>
<BR/>For continuous or ordinal variables, the main outcome of interest is change in score from baseline (i.e. pre-randomisation or at randomisation) to the final assessment. If ordinal scale data appear to be approximately normally distributed or if the analysis that the investigators performed suggested parametric tests were appropriate, then the outcome measures were treated as continuous data.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes or ordinal data that could be treated dichotomously, such as global ratings under some instances, the endpoint itself is of interest and the Peto method of the 'typical odds ratio' was used.</P>
<P>A test for heterogeneity of treatment effect among trials was made using a standard chi-squared statistic or the I-squared statistic. If a test of heterogeneity is negative then a weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials, the 'typical odds ratio' (e.g., the odds of an unfavourable outcome among treatment-allocated patients to the corresponding odds among controls) is calculated using Peto's log-rank test adapted for ordinal data (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 1990</LINK>). If, however, there was evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results are pooled, or a random effects model used (in which case the confidence intervals would be broader than a fixed effects model). </P>
<P>Additional hypotheses tested were that galantamine has no differential effect when compared with placebo, based upon daily dose.</P>

<P>
<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>The number of participants randomised in the trials ranged from 95 to 1062 (k=11). Those trials reporting the number excluded after randomizations (k=10) reported 204 to 1019 completers, with a completion rate ranging from 68.9-80.4%.

<BR/>Global Rating scales</B>
<BR/>Out of the eight AD trials that provided sufficient outcome data for analysis, all provided global rating data using observed cases (OC) analyses and ITT. Rating scale data were dichotomized into those who had no change or improvement versus those who worsened. Analyses revealed statistically significant results in favour of treatment in OC and ITT analyses at both 3 months and 6 months. </P>
<UL>
<LI>For trials of 3 months' duration, by OC analysis, dosing at 18 mg/d and 24 mg/d failed to show a statistically significant effect. Dosing at 24-32 mg/d (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.3; 95%CI 1.3 - 3.9) and 36 mg/d (OR 3.4; 95%CI 1.2 - 9.5) were both statistically significant in favour of treatment. </LI>
<LI>For trials of 3 months' duration, by ITT analysis, dosing at 24 mg/d and 24-32 mg/d failed to show a statistically significant effect. Dosing at 18 mg/d (OR 2.4, 95%CI 1.2 -5.0) and 36 mg/d (OR 2.7; 95%CI 1.2 -6.2) were all statistically significant in favour of treatment. </LI>
<LI>For trials of 6 months duration (5-months to 29 weeks), by OC analysis, dosing at 8 mg/d, 16-24 mg (bid or prolonged release) and 32mg/d (tds dosing) failed to show a statistically significant effect. Dosing at 16 mg (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.6 - 3.3), 24 mg (OR 2.1; 95%CI 1.6 -2.6), 32 mg (bd dosing) (OR 1.9; 95%CI 1.4 - 2.7) were all statistically significant in favour of treatment. </LI>

<LI>For trials of 6 months' duration, statistically significant effects were found at all dosing levels by both OC and ITT analysis. As expected, OC analysis yielded slightly more favourable estimates. Weighted mean difference in ADAS-cog score by ITT for 8 mg/d was 1.3 (95%CI 0.03-2.6), 16 mg 3.1 (95%CI 2.1-4.1), 16-24 mg bid 2.8 (95%CI 1.8-3.8), 16-24 mg prolonged release 2.5 (95%CI 1.6-3.4), 24 mg 3.1 (95%CI 2.6-3.7), 32 mg bd dosing 3.3 (95%CI 2.4-4.1) and 32 mg tds dosing 2.9 (95%CI 1.8-4.0).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Proportion of patients with 4 or more point improvement in ADAS-cog was reported at 3 months in 1 trial and 6 months in 3. The single trial reporting at 3 months showed a statistically significant result by OC but not ITT. Trials reporting at 6 months (all with OC data only) did not find a statistically significant effect for 8 mg/d. Statistically significant effect was found for 16 mg/d (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.5-3.4), 24 mg (OR 2.4, 95%CI 1.8-3.2), and 32 mg (OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.9-4.0).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>ADCS-ADL Scores</B>
<BR/>Treatment effect on ADCS-ADL scale was reported in one trial only for the dosing levels of 8 mg/d, 16 mg/d, 16-24 mg/d and 24mg/d. As expected, OC analysis yielded slightly more favourable estimates. Significantly smaller decrease in the ADCS-ADL score by ITT was reported for 16mg/d (3.1points, 95%CI 1.6-4.6) and 24mg/d (2.3points, 95%CI 0.6-4.0). Data was only available in OC form for 16-24 mg/d, finding a significantly smaller decrease in ADCS-ADL in the prolonged release group (2.4 points, 95%CI 0.8-4.0) but not the bid group.<BR/>

<BR/>DAD Scores<BR/>
</B>Treatment effect on DAD was reported at 3 months in 1 trial and at 6 months in 2. Statistically significant treatment effects were found at 3 months for 24-32 mg/d by OC and ITT. Change from baseline by ITT was 4.8 points (95%CI 2.1-7.6). Statistically significant treatment effects were also found at 6 months by OC and ITT. Change from baseline by ITT for 24 mg/d was 3.7 (95%CI<B> </B>1.4-6.9), 32 mg/d 3.5 (95%CI 0.5-6.5).<BR/>

<BR/>NPI Scores</B>
<BR/>Treatment effect on NPI was reported at 3 months in 1 trial and at 6 months in 3. No statistically significant treatment effect was found at 3 months for 24-32 mg/d by OC and ITT. At six months, for 16 mg/d, treatment effect was statistically significant by OC and ITT, with a 2.1 point reduction by ITT (95%CI 0.2-4.0). For 16-24mg/d, no statistically significant treatment effect was found for the prolong release or bid group. For 24 mg/d, treatment effect was statistically significant by OC but not ITT.</P>
<P>
<B>Probable versus possible AD</B>
<BR/>One of the eight AD trials recruited patients with possible AD while the other seven recruited patients with probable AD. Treatment effects found in the former had overlapping confidence intervals with the rest of the trials.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Prolonged release/ once daily formulation vs. twice daily dosing</B>
<BR/>The 16-24mg/d prolonged release formation was found to have overlapping confidence intervals with the 16-24mg/d twice daily dosing (<LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_10-Brodaty" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-10 Brodaty</LINK>)- in terms of treatment effects, adverse effects and proportion of treatment withdrawal.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>MCI trials</B>
<BR/>Neither of the MCI trials (<LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_11-DeKosky" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-11 DeKosky</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_18-Winblad" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-18 Winblad</LINK>) found significant treatment effect in terms of ADAS-cog at twelve months or twenty-four months. One of the trials <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_11-DeKosky" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-11 DeKosky</LINK>) reached marginal significance in terms of dementia conversion rate to dementia (change of CDR score from 0.5 to &gt;=1.0) at twenty-four months. Combining data from both trials, 12-24 mg/d bid galantamine confers an OR of 0.74 (95%CI 0.58-0.94) in dementia conversion at twenty-four months.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>MRI brain atrophy rate</B>
<BR/>Dekosky et al. (<LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_11-DeKosky" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-11 DeKosky</LINK>) also used volumetric MRI brain imaging as an outcome measure. They found significantly lower whole brain but not hippocampal atrophy rate in MCI subjects treated with 12-24 mg/d galantamine (bid) compared to the placebo group. The clinical significance of this is unclear. </P>
<P>
<B>Other comments</B>
<BR/>The majority of ITT data reported in these trials were calculated using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method. As a rule, the ITT treatment group size reported in these analyses were also smaller than the randomisation group size. Thus these ITT estimates are less conservative than traditional ITT.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Safety</B>
<BR/>In general, galantamine appeared well tolerated. As expected, gastrointestinal side effects were significantly more common in the treatment groups and in a dose-related fashion. As an example, the OR for nausea ranged from 2.9 (95%CI 1.7-5.3) for 16mg/d to 4.6 (95%CI 3.0-7.0) for 32mg/d.</P>
<P>Comparison of adverse effects between trials was limited by different methods of reporting. Adverse events appearing at least 5% more often in the treatment groups were reported in four published trials (<LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_10-Brodaty" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-10 Brodaty</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_USA_x002d_10-Tariot" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-USA-10 Tariot</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_USA_x002d_1-Raskind" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-USA-1 Raskind</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_1-Wilcock" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-1 Wilcock</LINK>). The proportion of subjects with these adverse events was also analysed. The adverse events recorded include tremor; anorexia; vomiting; nausea; weight loss; headache; abdominal pain; diarrhea; dizziness; and agitation. For 8mg/d, none of the adverse events was statistically significantly more frequent than placebo. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were statistically significant at 16mg/d. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weight loss, anorexia, tremor and headache were statistically significant at 24mg/d. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weight loss, anorexia, abdominal pain, tremor and headache were statistically significant at 32mg/d. </P>
<P>The data for 3-month trials were similar to that of 6-month, with nausea, vomiting, headache, somnolence, and agitation being those of greatest magnitude.</P>
<P>Four trials reported more galantamine-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects discontinuing (<LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_USA_x002d_1-Raskind" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-USA-1 Raskind</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_1-Wilcock" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-1 Wilcock</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_95_x002d_05" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-95-05</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_93_x002d_01-Wilkinson" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-93-01 Wilkinson</LINK>). Overall, galantamine-treated subjects were more likely than placebo-treated subjects to discontinue for any reason from trials of 6 months in length at daily doses of 24 mg (OR 1.7; 95%CI 1.3-2.2), 32 mg-bd dosing (OR 2.6; 95%CI 1.9-3.5), and 32 mg-tds dosing (OR 2.4; 95%CI 1.6-3.5) . For 3-month trials, subjects were more likely to discontinue at doses of 24mg and higher.</P>
<P>Overall, galantamine-treated subjects were more likely to discontinue due to adverse events from trials of 6 months in length compared to placebo-treated subjects, for those subjects treated with daily doses of 16-24 mg (prolonged release: OR 1.9; 95%CI 1.0-3.6),24 mg (OR 2.1; 95%CI 1.5-2.9), 32 mg-bd dosing (OR 3.6; 95%CI 2.6 -5.2) and 32 mg-tds dosing (OR 2.8; 95%CI 1.8-4.3). Note that ORs for 8 mg/d and 16 mg/d doses were not significantly greater than placebo. For 3-month trials, subjects were more likely to discontinue at doses of 24mg and higher.</P>
<P>All but 3 (<LINK REF="STD-Kewitz-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Kewitz 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_93_x002d_01-Wilkinson" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-93-01 Wilkinson</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_1-Wilcock" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-1 Wilcock</LINK>) of the 9 AD trials reported proportion of subjects deceased during the trial period. None found excess death in the treatment groups compared to the placebo group. On the other hand, pooled data from the MCI trials found significantly higher death rate in the galantamine groups. Causes of death in the galantamine group was detailed in one of the clinical research reports (<LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_11-DeKosky" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-11 DeKosky</LINK>), which included: bronchial carcinoma/sudden death, cerebrovascular disorder/syncope, myocardial infarct and suicide. An interim study from the manufacturer (<LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_COG_x002d_3002-2005" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-COG-3002 2005</LINK>) reported a hazard ratio of 4.9 (95%CI 1.8-13.40) during the double blind phase, and an interim adjusted hazard ratio of 3.0 (95%CI 1.3-7.3) after taking into account of some of the retrieved dropout subjects. Further data collection from these two MCI trials and another open label MCI trial is in progress (<LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_COG_x002d_3002-2005" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-COG-3002 2005</LINK>).<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>A clear picture is forming regarding the use of galantamine in AD now that the database available for review consists of seven published peer-reviewed trials, one unpublished multicenter trial, and one meeting abstract. This review shows overall positive effects for galantamine for trials of 3 months, 5 months and 6 months duration. In addition, although there was not a statistically significant dose effect, doses above 8mg/d were, for the most part, consistently statistically significant. Thus, there is evidence demonstrating efficacy for galantamine on global ratings, cognitive tests, assessments of ADLs and behavior. The one trial recruiting patients with possible AD shows similar treatment effect to the other trials recruiting patients with probable AD. The prolong release / once daily formulation of galantamine was found to have similar efficacy and side-effect profile as the equivalent twice-daily regime. Magnitude of treatment effect also appears to be similar to other cholinesterase inhibitors including donepezil, rivastigmine, and tacrine. <BR/>
<BR/>A comparatively narrow range of cognitive impairment ratings were used as entry criteria to these trials, leading to inclusion of mostly mildly or moderately impaired patients. A post-hoc analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 2002</LINK>) pooling subgroup data among patients with a MMSE score of 10-12 from four of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_1-Wilcock" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-1 Wilcock</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_2-Rockwood" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-2 Rockwood</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_USA_x002d_1-Raskind" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-USA-1 Raskind</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_USA_x002d_10-Tariot" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-USA-10 Tariot</LINK>), found galantamine to have a statistically significant effect on cognitive, functional and behavioral measures. However a proper systematic review and analysis was not completed, and the resulting effect size and significance was not compared to the subgroup with MMSE scores above 12- so no conclusions can be drawn. Post-hoc analysis of data from <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_USA_x002d_10-Tariot" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-USA-10 Tariot</LINK> also found statistically significant drug efficacy among patients with previous exposure to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Mintzer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mintzer 2003</LINK>), but the same criticism applies.</P>
<P>Galantamine's adverse event profile is similar to other cholinesterase inhibitors with respect to cholinergically mediated gastrointestinal symptoms. No information is available on adverse events that occurred less than 5% more frequently in the treatment groups. There appears to be a dose response relationship for these adverse events with doses of 32mg/day associated with greater incidence of withdrawals. <LINK REF="REF-GAL_x002d_USA_x002d_5" TYPE="REFERENCE">GAL-USA-5</LINK> randomised 6-week galantamine withdrawal versus continuing galantamine or placebo. Adverse event rates were similar across the groups though sample size for this trial was small (N=118).<BR/>
<BR/>It appears that doses of 16 mg/d were best tolerated in the single trial where medication was titrated over 4 week periods, and because this dose showed statistically indistinguishable efficacy with higher doses, it is probably most preferable initially.</P>
<P>Longer term use of galantamine has not been assessed in a controlled fashion. Data have been collected only from participants in open-label extensions to these published clinical trials, and some of this data has been compared against placebo data from an Alzheimer's Disease trial for another drug, i.e., historical controls (<LINK REF="REF-Blesa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blesa 2003</LINK>). Comparisons to historical controls are bias-prone and a more valid study such as a randomised controlled trial is needed.<BR/>
<BR/>Economic assessments based on some of the trials included in this review, using Canadian (<LINK REF="REF-Getsios-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Getsios 2001</LINK>) and US (<LINK REF="REF-Migliaccio_x002d_Walle2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Migliaccio-Walle2003</LINK>) cost data have also been published. </P>
<P>Data from the two MCI trials suggests marginal clinical benefit, but a yet unexplained excess in death rate. Galantamine use in MCI is therefore not recommended.<BR/>
</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>
<BR/>The results of this review suggest that doses of 16 mg/d and above improve cognitive function and either improve or maintain global function for at least 6 months. These findings apply to subjects with mildly to moderately severe cognitive impairment. There is limited information on efficacy for improving activities of daily living or overall behavior. The duration of efficacy is unknown as is the length of time patients should be treated. Adverse event data is available for only 6 months as well.</P>
<P>Galantamine use in MCI is not recommended due to excess death rate in the treatment group.<BR/>
<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future trials are needed in more heterogeneous and typical clinical populations, involving people with more severely impaired cognitive functioning and with more mildly impaired cognitive functioning than the subjects included in these trials, and over durations longer than 6 months. Trials that contrast galantamine with other cholinesterase inhibitors or other medications such as memantine are desirable. Given that adverse events are dose related, an optimal dose is needed that provides sufficient improvement while minimizing adverse events. This dose may be 16 mg/d but further research is needed. It will be important to assess more accurately the effects of galantamine on ADLs, aspects of problematic behavior and caregiver burden, and the implications for health economics.</P>
