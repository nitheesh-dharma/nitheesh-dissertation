<I>Importance of the review</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Complete, or full-thickness rectal prolapse is when the lower part of the intestine (the rectum) becomes loose and telescopes out of the anus when straining. It should not be confused with haemorrhoids (or piles), which is when the veins around the anus swell up. Rectal prolapse is most common in older people, especially women, although its cause is unclear. Rectal prolapse can cause complications, such as pain, ulcers, bleeding and faecal incontinence (inability to control bowel movements). Surgery is a common treatment for repairing the prolapse.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>The main findings of the review </I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Whether surgery is performed through a cut in the abdomen or a cut through the anus (known as a perineal approach), it makes no difference with regard to reappearance of the prolapse or appearance of postoperative complications. When surgeons perform the operation through a small hole in the abdomen (laparoscopic or keyhole surgery) recovery may be faster than for open abdominal surgery. When constipation is one of the main symptoms, bowel resection (removing part of the bowel) during prolapse repair may help. There was no difference in the results when different types of repair were used during the perineal (anal) approach.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Adverse effects</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>There was no particular concern about different types of surgery described in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Limitations of the review</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Although 15 studies were included in this review, many of them had different comparisons and some had poor methods, limiting the usefulness of the findings. However, longer follow-up of patients in these studies, together with results from ongoing trials, may provide some information in the future.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-11-05 09:46:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register up to 3 February 2015; it contains trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) as well as trials identified through handsearches of journals and conference proceedings. We also searched EMBASE and EMBASE Classic (1947 to February 2015) and PubMed (January 1950 to December 2014), and we specifically handsearched the<I> British Journal of Surgery </I>(January 1995 to June 2014), <I>Diseases of the Colon and Rectum</I> (January 1995 to June 2014) and <I>Colorectal Diseases</I> (January 2000 to June 2014), as well as the proceedings of the Association of Coloproctology meetings (January 2000 to December 2014). Finally, we handsearched reference lists of all relevant articles to identify additional trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-11-05 07:48:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of surgery for managing full-thickness rectal prolapse in adults.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-11-05 07:48:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reviewers independently selected studies from the literature searches, assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials and extracted data. The four primary outcome measures were the number of patients with recurrent rectal prolapse, number of patients with residual mucosal prolapse, number of patients with faecal incontinence and number of patients with constipation.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-05 07:48:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 15 RCTs involving 1007 participants in this third review update. One trial compared abdominal with perineal approaches to surgery, three trials compared fixation methods, three trials looked at the effects of lateral ligament division, one trial compared techniques of rectosigmoidectomy, two trials compared laparoscopic with open surgery, and two trials compared resection with no resection rectopexy. One new trial compared rectopexy versus rectal mobilisation only (no rectopexy), performed with either open or laparoscopic surgery. One new trial compared different techniques used in perineal surgery, and another included three comparisons: abdominal versus perineal surgery, resection versus no resection rectopexy in abdominal surgery and different techniques used in perineal surgery.</P>
<P>The heterogeneity of the trial objectives, interventions and outcomes made analysis difficult. Many review objectives were covered by only one or two studies with small numbers of participants. Given these caveats, there is insufficient data to say which of the abdominal and perineal approaches are most effective. There were no detectable differences between the methods used for fixation during rectopexy. Division, rather than preservation, of the lateral ligaments was associated with less recurrent prolapse but more postoperative constipation. Laparoscopic rectopexy was associated with fewer postoperative complications and shorter hospital stay than open rectopexy. Bowel resection during rectopexy was associated with lower rates of constipation. Recurrence of full-thickness prolapse was greater for mobilisation of the rectum only compared with rectopexy. There were no differences in quality of life for patients who underwent the different kinds of prolapse surgery.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-11-05 07:48:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The lack of high quality evidence on different techniques, together with the small sample size of included trials and their methodological weaknesses, severely limit the usefulness of this review for guiding practice. It is impossible to identify or refute clinically important differences between the alternative surgical operations. Longer follow-up with current studies and larger rigorous trials are needed to improve the evidence base and to define the optimum surgical treatment for full-thickness rectal prolapse.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-11-22 20:30:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-11-05 07:48:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Complete (full-thickness) rectal prolapse, also known as procidentia, is the circumferential protrusion through the anus of all layers of the rectal wall. It should not be confused with haemorrhoids, which are enlarged cushions of vascular tissue found within the anal canal in the submucosal space. Full-thickness rectal prolapse is a distressing and demoralising condition and can result in serious but rare complications such as gangrene and perforation. Although it can occur in any age group, it is most common in older women. This review assesses some surgical techniques in current clinical practice for rectal prolapse in adults.</P>
<P>The underlying cause of rectal prolapse remains unclear, although there are some known risk factors, including an abnormally deep Pouch of Douglas (the cavity between the rectum and the posterior wall of the uterus); lax muscles in the pelvic floor and anal canal; weak internal and external anal sphincters, often with evidence of pudendal nerve neuropathy; and abnormal fixation of the rectum, with a mobile mesorectum and lax lateral ligaments (<LINK REF="REF-Madiba-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madiba 2005</LINK>). Other predisposing factors include neurological illnesses, connective tissue disorders, and high parity (<LINK REF="REF-Schoetz-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoetz 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karasick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karasick 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rectal prolapse may result in acute complications of the prolapse itself (pain, ulceration, bleeding, incarceration and gangrene) or chronic debilitating symptoms such as difficulty maintaining perianal hygiene (faecal incontinence, mucus discharge).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-11-22 20:30:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The only potentially curative treatment for full-thickness rectal prolapse is surgery. However, for people who are unfit for surgery, high fibre intake with stool softener may help if constipation is a predominant symptom (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2005</LINK>). A range of surgical interventions are available, which are similar in principle although technically different in a number of respects. Differences include the surgical approach to the prolapsed bowel (transabdominal, open versus laparoscopic, perineal), the method of fixation during the rectopexy (suture or mesh), and the performance of a bowel resection (removal of a portion of the intestine). The choice of synthetic material used to perform the rectopexy may also vary and can include nylon, Teflon, Marlex, Ivalon, Gore-Tex, Vicryl or Dexon. There is little information on the best option for failed primary surgical treatment, but repeat surgery can be successful (<LINK REF="REF-Fengler-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fengler 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pikarsky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pikarsky 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The primary surgical interventions are the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<B>Anal encirclement operation</B>. This procedure is generally reserved for debilitated or other individuals at high anaesthetic risk. Under local anaesthesia, and after reduction of the prolapse, a subcutaneous suture is encircled around the anal orifice. This is then tightened to prevent further prolapse. A variety of suture materials may be used, including silicone rubber impregnated with Dacron, knitted Dacron or polypropylene mesh.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Perineal resection</B>. There are two main methods of perineal resection.</LI>
<OL>
<LI>Perineal rectosigmoidectomy aims to resect (remove) the redundant bowel via the perineum and anchor the lower rectum to the sacrum through fibrosis in the hope of preventing future prolapse. It may be combined with a procedure to tighten the pelvic muscles (levatorplasty).</LI>
<LI>The Delorme's procedure is a modification of perineal rectosigmoidectomy in which there is no resection of the prolapsed bowel. Instead, the mucosa is stripped and the muscle layer plicated and placed as a buttress above the pelvic floor. It may be combined with levatorplasty.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>
<B>Transabdominal rectopexy</B>. The aim of this procedure is to anchor the rectum to the sacrum without resection. There are various modifications to the procedure, including the following.</LI>
<OL>
<LI>Use of different fixation materials (mesh made from different materials such as nylon, Teflon, Marlex, Ivalon, Gore-Tex, Vicryl or Dexon, or simple sutures using materials such as prolene).</LI>
<LI>Placement of the mesh (anterior or ventral, posterior, completely or partially encircling the rectum).</LI>
<LI>Full rectal mobilisation with division or preservation of lateral ligaments prior to fixation.</LI>
<LI>Open or laparoscopic access.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>
<B>Transabdominal resection</B>
<I>. </I>This is similar to perineal resection except that it is performed through the abdomen. However, the extent of the bowel resection (removal) may be more extensive and varied (sigmoid colon, rectosigmoid or subtotal colon). This procedure may be combined with rectopexy (attachment of the rectum to the sacrum), but the redundant colon is resected (removed) first.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Transabdominal mobilisation of rectum</B>
<I>. </I>This is similar to transabdominal rectopexy, except the rectum is not fixed by suture or mesh, relying on the formation of adhesions between the mobilised rectum and the sacrum without artificial fixation.</LI>
</OL>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-11-05 09:55:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Selection of the surgical technique for rectal prolapse is difficult, and results appear to vary depending on the technique used (<LINK REF="REF-Eu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eu 1997</LINK>). However, studies suggest prolapse recurrence might not relate to the technical complexity of the surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raftopoulos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raftopoulos 2005</LINK>). The purpose of this review is to investigate the effectiveness of surgical techniques in current clinical practice for the repair of full-thickness rectal prolapse in adults. This condition may co-occur with other pelvic organ prolapse; however, it is beyond the scope of this study to provide a comprehensive review of other conditions. Operative procedures designed to repair specific anal sphincter or pelvic floor defects have been covered in a separate Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2013</LINK>), as has the surgical management of rectocoele (<LINK REF="REF-Maher-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2013</LINK>). Likewise, we did not include rectal intussusception (internal or occult rectal prolapse) in our review, as it is often associated with other pelvic floor abnormalities, including rectocoele and enterocoele.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-05 12:17:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have identified three new eligible studies since the last review, including two multicentre trials (<LINK REF="STD-Karas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Karas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senapati-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Senapati 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Youssef-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Youssef 2013</LINK>). This update included 15 randomised controlled trials with 1007 participants.</P>
<P>There is a tendency to carry out an abdominal procedure in young, fit people because of the perceived reduced recurrence rate compared with perineal procedures, which are reserved for more frail or unfit people. The logic is that these interventions are less invasive and therefore carry less risk of morbidity than abdominal approaches. There were only two trials that compared an abdominal with a perineal approach, but there were insufficient data to confidently comment on the difference in complications (<LINK REF="STD-Deen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Deen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senapati-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Senapati 2013</LINK>). We did not see any obvious difference in recurrence between abdominal or perineal approaches. The participants are still being followed up in <LINK REF="STD-Senapati-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Senapati 2013</LINK>, and it will be interesting to see the long-term results.</P>
<P>Rectopexy has stood the test of time, and in experienced hands it provides good long-term results (<LINK REF="REF-Byrne-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byrne 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foppa-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foppa 2014</LINK>). Five trials examined different materials used to fix the mobilised rectum, but it appears that essentially there were no differences in primary outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Speakman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Speakman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selvaggi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Selvaggi 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winde-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Winde 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Novell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Novell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galili-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Galili 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>During rectal mobilisation in rectopexy, the lateral ligaments may be preserved or divided, and evidence from non-randomised studies suggests division may result in denervation of the rectum due to damage to the parasympathetic component of the inferior hypogastric plexus (<LINK REF="REF-Varma-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varma 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El-Muhtaseb-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Muhtaseb 2014</LINK>). On the other hand, preservation may result in increased recurrence, presumably due to incomplete mobilisation of the rectum. The evidence is limited due to small numbers, but there appears to be more constipation among those with division of the lateral ligaments.</P>
<P>If constipation is one of the main symptoms, sigmoid resection during abdominal rectopexy in conjunction with prolapse repair may be advisable (<LINK REF="REF-Madoff-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madoff 1992</LINK>). Three trials in this review examined abdominal rectopexy with and without sigmoid resection, and their combined results suggest that resection does avoid constipation (<LINK REF="STD-Lukkonen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lukkonen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKee-1992" TYPE="STUDY">McKee 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senapati-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Senapati 2013</LINK>). There were more complications in the resection group, but the difference was not significant.</P>
<P>Two non-randomised studies suggest fixation is not necessary, and rectal mobilisation alone results in recurrence rates similar to fixation (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raftopoulos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raftopoulos 2005</LINK>). If this were true, then the potential complications associated with fixation, such as presacral bleeding or infection associated with foreign bodies used, may be obviated. However, these observations did not come from Level 1 evidence, and a subsequent multicentre trial involving 252 patients compared rectopexy versus no rectopexy (<LINK REF="STD-Karas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Karas 2011</LINK>). Although comparatively large, this trial has some limitations, such as the use of non-standardised surgical techniques (whether open or laparoscopic approach, extent of rectal mobilisation, methods of rectopexy, the addition of sigmoid resection) and the unusually high proportion of males. With these caveats in mind, the results do suggest that recurrence is more likely if the rectum is simply mobilised but not fixed.</P>
<P>Minimally invasive surgery has been gaining popularity. Two trials examined the role of laparoscopy in an abdominal approach. The trial data suggest equivalent low recurrence rates with less morbidity and a more rapid recovery for the laparoscopic group. Although equipment costs are higher, the authors of both studies suggest more rapid hospital discharge results in a cost saving compared with open surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Boccasanta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boccasanta 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are two commonly performed perineal approaches: the Delorme&#8217;s procedure is widely practised in the UK, while the Altemeier&#8217;s procedure is popular in North America. Either procedure can be combined with levatorplasty. The data is limited to two studies, and the evidence favouring one procedure or the other is either conflicting or not statistically significant. This suggests that the evidence is too limited to determine whether one perineal approach is better than another.</P>
<P>Will more information be available in the future to guide our practice in management of full-thickness rectal prolapse? Results from five ongoing trials will hopefully add to our current understanding and help us to improve the management of rectal prolapse. A multicentre study currently recruiting participants in Germany and Switzerland will compare the Delorme's procedure versus laparoscopic resection rectopexy (<LINK REF="STD-DeloRes-2012" TYPE="STUDY">DeloRes 2012</LINK>). A single centre study in Denmark is assessing the difference between laparoscopic posterior rectopexy without mesh and laparoscopic anterior mesh rectopexy (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00946205" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00946205</LINK>). Another trial is examining robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic ventral rectopexy in full-thickness rectal prolapse and intussusception (<LINK REF="STD-Makela_x002d_Kaikkonen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Makela-Kaikkonen 2013</LINK>); this trial has finished recruiting and is awaiting results. One Australian trial compared laparoscopic resection rectopexy with fixation rectopexy (<LINK REF="STD-ACTRN12605000748617" TYPE="STUDY">ACTRN12605000748617</LINK>), and another single centre study compared standard mesh rectopexy with ventral rectopexy (<LINK REF="STD-Tarquini-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tarquini 2010</LINK>). Furthermore, outcomes from longer follow-up of the trials included in the present review may also provide more information on prolapse recurrence and bowel function.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-11-05 12:19:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several major weaknesses of this review. The first relates to the plethora of interventions that have been analysed. There is very little consensus about the best treatment for rectal prolapse, apart from the agreement that surgery is the only potential mechanism for cure. Thus, when it comes to surgical intervention, the options are numerous. Should the approach be perineal or abdominal, open or laparoscopic? Should the rectum be mobilised anteriorly/posteriorly/laterally? Should redundant colon be routinely resected in combination with rectal fixation, and how should the rectum be fixed?</P>
<P>For each of these interventions, there are, in turn, numerous outcomes. Although many would agree that the most important universal outcome is recurrence of rectal or mucosal prolapse, some interventions are utilised because they have distinct advantages over other techniques. For instance, constipation can be considered the primary outcome when comparing resection rectopexy with mesh rectopexy, and adverse effects and cost may become primary outcomes when comparing laparoscopic abdominal surgery with open surgery, assuming efficacy is comparable. The different interventions, with the variable reporting of outcomes (including different follow-up periods for each trial) weaken the power of the meta-analyses, as often results from only two trials can be combined because of the specificity and heterogeneity of the individual comparisons.</P>
<P>During data synthesis and analysis, we calculated the standard deviation from the range, but this only provides estimated values.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-11-05 07:48:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Another significant drawback of this review is the methodological weakness of many of the included trials, which compromises the value of their results. For instance, eight trials did not mention methods of randomisation and only five trials documented the allocation concealment methods. Other potential sources of bias are likely due to lack of blinding in most trials, poor withdrawal and exclusion criteria data, and inadequate follow-up, which has to be long-term in order to exclude recurrence. Only five trials had follow-up more than three years and none more than five years. Having said that, the most recent trials (<LINK REF="STD-Karas-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Karas 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senapati-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Senapati 2013</LINK>) have larger numbers of participants and improved design.</P>

<P>Little has changed from the conclusion of the original review, despite three more trials meeting the criteria for inclusion. There is still inadequate evidence from this review due to small sample sizes of available trials and their methodological weakness for guiding practice. However, our results suggest that:</P>

<P>There is a need for trials with adequate power and long-term follow-up to evaluate the reliability of each existing prolapse repair technique. The most important question that needs to be answered is whether to carry out an abdominal or perineal approach. If perineal, should physicians opt for a perineal rectosigmoidectomy or a Delorme's procedure? If abdominal, should the intervention be laparoscopic or open? With lateral ligament division or preservation? How should the rectum be fixed and should a redundant bowel be resected?</P>
<P>In Europe, there is a current trend for recommending a laparoscopic ventral rectopexy for the treatment of external rectal prolapse, and two ongoing trials are examining this procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Tarquini-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tarquini 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makela_x002d_Kaikkonen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Makela-Kaikkonen 2013</LINK>). The technique is becoming very popular because of a perceived low recurrence rate in the short to medium term (<LINK REF="REF-Samaranayake-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samaranayake 2010</LINK>). Advocates therefore claim the procedure does not induce constipation. There is a need for well-designed and adequately powered trials comparing this new technique with other prolapse repair techniques. However, <LINK REF="STD-Senapati-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Senapati 2013</LINK> offers lessons for future studies; it took years to recruit and never achieved the target number of participants. <LINK REF="STD-NCT00946205" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00946205</LINK>aims to comparelaparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy with laparoscopic posterior rectopexy without mesh. Another potential comparator is the Delorme's procedure.</P>
<P>Participants in the included studies had full-thickness prolapse recurrence rates ranging from 0% to 33%. However, the follow-up periods from these studies ranged from six months to five years. Future trials should aim to have adequate follow-up and publish short- and long-term results to ensure proper comparisons between studies.</P>
<P>Quality of life assessments attracted little attention in the included trials, with one notable exception (<LINK REF="STD-Senapati-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Senapati 2013</LINK>). Any future trials must also incorporate formal assessment of quality of life issues, using validated tools that allow some assessment of cost, particularly if making comparisons with newer technologies such as laparoscopic surgery.</P>

<P>A pragmatic, factorial (2 x 2) design trial; participants could be randomised to abdominal or perineal surgery. For abdominal surgery, participants could be randomised between suture rectopexy and resection rectopexy. The abdominal procedure was performed through an open or laparoscopic approach, depending on surgeon's preference. For perineal surgery, participants could be randomised to a Delorme's or an Altemeier's procedure. It was the surgeon's choice to participate in either one or both of the randomisations. A video was provided to assist training in all the operations. The original protocol was powered to recruit 950 participants to detect a 5% difference in recurrence between abdominal and perineal approaches. Due to slow uptake of participants, the target was revised to detect a difference in quality of life or level of incontinence (Vaizey score) by recruiting 300 participants.</P>
