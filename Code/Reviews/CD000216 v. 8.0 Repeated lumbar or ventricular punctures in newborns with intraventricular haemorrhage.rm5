<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane researchers reviewed the evidence about the effect of removal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via lumbar or ventricular puncture and draining CSF via a needle inserted into the base of the spine or into a fluid-filled cavity in the brain on improving rates of disability, death, and the need for a permanent surgical procedure in preterm infants who have had bleeding inside the cavities of the brain (intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Babies that are born preterm are at risk of developing IVH. IVH can cause an excess of CSF to build up on the brain. The risk of this happening might be reduced by the removal of blood in the CSF via lumbar or ventricular taps. This might reduce the need for a permanent surgical procedure called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS). VPS is problematic as it can easily become infected and often has to be replaced or repaired, which requires an operation.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for trials up to 24 March 2016 that compared removing CSF via lumbar or ventricular taps in all babies at risk of developing a build-up of fluid on the brain against a conservative approach where this was only done if there was evidence that the build-up of fluid was causing an excess of pressure in the brain. We included four trials that included a total of 280 preterm infants treated in neonatal intensive care units in the UK. The trials were published between 1980 and 1990.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found no evidence that removal of CSF by lumbar or ventricular taps reduces the need for a permanent shunt to be inserted. There was also no evidence that it reduced the risk of major disability, multiple disability, or death. There was insufficient evidence to determine if this approach can lead to an increased risk of developing an infection in the CSF.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We assessed the outcomes of major disability, multiple disability, and disability or death as high quality evidence.</P>
<P>We recorded the quality of the evidence for the outcomes of shunt insertion, and death or shunt insertion as low quality evidence, as there was an issue with the random allocation method in one included trial that reported on this outcome.</P>
<P>For the outcomes of death and infection of CSF presurgery, the quality of the evidence was moderate due to the previously mentioned problem with allocation. In addition these studies did not have enough patients to sufficiently answer the question. In the case of the outcome infection of CSF presurgery, the results were inconsistent between the included trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-03-12 17:14:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although in recent years the percentage of preterm infants who suffer intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) has reduced, posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) remains a serious problem with a high rate of cerebral palsy and no evidence-based treatment. Survivors often have to undergo ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) surgery, which makes the child permanently dependent on a valve and catheter system. This carries a significant risk of infection and the need for surgical revision of the shunt. Repeated removal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by either lumbar puncture, ventricular puncture, or from a ventricular reservoir in preterm babies with IVH has been suggested as a treatment to reduce the risk of PHH development.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-03-11 19:15:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effect of repeated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removal (by lumbar/ventricular puncture or removal from a ventricular reservoir) compared to conservative management, where removal is limited to when there are signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP), on reduction in the risk of permanent shunt dependence, neurodevelopmental disability, and death in neonates with or at risk of developing posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-03-12 11:16:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 24 March 2016), Embase (1980 to 24 March 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 24 March 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-03-11 19:15:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RCTs and quasi-RCTs that compared serial removal of CSF (via lumbar puncture, ventricular puncture, or from a ventricular reservoir) with conservative management (removing CSF only when there were symptoms of raised ICP). Trials also had to report on at least one of the specified outcomes of death, disability, or shunt insertion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-03-12 17:14:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted details of the participant selection, participant allocation and the interventions. We assessed the following outcomes: VPS, death, death or shunt, disability, multiple disability, death or disability, and CSF infection. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-13 09:54:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials (five articles) met the inclusion criteria of this review; three were RCTs and one was a quasi-RCT; and included a total of 280 participants treated in neonatal intensive care units in the UK. The trials were published between 1980 and 1990. The studies were sufficiently similar regarding the research question they asked and the interventions that we could combine the trials to assess the effect of the intervention.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis showed that the intervention produced no significant difference when compared to conservative management for the outcomes of: placement of hydrocephalus shunt (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.26; 3 trials, 233 infants; I² statistic = 0%; moderate quality evidence), death (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.44; 4 trials, 280 infants; I² statistic = 0%; low quality evidence), major disability in survivors (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.18; 2 trials, 141 infants; I² statistic = 11%; high quality evidence), multiple disability in survivors (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 2 trials, 141 infants; I² statistic = 0%; high quality evidence), death or disability (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 2 trials, 180 infants; I² statistic = 0%; high quality evidence), death or shunt (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11; 3 trials, 233 infants; I² statistic = 0%; moderate quality evidence), and infection of CSF presurgery (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.67; 2 trials, 195 infants; low quality evidence).</P>
<P>We assessed the quality of the evidence as high for the outcomes of major disability, multiple disability, and disability or death. We rated the evidence for the outcomes of shunt insertion, and death or shunt insertion as of moderate quality as one included trial used an alternation method of randomisation. For the outcomes of death and infection of CSF presurgery, the quality of the evidence was low as one trial used an alternation method, the number of participants was too low to assess the objectives with sufficient precision, and there was inconsistency regarding the findings in the included trials regarding the outcome of infection of CSF presurgery.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-12 18:14:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was no evidence that repeated removal of CSF via lumbar puncture, ventricular puncture or from a ventricular reservoir produces any benefit over conservative management in neonates with or at risk for developing PHH in terms of reduction of disability, death, or need for placement of a permanent shunt.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-04-05 08:32:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-03-13 10:10:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although many interventions can reduce the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), it is still a common consequence of preterm birth. Posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is the most serious complication of IVH.</P>
<P>PHH is thought to result from the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin and laminin, in the channels necessary for circulation and reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (<LINK REF="REF-Cherian-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherian 2004</LINK>). Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) surgery is the conventional approach for treatment of established hydrocephalus. However, treatment of PHH is more difficult than other types of hydrocephalus because the large amount of blood in the ventricles, combined with the small size and instability of the patient, make an early VPS operation a very high risk procedure. In one series of 19 infants with PHH requiring shunt surgery, there were 29 shunt blockages and 12 infections (<LINK REF="REF-Hislop-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hislop 1988</LINK>). The risk of shunt blockage was increased if the CSF protein was over 1.5 g/L at shunt insertion. In a series of 36 infants shunt-operated for PHH, shunt blockage and infection occurred only in those operated on before 35 days of age (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2001</LINK>). Repeated shunt revisions and infection are associated with worsening of neurological outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Tuli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuli 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, these infants are nearly always shunt-dependent for the rest of their lives and will require several later operations even if no other problems occur. Thus it would be advantageous if a treatment could reduce the risk of permanent hydrocephalus after established IVH.</P>
<P>Neurodevelopmental outcome is poor in infants with PHH. Although this is due in part to parenchymal brain lesions present before PHH developed, it is likely that some of the dysfunction is the result of prolonged periods with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) with periventricular oedema and distortion of the developing axonal pathways and their myelination. It is also likely that some of the dysfunction is the result of injury from free radicals and inflammation as free iron, a source of free radicals, has been demonstrated in the CSF of infants with PHH (<LINK REF="REF-Savman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savman 2001</LINK>), as have pro-inflammatory cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00e4_vman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sävman 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A treatment for PHH remains elusive. A Cochrane Review that assessed drug treatment for reduction of CSF production (acetazolamide and furosemide) found no evidence of benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 2001b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Drainage, Irrigation and Fibrinolytic therapy (DRIFT) trial was stopped before completion due to an increase in secondary intraventricular bleeding in participants. However, DRIFT reduced severe cognitive disability, severe disability, and overall death in survivors (<LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 2010</LINK>). A 10-year follow-up study is currently in place.</P>
<P>There is now a separate Cochrane Review on intraventricular streptokinase after IVH (<LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 2007</LINK>). The available evidence suggests that fibrinolytic intervention relatively late (two to four weeks after the IVH) is ineffective.</P>
<P>Further randomised control trials (RCTs) are needed to evaluate the timing of external ventricular drainage, as a retrospective review has suggested that early (less than 25 days) placement is associated with improved cognition (<LINK REF="REF-Bassan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassan 2012</LINK>). Endoscopic choroid plexus cauterisation and ventriculosubgaleal shunt insertion also require investigation as potential treatments.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-03-13 10:11:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lumbar punctures (also known as a spinal tap) remove CSF via insertion of a needle into the lower back to drain CSF from the lumbar cistern. In a ventricular puncture the CSF is externally drained directly from the lateral ventricles via a needle. If a ventricular reservoir has been placed (this consists of a catheter leading to the lateral ventricle attached to a reservoir implanted under the scalp), CSF can also be tapped directly from the reservoir without the need for a direct ventricular puncture.</P>
<P>A ventricular or lumbar puncture is indicated in the context of PHH if there is evidence of significant raised ICP. Evidence may include: direct measurement of a CSF pressure over 12 mmHg, decreasing diastolic velocities on cerebral artery Doppler waveforms, deteriorating sensory evoked potentials, and clinical signs of raised ICP. Recently amplitude integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) has been identified as another method that may indicate that increasing pressure is affecting the functioning of the brain. The aEEG trace is described as becoming more discontinuous, followed by a return to a normal pattern after drainage (<LINK REF="REF-Olischar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olischar 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klebermass_x002d_Schrehof-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klebermass-Schrehof 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this Cochrane Review we assessed the use of serial lumbar ventricular punctures in infants with, or at risk of, developing PHH but without any signs of raised ICP. We compared this to conservative management, wherein the use of lumbar or ventricular punctures was restricted to where there are signs of raised ICP only.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-03-11 19:16:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been postulated that removal of bloody CSF by serial lumbar or ventricular punctures might improve the prognosis of infants at risk of, or actually developing, PHH. The physical removal of CSF that contains blood and protein might reduce the inflammatory reaction, decrease deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, and re-establish normal CSF drainage. The infants might benefit in terms of better neurological function because of reduced ICP and less periventricular oedema. Removal of blood and protein might also reduce the need for a permanent shunt.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-04-05 08:32:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a clear need to reduce mortality and the burden of disability that arises from this condition. Several trials have attempted to answer the question of whether this approach could produce a clear benefit. A systematic review is required to assess the evidence.</P>
<P>This is an update of the original Cochrane Review, <LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 2001a</LINK>, in which randomised trials failed to show any benefit of routine removal of CSF via lumbar or ventricular puncture. However, since then a retrospective review of infants with PHH in the Netherlands indicated that infants who received a lumbar puncture or subcutaneous ventricular reservoir &#8220;early&#8221; (defined as infants who at the decision to remove CSF via lumbar or ventricular puncture had a ventricular width above the 97<SUP>th</SUP> centile but below the 97<SUP>th </SUP>centile + 4 mm or 2 standard deviations of the mean (<LINK REF="REF-Levene-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levene 1981</LINK>)) were less likely to receive a shunt when compared to the &#8220;late&#8221; group (odds ratio 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.62) (<LINK REF="REF-de-Vries-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Vries 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>This has led to some questioning whether a benefit could be found if CSF removal for infants where there was rapidly increasing ventricular size was completed at an earlier time than is currently used. Subsequently, a RCT that prospectively compares low threshold versus high threshold intervention has started (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN43171322" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN43171322</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the renewed interest in this topic, it was necessary to revise the review and confirm that the assessment of the literature was current and the conclusions still valid.</P>

<P>The previous version of this review, <LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 2001a</LINK>, included four trials (reported in five articles). For this Cochrane Review update, we updated the literature searches without date limit as the search terms were expanded. The searched yielded 771 results, but we did not identify any new studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria of the review (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Therefore this Cochrane Review included four trials including 280 preterm infants treated in neonatal intensive care units in the UK. The trials were published between 1980 and 1990.</P>

<P>See the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table.</P>
<P>An important issue is the heterogeneity of the populations or intervention, or both, in the included trials. Two trials, <LINK REF="STD-Mantovani-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mantovani 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Anwar-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Anwar 1985</LINK>, enrolled infants with IVH and examined the effect of repeated lumbar puncture in preventing the development of permanent hydrocephalus (as defined by ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement). Two trials enrolled neonates with IVH who then went on to show progressive ventricular dilatation (<LINK REF="STD-Dykes-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dykes 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ventriculomegaly-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ventriculomegaly 1990</LINK>). They examined the effect of lumbar punctures (<LINK REF="STD-Dykes-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dykes 1989</LINK>), or lumbar punctures or ventricular punctures (<LINK REF="STD-Ventriculomegaly-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ventriculomegaly 1990</LINK>). The first approach is non-selective and allows earlier intervention (which might, in theory, offer a better chance of success). The second approach is selective but still means that some babies are treated who would have resolved without shunting anyway. The second approach usually means later treatment because one has to wait and see which IVH infants will show progressive dilatation. A further point is that <LINK REF="STD-Ventriculomegaly-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ventriculomegaly 1990</LINK> used ventricular as well as lumbar puncture to achieve CSF drainage, whereas the other three included trials used only lumbar puncture. Larger volumes of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be taken each time by ventricular puncture than by lumbar puncture but the potential for trauma and infection in the brain is probably greater by the ventricular route. All four included trials tackled the same question: does repeated removal of CSF reduce the risk of hydrocephalus? All four trials attempted in their interventions to drain as much CSF as was practical. For these reasons, we have examined them.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Dykes-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dykes 1989</LINK>, paediatric neurologists and a psychologist assessed developmental outcome at different ages. The study authors did not state whether or not these people were blinded to early treatment allocation. The study classified the children into 'major handicap' and "no major handicap". The study then subdivided those who had major handicap into those with a) 'single system disability'; and b) those with 'multiple handicaps'. We extracted the number of children a) without major disability; b) with a single disability; and c) with multiple disability.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Ventriculomegaly-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ventriculomegaly 1990</LINK>, one developmental paediatrician who was blinded to early treatment allocation examined virtually all the included children. Children were examined at 12-months post-term and at 30-months post-term. We extracted the number of children with single-system disability and those with multiple impairments.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Impairments, disabilities, and handicaps</HEADING>
<P>The term 'handicap' may, in retrospect, have been used in rather an imprecise way and we have avoided it in the analyses. We took disability to mean a disturbance of function severe enough to prevent the child functioning at an age appropriate level. Single-system disability meant that the findings were confined to one system of the nervous system, for example, a) hemiplegia without mental retardation; or b) sensorineural hearing loss.</P>
<P>We interpreted the terms 'multiple handicap', 'multiple disability', or 'multiple impairments' to mean clinically significant disturbances of function in different domains of the nervous system, for example, the combination of mental retardation, spastic diplegia, cortical blindness, and epilepsy. When we calculated the figures for death or disability, we subtracted the number of infants randomised but lost to follow-up from the totals originally entered. Death or disability were mutually exclusive and thus we could aggregate them.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Update</HEADING>
<P>For this review update we noted that <LINK REF="STD-Anwar-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Anwar 1985</LINK> reported the outcome as VPS or placement of ventricular reservoir. As the placement of a reservoir is a much milder outcome than a shunt we were unable to include this data for two outcomes: outcome 1.1 acquiring permanent shunt, or outcome 1.6 death or shunt. We contacted the study authors for the original data in order to obtain information on the number of infants who had only a shunt placement. However, we were unable to obtain this data.</P>
<P>We also combined the outcomes of death and shunt as a new outcome: outcome 1.6 death or shunt. Two trials, <LINK REF="STD-Ventriculomegaly-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ventriculomegaly 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Anwar-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Anwar 1985</LINK>, did not report on the breakdown of data to make this analysis in the paper, i.e. they did not provide the number of VPS placements that also died. For <LINK REF="STD-Ventriculomegaly-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ventriculomegaly 1990</LINK> we were able to access the original data to make the new analysis. For <LINK REF="STD-Anwar-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Anwar 1985</LINK> we contacted the original authors but were unable to obtain the original data. As such, we excluded <LINK REF="STD-Anwar-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Anwar 1985</LINK> from the analysis of outcome 1.6.</P>
<P>Finally, we added a new outcome: outcome 1.7 presence of CSF infection before surgery. CSF infection (meningitis/ventriculitis) is a serious adverse outcome and repeated lumbar or ventricular punctures in preterm infants carries a theoretical risk of introducing infection. Two trials, <LINK REF="STD-Dykes-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dykes 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ventriculomegaly-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ventriculomegaly 1990</LINK>, reported incidence of CSF infection prior to surgery and we assessed this as a secondary outcome.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-13 10:49:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although it was a reasonable hypothesis that removal of protein and blood by repeated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removal would improve outcome in infants with intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) but without signs of symptoms of raised intracranial pressure (ICP), meta-analysis of four included trials did not demonstrate any evidence of benefit in any of the outcome measures assessed (see 'Summary of findings' table 1: <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the outcomes of death (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) and infection of CSF presurgery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>), the confidence interval (CI) for risk ratio was particularly wide: 0.88 (0.53 to 1.44) and 1.73 (0.53 to 5.67) respectively. This indicates that imprecision is present because the width of CI is consistent with both important benefit and harm. This indicates that the total sample size was insufficiently large for a precise estimate of this outcome.</P>
<P>For the outcome of infection of CSF presurgery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>), there was inconsistency between the results of the two trials. <LINK REF="STD-Dykes-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dykes 1989</LINK> reported no cases of CSF infection and <LINK REF="STD-Ventriculomegaly-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ventriculomegaly 1990</LINK> reported infection in 10/157 cases.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-04-05 08:35:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this Cochrane Review update we re-conducted the search for completeness. The included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have outcome measures that are applicable to the review question. We found no ongoing trials that examined this review's question. However, there are ongoing trials that are comparing the timing of CSF removal in response to increasing ventricular size (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN43171322" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN43171322</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-03-13 11:21:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four RCTs including 208 preterm infants met the inclusion criteria of this review. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to selection bias, namely the use of a alternation method for randomisation in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mantovani-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mantovani 1980</LINK>). Also, it was unclear as to whether there was allocation concealment in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Anwar-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Anwar 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dykes-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dykes 1989</LINK>). Other sources of bias were likely to be minimal. In particular there were very low numbers of participants lost to follow-up and no evidence of selective reporting. There is some evidence that there was insufficient precision to assess the outcomes of death (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) and infection of CSF presurgery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). There were inconsistent results between studies for infection of CSF presurgery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). The quality of the evidence was low for the outcomes of death and infection of CSF presurgery; moderate for the outcomes of acquiring permanent shunt, and death or acquiring permanent shunt; and high for the outcomes of major disability in survivors, multiple disability in survivors, and death or disability.</P>

<P>Andrew Whitelaw (AW) performed the original literature search, extracted data, and conducted the original Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 2001a</LINK>). Yolanda Montagne, former Cochrane Neonatal Trials Search Coordinator, updated the search in 2009 and AW screened articles for potential inclusion. For this update, Richard Lee-Kelland (RLK) updated the literature search, text, and analyses, and included a new analysis of outcomes 1.6 and 1.7.

<P>We added the methodology and plan for the 'Summary of findings' tables and GRADE recommendations, which were not in the original protocol or previous version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 2001a</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>For the 2016 review update, we did not include VPS or placement of ventricular reservoir as part of outcome 1.1 acquiring permanent shunt, or outcome 1.6 death or shunt, as the placement of a reservoir is a much milder outcome than a shunt.</P>
<P>We combined the outcomes of death and shunt as a new outcome: outcome 1.6 death or shunt. </P>
<P>Finally, we added a new outcome: outcome 1.7 presence of CSF infection before surgery. CSF infection (meningitis/ventriculitis) is a serious adverse outcome and repeated lumbar or ventricular punctures in preterm infants carries a theoretical risk of introducing infection.</P>

<P>The infants are randomly allocated to the low threshold group or the high threshold group. Those in the low threshold group are treated when the ventricles reach a lower size threshold compared with the high threshold group. Treatment consists of lumbar punctures, where a needle is inserted into the lower part of the spine to drain fluid. If lumbar punctures are still needed over 28 days after the first one, a shunt is inserted into the brain to drain fluid. The two groups are compared with regard to how many infants need a shunt and their brain development at two years of age.<BR/>
