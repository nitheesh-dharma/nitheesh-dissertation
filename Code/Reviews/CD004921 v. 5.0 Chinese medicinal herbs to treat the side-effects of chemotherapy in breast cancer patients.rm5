<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Chinese medicinal herbs for the treatment of side-effects from chemotherapy in breast cancer patients</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Chinese medicinal herbs (CMH) include any mixture of herbal compounds and decoction (the process by which herbs are boiled and remaining liquid used for health purposes), including the development of herbal formulae and injections, and capsules. Although CMH are used to counteract the side effects of chemotherapy (cancer treatment with chemical agents that are selectively destructive to malignant cells and tissues) in patients being treated for cancer, the evidence for their use for women with breast cancer has not been ascertained. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CMH in alleviating chemotherapy-induced short term side effects for women either undergoing chemotherapy or having recently undergone chemotherapy. Short term side effects are those that occur during the course of the treatment and generally resolve within months of the completion of the therapy and affect up to 60% of patients.They include nausea and vomiting, mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the digestive tract from the mouth down to the anus caused by chemotherapy); neutropenia (a decrease in white blood cells caused by chemotherapy); myelosuppression (a condition in which bone marrow activity is decreased, resulting in fewer red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets), and fatigue (loss of energy and tirdness). This review found seven randomised studies involving 542 breast cancer patients addressing this question. These studies used six different herbal remedies to treat the side effects of chemotherapy, all used CMH plus chemotherapy as the intervention compared with chemotherapy alone. The results suggest that using Chinese herbs in conjunction with chemotherapy or CHM alone may be beneficial in terms of improvement in marrow suppression and Immune sytstem, and may improve overall state of quality of life. However, further trials are needed before the effects of TCM for people with breast cancer can be evaluated with any real confidence.There was no evidence of any harms of CMH.<BR/>

</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Short term side-effects of chemotherapy include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, mucositis and myelosuppression or neutropenia. These occur during the course of treatment and generally resolve within months of completion of chemotherapy. A variety of Chinese medicinal herbs have been used for managing these side effects.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs in alleviating chemotherapy-induced short term side effects in breast cancer patients.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched The Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register (15/02/2007), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1966 to December 2006); EMBASE (1990 to December 2006); and Chinese Biomedical Literature (2006, Issue 4). A number of journals were hand searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy with or without Chinese herbs in women with breast cancer. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently extracted the data, which were analysed using RevMan 4.2. For dichotomous data, we estimated the relative risk. For continuous data, we calculated the weighted mean difference.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified seven randomised controlled trials involving 542 breast cancer patients undergoing or having recently undergone chemotherapy. All studies were conducted and published in China. We did not pool the results because few studies were identified and no more than two used the same intervention. All were of low quality and used CMH plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. </P>
<P>CMH combined with chemotherapy showed no statistically significant difference for the outcomes of phlebitis and alopecia. Only one study showed an improvement in nausea and vomiting, and in fatigue. Three indicated an improvement in white blood cells in the group receiving CMH. Two showed an increase in percentage changes in T-lymphocyte subsets CD4 and CD8. One study showed a statistically significant difference for CMH in percentage changes in T-lymphocyte subsets CD3, CD4 and CD8. Two herbal compounds may have improved quality of life. One study reported that CMH may have some effect on reducing toxicity in liver and kidney, but differences were not statistically significant. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review provides limited evidence about the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs in alleviating chemotherapy induced short term side effects. Chinese medicinal herbs, when used together with chemotherapy, may offer some benefit to breast cancer patients in terms of bone marrow improvement and quality of life, but the evidence is too limited to make any confident conclusions. Well designed clinical trials are required before any conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness and safety of CHM in the management of breast cancer patients.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Chemotherapy improves disease-free and overall survival in women with early stage breast cancer and these treatments are generally recommended in those who are at moderate to high risk of recurrence. In advanced breast cancer, these therapies are generally not curative, but may lead to modest improvements in survival; when used in appropriate patients, they can improve quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hayes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 1995</LINK>).Chemotherapy is known to have substantial short and long term side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Partridge-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partridge 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Short term side effects are those that occur during the course of treatment and generally resolve within months of completion of therapy. They include fatigue, phlebitis, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, anemia, and myelosuppression or neutropenia. The latter can be associated with an increased risk of infection. The most common short term side effect of chemotherapy is fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bower-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Broeckel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broeckel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sitzia-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitzia 1998</LINK>). Nausea and vomiting are also common, and up to 60% of patients who receive antineoplastic cancer treatment will experience these side effects (<LINK REF="REF-King-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Long term side effects usually have a much later onset and have effects that may last for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Ramalingam-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramalingam 2002</LINK>). Long term side effects include premature ovarian failure, weight gain, cardiac dysfunction, leukemia and possibly cognitive dysfunction. These side effects affect the quality of life of cancer patients and compromise the ability of physicians to deliver adequate doses of effective chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-King-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1997</LINK>).</P>

<B>
<I>Fatigue</I>
</B>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>The prevalence of cancer-related fatigue increases to 80 to 96% in patients undergoing chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Stasi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stasi 2003</LINK>). This fatigue differs from that of everyday life, which is temporary and relieved by rest. Cancer-related fatigue is more severe, more distressing and not relieved by rest. Physiological factors (e.g. anemia, infection, electrolyte imbalance, sleep disorders, pharmacologic treatment) and psychological factors ( e.g. mood disorders, stress) contribute to this fatigue. Many studies have shown that a substantial proportion of patients do not discuss feelings of fatigue with their doctors. The limited understanding and appreciation of fatigue has resulted in the lack of a structured approach and treatment for this problem. This tends to be based frequently on dietary and vitamin support, in some cases pharmacologic treatment, and in others complete rest. Specific cancer-related causes of fatigue (anemia, insomnia, depression, metabolic disorders, etc.) should be treated first. Diet, sleep and rest are all strategies that have been used with a certain degree of success (<LINK REF="REF-Stasi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stasi 2003</LINK>). The use of erythropoietic growth factors has also been shown to mitigate chemotherapy-associated anemia and related fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Hudis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudis 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Nausea and vomiting</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting can be either acute (commencing shortly after administration and most severe during the next 6 to 8 hours) or delayed (occurring after 24 hours). Modern antiemetics are the standard medical treatment for preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, particularly the newly developed serotonin antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Campora-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campora 1994</LINK>). Chemotherapeutic drugs, however, vary in their tendency to cause nausea and vomiting and are classified as high, moderate or low in their emetogenicity. Drugs with high emetogenicity include cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and methotrexate. For many patients, the nausea and vomiting is refractory to serotonin antagonists and/or may continue for more than 24 hours after administration, when these work best (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 1997</LINK>). Nausea and vomiting can be controlled by the newer antiemetics or through the proper use of established agents. One large, randomised study (<LINK REF="REF-Gralla-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gralla 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kris-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kris 2006</LINK>) has shown that, when there is a high or moderate risk of emesis, adding corticosteroids to a serotonin receptor antagonist is safe and effective. <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Mucositis and neutropenia or myelosuppression</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Chemotherapy-induced mucositis is an important, dose-limiting, and costly side effect of cancer therapy. It occurs in approximately 40% of patients who receive cancer chemotherapy. Concomitant with mucositis is chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. </P>
<P>The approaches used to prevent chemotherapy-induced mucositis can be divided into three broad categories: alternation of mucosal delivery and excretion of individual chemotherapeutic agents; modification of the epithelial proliferative capabilities of the mucosa; and changing the potential for infective or inflammatory complications. General treatments include effective oral care, dietary modification and topical mucosal protectants. Appropriate use of topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics remain the cornerstone of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Pico-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pico 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Cytotoxic chemotherapy suppresses the hematopoietic system, impairing host protective mechanisms and limiting the dose of chemotherapy that can be tolerated. Neutropenic complications associated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, compromising treatment outcomes and creating excess healthcare costs. All patients who are treated with chemotherapy are at risk of developing neutropenic complications, but it is difficult for clinicians to predict which patients are at greater risk. For certain regimens, it is clear that prophylactic colony stimulating factor reduces the duration of severe neutropenia, but its use in all patients is not considered cost-effective. Researchers have sought to identify risk factors that may predispose patients to neutropenic complications (<LINK REF="REF-Crawford-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 2003</LINK>). Currently, however, many of the available interventions are costly and therefore prohibitive for treating the average patient in developing countries such as China. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Chinese medicinal herbs for chemotherapy-induced side effects<BR/>
</I>
</B>
<BR/>Complementary and alternative medicine approaches to health care are widely used around the world. A recent population-based survey of San Francisco women with breast cancer showed that 72% were using at least one type of alternative modality 2 to 4 months after diagnosis, especially those with advanced disease. One of the modalities commonly used among women with breast cancer is traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Most contemporary studies of TCM for breast cancer emanate from China and reflect the current practice of combining TCM with surgical treatment, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and radiation. There are no available statistics regarding the proportion of women using this approach in China or elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chinese medicinal herbs (CMH) form the mainstay of TCM, which is a 3000-year-old holistic system of medicine combining medicinal herbs, acupuncture, food therapy, massage and therapeutic exercise for both treatment and prevention of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Fulder-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulder 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirby-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 1997</LINK>). Traditional Chinese herbal practice differs from conventional or allopathic drug practice in three ways: first, Chinese herbal practice advocates the use of whole plants and herbalists generally use unpurified plant extracts containing several constituents; secondly, several herbs may be used at the same time; and thirdly, Chinese herbal practitioners provide herbs to patients according to the specific syndromes they are experiencing, using individualised formulae. In addition, herbal practitioners use different techniques and diagnostic classifications compared with conventional practitioners in order to diagnose particular conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Andrew-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrew 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Chinese herbs are defined in this review as products derived from plants or parts of plants (e.g. leaves, stems, buds, flowers, roots or tubers (raw or refined) and used for the treatment of disease on prescription from a TCM doctor. The plants included in this review will be restricted to those that are grown in China, since the effects of herbs from other areas may be different because of environmental factors that may affect plant components. For example, the components of the same plant from China or from Japan may be different. Synonyms for herbal medicines include: herbal remedies, herbal medications, herbal products, herbal preparations, medicinal herbs and phytopharmaceuticals. Being relatively convenient and cheap compared with other western medicine interventions, Chinese herbs have been sought and taken by many cancer patients in China and in other countries worldwide. </P>
<P>The treatments employed by TCM physicians are aimed at controlling the side effects and toxicities attributed to cancer therapies, preventing recurrence and prolonging survival (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2002</LINK>). It is claimed that CMH may also play an important role in the treatment of breast cancer, especially in accessory treatment, and that injury resulting from surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be relieved by TCM, and that recurrence, metastasis and complications can all be prevented. Many CMH have been used in the treatment of breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Two categories of CMH have been described: those that reduce therapeutic toxicity, clear heat (adjust unbalance in internal body such as anti-inflammatory action, reducing teperature etc.)and promote blood circulation (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2002</LINK>), and those that strengthen the body's resistance and reinforce immunity (humoral and cellular), relieve fatigue, remove toxins, and are antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2002</LINK>). CMH may therefore have the potential to improve the overall state of cancer patients' wellbeing and improve their ability to resist the disease. We identified some studies that used CMH to alleviate chemotherapy-induced short term side effects in breast cancer patients. The types of herbs and compound herbal formulae used are outlined in additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Some Chinese trials have tested the effectiveness of CMH in treating chemotherapy-induced short term side effects with interventions of at least one month duration and follow up of at least six months (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2002</LINK>). Researchers have tended to use different study designs and endpoints because CMH are quite often composed of mixtures of different herbs, and are sometimes customised for each patient by practitioners, based on a patient's syndrome according to traditional Chinese diagnostic patterns (inspection, listening, smelling, inquiry and palpation (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2006</LINK>)). </P>
<P>This systematic review was therefore necessary to assess the possible effectiveness and safety of CMH in alleviating chemotherapy-induced side effects in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the review could provide background information to aid the development and conduct of more definitive clinical trials in this area. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of CMH in alleviating chemotherapy-induced short term side effects in breast cancer patients. Short term side effects were defined as those that occur during the course of treatment and generally resolve within months of the completion of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Partridge-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partridge 2001</LINK>).</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-09-05 16:27:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only randomised clinical trials of CMH for breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced side effects were eligible for this review, regardless of blinding, language or publication status. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Inclusion criteria were: Female breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy either as adjuvant treatment for early or advanced breast cancer or as palliative treatment for metastatic breast cancer and experiencing chemotherapy-induced side effects. </P>
<P>Exclusion criteria were: Female breast cancer patients with other cancers (except for basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or skin cancer). </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>When considering Chinese herbs in the intervention group, we included: single herb (or extract from a single herb), Chinese proprietary medicine irrespective of preparation (e.g. oral liquid, tablet, capsule, pill, powder, plaster or injection liquid), mode of delivery (e.g. oral, cutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection), dosage and regimen etc. We defined CMH as products derived from plants or parts of plants that have been widely used in China for medicinal purposes. These include both single and compound herbal formulae (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>CMH may be given during and/or after chemotherapy regardless of the course of treatment or the duration of follow up. </P>
<P>We included these types of intervention. <BR/>1) CMH (single herb or compound herbs) compared with placebo. <BR/>2) CMH alone compared with conventional medicine alone (as methods of treating the side effects of chemotherapy: e.g. serotonin antagonists). <BR/>3) CMH combined with conventional medicine compared with conventional medicine alone. </P>
<P>We included Chinese herbal therapies alone or combined with other conventional treatments for the treatment group, provided that control group patients received the same conventional treatment; the only difference between the two groups was whether they received CMH or not. </P>
<P>The types of herbs used are described in additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measures were: <BR/>1) control of nausea and vomiting, phlebitis and alopecia; <BR/>2) control of the severity of mucositis,; including stomatitis, vaginitis, enteritis, proctitis and conjunctivitis <BR/>3) relief of fatigue. </P>
<P>We assessed the degree of control of the above symptoms according to the scales used in the original studies (e.g. patient reported and/or clinician evaluated). </P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures were: <BR/>1) improvement in marrow suppression, including neutropenia (white blood cell (WBC) reduction), anemia and thrombocytopenia as assessed by the World Health Organization Haematogical Toxicity Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Ramalingam-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramalingam 2002</LINK>); <BR/>2) immune system (percentage change in T lymphocytes); <BR/>3) adverse events, including infection, hospitalizations and toxicity to the kidney, liver and spleen induced by Chinese herbs (classified and measured according to the tools used in each trial); <BR/>4) long term side effects such as premature ovarian failure, weight gain, cardiac dysfunction, leukemia and cognitive dysfunction if data were available; <BR/>5) health-related quality of life assessed by, but not limited to, the European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 (<LINK REF="REF-Aaronson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaronson 1993</LINK>) or the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1992</LINK>) if reported. </P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trial selection </P>
<P>The authors screened trials for eligibility for inclusion in the review by retrieving all articles or abstracts that appeared relevant. Two assessors (M Zhang and X Liu) independently reviewed the title, abstract and keywords of every record retrieved. They obtained the full articles for further assessment if the information given suggested that: </P>
<P>1. the study population comprised patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy, regardless of cancer stage; <BR/>2. at least one treatment arm used CMH; <BR/>3. at least one outcome of interest (nausea and vomiting or mucositis etc.) was reported; <BR/>4. the trial compared CMH with placebo or any other active intervention; <BR/>5. random allocation to the treatment or comparison group was used. </P>
<P>A third author (J Li) resolved any differences encountered. Where there was still doubt, we acquired the full article for further inspection. When this was not possible, we sought further information. These trials were added to the list of those awaiting assessment pending acquisition of more details. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Quality assessment of the trials</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Two authors (M Zhang and X Liu) independently allocated each trial to one of the three quality categories described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). When disputes arose about category allocation, again we attempted resolution by discussion or by consulting a third author (J Li). When this was not possible and we required further information to clarify quality category allocation, we did not enter the data and we allocated the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment. </P>
<P>We assessed trial quality according to the following criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>1. Minimisation of selection bias. <BR/>a) Was the randomisation procedure adequate? <BR/>b) Was allocation concealment adequate? </P>
<P>2. Minimisation of performance bias - were the patients and individuals administering treatment blind to group allocation? </P>
<P>3. Minimisation of attrition bias. </P>
<P>a) Were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? <BR/>b) Was analysis by intention to treat? </P>
<P>4. Minimisation of detection bias - were outcome assessors blind to the intervention? </P>
<P>On the basis of these criteria, we broadly subdivided studies into one of the following three categories (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>). <BR/>A All criteria for quality were met: there was a low risk of bias. <BR/>B One or more of the criteria for quality were only partly met: there was a moderate risk of bias. <BR/>C One or more of the criteria for quality were not met: there was a high risk of bias. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Data extraction</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Where possible, we extracted the following data from descriptions of the original studies using a standard extraction form, which included at least the following items. <BR/>1. General information: published/unpublished, language, authors, article title, publication details (journal title, year, volume, issue, pagination). <BR/>2. Design of the trial: prespecified sample size, generation of randomisation sequence, allocation concealment method, blinding of information, statistical methods, attrition. <BR/>3. Participants: diagnostic criteria, total number and numbers in comparison groups, baseline characteristics, age, sex, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, study setting. <BR/>4. Intervention: types of herb, content of herbal formulae, duration, dosage, dose, co-intervention, control, withdrawals, dropouts, losses to follow up. <BR/>5. Outcome: primary outcomes; secondary outcomes and other outcomes at the end of treatment and /or the end of follow up; and number, type and severity of adverse events. <BR/>6. Conclusion: positive/negative. <BR/>7. Source of funding. </P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis <BR/>We did not include data from studies where more than 50% of the participants in any group were lost to follow up (this does not include the outcome of 'leaving the study early'). In studies with a less than 50% dropout rate, we considered participants leaving early to have had a negative outcome, except for the event of adverse effects and death. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Data analysis </I>
</B>
</P>
<P>We analysed the data using MetaView 4.2.2 in Review Manager 4.2 (Cochrane software). We compared each type of Chinese herb with each control intervention. If available and of sufficient quality and similarity (no heterogeneity, e.g. individual trial compared the same herb versus the same control intervention and the same outcome measures), we summarised the data statistically. Where possible, we conducted analyses according to intention to treat. </P>
<P>Dichotomous data </P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes a standard estimation of the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated (fixed-effect model) to compare the incidence of the side effects of chemotherapy in the treatment group with those in the control group. A RR value of less than 1 indicated a reduction in side effects in the CMH group. Where possible, we also calculated the number needed to treat. If there was heterogeneity, we used a random-effects model. </P>
<P>Continuous data </P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we estimated the weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups. Again, if we found heterogeneity, we used a random-effects model. </P>
<P>Test for heterogeneity </P>
<P>The fixed effect model was to be used for pooling. The random effects model was to be used if there was heterogeneity between studies (P &lt; 0.10, chi-square). We planned to explore possible sources of heterogeneity by subgroup analysis and carry out sensitivity analyses as described below. </P>
<P>Addressing publication bias </P>
<P>We plotted data from all included studies on a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias depending on the number of clinical trials included in the systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Sensitivity analysis</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>We had planned to perform sensitivity analyses to explore the influence of the following factors on estimates of treatment effect. <BR/>1. Repeating the analysis excluding unpublished studies (if there were any). <BR/>2. Repeating the analysis taking account of study quality. <BR/>3. Repeating the analysis excluding studies using the following filters: language of publication, source of funding (industry versus other), country. </P>
<P>However, we were unable to perform sensitivity analyses because pooling was not possible owing to the small number of trials. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Subgroup analysis</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>We had planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses. <BR/>1. Age (perimenopausal, postmenopausal). <BR/>2. Type of primary treatment. <BR/>3. Early compared with advanced breast cancer. <BR/>4. Participants receiving different chemotherapy drugs, different durations of treatment and different dosages. <BR/>5. Duration of follow up: on the basis of data. <BR/>We were unable to perform subgroup analyses owing to the small number of the trials. </P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Excluded studies</P>
<P>The initial search identified 88 references (76 from electronic searches and 12 from handsearching) up to December 2006. After reviewing the titles and abstracts, we excluded 71 studies because they were duplicates, experimental or animal studies, or they had a study objective not relevant to this review. A total of 17 references published in Chinese were retrieved for further assessment. Of these, 10 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hou-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hou 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1997</LINK>) were excluded because they did not meet our inclusion criteria (see 'Characteristics of excluded studies'). </P>
<P>Awaiting assessment</P>
<P>No studies were awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>Ongoing studies</P>
<P>We were not aware of any studies that were ongoing.</P>
<P>Included studies</P>
<P>We were able to include seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>). All were said to be randomised, although no detailed descriptions were provided. CMH were used in all included studies. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Huo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>) used Shenmai injections plus conventional chemotherapy as an intervention versus chemotherapy alone. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK> compared patients treated with Aidi fuzheng injections plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone and the study by <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK> compared patients treated with Shenqi fuzheng injections plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK> investigated Aifukang capsules (a developed formula) plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone on quality of life after operation. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2005</LINK> compared Jiawei Guilu Erxian Dan (a mixture of traditional Chinese medicines) plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone on bone marrow inhibition after chemotherapy. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK>
<BR/>compared an oral decoction of Chinese herbs( the main herbal compound comprising 11 herbs) given 1 month after surgery combined with chemotherapy versus western medicine. All the studies reported two parallel treatment arms. For a full description of these seven studies, see 'Characteristics of included studies'. All included studies were conducted and the reports published in China. </P>
<P>Length of studies</P>
<P>The longest study (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>) took place over a period of 84 days and the shortest ones (<LINK REF="STD-Huo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2005</LINK>) lasted only for 14 days. The length of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK>) was not reported. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) lasted for between 42 and 56 days. </P>
<P>Participants and setting</P>
<P>All seven trials randomised participants with breast cancer. All participants were Chinese women. Five studies included inpatients (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Huo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huo 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>). One (<LINK REF="STD-Hong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2005</LINK>) included outpatients post breast cancer surgery and one (<LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>) included both outpatients and inpatients. Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2005</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Huo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>) included postoperative patients. Two studied (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) patients with advanced breast cancer (Stage IV). </P>
<P>Study size</P>
<P>A total of 542 participants were included in the seven studies. <LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK> was the largest study, with 120 patients, and <LINK REF="STD-Huo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huo 2003</LINK> was the smallest, with 48 patients. The remaining studies randomized less than 100 patients: <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2005</LINK> (n = 92); <LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK> (n = 68); <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>(n = 75); <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK> (n = 80); <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK> (n = 59). </P>
<P>Diagnosis<BR/>The diagnostic criteria for breast cancer were based on World Health Organization (WHO) TNM stage criteria for three studies and a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) greater than 60 (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>); a further three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Huo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>) used pathological diagnostic criteria and a KPS greater than 60; and in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) the criteria were based on the Diagnostic Criteria for Chinese Common Malignant Tumors. All patients in this study had stage IV disease and their KPS scores were greater than 60. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>) documented clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. </P>
<P>Interventions</P>
<P>Variation in formulae, dosages, administration, duration of treatment and control interventions were common in the included studies. In total, 27 different herbal medicines were used. Radix Astragali (Huangqi) was tested in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>). Radix Codonopsis (Dangshen) was tested in two (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>). Shenmai injections were used in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Huo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>). Four studies used herbal injections (<LINK REF="STD-Huo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>); two used herbal decoctions (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2005</LINK>) and one (<LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>) used herbal capsules. The compositions and dosages of herbal medicines varied (see Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). </P>
<P>The treatment groups were given herbal medicines combined with chemotherapy and all the control groups received chemotherapy alone. <LINK REF="STD-Huo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huo 2003</LINK> used Shenmai injections (40 mL plus 300 mL with 5% amylaceum, once a day for 14 days) combined with conventional chemotherapy (not specified). <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK> used Shenmai injections (60 mL/day for 42 days) combined with conventional chemotherapy with CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil), CAF (cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, fluorouracil), or CAP (cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Platino). <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK> used Aidi injections (50 mL/day for 30 days) combined with vinorelbine (25 mg/m2) and Pirarubicin (40 to 50 mg/m2) for 21 days. <LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK> used an oral decoction of a mixture of 11 CMH combined with conventional chemotherapy (not specified). Full descriptions of the studies can be found in 'Characteristics of included studies'. </P>
<P>Outcomes</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) reported nausea and vomiting, two (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) reported phlebitis, one (<LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>) reported fatigue, one (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>) reported alopecia, five (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) reported bone marrow suppression (proportion of patients with a WBC count &lt; 3.0 10^9/L) and effect on the immune system (percentage change in T lymphocytes), three ( <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) reported quality of life, and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>) reported adverse events. All the reported outcomes were measured at the end of treatment, but the timing of measurements varied across trials. </P>
<P>No study reported severity of mucositis or long term side effects. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Randomisation and allocation concealment </P>
<P>All included studies were described as randomised. Two (<LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) used a random number table to allocate participants, one (<LINK REF="STD-Hong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2005</LINK>) used a simple randomised method, but the author did not state which one. All other studies claimed to be randomised, but none described how the randomisation process was undertaken. This potentially created some selection bias. Concealment of allocation prior to enrolment was not mentioned in any study. We tried to contact the relevant authors for detailed information by phone or correspondence, but to date we have not received any replies. </P>
<P>Blindness</P>
<P>Descriptions of the blinding process were not reported for the included studies. There were obvious differences in drug types and routes of drug delivery between treatment and control groups in all the studies (see table of 'Characteristics of included studies', particularly 'Methods' and 'Notes'). </P>
<P>Loss to follow up, withdrawals and intention-to-treat analysis</P>
<P>None of studies described or reported withdrawals, loss to follow up or intention-to-treat analysis. </P>
<P>Data reporting</P>
<P>The similarities of the comparison groups at baseline were reported in all trials, based on age, sex and disease duration at entry. Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>) reported inclusion and exclusion criteria. Outcome assessments were made after treatment, but indications for further interventions were stated. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>We did not conduct a pooled analysis because there were only two studies that evaluated the same intervention. We did not conduct subgroup analysis because of the small number of included studies in each group. We also did not conduct sensitivity analyses because pooling was not performed. </P>
<P>Control of nausea and vomiting ('Comparisons and data 01.01-01.02')</P>
<P>This was expressed as either dichotomous or continuous data in the original studies. </P>

Quality of life was evaluated in this study using the EuroQLQ-BR23 questionnaire and an additional form developed for the study. Quality of life measured in one study administering Shenqi fuzheng injections plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>) and another administering Aidi fuzheng injections plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) was evaluated using the Karnofsky performance status score combined with scores evaluated by the patients (improvement: an increase by 10 points after treatment; reduction: a decrease by 10 points; stable: either an increase or a decrease of less than 10 points). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK> showed an improvement in quality of life (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.33), but that by <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK> did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.74). However, the original study by <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK> reported that there was a statistically significant difference for quality of life between the herbal group and the control group.

<P>The study (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>) that compared Shenqi fuzheng injections plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone reported adverse effects of toxicity to kidney and liver and abnormal function. These results were not statistically significant (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.06; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.48). Our results differed from those in the original study, which reported that the treatment group had fewer adverse effects than the control group (7.5% in the treatment group and 8.5% in the control group). </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review identified seven studies of six different herbal remedies to treat the side effects of chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. All studies compared CMH plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. Different prescriptions for the elements and dosages of each herbal remedy may cause different outcomes in breast cancer patients. As a result we were unable to pool the data across studies, which may have provided more precise results and greater statistical power to detect differences. To help physicians to understand the effectiveness of each Chinese herbal remedy in treatment of the side effects of chemotherapy, we have described the elements and dosages of all the prescriptions included in this review in additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. </P>
<P>This review has several limitations. First, all included studies were quite small in size, ranging from 48 to 120 patients, which could have resulted in both false positive and false negative findings. Secondly, the patients included in individual studies had different stages of breast cancer and were subject to different diagnostic criteria (e.g. three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>) used the WHO TNM staging criteria, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>) used pathologic diagnostic criteria, and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) used the Diagnostic Criteria for Common Chinese Malignant Tumors). Thirdly, there were variations in formulae, dosages, modes of administration, duration of treatment and control interventions. Fourthly, the outcome measures were also different (e.g. when reporting WBC count outcome, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Huo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) used a defined reduction in WBC as an outcome measurement, and three other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>) used the WBC count as the outcome measurement). Additionally, different tools were used to assess quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Situ-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Situ 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>). Details are given in the table of 'Characteristics of included studies'. The differences noted could have resulted in clinical heterogeneity. </P>
<P>In addition, statistical methods were misused in some of the original studies. One study, by <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>, reported that there was a significant improvement in the herbal group for all outcomes measured. After very careful checking by two authors and a statistician using methods including Fisher's exact test and the logrank test, we detected that some statistical methods were used inappropriately in the original study, which led to incorrect conclusions. </P>
<P>It is believed that CMH may reduce therapeutic toxicity, clear heat and promote blood circulation (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2002</LINK>); they may also strengthen the body's resistance and reinforce immunity (humoral and cellular), relieve fatigue and remove toxins, and are antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2002</LINK>). The use of CMH may improve the overall state of these patients' wellbeing and improve their ability to overcome the cancer. There is some evidence in this review that CMH recipes containing Huangqi (Radix Astragali) plus chemotherapy may have beneficial effects that combat marrow suppression (white blood cells) and improve the immune system (T lymphocytes). There is no evidence that Chinese herbal compounds plus chemotherapy improve the control of phlebitis and alopecia. </P>
<P>It was regrettable that the quality of the included trials was poor. We do not think the evidence in this systematic review is strong enough to draw firm conclusions. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review provides limited evidence concerning the effectiveness of CMH in alleviating chemotherapy-induced short term side effects. When used together with chemotherapy, CMH may offer some benefit to breast cancer patients in terms of bone marrow improvement and quality of life, but the evidence is too limited to make any confident conclusions. Well designed clinical trials are required before any conclusions can be drawn about the value of CMH in the management of breast cancer patients. </P>
<P>Breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy</P>
<P>Chinese herbal medicine, when used together with chemotherapy, may have the potential to offer benefits in terms of improvements in marrow suppression and the immune system, and in the overall status of quality of life, but the evidence is too limited to make any conclusions with confidence. Furthermore, there has been only limited assessment of the safety of herbal therapy. </P>
<P>Clinicians</P>
<P>How these findings may be incorporated into everyday practice is unclear. Clinicians practising TCM or using Chinese herbs as a medicine supplementary to chemotherapy should be encouraged to review the data from these studies and share them with their patients. They should also support more definitive studies. Western physicians not trained in TCM or the use of CMH should not dismiss these approaches as being without theory or clinical basis, and should likewise support further studies in the field. There are currently no data to make specific recommendations on whether herbal therapy should be used, and which specific regimens would be suited to specific conditions. </P>
<P>Funders and policy makers</P>
<P>TCM and Chinese herbs are widely used and the studies noted here seem to suggest that they may have some effect. This intervention seems to have enough supporting evidence from both ancient practice and modern studies to be worth further investigation in some areas. This review does not provide sufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of TCM or CMH combined with chemotherapy for alleviation of the side effects of chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Numerous obstacles to the conduction of studies in this area need to be overcome, including the standardization of herbal products, the bridging of gaps between practitioners of herbal therapy and traditional oncologists, and sufficient expertise and funding to conduct the necessary trials. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review raises many questions. There is some suggestion that the use of CMH, even within the context of western traditions of diagnosis and practice, have some properties that are possibly beneficial, but this remains unclear in the absence of properly randomised trials. Furthermore, we did not find that the identified trials evaluated the holistic and tailored approach of traditional CMH. Any future studies of Chinese herbal medicines plus chemotherapy in breast cancer patients would need to be much larger and take into account clear and consistent clinical criteria in diagnosis, interventions, outcomes and the safety of Chinese herb medicine. </P>
