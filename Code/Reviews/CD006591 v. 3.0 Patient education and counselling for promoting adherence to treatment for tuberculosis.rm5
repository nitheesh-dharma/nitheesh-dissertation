<P>Many people do not take their medication as prescribed. The consequences of this for chronic and debilitating infections like tuberculosis are serious and can include prolonged periods of infectiousness, relapse, emergence of drug-resistant <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </I>isolates, and increased morbidity and mortality. Our review considered trials of education and counselling in promoting adherence to the treatment of both latent (dormant) and active tuberculosis.</P>
<P>We identified three very low quality evidence trials involving a total of 1437 participants that evaluated education and counselling interventions in promoting adherence to completion of medication for treatment of latent tuberculosis. Two of these studies demonstrated a beneficial effect of education and counselling upon adherence to drug treatment, whereas one did not.</P>
<P>There were substantial differences between trials with respect to populations targeted, interventions chosen and outcomes measured. The existing evidence is insufficient to guide policy on the use of education and counselling to promote adherence to tuberculosis therapy.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-13 09:23:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found three trials, with a total of 1437 participants, which examined the effects of different educational and counselling interventions on adherence to treatment for latent tuberculosis.</P>
<P>All three trials reported the proportion of people who successfully completed treatment for latent tuberculosis. Overall, education or counselling interventions may increase successful treatment completion but the magnitude of benefit is likely to vary depending on the nature of the intervention, and the setting (data not pooled, 923 participants, three trials, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>In a four-arm trial in children from Spain, counselling by nurses via telephone increased the proportion of children completing treatment from 65% to 94% (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.72; 157 participants, one trial), and counselling by nurses through home visits increased completion to 95% (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.74; 156 participants, one trial). Both of these interventions were superior to counselling by physicians at the tuberculosis clinic (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.47; 159 participants, one trial).</P>
<P>In the USA, a programme of peer counselling for adolescents failed to show an effect on treatment completion rates at six months (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 394 participants, one trial). In this trial treatment completion was around 75% even in the control group.</P>
<P>In the third study, in prisoners from the USA, treatment completion was very low in the control group (12%), and although counselling significantly improved this, completion in the intervention group remained low at 24% (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.68; 211 participants, one trial).</P>
<P>None of these trials aimed to assess the effect of these interventions on the subsequent development of active tuberculosis, and we found no trials that assessed the effects of patient education or counselling on adherence to treatment for active tuberculosis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-20 15:18:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-03-20 15:18:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tuberculosis is an infectious disease which may be caused by a variety of strains of mycobacteria, but usually <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis. </I>Tuberculosis usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. When a person with infectious tuberculosis coughs or sneezes, droplet nuclei containing <I>M. tuberculosis</I> are expelled into the air. If another person inhales air containing these droplet nuclei, he or she may become infected. However, not everyone infected with tuberculosis bacteria becomes sick. As a result, two tuberculosis-related conditions exist: latent tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis disease (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In latent tuberculosis, the person is infected with <I>M. tuberculosis</I> but does not feel sick and has no symptoms. The only sign of tuberculosis infection is a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test. Persons with latent tuberculosis infection are not infectious and cannot spread tuberculosis infection to others. However, if tuberculosis bacteria become active in the body and multiply, the person will develop tuberculosis disease. The general symptoms of tuberculosis disease include: night sweats, weight loss, unexplained, fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, chills, chest pain, coughing for 3 weeks or longer and haemoptysis. Left untreated, each person with active tuberculosis disease will infect on average between 10 and 15 people every year.</P>
<P>Overall, one-third of the world's population is currently infected with the tuberculosis bacillus. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the largest number of new tuberculosis cases in 2008 occurred in the Southeast Asia region, which accounted for 35% of incident cases globally. However, the estimated incidence rate in sub-Saharan Africa is nearly twice that of Southeast Asia with over 350 cases per 100,000 population (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tuberculosis treatment regimens can vary, but they generally require the use of multiple drugs for a minimum of six months (<LINK REF="REF-Harries-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harries 2004</LINK>). Regardless of which regimen is in place, patients often find it difficult to complete their course of drug treatment. Frequently they feel well after the first few months of treatment, when most of the tubercle bacilli have been killed, and stop taking the prescribed regimen of drugs. Personal factors (eg poor understanding of the disease or treatment requirements), drug side effects, drug resistance leading to protracted treatment periods, social and economic factors (eg stigma, lack of family support, and poverty), and health system factors (eg inconvenient treatment arrangements, poor patient-provider relationships, and non-availability of drugs) can further contribute to poor adherence to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Comolet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comolet 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rideout-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rideout 1994</LINK>). The consequences of not completing drug therapy are serious and can include a prolonged period of infectiousness, relapse, emergence of drug-resistant <I>M. tuberculosis </I>isolates, and increased morbidity and mortality. Poor adherence to drug treatment therefore poses a serious risk to the community and contributes to failure in eradicating the disease globally (<LINK REF="REF-Addington-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addington 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cuneo-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuneo 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fox-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In high-risk groups, such as the homeless, intravenous drug users, people infected with HIV, and prisoners, completion of the drug treatment regimen poses special challenges. These groups contribute significantly to the global burden of tuberculosis and spread of the disease, and therefore warrant special attention within tuberculosis control and treatment programmes.</P>
<P>People at high risk of developing clinical tuberculosis who require preventive therapy (also referred to as chemoprophylaxis or treatment of latent tuberculosis) constitute yet another group for whom adherence to treatment is important (<LINK REF="STD-Chaisson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chaisson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanmarti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sanmarti 1993</LINK>). The most common preventive therapy regimen is daily isoniazid for a period of 6 to 12 months, but other effective regimens also exist (<LINK REF="REF-Akolo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akolo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smieja-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smieja 1999</LINK>). The choice of regimen will depend on factors such as cost, the likelihood of adverse effects, adherence and drug resistance.</P>
<P>Treatment adherence can be defined as the extent to which people follow the instructions they are given regarding prescribed treatments. The term is intended to be non-judgemental, a statement of fact rather than one of blame. Various strategies have been employed in an attempt to improve adherence to tuberculosis treatment. Many of these strategies target patients (eg reminders and prompts, defaulter action, education and counselling, incentives and reimbursements, contracts, peer assistance, and directly observed therapy). Other interventions are directed at healthcare providers (eg staff motivation and supervision) or the mode of treatment delivery (eg intermittent dosing and drug packaging). The cost of implementation of some adherence promoting strategies may be prohibitive, particularly in low-resource settings in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia where most of the burden of tuberculosis occurs (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Decisions should therefore be informed by solid evidence on what works, under what operational conditions they work, and at what cost, so that tuberculosis management policies and programmes can be aligned with available resources.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-03-12 20:39:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Techniques used in delivering patient education cover a wide spectrum of means, including dissemination of information via the mass media, provision of written, audiovisual, and computer-based patient education materials by healthcare providers or institutions, and individualized counselling approaches.</P>
<P>A number of interventions have been used to promote adherence. This Cochrane Review is one of several published, planned, or in progress to evaluate each type of intervention:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Patient education and counselling: provision of information or one-to-one or group counselling about tuberculosis and the need to complete treatment (this review).</LI>
<LI>Staff motivation and supervision: training and management processes that aim to improve how providers care for people with tuberculosis.</LI>
<LI>Reminder systems and late patient tracers in the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis: routinely reminding patients to keep an appointment and actions taken when patients fail to keep an appointment (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2008</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Incentives and reimbursements: money or cash to reimburse expenses of attending services, or to improve the attractiveness of visiting the service.</LI>
<LI>Contracts: written or verbal agreements to return for an appointment or course of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch_x002d_Capblanch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch-Capblanch 2007</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Peer assistance: people from the same social group helping someone with tuberculosis return to the health service by prompting or accompanying them.</LI>
<LI>Directly observed therapy (DOT): an appointed agent (health worker, community volunteer, family member) directly monitors people swallowing their antituberculous drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2007</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Material incentives and enablers in the management of tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lutge-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutge 2012</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-03-12 20:39:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patient education and counselling aims to ensure that people have sufficient knowledge and understanding to make informed choices and actively participate in their own health care. In this review, we evaluated the impact of these interventions on adherence to drug treatment for active and latent tuberculosis. Patient education has been defined as a deliberate process of influencing patient behaviour and producing the changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practices necessary to maintain or improve health (<LINK REF="REF-AAFP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAFP 2000</LINK>). Providing patients with complete and current information about their health helps create an atmosphere of trust, enhances the healthcare provider-patient relationship, and empowers patients to participate in their own health care. In this review, counselling refers to one-on-one or group interaction between the study participant(s) and a trained counsellor with the aim of providing tailored guidance and problem-solving skills to help patients manage their health problem better. During the counselling sessions, attempts are made to understand the patient's level of understanding of tuberculosis and its treatment, and also explore any misconceptions. Emphasis is put on the tuberculosis infection, the importance of therapy and adherence to therapy, the possible adverse effects, and dietary habits. It is assumed that gains made at this level would be further strengthened during subsequent visits through education sessions.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-03-12 20:39:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patient education and counselling strategies have been shown to improve treatment outcomes for certain conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>). However, their value for people with tuberculosis is unclear. Non-adherence to drug treatment for tuberculosis has the potential to impact negatively on both the individual patient and on the broader health of the community. It is therefore important to evaluate which interventions are effective in supporting adherence and completion of tuberculosis drug treatment regimens.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Sanmarti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sanmarti 1993</LINK>, after 12 months of follow-up all of those patients randomized (318) were included in the analysis. Adherence, measured by attendance at the last clinic visit, was significantly better in the group that received education by nursing personnel either by telephone (75/80) (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.72) or through home visits (75/79) (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.74). For those receiving education by physicians at the clinic, there was no statistically significant increase in attendance (64/82) (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.47). Compared to the control group, all three educational strategies had improved adherence as measured by the Eidus-Hamilton reaction in the urine in the nursing education by telephone arm (68/80) (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.89); in the education with home visits by a nurse (71/79) (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.99); and for those receiving education by a physician (61/82) (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.69).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-White-2002" TYPE="STUDY">White 2002</LINK>, of the 558 originally randomized to education (185), incentives (185) or a control group (188), 322 (57.7%) were included in the analysis. In the available case analysis in the paper, those in the education group (24/107) were almost twice as likely to complete therapy for latent tuberculosis at six months compared to those in the control group (12/104) (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.68). In addition, education increased the likelihood of completing the first tuberculosis clinic visit one month after release from jail (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.37). In a best case scenario analysis, assuming that all of those lost to follow-up did in fact complete treatment, there was no statistical difference between the groups, education (103/185) versus control (97/188) (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.30); for a worst case scenario analysis assuming that those who were not reported did not complete therapy, those in the education group completed treatment (24/185) significantly more often than those in the control group (12/188) (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.94).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK>, 794 participants were randomized to four groups: peer counselling (199); contingency contracting (204), a combination of both (196), and usual care (195). The total percentage of randomized participants included in the analysis was 96.6% (767/794).The analysis was described as an intention-to-treat analysis, whereby all patients who did not have a measure for completion of care were assumed to have discontinued therapy and were coded as having not completed care. The authors then referred to exceptions in which patients whose treatment was discontinued by the physician, or who informed the clinics that they were moving, were analysed differently. It is unclear whether these patients were excluded from the analysis or were considered to have completed care. The results that are reported do not include all 794 initially randomized patients, and is therefore likely a modified intention-to-treat analysis. There was no statistically significant difference reported between the peer counselling and usual care groups. In a best case scenario, assuming that all those lost to follow up in either group did complete therapy, there was no significant difference between the peer counselling group (166/199) compared to the usual care group (153/195) (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.17). For a worst case scenario analysis, considering that all of those lost to follow up did not complete therapy, there was no statistical difference between the peer counselling (155/199) and the usual care (147/195) groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.15).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-12 20:39:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is very low quality evidence that in children at risk of tuberculosis, treatment adherence (as measured by attendance at the clinic at one year) is improved by mothers receiving an educational intervention delivered by nurses by telephone or by a home visit (<LINK REF="STD-Sanmarti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sanmarti 1993</LINK>). Another study found that prison inmates receiving an educational intervention were more likely to complete treatment for latent tuberculosis than those who do not (<LINK REF="STD-White-2002" TYPE="STUDY">White 2002</LINK>). There is no evidence that peer counselling improves completion of treatment in adolescents with latent tuberculosis (<LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-03-20 15:24:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not find any eligible studies of patient education and counselling for promoting adherence to treatment in patients with active tuberculosis. The three trials of participants with latent tuberculosis were conducted in the USA and Spain. The evidence base currently does not include participants living in low resource countries or those in special risk groups, such as HIV-infected patients, intravenous drug users, the homeless, and others. Furthermore, to avoid high risk of bias we excluded a number of studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria, as described under <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>A key issue with the application of an educational and counselling intervention is the possible cost implications, particularly in settings already poorly resources in terms of staff or funds. A cost-effectiveness study linked with <LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK> described the direct costs of the counselling intervention relative to standard of care (<LINK REF="STD-Kominsky-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kominsky 2007</LINK>). Direct costs included clinic visits, mantoux testing, chest X-rays, costs of staffing and hiring of peer counsellors, and travel to the clinic for the patient. The usual cost of care in this American setting was $199, whereas the addition of peer counselling increased the cost to $277. It is difficult to extrapolate from this study the possible costs in other settings, particularly in low- and middle-income settings where tuberculosis is most prevalent. However, this gives a good indication that the intervention would add costs, both in terms of human resources and necessary funding. The current data is insufficient to provide a relevant cost-benefit assessment. Decision makers aiming to implement educational programmes based on evidence from other settings would have to consider the additional costs.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-03-20 15:25:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the GRADE quality of evidence for the outcomes assessed was rated as 'very low' and highlights the need for further large randomized controlled trials of education and counselling in people on drug treatment for active or latent tuberculosis. (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Only one included trial (<LINK REF="STD-White-2002" TYPE="STUDY">White 2002</LINK>) reported the method of randomization with adequate sequence generation, and none of them mentioned a method of treatment allocation which allowed for the concealment of study groups allocation. Furthermore, only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK>) addressed incomplete outcome data. Bias due to selective reporting was unclear in all three trials; however, two of them (<LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2002" TYPE="STUDY">White 2002</LINK>) were free from bias from other sources while one, <LINK REF="STD-Sanmarti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sanmarti 1993</LINK>, was not (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> &amp; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The sample sizes of the included trials were relatively small. Small trials are more likely than larger trials to be insufficiently powered to detect clinically and statistically significant differences between groups. Poor quality trials are more likely to be subject to bias and therefore the results are less reliable than those from better quality trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is very low quality evidence that education or counselling or both promotes adherence to treatment for latent tuberculosis.

<P>There is therefore insufficient evidence to recommend the widespread use of education and counselling in tuberculosis services.

<P>There is a need for adequately powered, good quality, randomized controlled trials that evaluate education and counselling in people with latent and active tuberculosis. These studies should be designed to assess the effects of the interventions on the important clinical outcomes such as cure or tuberculosis incidence in participants living in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. It may be more relevant to evaluate education and counselling as part of packages of care or interventions that support adherence.</P>

<P>
<B>Peer counselling:</B> Specially trained adolescent peer counsellors who had previously completed treatment for latent tuberculosis, following a standardized protocol, contacted by telephone all participants assigned to them one week after commencement of treatment and at least every two weeks thereafter. The initial contact aimed to establish rapport and explain the role of the peer educator, and stressed the importance of clinic attendance and medication-taking. Later contacts focused on addressing beliefs, problems or concerns.</P>
<P>
<B>Parent-participant contingency contract:</B> With the assistance of program staff, parents and adolescents negotiated an incentive provided by the parent to be received if the adolescent adhered to the prescribed tuberculosis treatment ie keeping appointments with tuberculosis clinic and taking the tuberculosis medication every day.</P>
<P>
<B>Combined use of peer counselling and incentives:</B> Received both peer counselling and parent-participant contingency contract interventions.</P>
<P>
<B>Control (Usual Care):</B> Received all of the treatment and educational services usually provided by the clinic, eg face-to face health education from tuberculosis staff and assessment and health checks in response to treatment. </P>
<P>All participants received US $15 as reimbursement for their time spent completing the baseline and post-test interviews. All participants were also interviewed three times during the six months of their treatment.</P>

<B>Education by nurse via telephone:<I> </I>
</B>Mothers were telephoned by specialized nursing personnel every three months, who informed them of the advantages of chemoprophylaxis for their child&#8217;s health and encouraged them to continue with this preventive measure.</P>
<P>
<B>Education by nurse via home visit:</B> Specialized nurse visited the participant's home every three months, providing health education to mother and child, encouraging them to continue with the preventive therapy, and re-issuing informative leaflets given at the first visit. Also, the Eidus-Hamilton reaction was performed to objectively verify compliance with the therapy. Possible adverse reactions were monitored.</P>
<P>
<B>Education by doctor at clinic: </B>The child was seen by the physician every three months at the Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Centre. At each visit, the doctor gave educational messages to both mother and child, provided the same informative leaflets given at the first visit, monitored possible drug adverse reactions, and performed the Eidus-Hamilton reaction.</P>
<P>Education messages were standardized through use of the same health education script by both the physician and the nurses, and participants were given the same pamphlets.</P>
<P>
<B>Control group: </B>No health education activity was performed. After the first visit, the mothers were informed that unless they considered it appropriate there was no need to come back until after they had followed the treatment for 12 months.</P>
<P>At recruitment, all the groups received the following: Parents were told how their children had to take isoniazid and given informative leaflets regarding tuberculosis and its prevention. They were also informed what symptoms to look for and to see the doctor if they suspected the existence of any of these symptoms or if they considered it advisable.</P>
<P>For all the groups, the final visit consisted of medical history and examination, a chest X-ray and the performance of the Eidus-Hamilton reaction.</P>

<B>Control: </B>After the usual care during the first session, participants received no further contact with study personnel while in jail.</P>
<P>All study participants in the intervention groups received from a research assistant a one-to-one session of education in English or Spanish based on Centres for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines focusing on LTBI (Latent Tuberculosis Infection: Where the person is infected with <I>M. tuberculosis</I> but does not feel sick and has no symptoms) therapy, adverse effects, availability of free care after release, and location of, transportation to, and hours of the tuberculosis clinic. The session emphasised that completing therapy could eliminate future risk of tuberculosis infection and ensured understanding of the messages. After this, the jail pharmacy personnel prepared a one-month supply of isoniazid to be given to the inmate at release.</P>
