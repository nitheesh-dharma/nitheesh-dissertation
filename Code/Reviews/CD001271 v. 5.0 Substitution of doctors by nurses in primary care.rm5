<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-30 12:44:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Paulsen">
<P>Many countries have sought to shift the provision of primary care from doctors to nurses in order to reduce the demand for doctors and improve healthcare efficiency. The expectation is that nurses working as substitutes can provide as high quality care as doctors at lower cost. This review found that quality of care is similar for nurses and doctors but it is not known if it decreases the doctor's workload. Nurses tend to provide more health advice and achieve higher levels of patient satisfaction compared with doctors. Even though using nurses may save salary costs, nurses may order more tests and use other services which may decrease the cost savings of using nurses instead of doctors.</P>
<P>The searches for this review were conducted in 2002. The review findings are therefore out-of-date and should be used with caution. The review is currently being updated and the updated version should be published before the end of 2014.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2014-04-30 12:49:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Paulsen">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Demand for primary care services has increased in developed countries due to population ageing, rising patient expectations, and reforms that shift care from hospitals to the community. At the same time, the supply of physicians is constrained and there is increasing pressure to contain costs. Shifting care from physicians to nurses is one possible response to these challenges. The expectation is that nurse-doctor substitution will reduce cost and physician workload while maintaining quality of care. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Our aim was to evaluate the impact of doctor-nurse substitution in primary care on patient outcomes, process of care, and resource utilisation including cost. Patient outcomes included: morbidity; mortality; satisfaction; compliance; and preference. Process of care outcomes included: practitioner adherence to clinical guidelines; standards or quality of care; and practitioner health care activity (e.g. provision of advice). Resource utilisation was assessed by: frequency and length of consultations; return visits; prescriptions; tests and investigations; referral to other services; and direct or indirect costs.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-04-30 12:49:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Paulsen">
<P>The following databases were searched for the period 1966 to 2002: Medline; Cinahl; Bids, Embase; Social Science Citation Index; British Nursing Index; HMIC; EPOC Register; and Cochrane Controlled Trial Register. Search terms specified the setting (primary care), professional (nurse), study design (randomised controlled trial, controlled before-and-after-study, interrupted time series), and subject (e.g. skill mix).</P>
<P>The searches for this review were conducted in 2002 and are now out-of-date and therefore the review findings should be used with caution. The review is currently being updated and the updated version should be published before the end of 2014.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included if nurses were compared to doctors providing a similar primary health care service (excluding accident and emergency services). Primary care doctors included: general practitioners, family physicians, paediatricians, general internists or geriatricians. Primary care nurses included: practice nurses, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, or advanced practice nurses.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study selection and data extraction was conducted independently by two reviewers with differences resolved through discussion. Meta-analysis was applied to outcomes for which there was adequate reporting of intervention effects from at least three randomised controlled trials. Semi-quantitative methods were used to synthesize other outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>4253 articles were screened of which 25 articles, relating to 16 studies, met our inclusion criteria. In seven studies the nurse assumed responsibility for first contact and ongoing care for all presenting patients. The outcomes investigated varied across studies so limiting the opportunity for data synthesis. In general, no appreciable differences were found between doctors and nurses in health outcomes for patients, process of care, resource utilisation or cost. </P>
<P>In five studies the nurse assumed responsibility for first contact care for patients wanting urgent consultations during office hours or out-of-hours. Patient health outcomes were similar for nurses and doctors but patient satisfaction was higher with nurse-led care. Nurses tended to provide longer consultations, give more information to patients and recall patients more frequently than did doctors. The impact on physician workload and direct cost of care was variable. </P>
<P>In four studies the nurse took responsibility for the ongoing management of patients with particular chronic conditions. The outcomes investigated varied across studies so limiting the opportunity for data synthesis. In general, no appreciable differences were found between doctors and nurses in health outcomes for patients, process of care, resource utilisation or cost. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The findings suggest that appropriately trained nurses can produce as high quality care as primary care doctors and achieve as good health outcomes for patients. However, this conclusion should be viewed with caution given that only one study was powered to assess equivalence of care, many studies had methodological limitations, and patient follow-up was generally 12 months or less. </P>
<P>While doctor-nurse substitution has the potential to reduce doctors' workload and direct healthcare costs, achieving such reductions depends on the particular context of care. Doctors' workload may remain unchanged either because nurses are deployed to meet previously unmet patient need or because nurses generate demand for care where previously there was none. Savings in cost depend on the magnitude of the salary differential between doctors and nurses, and may be offset by the lower productivity of nurses compared to doctors.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Demand for primary care services has increased in many countries due to population ageing, rising patient expectations, and reforms that shift care from hospitals to the community. At the same time, the supply of physicians is constrained and there is increasing pressure to contain costs. Shifting care from doctors to nurses, is one possible response to these challenges (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins_x002d_Clarke-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins-Clarke 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitecross-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitecross 1999</LINK>). A review of research into the substitutability of nurses for doctors suggested that 25% to 70% of the work undertaken by doctors might be moved to nurses (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1998</LINK>). In primary care, nurses may undertake much of the health promotion work of family practice (<LINK REF="REF-Family-HSG-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Family HSG 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muir-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muir 1995</LINK>), and play a leading role in the routine management of chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes and coronary heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Aubert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aubert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Charlton-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charlton 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirkman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkman 1994</LINK>). The expectation is that primary care nurses working in extended roles can:<BR/>a)enhance the quality of services provided by doctors;<BR/>b)safely substitute for doctors in an wide array of services, so reducing demand for doctors; and <BR/>c)reduce the direct costs of services because nurse are cheaper to hire than physicians. </P>
<P>Nurses may work either as doctor supplements or as doctor substitutes. Nurses working as doctor supplements provide services which complement or extend those provided by doctors. The aim is to improve the quality of care and extend the range of services available to patients. In contrast, nurses working as doctor substitutes provide services which otherwise would be provided by doctors alone. The aim is to reduce the demand for doctors. Gains in service efficiency may be achieved if doctors give up providing the services they have delegated to nurses, and instead invest their time in activities that only doctors can perform (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1999</LINK>). This review is focused on the impact of nurses working as substitutes for primary care doctors.</P>
<P>Previous systematic reviews of doctor-nurse substitution in primary care have sought to identify whether nurses differ from doctors in terms of patient outcomes, process of care or resource utilisation. In 1995, Brown and Grimes conducted a meta-analysis of American and Canadian research into doctor-nurse substitution in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1995</LINK>). Thirty-eight studies were included in the review, covering a wide range of nursing roles and encompassing both (quasi) experimental and observational research designs. The findings suggested that, as compared with doctor-led care, nurse-led care was associated with higher levels of patient compliance and satisfaction, longer consultations, and higher rates of laboratory testing. Health outcomes for patients were similar. These findings are supported by the more recent systematic review of Horrocks et al in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Horrocks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horrocks 2002</LINK>). They included 11 randomised controlled trials and 23 prospective observational studies of nurses acting as doctor substitutes for patients with undifferentiated healthcare problems in primary care settings in developed countries. The findings suggested that patient health care outcomes were similar for doctors and nurses, but that nurse-led care was associated with higher levels of patient satisfaction, longer consultations and higher rates of investigation. </P>
<P>Both reviews are flawed in their inclusion of observational research which is susceptible to producing biased estimates of differences between doctors and nurses through failure to control for other factors that may affect outcome. In addition, by combining a diversity of nurse roles, it remains unclear whether the observed differences or similarities between nurses and doctors vary with the particular type of role substitution. We aimed to address these deficiencies.</P>

<P>Three types of study were eligible for inclusion:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Randomised controlled trials (RCT): Random or quasi-random allocation of subjects to intervention and control groups.</LI>
<LI>Controlled before and after studies (CBA): the intervention group is compared with a control group selected by non-random processes. Outcomes must be measured before as well as after the intervention.</LI>
<LI>Interrupted time series (ITS). Longitudinal examination of outcomes with at least three observations before and again after the intervention.</LI>
</UL>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<UL>
<LI>Doctors - primary care physicians which could include general practitioners, family doctors, paediatricians, general internists or geriatricians.</LI>
<LI>Nurses - any qualified nurse working as a substitute to a primary care physician. This could include: nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, advanced practice nurses, practice nurses, health visitors, etc. As the job title, education, and experience of nurses varies considerably among and within countries, we did not select nurses by virtue of their job title. Only trainee nurses and mental health nurses were excluded.</LI>
<LI>Patients - presenting in primary care, excluding accident and emergency.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The review is limited to primary health care services that provide first contact and ongoing care for patients with all types of health problems. It includes family practice or general practice, outpatient settings, and ambulatory primary care settings (excluding accident and emergency). </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Our focus was on nurses working as substitutes for primary care doctors. Substitution refers to the situation where task(s) formerly performed by one type of professional (i.e. doctor) are transferred to a different type of professional (i.e. nurse), usually with the intention of reducing cost or addressing workforce shortages. Substitution studies typically examine the case where a nurse is responsible for providing the same health care as a doctor, and the performance of these two practitioners is compared. For example, a nurse-led clinic for a particular disease or condition is compared to a doctor-led clinic. </P>
<P>Supplementation refers to the situation where a nurse supplements or extends the care of the doctor by providing a new primary care service. The aim is generally to improve the quality of care rather than reduce cost or address workforce shortages. Supplementation studies typically compare usual care by a doctor to an innovative service provided by a nurse working alongside a doctor. For example, a family practice with a nurse-led diabetes clinic is compared to a family practice without such a clinic. This type of study risks confounding two aspects of care provision: <BR/>a)type of service (specialised clinic vs routine consultation), and <BR/>b)who provides that service (doctor or nurse) <BR/>Supplementation studies have been excluded from this review.</P>
<P>Some studies investigated complex interventions where practitioner care was combined with other interventions. Where a factorial study design was employed, the nurse can be compared with the doctor independently of other interventions. In such cases, we report only the effect attributable to the nurse compared with the doctor.</P>

<P>Each potentially relevant study was independently assessed for inclusion in the review by two reviewers. Differences between the reviewers were resolved by discussion. Excluded studies along with the reasons for their exclusion are given below (See Reference list, excluded studies). A data extraction form based on the standard EPOC checklist was designed for this review (See Group Details). Data from each included study were extracted independently by two reviewers. Differences were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>If a single publication reported two or more separate studies, then each study was extracted separately. If the findings of a single study were spread across two or more publications, then the publications were extracted as one. For each study with more than one control or comparison group for the nurse intervention, we report only the results for the control condition in which doctors provided the same intervention as the nurse.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>Studies were grouped by nurse role for analysis, as follows:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>First contact and ongoing care for undifferentiated patients.</LI>
<LI>First contact care for patients wanting urgent attention during office hours or out-of-hours.</LI>
<LI>Routine management of patients with chronic conditions.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>For each group, meta-analysis was applied to outcomes for which there was adequate reporting of intervention effects from at least three randomised controlled trials. We excluded non-randomised studies from meta-analysis due to their inherently greater potential for bias, and we excluded outcomes for which less than three randomised controlled trials were available on the grounds that a meta-analysis would not add substantial value to a semi-quantitative examination. Outcomes not amenable to meta-analysis were subjected to semi-quantitative synthesis. All results reported below are statistically significant unless otherwise stated.</P>
<P>A fixed-effects (FE) model was used for all meta-analyses. A general recommendation is that, when there is evidence of substantial heterogeneity between study results, a Random Effects (RE) model should also be applied (<LINK REF="REF-Petitti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petitti 2001</LINK>). Despite significant heterogeneity, we decided against the use of RE models for two main reasons: (i) we had very small numbers of studies in each analysis - three at most; and (ii) we had no basis for assuming that effect sizes are normally distributed. These factors can result in RE estimates of overall effect and confidence intervals that are quite inaccurate (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Biggerstaff-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biggerstaff 1997</LINK>
<B>; </B>
<LINK REF="REF-Maas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maas 2004</LINK>) and, in our view, the risk of drawing an inappropriate conclusion from the analysis was too large to justify the use of RE models. In contrast, the FE model is known to provide accurate estimates of the average effect (and confidence interval) within the included studies even when the number of studies is small(<LINK REF="REF-Brockwell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brockwell 2001</LINK>), but does not provide a statistical basis for generalising beyond the studies in hand (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1987</LINK>).</P>

Prescribing rate was investigated in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kinnersley-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnersley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shum 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venning-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Venning 2000</LINK>); five outcomes were measured of which one showed a lower rate for nurses and the remainder showed no difference. Meta-analysis of these three studies suggested there was no significant difference between doctors and nurses in prescribing rates (relative risk nurse will prescribe compared to doctor = 1.00, 95% confidence limit: 0.96, 1.05) (See Comparison 01.04). Tests and investigations were examined in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kinnersley-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnersley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venning-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Venning 2000</LINK>); two outcomes were measured of which one showed a higher rate for nurses. Use of other services was investigated in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kinnersley-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnersley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myers-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Myers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shum 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venning-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Venning 2000</LINK>); nine outcomes were measured and none showed a significant difference between nurses and doctors.

Doctors' workload was assessed in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>); three outcomes were assessed, all of which showed a reduction in doctors' workload with nurse-led care (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Costs were assessed in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venning-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Venning 2000</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>) showed a net reduction in direct costs with nurse-led care while the other (<LINK REF="STD-Venning-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Venning 2000</LINK>) found no difference (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>C. Routine management of patients with chronic conditions.<BR/>Patient outcomes were assessed in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIntosh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McIntosh 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1974</LINK>). Health status was assessed in all four studies; eight outcomes were measured of which one was significantly better with nurse-led care and seven showed no significant difference. Patient satisfaction was assessed in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1967</LINK>) and was found to be significantly higher with nurse-led care.

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The findings suggest that nurses and doctors generate similar health outcomes for patients, at least in the short-term, over the range of care investigated. This work included the provision of first contact and/or ongoing care for unselected patients and the management of patients with specific chronic conditions. The findings must be viewed with caution, however, given that only 1 study (in which nurses provided first contact care for patients wanting urgent attention out-of-hours) was powered to assess equivalence of care.</P>
<P>Patient satisfaction was higher when nurses, as opposed to doctors, provided first contact care for people wanting urgent attention. Patient satisfaction with chronic disease management was also found to higher with nurse-led care, although this was investigated in only one study. The reason for this difference is unclear and may relate to a number of factors. Nurses tended to have longer consultations than doctors, and patient satisfaction is higher with longer consultations (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2002</LINK>). Nurses also tended to provide more information to patients than did doctors which might also have enhanced satisfaction. </P>
<P>High satisfaction with nurse care did not, however, mean that patients inevitably preferred nurses to doctors. Patient preferences in most studies were mixed with some patients preferring to see nurses while others preferred to see doctors. Preference might partly relate to the nature of the presenting problem. Nurses may be preferred when the patient believes their problem to be 'minor' or 'routine' but doctors are preferred when the problem is thought to 'serious' or 'difficult' (<LINK REF="REF-Drury-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drury 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Productivity was lower when nurses, as opposed to doctors, provided first contact care for people wanting urgent attention. Nurses tended to have longer consultation lengths and higher rates of patient recall while achieving the same health outcomes as doctors. This might be a learning effect whereby nurse productivity would improve as nurses gained more experience in their role. However, two of the three studies which assessed productivity used experienced nurses (<LINK REF="STD-Kinnersley-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnersley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venning-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Venning 2000</LINK>) and only one (<LINK REF="STD-Shum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shum 2000</LINK>) did not. Moreover, no appreciable differences were found between doctors and nurses in other aspects of resource utilisation such as prescribing, use of tests or investigations, or referrals to other services. It therefore seems unlikely that the lower productivity of nurses as compared with doctors reflects their relative inexperience. </P>
<P>While no appreciable differences in resource use were found when nurses substituted for doctors in providing ongoing care for undifferentiated patients or those with particular chronic conditions, caseload (number of patients seen per unit of time) was not measured so productivity is unknown.</P>
<P>Only one of five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>) in which nurses provided first contact care for patients wanting urgent attention out-of-hours, demonstrated clear cost savings with nurse-led services. In all other studies - spanning all three of the nursing roles considered in this review - the lower salary costs of nurses were offset by their increased use of resources or lower productivity. As salary differentials between nurses and doctors may vary from place to place and over time, the net saving to health care services, if any, will be highly context dependent (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only 1 study investigated the impact of nurses on doctors' workload and this showed reductions in the demand for doctors (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>) in which nurses provided first contact care for patients wanting urgent attention out-of-hours). However, a recent controlled trial of adding nurses to doctors' teams showed no reduction in physician workload(<LINK REF="REF-Laurant-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laurant 2004</LINK>). This may be because nurses addressed previously unmet need or because nurses generated demand where previously there was none. In either case, the findings suggest that the addition of nurses to physician teams may not reduce workload unless active steps are taken to ensure doctors discontinue providing the services that have been transferred to nurses. Efficiency gains are possible if doctors invest this 'saved' time in activities that only doctors can perform (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is self-evident that nurses must be adequately trained to act as substitutes for doctors. There is, however, no agreement as to the level of training required for nurses to undertake the specific roles covered by this review, and no consistency in the qualifications nurses must have to merit job titles such as nurse practitioner. Few studies contained detailed information on the nature of nurses' training for the specific role under investigation, making it impossible for us to draw any conclusions as to whether or how training affects outcomes. All the studies included in this review adopted the position that the nurses they investigated were competent to carry out the clinical role assigned to them and, indeed, the evidence supports that assumption. Additional research is therefore needed to examine the relationship between training and outcome. </P>
<P>The limitations of this review need to be considered. Our search strategy was designed to maximise sensitivity (detection of relevant research) at the expense of specificity (excluding irrelevant research). Even so, relevant research proved difficult to identify and some papers may have been missed, particularly in the 'grey' literature that we did not search. Publication bias seems unlikely as the clinical and research communities are interested equally in whether nurses outperform doctors or the reverse. The inclusion of only English and Dutch language publications risks excluding potentially relevant work. We did, however, screen the English abstracts of papers published in other languages and found none that appeared relevant. Research into doctor-nurse substitution in primary care appears primarily to have been conducted in Canada, the USA and the UK which are English-speaking countries. </P>
<P>We restricted our meta-analyses to Fixed Effect (FE) models. The FE approach provides reliable estimates of the average effect (and confidence interval) across included studies, but findings cannot be generalised beyond these studies to the wider population of practitioners and practices. Therefore, where we have generalised beyond the studies in hand, this has been a qualitative judgement based on assessment of all the available evidence of which the meta-analysis is just one component. </P>
<P>Most studies included only small numbers of nurses and very few considered the potential for variation in outcomes by practitioner. This may have led to over precision in the estimates of differences between doctors and nurses. In addition, studies intended to demonstrate the comparability of nurse and doctor care need to be powered to assess the equivalence, not difference, of outcomes. This was done in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lattimer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lattimer 1998</LINK>). A final concern is the narrow range of nurse roles that has been subjected to rigorous evaluation. Nurses in many countries provide a far wider range of care than is represented in the current research literature. Nurse-doctor substitution in the management of patients with particular chronic diseases has been infrequently studied. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The findings suggest that appropriately trained nurses can produce as high quality care as primary care doctors and achieve as good health outcomes for patients. Indeed nurses providing first care for patients needing urgent attention tend to provide more health advice and achieve higher levels of patient satisfaction compared with doctors. </P>
<P>Nurse-doctor substitution has the potential to reduce doctors' workload. However this benefit will not be realised in practise if doctors continue to provide the types of care that have been transferred to nurses. Doctors' workload may remain unchanged either because there was previously unmet need that nurses now fulfil or because nurses generate demand for care where previously there was none.</P>
<P>Nurse-doctor substitution has the potential to reduce the direct costs of care. Cost savings are, however, highly dependent on salary differentials between doctors and nurses and these may vary across locations and over time. In addition, savings on nurse salaries may be offset by nurses' longer consultation length and increased rate of patient recall relative to doctors, leading to no overall savings on cost. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Cost, particularly societal cost, has not been well investigated despite the widely held view that nurse-led care will generate savings. Future studies of nurse-doctor substitution should give more attention to the financial aspects of care. Related to this is the question of what impact nurses have on doctor behaviour and workload. This has rarely been evaluated despite the widely held view that nurses can 'save' doctors' time.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of studies is variable. Future studies should seek to maximise the numbers of practitioners (particularly nurses), rather than numbers of patients, in order to reduce the effect of any individual practitioner on outcomes. Studies also need to adopt methods of statistical analysis that account for variation in outcomes between practitioners, to avoid over precision and an inflated risk of type 1 errors (false positive results). Studies intended to demonstrate the comparability of nurse and doctor care need to be powered to assess the equivalence, not difference, of outcomes. A final concern is the narrow range of nurse roles that has been subjected to rigorous evaluation. Nurses in many countries provide a far wider range of care than is represented in the current research literature. Related to this is the question of what levels of training and experience are required by nurses working as doctor substitutes. The characteristics of nurses and doctors (numbers, training, experience) need to be reported more often and more consistently in studies in order to shed light on this issue.</P>
