<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-11-17 21:16:10 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>If a pregnant woman's waters break without onset of contractions (prelabour rupture of membranes &#8211; PROM) at 37 weeks of pregnancy or more, there are two options: the first is for induction of labour so that the baby is born as soon as possible (planned early birth); or secondly, to wait for labour to start naturally (expectant management).</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>In a previous version of this review we found that planned early birth may reduce the risk of maternal infection without increasing the risk of caesarean section, compared with waiting. Fewer infants went to the neonatal intensive care unit with planned early birth, though there were no differences seen in rates of neonatal infection. While there are some benefits of early induction of labour, it is important to have a more complete picture of what happens with planned early birth compared with waiting for labour to start naturally.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>This review included data from 23 randomised controlled trials involving 8615 pregnant women at 37 weeks of pregnancy or more. Only three trials were at overall low risk of bias, and the evidence in the review was very low to moderate quality. For planned early birth, 10 trials used intravenous oxytocin for induction of labour, 12 trials used prostaglandins, and one trial each assessed <I>Caulophyllum</I> and acupuncture.</P>
<P>The findings showed that planned early birth for PROM at term reduced the risk of infection for pregnant women (including infection of the membranes surrounding the baby and the amniotic fluid (known as chorioamnionitis)) compared with expectant management (eight trials, 6864 women; this was rated <I>low-quality evidence</I>), Planned early birth also reduced the risk of definite or possible infections for the babies (16 trials, 7314 babies, <I>low-quality evidenc</I>e). However, no differences were seen in the rates of caesarean births (23 trials, 8576 women, <I>low-quality evidence</I>), serious illness or death for the women (three trials, 425 women, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>), definite infection for the babies (six trials, 1303 babies, <I>very</I> <I>low-quality evidence</I>), or death for the babies (eight trials, 6392 babies, <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>). Babies born after planned early birth were less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (eight trials, 6179 babies), and both women (two trials, 748 women) and their babies (four trials, 5691 babies) had a shorter stay in hospital after planned early birth. Women had a more positive experience of planned early birth compared with expectant management (two trials, 5134 women).</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Planned early birth (compared with expectant management) after PROM at term may help to reduce infection for women without increasing the need for a caesarean section, and neonatal infection may also be reduced. However, evidence about longer-term effects on children is needed.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-17 21:15:39 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Twenty-three trials involving 8615 women and their babies were included in the update of this review. Ten trials assessed intravenous oxytocin; 12 trials assessed prostaglandins (six trials in the form of vaginal prostaglandin E2 and six as oral, sublingual or vaginal misoprostol); and one trial each assessed <I>Caulophyllum</I> and acupuncture. Overall, three trials were judged to be at low risk of bias, while the other 20 were at unclear or high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Primary outcomes: women who had planned early birth were at a reduced risk of <B>maternal infectious morbidity (chorioamnionitis and/or endometritis)</B> than women who had expectant management following term prelabour rupture of membranes (average risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.72; eight trials, 6864 women; Tau = 0.19; I = 72%; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), and their neonates were less likely to have <B>definite or probable early-onset neonatal sepsis</B> (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.92; 16 trials, 7314 infants;<I> low-quality evidence</I>). No clear differences between the planned early birth and expectant management groups were seen for the risk of <B>caesarean section</B> (average RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.04; 23 trials, 8576 women; Tau = 0.10; I = 55%; <I>low-quality evidence</I>); <B>serious maternal morbidity or mortality</B> (no events; three trials; 425 women; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>); <B>definite early-onset neonatal sepsis </B>(RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.33; six trials, 1303 infants; <I>very</I> <I>low-quality evidence</I>); or <B>perinatal mortality</B> (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.66; eight trials, 6392 infants; <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>).
</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes: women who had a planned early birth were at a reduced risk of chorioamnionitis (average RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.82; eight trials, 6874 women; Tau = 0.19; I = 73%), and postpartum septicaemia (RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.96; three trials, 263 women), and their neonates were less likely to receive antibiotics (average RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.84; 10 trials, 6427 infants; Tau = 0.06; I = 32%). Women in the planned early birth group were more likely to have their labour induced (average RR 3.41; 95% CI 2.87 to 4.06; 12 trials, 6945 women; Tau = 0.05; I = 71%), had a shorter time from rupture of membranes to birth (mean difference (MD) -10.10 hours; 95% CI -12.15 to -8.06; nine trials, 1484 women; Tau = 5.81; I = 60%), and their neonates had lower birthweights (MD -79.25 g; 95% CI -124.96 to -33.55; five trials, 1043 infants). Women who had a planned early birth had a shorter length of hospitalisation (MD -0.79 days; 95% CI -1.20 to -0.38; two trials, 748 women; Tau = 0.05; I = 59%), and their neonates were less likely to be admitted to the neonatal special or intensive care unit (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.85; eight trials, 6179 infants), and had a shorter duration of hospital (-11.00 hours; 95% CI -21.96 to -0.04; one trial, 182 infants) or special or intensive care unit stay (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.85; four trials, 5691 infants). Women in the planned early birth group had more positive experiences compared with women in the expectant management group.</P>
<P>No clear differences between groups were observed for endometritis; postpartum pyrexia; postpartum antibiotic usage; caesarean for fetal distress; operative vaginal birth; uterine rupture; epidural analgesia; postpartum haemorrhage; adverse effects; cord prolapse; stillbirth; neonatal mortality; pneumonia; Apgar score less than seven at five minutes; use of mechanical ventilation; or abnormality on cerebral ultrasound (no events).</P>
<P>None of the trials reported on breastfeeding; postnatal depression; gestational age at birth; meningitis; respiratory distress syndrome; necrotising enterocolitis; neonatal encephalopathy; or disability at childhood follow-up.</P>
<P>In subgroup analyses, there were no clear patterns of differential effects for method of induction, parity, use of maternal antibiotic prophylaxis, or digital vaginal examination. Results of the sensitivity analyses based on trial quality were consistent with those of the main analysis, except for <B>definite or probable early-onset neonatal sepsis </B>where no clear difference was observed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-09 13:19:09 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is low quality evidence to suggest that planned early birth (with induction methods such as oxytocin or prostaglandins) reduces the risk of maternal infectious morbidity compared with expectant management for PROM at 37 weeks' gestation or later, without an apparent increased risk of caesarean section. Evidence was mainly downgraded due to the majority of studies contributing data having some serious design limitations, and for most outcomes estimates were imprecise.</P>
<P>Although the 23 included trials in this review involved a large number of women and babies, the quality of the trials and evidence was not high overall, and there was limited reporting for a number of important outcomes. Thus further evidence assessing the benefits or harms of planned early birth compared with expectant management, considering maternal, fetal, neonatal and longer-term childhood outcomes, and the use of health services, would be valuable. Any future trials should be adequately designed and powered to evaluate the effects on short- and long-term outcomes. Standardisation of outcomes and their definitions, including for the assessment of maternal and neonatal infection, would be beneficial.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-10-27 13:31:20 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) is defined as rupture of membranes (ROM) prior to the onset of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Duff-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duff 1998</LINK>). PROM most frequently occurs at term (37 weeks or more of gestation) (<LINK REF="REF-Duff-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duff 1998</LINK>), with the overall incidence of PROM at term being approximately 8% (<LINK REF="REF-Cammu-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cammu 1990</LINK>). Spontaneous onset of labour after term PROM usually follows within 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Cammu-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cammu 1990</LINK>), with 79% of women labouring spontaneously within 12 hours, and 95% within 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Conway-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zlatnik-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zlatnik 1992</LINK>). Even when the state of the cervix is unfavourable, the majority of women labour spontaneously within 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 1998</LINK>). However, if the woman does not labour within 24 hours, labour may be delayed up to seven days after membrane rupture (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 1998</LINK>), with longer latent periods in nulliparous women (<LINK REF="REF-Zlatnik-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zlatnik 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>PROM at term is known to be associated with overdistension of the uterus due to multiple pregnancy or polyhydramnios (abnormally high levels of amniotic fluid), cigarette smoking, altered mechanical properties of the amniotic membranes, frequent digital examinations, coitus and infection (<LINK REF="REF-Duff-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duff 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hannah-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 1998</LINK>), although it is not clear if these are causally related to PROM (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-17 21:16:56 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>PROM at term may be managed expectantly or by elective birth, usually by induction of labour. Planned elective early birth is usually termed active or planned early birth. Expectant management involves waiting for labour to occur and then making management decisions (such as inducing labour) if labour does not happen spontaneously after a specified period. 
</P>
<P>PROM may result in immediate risks such as cord prolapse, cord compression and placental abruption; and later problems including maternal or neonatal infection, as well as the use of interventions such as caesarean section and instrumental vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kong-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kong 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merenstein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merenstein 1996</LINK>). Expectant management of term PROM has been associated with maternal infections including chorioamnionitis (inflammation of the membranes) or endometritis (generally a postpartum infection). These infections may result in neonatal infection and mortality, chronic lung disease and cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Cammu-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cammu 1990</LINK>
<I>; </I>
<LINK REF="REF-Gonen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonen 1989</LINK>

Some reports have suggested that the risk of maternal and fetal infection increases proportionally with the time between membrane rupture and birth (<LINK REF="REF-Gafni-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gafni 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zlatnik-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zlatnik 1992</LINK>), while others refute this (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seaward-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seaward 1997</LINK>). Whether or not to induce labour may depend on the state of the cervix, with an insufficiently ripe cervix resulting in increased length of labour and failed induction requiring caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Cammu-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cammu 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duff-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duff 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duff-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duff 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yawn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yawn 2001</LINK>)<I>. </I>Uterine rupture has been reported, but only rarely.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-15 16:33:22 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are conflicting conclusions from literature reviews assessing PROM at term. <LINK REF="REF-Hallak-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallak 1999</LINK> found that with a longer interval from admission to the onset of labour, there is an increased incidence of neonatal intensive care unit admission, caesarean section and more frequent maternal diarrhoea and use of analgesia or anaesthesia. Induction of labour is supported by a retrospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1981</LINK>), which reported increased perinatal mortality and intrapartum fever in women at term when there was delay of more than 72 hours between PROM and birth. Oxytocin infusion was recommended as the gold standard management of PROM at term in a review (<LINK REF="REF-Crane-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crane 2003</LINK>). These results are in contrast to the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Guise-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guise 1992</LINK>, who reported that induction of labour results in increased frequency of chorioamnionitis, neonatal sepsis, caesarean section and longer duration of hospitalisation. <LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 1997</LINK> highlighted the risks and benefits of induction of labour, with reduced rates of chorioamnionitis, endometritis and neonatal infection, and an increased rate of caesarean section. Induction of labour for women with PROM at term may incur fewer costs than expectant management (<LINK REF="REF-Gafni-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gafni 1997</LINK>). Women may be more satisfied with care when there is a short time between PROM and birth (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 1999</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-09 13:21:25 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review updates a previously published Cochrane review on planned early birth versus expectant management (waiting) for PROM at term (<LINK REF="REF-Dare-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dare 2006</LINK>), which included 12 randomised controlled trials, and found that planned early birth may reduce the risk of maternal infectious morbidity without increasing the risk of caesarean section or operative vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-Dare-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dare 2006</LINK>). The review found that fewer infants went to the neonatal intensive care unit with planned early birth, though no clear differences were seen in neonatal infection rates (<LINK REF="REF-Dare-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dare 2006</LINK>). It was concluded that while there may be some benefits of planned early birth, since the differences in outcomes may not be substantial, women need to be able to access the appropriate information to make an informed choice, and further research is required to assess outcomes such as maternal satisfaction, maternal and neonatal infectious morbidity and longer-term child development/disability (<LINK REF="REF-Dare-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dare 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another Cochrane review has evaluated the management of women with preterm PROM between 24 and 37 weeks' gestation and found insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice, with methodological weaknesses in the clinical trials conducted to date (<LINK REF="REF-Buchanan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchanan 2010</LINK>). Our review focuses on women with PROM at term (37 weeks' gestation or later).</P>

<P>For an intervention to be considered 'planned early birth', a decision must have been made to expedite birth after PROM through some form of induction of labour or by caesarean section. The planned intervention must have been implemented (or was intended to be implemented) within 24 hours of randomisation.</P>

<P>For this update, we evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A>. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for specific outcomes. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or publication bias.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-11-17 21:22:05 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001807.pub2/full#CD001807-bbs2-0031">RevMan 2014</A>).

<P>Where there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or where substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary has been treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we have discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we planned to not combine trials.

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-04-20 18:41:59 +0930" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where we identified substantial heterogeneity, we investigated it using subgroup and sensitivity analyses. We considered whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, we used random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>We carried out the following subgroup analyses.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Method of induction of labour (e.g. intravenous oxytocin versus vaginal prostaglandin).</LI>
<LI>Parity (e.g. multiparous women versus nulliparous women).</LI>
<LI>Cervical status at baseline (e.g. women with an unfavourable cervix versus women with a favourable cervix).</LI>
<LI>Maternal antibiotic prophylaxis for PROM (e.g. antibiotic prophylaxis versus no antibiotic prophylaxis).</LI>
<LI>Digital vaginal examination at baseline (e.g. women who had digital vaginal examination versus women who did not have vaginal examination).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The rationale for these subgroup analyses was as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>(1) Method of induction of labour - some studies have found differences between various methods (such as oxytocin and prostaglandin) and any such differences would be expected to be operating in women with PROM at term.</LI>
<LI>(2) and (3) Differences in outcomes according to parity and state of cervix would be expected - for example, nulliparous women and those with an unfavourable cervix are likely to have longer labours and this in turn may increase the risk of infection of infection and other adverse outcomes.</LI>
<LI>(4) Maternal antibiotic prophylaxis for PROM may be more likely to reduce maternal and neonatal infection than no maternal antibiotic prophylaxis.</LI>

<P>There was variable reporting for this review's primary outcome of maternal infectious morbidity (chorioamnionitis and/or endometritis).</P>
<P>When we included only those trials reporting specifically on outcomes termed 'chorioamnionitis' or 'endometritis' a clear reduction was observed for the planned early birth group compared with the expectant management group (average risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.72; eight trials, 6864 women; Tau = 0.19; I = 72%, <I>low-quality evidence</I>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

While the subgroup interaction test indicated a possible effect of mode of induction on this outcome (Chi = 12.83, P = 0.005, I = 76.6%), all subgroups (oral misoprostol; sublingual misoprostol; vaginal prostaglandin E2; intravenous oxytocin) showed effects in favour of planned early birth, although a clear reduction in maternal infectious morbidity was seen only for the sublingual misoprostol and intravenous oxytocin subgroups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The data contributing to the sublingual misoprostol subgroup were from only one trial, of 560 women at an overall unclear to high risk of bias; when these data were excluded from the meta-analysis, the subgroup interaction test was no longer significant. This may suggest that there were no important differences between various modes of induction on maternal infectious morbidity.</P>
<P>We also conducted a meta-analysis for this outcome including those trials that reported on intrapartum pyrexia and/or treatment with antibiotics for intrapartum pyrexia (<LINK REF="STD-Akyol-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Akyol 1999</LINK>: "Fever...during labour was defined as a temperature &gt; 37.5캜 on 2 occasions 2 1 hour apart or a temperature of &gt; 38캜."; <LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2006</LINK>: <I>"Pyrexia"</I>; <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1992</LINK>: <I>"fever (&gt; 37.5 "C) in the intrapartum period"</I>; <LINK REF="STD-Fatima-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fatima 2015</LINK>: <I>"Fever"</I>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmood-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmood 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mahmood-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmood 1995</LINK>: <I>"pyrexia if maternal temperature exceeded 37.5"C in labour"</I>).</P>

<P>We ran a funnel plot to assess the risk of reporting bias, such as publication bias, and we found that while studies were equally distributed on either side, there was some asymmetry, which could represent the presence of bias due to smaller studies (such as <LINK REF="STD-Ayaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ayaz 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sperling-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sperling 1993</LINK> (at unclear to high risk of bias) and <LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2006</LINK> (at low risk of bias)) producing exaggerated intervention effect estimates (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-17 22:02:53 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review included 23 randomised controlled trials (involving 8615 women and their babies; including the large <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK> trial of 5042 women) assessing planned early birth, compared with expectant management for prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) at term. On meta-analysis, we observed a reduction in the risk of maternal infectious morbidity (chorioamnionitis and/or endometritis) (eight trials, 6864 women) for women in the planned early birth group; the absolute risk reduction was 5.01% (from 11.02% (377/3422) in the expectant management group to 6.01% (207/3442) in the planned early birth group). We also observed a reduction in the risk of definite or probable early-onset neonatal sepsis (from 4.10% (149/3637) in the expectant management group to 2.99% (110/3677) in the planned early birth group. We did not observe any clear differences between the planned early birth and expectant management groups when considering the other primary outcomes of caesarean section, serious maternal morbidity or mortality (no events in the three trials reporting on this outcome), definite early-onset neonatal sepsis, or perinatal mortality (stillbirth and/or neonatal death).</P>
<P>Similarly, we did not observe clear differences between groups for many of the secondary review outcomes, including the maternal outcomes: endometritis; postpartum pyrexia; postpartum antibiotic usage; caesarean section for fetal distress; operative vaginal birth; uterine rupture; epidural analgesia; and postpartum haemorrhage; and the fetal/neonatal outcomes: cord prolapse; stillbirth; neonatal mortality; pneumonia; Apgar score less than seven at five minutes; use of mechanical ventilation; and abnormality on cerebral ultrasound.</P>
<P>We did, however, observe significant reductions with planned early birth in the risk of chorioamnionitis (either suspected or proven) (eight trials, 6874 women), postpartum septicaemia (three trials, 263 women), and neonatal antibiotic usage (10 trials, 6427 infants). In relation to the use of health services, women in the planned early birth group, compared with the expectant management group had a shorter length of hospitalisation, of 0.79 days on average (two trials, 748 women); their neonates also were less likely to be admitted to the neonatal special or intensive care unit (eight trials, 6179 infants), and were more likely to have a shorter neonatal stay in hospital of 11 hours on average (one trial, 182 infants), and a shorter stay in the special or intensive care unit (four trials, 5691 infants).</P>
<P>Women who had a planned early birth also viewed their care more favourably in two trials (93 women (<LINK REF="STD-Selmer_x002d_Olsen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Selmer-Olsen 2007</LINK>); and 5041 women (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>)). In <LINK REF="STD-Selmer_x002d_Olsen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Selmer-Olsen 2007</LINK>, women rated their PROM management more positively in the planned early birth group; in <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>, fewer women in the planned early birth group disliked aspects of their management. While these findings are from single studies, they are valuable (particularly the results from <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>, which was a large, high-quality trial), and contribute to the understanding of women's preferences.</P>
<P>As may have been expected, women in the planned early birth group were over three times more likely to have their labour induced (12 trials, 6945 women) and had a shorter duration of rupture of membranes (ROM) to birth, on average of 10 hours (nine trials, 1484 women). Babies born to women in the planned early birth group weighed, on average, 79 g less (five trials 1043 infants).</P>
<P>No information was available from the 23 included trials on the maternal outcomes: breastfeeding and postnatal depression; and fetal/neonatal outcomes: gestational age at birth; meningitis; respiratory distress syndrome; necrotising enterocolitis; neonatal encephalopathy. No trial reported on disability at childhood follow-up.</P>
<P>There was substantial heterogeneity for some outcomes. The subgroup analyses (based on initial method of induction, parity, cervical status, antibiotic prophylaxis, digital vaginal examination) and sensitivity analyses (based on trial quality) performed in this review, however largely revealed no clear differential treatment effects according to characteristics of the women or trials. The different methods of outcome measurement and definitions, particularly for review outcomes relating to maternal and neonatal infection, also likely contributed to the heterogeneity observed.</P>
<P>Considering the mode of induction of labour, no clear subgroup differences were seen for definite early-onset neonatal sepsis, definite or probable early-onset neonatal sepsis or perinatal mortality, and we could not conduct a subgroup analysis for serious maternal morbidity or mortality (with no events occurring). While the subgroup analyses for maternal infectious morbidity and caesarean section suggested possible differential treatment effects (for maternal infectious morbidity: with a significant benefit seen only for the intravenous oxytocin and sublingual misoprostol subgroups; and for caesarean section: with a significant reduction seen for the sublingual misoprostol subgroup), no clear conclusions can be based on these data; the sublingual misoprostol subgroup included data from only one trial (560 women; unclear to high risk of bias) (<LINK REF="STD-Maqbool-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Maqbool 2014</LINK>), and when this subgroup was removed from the analyses, the interaction tests were no longer significant. Considering the subgroup analyses based on parity, cervical status, maternal antibiotic prophylaxis and digital vaginal examination, largely no differential effects were observed for any of the primary outcomes. Where we did observe possible differential effects (interaction tests were significant), these were mostly not sustained when the mixed/unclear subgroups were removed from analyses; thus the poor reporting or limited methodological detail provided by many of the included studies limited our ability to assess subgroup effects.</P>
<P>The sensitivity analyses, including only those high-quality trials (judged at low risk of selection and detection bias) (including only three trials: <LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>) revealed similar findings to the main analysis - a reduction in maternal infectious morbidity (chorioamnionitis and/or endometritis) with planned early birth, and no clear differences between groups for the other primary outcomes.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-11-17 22:03:48 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Although 23 trials were able to be included in this review, over 30 other studies were excluded, and some of these may have had relevant data. Most of these trials reported outcomes for women less than, as well as more than, 37 weeks' gestation at PROM and it was not possible to extract only the information relating to women 37 weeks' gestation or later at PROM; nor were trial authors able to provide this information when it was requested from them. This strict inclusion criterion was applied because women at full term may represent a different clinical group than women with PROM at less than 37 weeks' gestation (which is the topic of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Buchanan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchanan 2010</LINK>)).</P>
<P>Many important outcomes were not assessed at all by the included trials (including breastfeeding; postnatal depression; gestational age at birth; meningitis; respiratory distress syndrome; necrotising enterocolitis; neonatal encephalopathy; and disability at childhood follow-up). While all 23 included trials reported on caesarean section, many did not report on the other primary outcomes (for example, with only three trials reporting on serious maternal morbidity or mortality), and for a number of secondary outcomes (such as endometritis; uterine rupture; views of care; neonatal pneumonia; use of mechanical ventilation; and abnormality on cerebral ultrasound), only one or two trials contributed outcome data for the meta-analyses.</P>

<P>The methodological quality of the 23 trials included in this review was low to moderate; overall, most of the trials were judged to be at unclear risk of bias. We were only able to include three 'high-quality' trials in our sensitivity analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>). Only four of the 23 trials were judged to be at low risk of selection bias (with adequate methods used to generate the random sequence and conceal allocation) (<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krupa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Krupa 2005</LINK>). The potential for performance bias was common across the included trials, due to the nature of the intervention. All trials were judged to be at high risk of performance bias, with the exception of three, which used a placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Beer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1992</LINK>). Eight of the trials were judged to be low risk of detection bias, with blinding of outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Akyol-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Akyol 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmood-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmood 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Natale-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Natale 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sperling-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sperling 1993</LINK>). Very few trials reported clearly on losses to follow-up or missing data (with only eight judged to be low risk of attrition bias (<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fatima-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fatima 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krupa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Krupa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmood-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmood 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milasinovic-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Milasinovic 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selmer_x002d_Olsen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Selmer-Olsen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2012</LINK>)), and only fives trials were considered to be at low risk of reporting bias (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krupa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Krupa 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmood-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmood 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmood-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmood 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shalev-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shalev 1995</LINK>). In many cases, poor reporting (and limited methodological detail provided) in the included trials led to 'unclear' judgements across one or more of the seven pre-specified domains for assessing risk of bias.</P>
<P>GRADE profiler was used to assess the quality of the evidence for our primary outcomes. The evidence was of <I>moderate quality</I> for perinatal mortality, <I>low quality</I> for maternal infectious morbidity, caesarean section and definite or probable early-onset neonatal sepsis; and of <I>very low quality</I> for definite early-onset neonatal sepsis and serious maternal morbidity or mortality. Evidence was mainly downgraded due to the majority of studies contributing data having some serious or very serious design limitations, and for most outcomes estimates were imprecise (<I>see </I>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-12-09 16:26:41 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We were aware of the possibility of introducing bias through the review process, and thus tried to minimise bias in a number of ways. Two review authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias. As we included only those trials with reported data for women at 37 weeks' gestation or later at PROM, the evidence we have presented may not represent the total available evidence (given that some trials have been excluded based on also including women at earlier gestations at PROM). However, we developed and applied a priori criteria to enable us to select trials for inclusion in a consistent manner, and all trial selection and assessment steps were performed by two review authors to maximise consistency of judgement.</P>
<P>To reduce the potential for publication bias, we conducted a detailed, systematic search process without language or publication status restrictions. It is possible that additional trials comparing planned early birth versus expectant management for PROM at term have been published but not identified. It is also possible that there are other studies that have been conducted but are not yet published. Should any such studies be identified, we will include them in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>We explored the potential for publication bias using funnel plots for the review's primary outcomes maternal infectious morbidity, caesarean section and definite or probable early-onset neonatal sepsis, and secondary outcomes, chorioamnionitis and/or pyrexia, caesarean section for fetal distress, induction of labour, operative vaginal birth, time from ROM to birth, neonatal antibiotic usage and Apgar score less than seven at five minutes. While there was no clear indication of publication bias, there was some asymmetry, possibly associated with small-study effects (i.e. with small studies of low methodological quality producing exaggerated intervention effect estimates) for three outcomes (maternal infectious morbidity, chorioamnionitis, and neonatal antibiotic usage).</P>

<LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 2009</LINK>, has assessed the evidence supporting different indications for induction, including for PROM at term, and identified three systematic reviews (including the previous version of this review, <LINK REF="REF-Dare-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dare 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 1997</LINK>). Two reviews compared early birth (such as with oxytocin, prostaglandin E2 or <I>Caulophyllum</I>) with conservative management (<LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 1997</LINK>: 23 trials, 7493 women; <LINK REF="REF-Dare-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dare 2006</LINK>: 12 trials, 6814 women), and the third assessed misoprostol for induction following PROM at term (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2005</LINK>: six trials, 452 women). <LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 2009</LINK> concluded, based on these three reviews, that <I>"Expedited induction of labour after PROM reduces chorioamnionitis, endometritis, and admissions to a neonatal intensive care unit. Quality of evidence: high, grade of recommendation for induction of labour: strong". </I>While the general findings of the <LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 2009</LINK> 'best evidence' review are similar to those of our review, the assessments of the quality of the evidence vary. In <LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 2009</LINK>, while the GRADE system was also used, it appears that it was applied differently (i.e. across all outcomes in the three reviews) "<I>In evaluating the strength of the evidence for each indication for induction, we adhered to the GRADE system that classifies the overall quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, and very low"</I>; <LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 2009</LINK> then assigned one of four categories to the evidence: 'net benefits', 'trade-offs', 'uncertain trade-offs' or 'net harm'; and subsequently classified a recommendation as 'strong' where the quality of the evidence was considered high, and there was a 'net benefit' for induction of labour.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Mishanina-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishanina 2014</LINK> conducted a broader review of whether the number of caesarean births were higher with induction of labour compared with expectant management and found that overall the number of caesarean births at term were lower when labour was induced (this included women with and without PROM).</P>
<P>A number of other current Cochrane reviews are of relevance to our review.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<LINK REF="REF-Buchanan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchanan 2010</LINK> assessed planned early birth compared with expectant management for women with preterm PROM. While this review showed no clear differences between groups for neonatal sepsis and perinatal mortality, increases in endometritis and caesarean birth with planned early birth were observed (<LINK REF="REF-Buchanan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchanan 2010</LINK>). The review, however, included only seven trials (690 women), all with methodological weaknesses, and concluded that there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice on the benefits and harms of planned early birth compared with expectant management for women with preterm PROM (<LINK REF="REF-Buchanan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchanan 2010</LINK>). The next update of this review will consider the large PPROMT trial of 1839 women (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2016</LINK>), which has recently shown expectant management to be a more optimal strategy than immediate birth in women with ruptured membranes close to term.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glmezoglu 2012</LINK> assessed induction of labour compared with expectant management for women at or beyond term. This review, including 22 trials (9383 women) showed reductions in perinatal mortality and caesarean section birth with induction of labour (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glmezoglu 2012</LINK>). These benefits were however predominately associated with post-term induction (41 weeks' gestation or later), and the review concluded that as the absolute risk of perinatal mortality is small, women should be appropriately counselled in order to make an informed choice between being scheduled for induction post-term or monitored without induction (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glmezoglu 2012</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="REF-Wojcieszek-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wojcieszek 2014</LINK> assessed the routine use of antibiotics for PROM at or near term. This review, including four trials (2639 women), similarly identified no differences in neonatal sepsis and perinatal mortality. In contrast to our review, <LINK REF="REF-Wojcieszek-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wojcieszek 2014</LINK> did not show a difference in maternal infectious morbidity, and an increase in caesarean section with the use of antibiotics was observed (which was largely attributed to one study of 1640 women, in which repeat caesarean section, increased baseline hypertension and pre-eclampsia were more common in the antibiotic group, despite randomisation processes) (<LINK REF="REF-Wojcieszek-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wojcieszek 2014</LINK>). The review concluded that there is no convincing evidence of benefit for mothers or neonates from the routine use of antibiotics for PROM at or near term (<LINK REF="REF-Wojcieszek-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wojcieszek 2014</LINK>).</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-12-09 13:26:16 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is low-quality evidence to suggest that planned early birth (with induction methods such as oxytocin or prostaglandins) reduces the risk of maternal infectious morbidity (chorioamnionitis and/or endometritis) and definite or probable neonatal sepsis compared with expectant management for prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) at 37 weeks' gestation or later, without increasing the risk of caesarean birth. Very low- to moderate-quality evidence suggests no clear differences between planned early birth and expectant management for serious maternal morbidity or mortality, perinatal mortality and definite neonatal sepsis. Women should be appropriately counselled in order to make an informed choice between planned early birth and expectant management for PROM at 37 weeks' gestation or later.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-17 22:05:39 +1030" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Although the 23 included trials in this review involved a large number of women and babies, the quality of the trials and evidence was not high overall, and there was very limited reporting of data for a number of important outcomes. Thus, further evidence assessing the benefits or harms of planned early birth compared with expectant management, considering maternal, fetal, neonatal and longer-term childhood outcomes, and the use of health services, would be valuable. Any future trials should be adequately designed (including appropriate randomisation processes and blinding of outcome assessment) and powered to evaluate the effects on short- and longer-term outcomes. Standardisation of outcomes and their definitions, including for the assessment of maternal and neonatal infection, would be beneficial.</P>

<B>Characteristics for planned subgroup analyses:</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Method of induction:</B> intravenous oxytocin.</P>

<P>There appears to be an inconsistency between the abstract and text. In the abstract it says, <I>"However, fewer infants under planned early birth went to neonatal intensive or special care compared with expectant management (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92)"</I>
</P>
<P>Then the main text of results states,<I> "Overall, there were fewer admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit or special care nursery for planned early birth compared with expectant management (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91; 5 trials, 5679 infants)."</I>
</P>
<P>Which relative risk and confidence interval are correct?</P>
