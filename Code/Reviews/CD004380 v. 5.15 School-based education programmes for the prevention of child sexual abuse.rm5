<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-04-09 02:08:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background and review question</B>
</P>
<P>School-based education programmes for the prevention of child sexual abuse have been implemented on a large scale in some countries. We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of these programmes in the following areas: (i) children's skills in protective behaviours; (ii) children's knowledge of child sexual abuse prevention concepts; (iii) children's retention of protective behaviours over time; (iv) children's retention of knowledge over time; (v) parental or child anxiety or fear as a result of programme participation; and (vi) disclosures of past or current child sexual abuse during or after programmes. The evidence is current to September 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review included 24 studies, conducted with a total of 5802 participants in primary (elementary) and secondary (high) schools in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, Spain, Taiwan, and Turkey. The duration of interventions ranged from a single 45-minute session to eight 20-minute sessions on consecutive days. Although a wide range of programmes were used, there were many common elements, including the teaching of safety rules, body ownership, private parts of the body, distinguishing types of touches and types of secrets, and who to tell. Programme delivery formats included film, video or DVD, theatrical plays, and multimedia presentations. Other resources used included songs, puppets, comics, and colouring books. Teaching methods used in delivery included rehearsal, practice, role-play, discussion, and feedback.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This review found evidence that school-based sexual abuse prevention programmes were effective in increasing participants' skills in protective behaviours and knowledge of sexual abuse prevention concepts (measured via questionnaires or vignettes). Knowledge gains (measured via questionnaires) were not significantly eroded one to six months after the intervention for either intervention or control groups. In terms of harm, there was no evidence that programmes increased or decreased children's anxiety or fear. No studies measured parental anxiety or fear. Children exposed to a child sexual abuse prevention programme had greater odds of disclosing their abuse than children who had not been exposed, however we were more uncertain about this effect when the analysis was adjusted to account for the grouping of participants in classes or schools. Studies have not yet adequately measured the long-term benefits of programmes in terms of reducing the incidence or prevalence (or both) of child sexual abuse in programme participants.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for all outcomes included in the meta-analyses (combining of data) was moderate. Study quality was compromised in about half of the included studies, due to suboptimal data collection methods for study outcomes and inappropriate data analysis.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-04 11:52:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Child sexual abuse is a significant global problem in both magnitude and sequelae. The most widely used primary prevention strategy has been the provision of school-based education programmes. Although programmes have been taught in schools since the 1980s, their effectiveness requires ongoing scrutiny.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-01-29 12:33:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To systematically assess evidence of the effectiveness of school-based education programmes for the prevention of child sexual abuse. Specifically, to assess whether: programmes are effective in improving students' protective behaviours and knowledge about sexual abuse prevention; behaviours and skills are retained over time; and participation results in disclosures of sexual abuse, produces harms, or both. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-02-17 09:54:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In September 2014, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and 11 other databases. We also searched two trials registers and screened the reference lists of previous reviews for additional trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-03-04 13:02:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, and quasi-RCTs of school-based education interventions for the prevention of child sexual abuse compared with another intervention or no intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-03-04 11:52:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We summarised data for six outcomes: protective behaviours; knowledge of sexual abuse or sexual abuse prevention concepts; retention of protective behaviours over time; retention of knowledge over time; harm; and disclosures of sexual abuse.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-09 12:16:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review that included 15 trials (up to August 2006). We identified 10 additional trials for the period to September 2014. We excluded one trial from the original review. Therefore, this update includes a total of 24 trials (5802 participants). We conducted several meta-analyses. More than half of the trials in each meta-analysis contained unit of analysis errors.</P>
<P>1. Meta-analysis of two trials (n = 102) evaluating protective behaviours favoured intervention (odds ratio (OR) 5.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98 to 16.51), with borderline low to moderate heterogeneity (Chi = 1.37, df = 1, P value = 0.24, I = 27%, Tau = 0.16). The results did not change when we made adjustments using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to correct errors made in studies where data were analysed without accounting for the clustering of students in classes or schools.</P>
<P>2. Meta-analysis of 18 trials (n = 4657) evaluating questionnaire-based knowledge favoured intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.78), but there was substantial heterogeneity (Chi = 104.76, df = 17, P value &lt; 0.00001, I = 84%, Tau = 0.10). The results did not change when adjusted for clustering (ICC: 0.1 SMD 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.81; ICC: 0.2 SMD 0.63, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.77).</P>
<P>3. Meta-analysis of 11 trials (n =1688) evaluating vignette-based knowledge favoured intervention (SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.65), but there was substantial heterogeneity (Chi = 34.25, df = 10, P value &lt; 0.0002, I = 71%, Tau = 0.08). The results did not change when adjusted for clustering (ICC: 0.1 SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.74; ICC: 0.2 SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.89).</P>
<P>4. We included four trials in the meta-analysis for retention of knowledge over time. The effect of intervention seemed to persist beyond the immediate assessment (SMD 0.78, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.17; I = 84%, Tau = 0.13, P value = 0.0003; n = 956) to six months (SMD 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.87; I = 25%; Tau = 0.01, P value = 0.26; n = 929). The results did not change when adjustments were made using ICCs.</P>
<P>5. We included three studies in the meta-analysis for adverse effects (harm) manifesting as child anxiety or fear. The results showed no increase or decrease in anxiety or fear in intervention participants (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.07; n = 795) and there was no heterogeneity (I = 0%, P value = 0.79; n=795). The results did not change when adjustments were made using ICCs.</P>
<P>6. We included three studies (n = 1788) in the meta-analysis for disclosure of previous or current sexual abuse. The results favoured intervention (OR 3.56, 95% CI 1.13 to 11.24), with no heterogeneity (I = 0%, P value = 0.84). However, adjusting for the effect of clustering had the effect of widening the confidence intervals around the OR (ICC: 0.1 OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 12.33; ICC: 0.2 OR 2.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 12.61).</P>
<P>Insufficient information was provided in the included studies to conduct planned subgroup analyses and there were insufficient studies to conduct meaningful analyses.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence for all outcomes included in the meta-analyses was moderate owing to unclear risk of selection bias across most studies, high or unclear risk of detection bias across over half of included studies, and high or unclear risk of attrition bias across most studies. The results should be interpreted cautiously.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-04 11:52:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this review show evidence of improvements in protective behaviours and knowledge among children exposed to school-based programmes, regardless of the type of programme. The results might have differed had the true ICCs or cluster-adjusted results been available. There is evidence that children's knowledge does not deteriorate over time, although this requires further research with longer-term follow-up. Programme participation does not generate increased or decreased child anxiety or fear, however there is a need for ongoing monitoring of both positive and negative short- and long-term effects. The results show that programme participation may increase the odds of disclosure, however there is a need for more programme evaluations to routinely collect such data. Further investigation of the moderators of programme effects is required along with longitudinal or data linkage studies that can assess actual prevention of child sexual abuse.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-04 12:03:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Child sexual abuse is a problem of considerable magnitude with short- and long-term repercussions for those victimised. There is no universal definition of child sexual abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Macdonald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macdonald 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trickett-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trickett 2006</LINK>). It is a term used to describe a range of experiences involving a child in unwanted, inappropriate, coercive, and unlawful sexual exploitation by an adult or older child. The World Health Organization (WHO) definition states that "child sexual abuse is the involvement of a child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend, is unable to give informed consent to, or for which the child is not developmentally prepared and cannot give consent, or that violates the laws or social taboos of society" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>, p 15). Child sexual abuse is categorised along a continuum according to the type of abuse experienced by the child: involving physical body contact (using the term 'contact child sexual abuse') or not involving physical body contact (using the term "non-contact child sexual abuse"). Contact acts include unwanted touching, fondling, masturbation, frottage, oral-genital contact, and vaginal or anal penetration by a penis, finger or other object. Non-contact acts include making sexual comments, voyeurism ('peeping'), exhibitionism ('flashing'), exposing a child to pornography, or making pornography (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Putnam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Putnam 2003</LINK>). Recent meta-analyses of data collected from retrospective studies of adults in countries and cultures worldwide estimate that 10% to 20% of female children, and 5% to 10% of male children, have experienced child sexual abuse on a spectrum from exposure through unwanted touching to penetrative assault before the age of 18 years (<LINK REF="REF-Barth-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barth 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ji-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ji 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pereda-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereda 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoltenborgh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoltenborgh 2011</LINK>). These data are likely to underestimate its true prevalence because two-thirds of individuals never disclose their victimisation (<LINK REF="REF-London-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">London 2005</LINK>) and most cases go unreported to authorities (<LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 1999</LINK>). The WHO estimates that child sexual abuse contributes to seven to eight per cent of the global burden of disease for females, and four to five per cent for males (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Child sexual abuse is associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes such as depression (<LINK REF="REF-Roosa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roosa 1999</LINK>), post-traumatic stress disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Widom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widom 1999</LINK>), antisocial and suicidal behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Bensley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bensley 1999</LINK>), eating disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Perkins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perkins 1999</LINK>), alcohol and substance abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Spak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spak 1998</LINK>), post-partum depression and parenting difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Buist-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buist 1998</LINK>), sexual re-victimisation, and sexual dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Fleming-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 1999</LINK>). A recent meta-analysis found child sexual abuse was also associated with higher rates of physical health conditions, including gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and cardiovascular problems, and obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Irish-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irish 2010</LINK>). A longitudinal analysis of the association between childhood sexual abuse and educational achievement found a clear linear relationship between increasing severity of child sexual abuse and poorer educational achievement, however the relationship was confounded by sociodemographic characteristics (e.g. lower maternal age and qualifications) and family functioning variables (e.g. inter-parental violence) known to be associated with child maltreatment (<LINK REF="REF-Boden-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boden 2007</LINK>). These consequences are far-reaching into families and communities, with significant costs for institutions in terms of primary and rehabilitative health care, education and welfare assistance, child protection, and justice system costs (<LINK REF="REF-Fang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fang 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the retrospective nature of many studies, it is unclear what proportion of survivors go on to experience adverse outcomes and how sexual abuse interacts with other potential risk factors for these adverse outcomes. However, outcomes are known to vary for individuals according to: child age and gender; perpetrator age and gender; the relationship between child and perpetrator; the severity, duration, and/or frequency of the abusive act(s); accompanying physical or emotional violence and/or force; and the presence of other forms of victimisation (<LINK REF="REF-Putnam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Putnam 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trickett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trickett 1997</LINK>). Sexual abuse has been reported across all socioeconomic and ethnic groups, in both males and females, and perpetrators can include those outside the family as well as within it (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1993</LINK>); they can be adults or other young people (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2011</LINK>). However, all children are not at equal risk. Risk factors for child sexual abuse, mainly identified in Western countries, include being female (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 1996</LINK>), having a physical or mental disability (<LINK REF="REF-Westcott-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westcott 1999</LINK>), living without a natural parent (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1990</LINK>), parental mental illness, parental alcohol or drug dependency, and young maternal age (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holmes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacMillan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMillan 2013</LINK>). Girls appear to be more likely to be sexually abused by family members and boys by non-family members (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1990</LINK>). The time of greatest vulnerability for child sexual abuse is between 7 and 12 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1986</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review focuses on the most widely used strategy for the prevention of child sexual abuse: the provision of school-based programmes. Some terms commonly used to describe these programmes include: <I>personal safety education</I> (<LINK REF="REF-NCMEC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCMEC 1999</LINK>); <I>protective behaviours</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Flandreau_x002d_West-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flandreau-West 1984</LINK>); <I>personal body safety</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Miller_x002d_Perrin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller-Perrin 1990</LINK>); <I>body safety</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Wurtele-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wurtele 2007</LINK>); and <I>child assault prevention</I> and <I>child protection education</I> (<LINK REF="REF-NSW-Department-of-School-Education-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSW Department of School Education 1998</LINK>). These programmes target children and adolescents aged 5 to 18 years who are students in primary (elementary) or secondary (high) schools. Support for interventions of this type can be found in Article 19 of the <I>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</I>, an international law, which states that governments should "take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse" (<LINK REF="REF-United-Nations-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">United Nations 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Education programmes to reduce the occurrence of sexual abuse in children and adolescents were first developed by women's rape prevention collectives in the United States of America (USA) in the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Berrick-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berrick 1991</LINK>). School-based programmes for the prevention of child sexual abuse were rapidly and widely adopted across the USA, assisted in some states by policy mandates, and by the mid 1990s it was estimated that two-thirds of 10- to 16-year olds in the USA had participated in such programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1995c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1995c</LINK>). Schools are a logical choice for teaching children about sexual abuse and its prevention, given their primary function is to educate (<LINK REF="REF-Wurtele-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wurtele 2009</LINK>), and the content of prevention programmes aligns with proscribed school health curricula (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2013</LINK>). Hence, schools have emerged as an important primary and secondary prevention setting providing access to large populations of children and adolescents, and relatively economical service delivery, without stigmatising those who may be at particular risk (<LINK REF="REF-Wurtele-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wurtele 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>School-based child sexual abuse prevention programmes are typically presented to groups of students and are tailored to ages and cognitive levels. Programme content covers themes such as body ownership; distinguishing types of touches; identifying potential abuse situations; avoiding, resisting, or escaping such situations; secrecy; and how and whom to tell if abuse has occurred (<LINK REF="REF-Duane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duane 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Topping-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Topping 2009</LINK>). Many programmes also stress that the child or adolescent is not to blame. Programmes vary in the number of, and extent to which these themes are covered. There is considerable variability in programme delivery formats and teaching methods. Formats such as books, comics, dramatic plays, puppet shows, films, lectures, and discussions have been used with some programmes employing single formats, whereas others use combinations of formats (<LINK REF="REF-Duane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duane 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Topping-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Topping 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wurtele-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Wurtele 1987a</LINK>). Programme teaching methods have been conceptualised on a continuum from those employing purely didactic approaches, such as a speech, address, or talk, stressing students' passive listening and acquisition of knowledge, to those employing behavioural approaches, such as modelling, and emphasising students' active participation in role-play, rehearsing, or practising new self protection skills (<LINK REF="STD-Wurtele-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Wurtele 1987a</LINK>). The duration and frequency of programmes is diverse, with 30 minutes being a common length as this fits with a standard school lesson period. Programmes also vary in their scope with some programmes dealing only with child sexual abuse, whereas others integrate these themes into programmes covering broader issues such as general safety education, social and emotional learning, mental health and well being, respectful relationships, and sexuality education. This review focuses only upon interventions in which prevention of child sexual abuse is the main goal.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-04 12:04:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The ultimate goal of child sexual abuse prevention education is to prevent children from ever experiencing abuse. It is also important, in cases where children have experienced abuse, for adults to respond quickly and effectively to disclosures, to protect them from further victimisation, and to limit the harm caused. From a public health perspective (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1991</LINK>), comprehensive approaches to child sexual abuse would involve multiple "prevention targets", including (i) offenders and potential offenders, (ii) children and adolescents, (iii) situations, and (iv) communities (<LINK REF="REF-Smallbone-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smallbone 2008</LINK>, p 47). Although not yet rigorously researched, it appears that school-based programmes may also work to enhance community capacity for sexual abuse prevention by raising awareness and delivering information to multiple members of children's social systems (<LINK REF="REF-Duane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duane 2002</LINK>), via provision of information packages to parents, training for teachers, and family participation in homework activities.</P>
<P>School-based sexual abuse prevention programmes focus on children and adolescents as prevention targets. They seek to prevent child sexual abuse by providing students with knowledge and skills to recognise and avoid potentially sexually abusive situations, and with strategies to physically and verbally repel sexual approaches by offenders. They endeavour to minimise harm by disseminating messages about appropriate help seeking in the event of abuse or attempted abuse. Interventions aim to transfer the knowledge and skills learned by the child or adolescent in the classroom to real-life situations. Interventions work by capitalising on principles used by classroom teachers, most notably social cognitive learning theories (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vygotsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vygotsky 1986</LINK>), which stress the social context of learning via the use of instruction, modelling, rehearsal, reinforcement, and feedback (<LINK REF="STD-Wurtele-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Wurtele 1987a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Do programmes actually prevent child sexual abuse? There is some evidence from a small group of studies, all of which have been conducted in the USA, that participation in school-based child sexual abuse prevention programmes may decrease the occurrence of child sexual abuse. A study of 2000 10- to 16-year olds found that those exposed to more comprehensive prevention education were more knowledgeable about sexual abuse, more likely to report using self protection strategies, more likely to report protective efficacy, more likely to have disclosed their victimisation, and less likely to engage in self blame (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1995a</LINK>). In a follow-up study, the same individuals were more likely to use the protective strategies they had been taught when confronted with threats and assaults (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1995b</LINK>). Two studies with high-school (<LINK REF="REF-Ko-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 2001</LINK>) and college students (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2000</LINK>) showed programmes were associated with reduced incidence of child sexual abuse. However these studies harbour the limitations of retrospective recall and have not been replicated with larger and more diverse samples. Research with sexual offenders on their perceptions of the efficacy of children's self protection strategies in actual abuse situations has found the most effective strategy, reported by three-quarters of offenders, was to tell the offender they did not want to participate in sexual activities. Girls under the age of 12 years effectively used six strategies to avoid abuse: demanding to be left alone, saying they would tell someone, crying, saying they were scared, saying the they did not want to, and saying "no" (<LINK REF="REF-Leclerc-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leclerc 2011</LINK>). These strategies are key content in school-based child sexual abuse prevention programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Duane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duane 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-03-04 11:52:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite widespread adoption into the school curriculum in many countries, conclusions about the effectiveness of school-based programmes for the prevention of child sexual abuse remain tentative. A number of research synthesis studies have been conducted on this topic in the form of meta-analyses, and systematic and narrative reviews (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>: Previous reviews). However the findings have been limited by methodological weaknesses in the reviews (e.g. including non-randomised as well as randomised studies; aggregation of diverse outcomes; inappropriate analytical approaches), and in the individual studies included in the reviews (e.g. use of diverse measures; inadequate measurement of programme fidelity). Additionally, previous meta-analyses have differed in their parameters and have not been replicated. Further, there are historical distinctions in previous reviews, for example, the classification of programmes as primarily active or passive, behavioural or instructional, that warrant further exploration; this particular distinction seems artificial from an educational perspective because many programmes are, in practice, multifaceted, involving a number of teaching methods that are used in integrated ways to deliver programme content (<LINK REF="REF-MacMillan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMillan 1994</LINK>). What is needed is a way of identifying, more precisely, the range of child, programme, and study design characteristics that may moderate programme effectiveness.</P>
<P>Evaluations of discrete programmes have been limited to authors assessing and reporting on one or more of five measures: (i) knowledge gains, (ii) skills gains, (iii) sexual abuse disclosures, (iv) negative programme effects or harms, and (v) subsequent incidence of child sexual abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Smallbone-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smallbone 2008</LINK>). Consistent with previous reviews, the original Cochrane review found improvements in knowledge and protective behaviours (skills) among children who had received school-based programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Zwi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwi 2007</LINK>). Findings on disclosures, harm, and retention of knowledge over time were inconclusive. As this was the most rigorous of the reviews ever conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Mikton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mikton 2009</LINK>), and is the only review to include risk of bias analyses, the review also uncovered many methodological quality issues that warrant ongoing monitoring and review. This is important because the historical controversy over school-based child sexual abuse prevention programmes is concentrated on two outcomes: programmes' actual effectiveness in preventing child sexual abuse, and concerns over negative programme effects (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 2007</LINK>). Evidence on programmes' effectiveness with regard to the fifth and arguably the most important measure, the degree to which programmes actually reduce the incidence of child sexual abuse, remains a pressing and unanswered empirical question that requires ongoing review.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that education programmes can cause harm to participating children and adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Taal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Taal 1997</LINK>). This is reported to be a common parental concern (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tutty-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tutty 1993</LINK>). Some studies report few or no evaluated negative effects on children (<LINK REF="STD-Tutty-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tutty 1997</LINK>), whereas others suggest potentially harmful sequelae. For example, some children report increased worry following programme participation (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1995c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1995c</LINK>) and older children have been found to experience more negative feelings about non-sexual physical touch (<LINK REF="STD-Taal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Taal 1997</LINK>). Therefore, there is a need to rigorously evaluate the evidence for these programmes, both in terms of beneficial and harmful outcomes, and to update the current evidence base on programme effectiveness.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-03-04 11:52:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To systematically assess evidence of the effectiveness of school-based education programmes for the prevention of child sexual abuse. Specifically, to assess whether: programmes are effective in improving students' protective behaviours and knowledge about sexual abuse prevention; behaviours and skills are retained over time; and participation results in disclosures of sexual abuse, produces harms, or both.</P>
<P>The original review and the current update do not address whether these programmes or other interventions have reduced the incidence and/or prevalence of child sexual abuse at the population level as reported by official records (e.g. from statutory child protection services, law enforcement, primary care, or hospital data), and/or community prevalence data (e.g. from self report surveys repeated at regular intervals). This objective may be incorporated in future review updates as research advances in this field.</P>

We incorporated new search terms to describe recent concepts, such as child sexual abuse in online contexts, and the increasing use of terms such as 'exploitation' and 'victimisation' by researchers when describing child sexual abuse. Searches for the previous review were completed in August 2006. Where possible, we focused on finding new studies and identifying older studies added to databases since that time. We added five new sources (two trials registers, two conference proceedings indexes, and one source of open access dissertations), and searched these for all available years (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>).

<P>We conducted selection of studies in three phases. In phase one, we imported titles and abstracts of articles identified in the searches into reference management software and review authors KZ and SW (2007 and 2009 searches), KW and KZ (2013 searches), and KW and AS (2014 searches) independently screened them. We excluded papers if they clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria (i.e. study design, participants, type of intervention, types of comparisons). In phase two, two review authors (KZ and SW in 2007; KZ and KW in 2013; KW and AS in 2014) independently screened the titles, abstracts, and methodology sections of papers appearing to meet inclusion criteria. In phase three, we retrieved the full text of studies meeting all inclusion criteria for data extraction and we linked together multiple reports of the same study (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>). One study was translated into English (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Campo-Sanchez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Campo Sanchez 2006</LINK>). In cases where agreement could not be reached during screening, we asked a third and fourth review author to independently assess the study against the inclusion criteria, and we resolved these cases via discussion and consensus.</P>

<P>For this update, we used an electronic data extraction proforma adapted from the checklist of items specified in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Table 7.3a). Two review authors (KZ and SW in 2007) independently performed data extraction. KW repeated data extraction for all 24 studies in 2013, with KZ extracting data independently for new studies in 2013. No data extraction was required in 2014 as no further studies met the inclusion criteria. The data were entered into RevMan by KZ (Review Manager 4.2 in 2007) and KW (Review Manager 5.2 in 2013), and independently checked for accuracy by a research assistant who was not involved in the review. We resolved discrepancies via discussion. We asked authors of studies in which methods of sequence generation, allocation concealment, or blinding were unclear to provide additional information (see <LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>). We contacted corresponding authors of studies with insufficient information to allow inclusion in meta-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saslawsky-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Saslawsky 1986</LINK> in 2007; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK> in 2013) and studies that used cluster-randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Dake-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dake 2003</LINK>; see <LINK TAG="UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Unit of analysis issues</LINK>) via email with a request to provide additional data.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-03-04 12:12:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the original review, two review authors (KZ, SW) independently assessed each included study. In the review update, the procedure was repeated by one review author (KW) who independently assessed risk of bias for all included studies and compared these results to those obtained in the original review, with KZ assessing risk of bias independently for new studies in 2013. KW repeated assessment of risk of bias after a six-month interval. There were no discrepancies. We undertook no 'Risk of bias' assessment in 2014 as no further studies met the inclusion criteria. Review authors assessing risk of bias were not blinded to the names of the authors, institutions, journals, or results of studies.</P>
<P>We assessed risk of bias using the seven domains on the Cochrane revised 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Table 8.5a): (i) random sequence generation; (ii) allocation concealment; (iii) blinding of participants and personnel; (iv) blinding of outcome assessment; (v) incomplete outcome data; (vi) selective reporting; and (vii) other sources of bias. We assessed included studies on each domain as 'low risk', 'high risk', or 'unclear risk' of bias. We made judgements by answering 'yes' (assessed as low risk of bias), 'no' (assessed as high risk of bias) or 'uncertain' (assessed as unclear risk of bias) to pre-specified questions for each domain. We used verbatim text from study reports as support for each judgement of risk wherever possible. We entered information into RevMan and summarised it in a 'Risk of bias' table for each included study. We generated two summary figures: a 'Risk of bias' summary (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) visually depicting judgements across all studies, and a 'Risk of bias' graph (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) illustrating the proportion of studies for each risk of bias criterion.

For the meta-analysis, where possible, we planned to report the RR and RD with 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes and MD with 95% CI for continuous variables. Elsewhere in the protocol (e.g. p 4) odds ratios (OR) are also mentioned.</P>
<P>In the original review, and in this review update, we reported the summary of effect for dichotomous outcomes as an OR with 95% CI. Odds ratios are the statistic used most often in this field. For continuous outcomes this was to be reported as the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI. Standardised mean differences are appropriate for data synthesis where different outcome measures are used across studies.</P>

<P>In the review protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Zwi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwi 2003</LINK>), in the case of cluster-RCTs, we planned to adjust for unit of analysis errors where the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was available. In the original review, and in this review update, some included studies involved cluster-randomisation at the level of the class, school, or district. However, ICCs were not reported in the studies, nor were they available from study authors. No published ICC for school-based child sexual abuse prevention interventions could be found. We noted that estimates of 0.1 and 0.2 had been used in a review of school-based violence prevention programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Mytton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mytton 2006</LINK>), based on the rationale for a published ICC of 0.15 for similar trials (CPPRG 1999b in <LINK REF="REF-Mytton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mytton 2006</LINK>), and was considered a plausible yet conservative estimate for the impact of clustering at the classroom level (<LINK REF="REF-Schochet-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schochet 2008</LINK>). We reasoned that a suitably conservative approach would be to use the extremes of ICC 0.1 and 0.2 to calculate a design effect for each cluster-RCT according to the formula given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Section 16.3.4) which is: 1 + (mean cluster size - 1) ICC. We weighted these using the generic inverse variance function and used random-effect models.</P>
<P>Some studies included in this review had multiple intervention groups (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krah_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krah 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poche-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Poche 1988</LINK>). In these cases, we combined all relevant intervention groups into a single group, and all relevant control groups into a single group. Using the tools available in Review Manager 5.2, we combined means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous outcomes, and summed sample sizes and number of outcomes across groups for dichotomous outcomes. This enabled us to make comparisons between groups using pair-wise comparisons without risk of double-counting participants.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-03-04 11:52:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Requirements for dealing with missing data in Cochrane Reviews have changed since the protocol for this review was written (<LINK REF="REF-Zwi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwi 2003</LINK>). We identified several types of missing data in this review update: missing outcomes, missing summary data, and missing participants. For missing outcomes (e.g. disclosures, adverse outcomes) and missing summary data (i.e. group size totals, means, SDs), we contacted corresponding study authors to provide the outstanding data. Some authors responded helpfully to these requests, but data could only be provided for the most recent studies; in other cases, data had been collected over two decades ago and were no longer available. In some cases, authors did not respond. If data remained unavailable after these processes, we excluded these studies from the analyses. For missing participants, we reported the attrition rate wherever possible in the 'Risk of bias' tables beneath the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-10 11:32:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed heterogeneity (study diversity) visually and by examining the I statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>), a quantity which describes the proportion of variation in point estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. We supplemented this with a statistical test of homogeneity to determine the strength of evidence for genuine heterogeneity using a significance level of P value &gt; 0.05. </P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-09 12:30:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess reporting biases, we used two approaches to investigate the relationship between effect size and sample size (<LINK REF="REF-Borenstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borenstein 2009</LINK>). We drew fixed-effect forest plots with studies plotted according to weight (i.e. from most to least precise). We noted any trend towards greater effect sizes at the bottom of the plots indicative of bias attributable to missing studies. We also drew fixed-effect funnel plots and checked them for asymmetry indicating the presence of publication bias. In both approaches, trends or asymmetry could be due to publication or related biases (e.g. language bias, availability bias, citation bias) or due to genuine differences between small and large trials (<LINK REF="REF-Borenstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borenstein 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). If a relationship was identified, we further examined differences between studies as a possible explanation along with comparisons by source (e.g. peer-reviewed journals; theses). We planned to conduct these analyses only when there was a reasonable number of studies (more than 10) and a reasonable amount of dispersion in sample sizes. To reduce the effects of publication bias, in the review update, we made efforts to retrieve the full texts of unpublished trials (e.g. theses). This was made easier by virtue of the fact that many had been made available on electronic databases since our previous searches were conducted and document delivery services had improved.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-04-09 12:03:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We synthesised the data using tools provided in Review Manger (RevMan) 5.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We assessed the appropriateness of combining studies based on sufficient comparability with respect to: the type of intervention, the type of outcome measures, and the nominated data collection points pre- and post-intervention. We calculated summary statistics (OR for dichotomous data and SMD for continuous data) with 95% CIs for each study. We had intended to use a fixed effect model to combine data in the first instance and then to adopt a random effects model where the I square value exceeded 30%. On further consideration of the differences between the included studies in terms of their setting and intervention, we decided instead to adopt a random effects model to combine data. In all cases, we generated pooled estimates for those studies for which complete statistical data were available or could be derived (i.e. counts and proportions for dichotomous data, and means and SDs for continuous data). Forest plots are presented for each of the pooled estimates. In all cases, we corrected for small sample size bias by using Hedges' g, which is the default in Review Manager (RevMan) 5.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>We planned to conduct analyses on the six outcomes nominated above: (i) protective behaviours; (ii) knowledge of sexual abuse or knowledge of sexual abuse prevention concepts, or both; (iii) retention of protective behaviours over time; (iv) retention of knowledge over time; (v) parental or child anxiety or fear; (vi) disclosure of sexual abuse. To manage subtle differences in outcome measurement for (ii) (knowledge), we created subgroups according to the category of measurement instrument used (i.e. questionnaire-based knowledge or vignette-based knowledge). There were insufficient data to proceed with analysis for retention of protective behaviours over time. No studies measured parental anxiety or fear.</P>

<P>In the review protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Zwi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwi 2003</LINK>), we specified the conduct of subgroup analyses to assess the impact of clinically relevant differences: (i) in the interventions (e.g. passive or active involvement of participants); and (ii) between groups of participants (e.g. gender, school setting). We did not conduct subgroup analyses because there was insufficient information provided in the included studies about issues that were hypothesised as being relevant for subgroup analysis, for example, studies did not always provide a breakdown of student gender by intervention group. Further, upon close scrutiny, interventions did not appear to fit an active/passive dichotomy with many having multiple components of both active and passive types (e.g. a video or DVD presentation may at times require children to sit still and listen, and at other times, to respond, chant, sing, or move). Further, there were insufficient numbers of studies to allow for meaningful comparisons. This will be elaborated further below.</P>

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-04-09 02:02:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted sensitivity analysis to explore the extent to which results were influenced by risk of bias. We conducted a series of sensitivity analyses removing from the analyses studies with high risk of bias for: (i) allocation concealment (selection bias); (ii) blinding of outcome assessors (detection bias); (iii) incomplete outcome data (attrition of over 20%), and (iv) selective reporting (reporting bias). We also conducted sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of unit of analysis errors, arising from inadequate adjustment for cluster-randomisation in published results.</P>

<P>We rated the quality of the evidence for our main outcomes according to methods for rating evidence from randomised controlled trial developed by the GRADE working group (<A HREF="http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/">http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/</A>). For each outcome of interest the evidence started at high quality and could be downgraded to moderate, low or very low quality after consideration of the possible impact of risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness and publication bias on our confidence in the effects of intervention. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In all 24 trials, interventions focused specifically on child sexual abuse prevention. The targets of the interventions were school-aged children who were taught knowledge of sexual abuse, sexual abuse prevention concepts, and/or skill acquisition in self protective behaviours.</P>
<P>A wide range of previously published, modified, and new prevention programmes were used in the trials. Fifteen discrete programmes were identified including: Behavioural Skills Training (BST) (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wurtele-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wurtele 1986</LINK>), Good Touch/Bad Touch (<LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x04aa_e_x04ab_en_x002d_Ero_x011f_ul-2013" TYPE="STUDY">&#1194;e&#1195;en-Ero&#287;ul 2013</LINK>), Red Flag/Green Flag (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>), Child Abuse Primary Prevention Program (CAPPP) (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>), Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program (<LINK REF="STD-Grendel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grendel 1991</LINK>), Children Need to Know Personal Safety Training Programme (<LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK>), ESPACE (<LINK REF="STD-Daigneault-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Daigneault 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>), Good Secrets/Bad Secrets (<LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1986</LINK>), No Child's Play (<LINK REF="STD-Krah_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krah 2009</LINK>), Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse Program (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Campo-Sanchez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Campo Sanchez 2006</LINK>), Project TRUST (<LINK REF="STD-Oldfield-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oldfield 1996</LINK>), Safe Child Program (<LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>), Stop, Tell someone, Own your body, Protect yourself (STOP!)

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>In this section we summarise six outcome measures of interest that were addressed in the included studies: (i) protective behaviours; (ii) knowledge (questionnaire-based knowledge and vignette-based knowledge); (iii) retention of protective behaviours over time; (iv) retention of knowledge over time; (v) harm (manifest as parent or child anxiety or fear); and (vi) disclosures. This information is presented in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Protective behaviours</HEADING>
<P>Three studies measured change in behaviour using a simulated abuse situation and scored the child's response to the situation (<LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poche-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Poche 1988</LINK>). All three studies used a version of a stranger simulation test to assess children's self protective skills (i.e. whether children could follow the rules they were taught and not interact if approached by a stranger).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Knowledge</HEADING>
<P>Knowledge outcome measures varied between studies. Knowledge measures used were: (i) questionnaire-based measures, or (ii) vignette-based measures that used scenarios or visual prompts to elicit a response from the child about safe behaviour in that situation. Only one study did not measure knowledge (<LINK REF="STD-Poche-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Poche 1988</LINK>), and one study used a vignette-based measure only (<LINK REF="STD-Krah_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krah 2009</LINK>). Ten studies used both vignette- and questionnaire-based measures (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daigneault-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Daigneault 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grendel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grendel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saslawsky-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Saslawsky 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wurtele-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wurtele 1986</LINK>). Three studies used a second questionnaire-based measure to establish construct validity (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Del-Campo-Sanchez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Campo Sanchez 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of more than one measure by studies to assess knowledge gain was not anticipated at the outset of this systematic review. The two types of measures were administered differently. Questionnaire-based measures were administered as self completed measures via individual or group administration. Vignette measures were administered by interview. The different methods of administration and the type of response required from the child means that these two outcomes may measure different aspects of children's knowledge; therefore, we considered them as separate knowledge outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Random sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>Twenty studies stated that individuals or groups (classes, schools, or districts) were "randomised", "randomly allocated", or "randomly assigned" to groups, but provided no detail about how the random sequence was generated. Three further studies described a classic experimental design, but did not report details about random assignment (<LINK REF="STD-Dake-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dake 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>). We classified all of these studies as unclear risk of bias. One study reported a random component in the sequence generation, coin tossing (<LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1986</LINK>), and we classified it as low risk of bias. In one study, evidence of computerised randomisation was provided after author contact (<LINK REF="STD-Dake-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dake 2003</LINK>). We re-classified this study as low risk of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>No studies provided information on methods used to conceal allocation. In all instances we concluded that procedures were potentially unconcealed such that assignment to groups could reasonably have been predicted prior to or during the process. Twelve studies reported tests of baseline imbalances showing no statistical differences between groups, potentially indicating successful randomisation. However, we classified these studies as unclear risk of bias because the method of concealment was not described in sufficient detail for an adequate assessment to be made. Ten studies provided no baseline comparisons and we also classified them as unclear risk of bias. We classified two studies as high risk of bias: one study reported important differences between groups at baseline and concluded failure of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1989</LINK>, pp 60-1) and another study revealed school officials were involved in the process (<LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>, p 27).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of participants and personnel</HEADING>
<P>The school-based nature of the interventions made blinding of participants receiving the intervention and personnel delivering the intervention impossible. In 14 studies intervention and control groups were located within the same school. In these cases, it was possible that participants experienced 'contamination' effects via contact with each other in the playground or their siblings at home, and/or inadvertent 'exposure' to programme concepts via teachers and other school staff. This is likely to have biased the results towards an underestimation of programme effects, particularly on knowledge outcomes, which would be more susceptible to such contamination and exposure. Personnel delivering the interventions were various study authors, programme facilitators, and classroom teachers. None of these 14 studies described a means by which programme fidelity or integrity was addressed (e.g. via the use of scripts or standardised lesson plans) or measured (e.g. via observation, audio, or video recordings). We classified these 14 studies as high risk of bias. Seven further studies provided no information on blinding procedures and we classified them as unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dake-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dake 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Del-Campo-Sanchez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Campo Sanchez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saslawsky-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Saslawsky 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wurtele-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wurtele 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x04aa_e_x04ab_en_x002d_Ero_x011f_ul-2013" TYPE="STUDY">&#1194;e&#1195;en-Ero&#287;ul 2013</LINK>).

Some studies used multiple strategies for minimising outcome assessment bias. In eight studies, authors reported that outcome assessors were blind to group membership, study hypotheses, or both (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daigneault-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Daigneault 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grendel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grendel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krah_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krah 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oldfield-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oldfield 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saslawsky-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Saslawsky 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wurtele-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wurtele 1986</LINK>). In three studies, authors noted that participants were not informed that the outcome assessment was related to the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poche-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Poche 1988</LINK>), and in three studies outcome assessors were reported to be different to the personnel delivering the interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>).

One study reported that participants were assessed only once (either pre-test or post-test) by the same outcome assessor to control for potential effects of rapport building (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>). Of these 10 studies, <LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK> implemented more strategies than any other study and we considered it to be at lowest risk of bias in this domain.</P>
<P>We classified seven studies as high risk of bias. In these studies outcome assessment was administered in group format (in class or with a number of children) and there were no strategies in place to blind outcome assessors to group membership or to ensure children completed the assessment independently (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dake-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dake 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1986</LINK>).

<P>Most studies reported complete outcome data that matched the stated aims or hypothesis of the study, and reported on pre-specified outcomes of interest. We initially classified these studies as low risk of bias. We classified two studies as high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1986</LINK>), because not all measures discussed in the methods section of the paper were also reported in the results. This may be an artefact of publication word limits.</P>
<P>On closer inspection, however, we noted that outcome reporting was incomplete in five studies. One study did not provide a breakdown of data for intervention and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>). In four studies, outcomes were reported as summary statistics (e.g. F-tests or T-tests) without including means and SDs for continuous outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Campo-Sanchez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Campo Sanchez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>).

<P>The unit of randomisation in 14 studies was clusters. Eleven of these were cluster-RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dake-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dake 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grendel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grendel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krah_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krah 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oldfield-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oldfield 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poche-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Poche 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1986</LINK>), where the unit of allocation was a group (e.g. classroom or school). Three quasi-RCTs also used groups as the unit of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daigneault-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Daigneault 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>). None of these studies reported appropriate analyses accounting for clustering effects. Therefore, we assumed unit of analysis errors in all cases, meaning the original P values would be artificially small. In the subsequent meta-analysis, studies with unadjusted unit of analysis errors would be incorrectly and more highly weighted than is, in reality, appropriate. This risks biasing results in favour of the intervention.</P>
<P>As noted above, to diminish the risk of publication bias, in the review update we made concerted efforts to retrieve the full texts of unpublished trials (e.g. theses). Seven of 29 records included in this review were unpublished theses (<LINK REF="REF-Blumberg-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumberg 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chadwick-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadwick 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grendel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grendel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1986</LINK>). We assessed the risk of publication bias by drawing fixed-effect forest and funnel plots for the two meta-analyses involving 10 or more trials (questionnaire-based knowledge, 18 trials; vignette-based knowledge, 11 trials). Visual inspection of fixed-effect forest plots revealed no discernable trend towards greater effect sizes in smaller studies. However, our subjective impression of the fixed-effect funnel plots suggested the presence of slight asymmetry on the lower right (here we found smaller studies with greater effect sizes) indicating the possibility that some studies are missing from the lower left (here we should have found smaller studies with smaller effect sizes) (see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). There is also the possibility that smaller studies were of poorer methodological quality (although this is not evident in the 'Risk of bias' assessments), or there may have been genuine differences between studies (e.g. unreported sample differences at baseline; differences in programme duration) (<LINK REF="REF-Borenstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borenstein 2009</LINK>). Due to poor reporting of variables that may be responsible for heterogeneity, it was not possible to further explore the sources of variation, for example, via the use of meta-regression.</P>

<P>This review sought to assess the evidence of effectiveness of school-based education programmes for the prevention of child sexual abuse. Specifically, we sought to assess whether: programmes were effective in improving students' protective behaviours and knowledge about sexual abuse prevention; behaviours and skills were retained over time; and programme participation resulted in disclosures of sexual abuse, produced harm, or both. In this section, we present the main findings on the effects of the interventions for six outcomes: (i) protective behaviours; (ii) knowledge (questionnaire-based knowledge and vignette-based knowledge); (iii) retention of protective behaviours over time; (iv) retention of knowledge over time; (v) harm (parental or child anxiety or fear); and (vi) disclosures. The analysis results and our GRADE ratings are presented in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Protective behaviours</HEADING>
<P>Of the 24 included studies, three studies reported collecting data on protective behaviours (<LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poche-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Poche 1988</LINK>). All used a version of a stranger simulation test involving staging of a simulated abuse or grooming situation with each individual child where a research assistant, posing as a stranger, requested the child's help with a task that required them to go with the stranger (e.g. accompany the stranger to the stranger's car to do a special task). Children's responses were recorded by independent assessors using contemporaneous video monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>), or by the research assistant (<LINK REF="STD-Poche-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Poche 1988</LINK>). Scoring was pass or fail. All three studies were conducted with children in lower primary school (kindergarten to grade three).</P>
<P>Only the <LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK> (n = 48; randomised controlled trial (RCT)) and <LINK REF="STD-Poche-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Poche 1988</LINK> (n = 74; cluster-RCT) studies could be included in the meta-analysis for protective behaviours, as <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK> (n = 670; cluster-RCT) did not report a breakdown of pass or fail scores for intervention and control groups. For the <LINK REF="STD-Poche-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Poche 1988</LINK> study, we combined two intervention groups as the self protective knowledge and skills received were considered sufficiently similar to those in <LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK>: teaching rules, group discussion, and practice through role-play and rehearsal. Data were available for 102 participants. Comparison was with a control group.</P>
<P>In the analysis, heterogeneity approached the moderate range (I = 27%; Tau = 0.16) and was non-significant (P value = 0.24). Protective behaviours were greatly enhanced in intervention groups compared to control groups immediately post-intervention (odds ratio (OR) 5.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98 to 16.51; two studies; n = 102) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of adjusting the <LINK REF="STD-Poche-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Poche 1988</LINK> study for cluster-randomisation. Using this method and an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.1 produced an OR of 5.43 (95% CI 1.88 to 15.65; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) and an ICC of 0.2 produced an OR of 5.16 (95% CI 1.81 to 14.70; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). These analyses indicate that adjusting for the effect of clustering have minimal effects on our results.</P>
<P>Taken together, results of the more conservative adjustment for clustering show the short-term (i.e. immediately post-intervention) superiority of the interventions over control group effects. That is, children who received a school-based sexual abuse prevention programme were substantially more likely to demonstrate protective behaviours in a simulated situation that was administered immediately after the programme ended.</P>
<P>In addition to the above assessment, <LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK> assessed the impact of knowledge and self esteem on the use of protective behaviours. <LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK> used the Harter Perceived Competence Scale for Children (HPCS) (<LINK REF="REF-Harter-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harter 1982</LINK>), commonly used as a measure of self esteem. <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK> used the Battle Culture Free Self-esteem Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Battle-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battle 1981</LINK>) and the Children Need to Know Knowledge/Attitude Test (CNKKAT) (<LINK REF="REF-Kraizer-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraizer 1981</LINK>). Results of these measures were reported only for the intervention groups. In both studies, children with high self esteem who had improved knowledge scores post-intervention were more likely to exhibit protective behaviours. These studies did not report effect sizes to enable assessment of the magnitude of the relationships between self esteem, knowledge, and protective behaviours, although self esteem was identified as a potential "critical path" or moderating variable, which was recommended for further research (<LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK>, p 177).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Questionnaire-based knowledge</HEADING>
<P>Of the 24 included studies, 21 reported questionnaire-based knowledge using a range of different measures detailed above. Three of the 21 studies did not provide data in a way that could be included in meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Campo-Sanchez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Campo Sanchez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>). In three trials, with multiple intervention groups in which interventions were judged to be sufficiently comparable, we combined intervention groups into a single intervention group in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>). Eighteen studies were included in the meta-analysis comprising a total of 4657 participants.</P>
<P>In the meta-analysis, there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity (I = 84%; Tau = 0.10). The high Chi statistic (104.76; df = 17) and low P value (&lt; 0.00001) indicated variation of effect estimates beyond chance. The SMD was 0.61 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.78), reflecting an average 0.61 standard deviation (SD) increase in factual knowledge, across various measures, for the intervention group. These results suggest that children exposed to the interventions tend to display increased factual knowledge about sexual abuse and its prevention, when measured immediately after completion of the programme, and the effect is of a moderate size (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the 18 studies included in this meta-analysis, 12 were cluster-randomised studies and all were analysed with unit of analysis errors. Of the cluster-randomised studies, one was randomised by school district (<LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>), four were randomised by school (<LINK REF="STD-Daigneault-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Daigneault 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dake-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dake 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>), and seven by classroom (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grendel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grendel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oldfield-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oldfield 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1986</LINK>). We estimated ICCs, as described above, in sensitivity analyses to adjust for unit of analysis errors. We applied the same ICC to district, school, and class cluster-RCTs. When adjusted, an ICC of 0.1 produced a SMD of 0.66 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.81; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) and an ICC of 0.2 produced a SMD of 0.63 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.77; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). These analyses indicate that adjusting for clustering has very minimal effects on results.</P>
<P>We also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of study exclusion for risk of bias in the two most relevant domains for school-based studies. First, we examined risk of bias on the blinding of outcome assessment domain. When studies at high risk of bias were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dake-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dake 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1986</LINK>), the SMD was reduced to 0.47 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.66). These results indicate that knowledge scores in these studies may be influenced by assessor bias or contamination from group assessment, or both, such that better controlled studies may generate lower effect sizes in this domain. Second, we examined risk of bias on the attrition bias domain. When studies at high risk of bias were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daigneault-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Daigneault 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dake-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dake 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grendel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grendel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>), the SMD was 0.69 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.88), indicating that children from studies with better follow-up tended to score somewhat higher in this domain.</P>
<P>We conducted subgroup analyses to assess the effects of participant age. We examined studies in two age-based subgroups as follows: (i) six studies with only younger participants from kindergarten to grade three (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daigneault-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Daigneault 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dake-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dake 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grendel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grendel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>); and (ii) seven studies with only older participants from grade four upwards (<LINK REF="STD-Crowley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x04aa_e_x04ab_en_x002d_Ero_x011f_ul-2013" TYPE="STUDY">&#1194;e&#1195;en-Ero&#287;ul 2013</LINK>). The SMD was 0.42 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.77) for the younger group and 0.89 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.19) for the older group. The test for subgroup differences was just below the statistically significant cut-off of 0.05 (Chi = 4.04, df = 1; P value = 0.04). These results indicate that knowledge may be better gained immediately after the intervention by older children.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vignette-based knowledge</HEADING>
<P>Twelve studies used vignette-based measures in various formats, including verbal, picture, and video vignettes. One study did not report SDs and thus could not be included in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1988</LINK>). One study did not report SDs but these could be derived by review authors from other reported statistics to enable inclusion in meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Saslawsky-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Saslawsky 1986</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Krah_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krah 2009</LINK>, we combined two intervention groups into a single intervention group based on our assessment that the interventions were sufficiently similar when compared with other studies. Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis with a total of 1688 participants.</P>
<P>There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity (I = 71%; Tau = 0.08) in the meta-analysis. The high Chi statistic (34.25, df = 10) and low P value (&lt; 0.0002) provide further evidence of variation in effect estimates beyond chance. The SMD was 0.45 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.65) (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>), indicating that those receiving treatment had an average 0.45 SD increase in applied knowledge as reflected in their responses to vignettes administered post-intervention, a gain of moderate effect size.</P>
<P>Of the 11 studies included in the meta-analysis, seven studies were of cluster-randomised design (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daigneault-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Daigneault 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grendel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grendel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krah_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krah 2009</LINK>). To assess the impact of unit of analysis errors, we conducted sensitivity analyses for estimated ICCs (as above). For an ICC of 0.1, the SMD was 0.53, (95% CI 0.32 to 0.74; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>) and for an ICC of 0.2, the SMD was 0.60 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.89; <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). These analyses suggest that adjusting for clustering has only slight effects on results.</P>
<P>We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of study exclusion for risk of bias. First, we examined risk of bias on the blinding of outcome assessment domain. When we excluded three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>), the SMD was reduced to 0.36 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.56), indicating a slight testing effect. Second, we examined risk of bias on the attrition bias domain. When we excluded studies at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daigneault-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Daigneault 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grendel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grendel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>), the SMD increased to 0.57 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.89), indicating that children from studies with better follow-up tended to score somewhat higher in this domain.</P>
<P>We conducted subgroup analyses to assess the effects of participant age. We examined studies in two groups: (i) six studies including only participants in kindergarten to grade three (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daigneault-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Daigneault 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grendel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grendel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krah_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krah 2009</LINK>); and (ii) three studies including only participants in grade four upwards (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1998</LINK>). The SMD was 0.39 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.69) for the younger group and 0.56 (95% CI 0.03 to 1.08) for the older group. Thus, older children, on average, may score somewhat better than younger children when they complete these measures of applied knowledge immediately after the intervention. However, the test for subgroup differences was not significant (Chi = 0.29, df = 1; P value = 0.59).</P>

<P>Three of the 24 included studies measured retention of protective behaviours over time. Complete data were not available for any of these studies and a meta-analysis could not be conducted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Retention of knowledge over time</HEADING>
<P>Questionnaire-based measures were used in 21 of the 24 included studies. Ten of these studies reported on retention of knowledge over time. Complete data were available for four studies (956 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1998</LINK>). All studies used unique knowledge scales. In three studies, follow-up periods were one to three months post-intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1998</LINK>), and in one study, six months post-intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>). These four studies were included in meta-analysis using a random-effects model. For comparative purposes we generated two meta-analyses: one estimating effects for the four studies immediately post-intervention and one estimating effects at follow-up. Results suggest that knowledge appeared to deteriorate slightly over time as demonstrated by a decline in the SMD from 0.78 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.17; I = 84%, Tau = 0.13, P value = 0.0003) immediately post-intervention to SMD 0.69 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.87; I = 25%; Tau = 0.01, P value = 0.26) at one to three months follow-up (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). However, the test for subgroup differences was not significant (Chi = 0.14, df = 1; P value = 0.71), suggesting knowledge scores did not deteriorate significantly for intervention or control groups within the one- to six-month follow-up period.</P>
<P>Of the four studies included in this meta-analysis, three were cluster-randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>). Sensitivity analyses, adjusting for clustering yielded very similar results. When adjusted with an ICC of 0.1, knowledge decreased slightly over time as demonstrated by a small decline in the SMD from 0.86 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.20) immediately post-intervention to 0.73 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.06) at follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). When adjusted with an ICC of 0.2, knowledge decreased slightly over time as demonstrated by a small decline in the SMD from SMD 0.86 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.20) immediately post-intervention to 0.72 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.11) at follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). </P>
<P>Vignette-based measures were used in 12 of the 24 included studies. Nine of these studies reported on retention of knowledge over time. None of these studies could be included in a meta-analysis. The reasons for this are twofold: (i) the wait-list control design of the study meant that the control group received the intervention immediately after the experimental group had finished and, therefore, follow-up data were unavailable for the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daigneault-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Daigneault 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grendel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Grendel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saslawsky-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Saslawsky 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wurtele-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wurtele 1986</LINK>); or (ii) the study did not provide data in a form useable in meta-analysis, for example, the study provided a narrative statement or reported summary statistics without providing means and SDs (<LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krah_x00e9_-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krah 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1998</LINK>). As a narrative synthesis, six studies provided intervention group data only: two studies reported no knowledge gains between post-test and follow-up (at five months, <LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; at one year, <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>), two studies reported maintenance of knowledge gains at two-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1998</LINK>), and three studies reported small, but unimportant additional knowledge gains between post-test and follow-up (six months, <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>; three months, <LINK REF="STD-Saslawsky-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Saslawsky 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wurtele-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wurtele 1986</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Harm</HEADING>
<P>A total of six studies had measured harm, but three did not report data in a form that could be used in meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Daigneault-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Daigneault 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>). We included three studies (795 participants) in the meta-analysis for harm in relation to participation in school-based child sexual abuse prevention programmes (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1998</LINK>). In these studies, harm was measured via child self report anxiety or fear scales, with all studies using unique measures: <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK> used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1998</LINK> used the Fear Assessment Thermometer Scale (FATS), and <LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK> used a custom-made scale. There was no heterogeneity (I = 0%, P value = 0.79). The SMD was -0.08 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.07) (see <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). This result reveals evidence of no increases or decreases in anxiety or fear in intervention participants.</P>
<P>Two of these three studies were cluster-randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dawson 1987</LINK>). To assess the impact of unit of analysis errors, we conducted sensitivity analyses for estimated ICCs as above, showing little change in point estimates and slightly widening CIs. For an ICC of 0.1, the SMD was -0.04 (95% CI -0.42 to 0.33; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>) and for an ICC of 0.2, the SMD was -0.03 (95% CI -0.46 to 0.40; <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>A narrative synthesis of the studies not included in the meta-analysis shows that seven studies reported on adverse effects with either child (<LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oldfield-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oldfield 1996</LINK>) or parent self reports (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Campo-Sanchez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Campo Sanchez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tutty-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tutty 1997</LINK>). Using child self report measures, <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Oldfield-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oldfield 1996</LINK> reported no important differences in STAIC scores between intervention and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>, treatment mean 29.7, control mean 29.9; <LINK REF="STD-Oldfield-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oldfield 1996</LINK>, F(1, 593) = 0.05, P value = 0.825). <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK> did not report SDs and ANCOVA results. <LINK REF="STD-Oldfield-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oldfield 1996</LINK> did not report means and SDs. <LINK REF="STD-Oldfield-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oldfield 1996</LINK> also found no important differences between experimental and control group anxiety scores using the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) with younger participants, F(1, 653) = 1.40, P value = 0.248. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>), children in the intervention group participated in an exit interview (n = 332): 14.8% of the children experienced some anxiety or fear initially but none on programme completion, and 4.5% experienced some anxiety or fear initially and remained a little worried on programme completion.</P>
<P>Using parent self report measures of perceived changes in children's behaviour, <LINK REF="STD-Del-Campo-Sanchez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Campo Sanchez 2006</LINK> (n = 193) reported the following in children exposed to the intervention: fear of adults (1%) and increased fighting with peers (1%), but no sleep problems, or rejection of normal affection. Similarly, in intervention group children, <LINK REF="STD-Tutty-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tutty 1997</LINK> (n = 231) found worry about scary things happening (1.7%), but no bedwetting, nightmares, crying, rejection of normal affection, or attention seeking behaviour. <LINK REF="STD-H_x00e9_bert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hbert 2001</LINK> (n = 133) reported intervention group children having increased dependency behaviours (13%), more aggressiveness towards peers (15%) and siblings (29%), and more fearfulness of strangers (25%). <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK> (n = 399) reported no important differences between intervention and control group children on parental perceptions of anxiety or fear (summary data not provided).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Disclosure</HEADING>
<P>We included three studies (1788 participants) in the meta-analysis for disclosures of previous or current sexual abuse (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Campo-Sanchez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Del Campo Sanchez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oldfield-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oldfield 1996</LINK>). There was no heterogeneity (I = 0%, P value = 0.84). Disclosure occurred more often in the intervention group (OR 3.56, 95% CI 1.13 to 11.24). The odds of disclosure were as much as 3.5 times higher in participants exposed to the intervention (see <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of adjusting the <LINK REF="STD-Kolko-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kolko 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Oldfield-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Oldfield 1996</LINK> studies for cluster-randomisation. Using this method and an ICC of 0.1 produced a non-significant OR of 3.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 12.33; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>) and an ICC of 0.2 produced an OR of 2.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 12.61; see <LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>). These analyses, adjusted for unit of analysis errors, indicate that the effect of intervention programmes on disclosure was sensitive to different assumptions regarding the effect of clustering on the results.</P>
<P>Of the studies not included in meta-analysis, disclosure of past or current abuse was recorded in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>). One study conducted a search of the files of Child Protective Services (CPS) for names of children in the classrooms who were part of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Blumberg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberg 1991</LINK>). Data event counts were not provided, however the study reported that risk ratios (RR) were calculated for experimental against control conditions. Both ratios "approached 1.0 which one would expect by chance" (<LINK REF="REF-Chadwick-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadwick 1989</LINK>, p 61). One further study measured disclosures, but was unable to distinguish between treatment and control groups due to data reporting methods (<LINK REF="STD-Hazzard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hazzard 1991</LINK>). Eight of 526 participants (1.5%) reported ongoing sexual abuse and 20 (3.8%) reported past sexual abuse.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analyses are used to compare the mean effect for different subgroups of studies where there are sufficient numbers of studies to allow for meaningful comparisons. We were able to conduct subgroup analyses for age, but only for knowledge outcomes, by categorising studies into two broad groups: younger children and older children as described above. This was because programmes were often delivered to children across multiple consecutive and non-consecutive school grades. We did not conduct other subgroup analyses in this review because the included studies provided insufficient information about issues that were hypothesised as being relevant for subgroup analysis. In the original study protocol we planned to conduct subgroup analyses for participant age and gender, and programme type and setting (<LINK REF="REF-Zwi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwi 2003</LINK>). We were unable to conduct subgroup analyses for gender owing to poor reporting. We did not conduct subgroup analyses for active or passive involvement as it was not possible to categorise programmes in this way; most were multifaceted, involving both active and passive approaches. What is needed is a way of identifying, more precisely, the range of child, programme, and study design characteristics that may moderate programme effectiveness. We explain this in more detail in the discussion below.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-04 11:52:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review reported on 24 trials (29 reports) examining the effectiveness of school-based programmes for the prevention of child sexual abuse. The studies report on data for 5802 child participants of whom 5730 (almost 98.8%) were from primary (elementary) schools. In this review, we assessed programme effectiveness according to six outcomes: (i) protective behaviours; (ii) knowledge (questionnaire-based knowledge and vignette-based knowledge); (iii) retention of protective behaviours over time; (iv) retention of knowledge over time; (v) harm manifesting as parental or child anxiety or fear; and (vi) disclosures of past or current child sexual abuse. Below we report on: (i) protective behaviours; (ii) knowledge; (iii) harm; and (iv) disclosures.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Protective behaviours</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analysis of data from two studies showed significant improvements in protective behaviours in simulated at-risk situations, measured immediately (up to two weeks) post-intervention. Follow-up assessment of protective behaviours was not reported in either of the studies. Simulated situations, used in three of the included studies, were a form of in vivo assessment, which exposed children to potentially stressful situations such as an invitation to go with an unknown adult (<LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraizer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kraizer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poche-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Poche 1988</LINK>). The use of these simulation techniques is difficult to justify and raises important ethical questions about balancing risks against potential benefits for participants. Research of this type also presents significant challenges for voluntary consent where there is active concealment via role-playing. Although this is arguably as close as researchers can get to testing whether participants' learned skills can be translated into appropriate behaviour, three salient issues must be considered. First, the generalisation of responses from simulated to actual settings cannot be assumed. Second, it is not known if skills taught in the context of approaches from strangers help children deal with threats from familiar adults, who are the most common perpetrators of child sexual abuse. Third, there is the possibility that this type of outcome assessment may desensitise children to similar occurrences in the future. Outcome assessment of this type, therefore, must be rigorously conducted and monitored.</P>
<P>The results of one study suggest that children with greater self esteem (<LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK>), as measured by the Harter Perceived Competence Scale (HPCS) (<LINK REF="REF-Harter-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harter 1982</LINK>), exhibited better protective behaviours following intervention. Since self esteem is clinically relevant in child sexual abuse, this finding warrants further investigation to determine whether self esteem training should be included as a component of child sexual abuse prevention interventions. It may be that children with greater self esteem are more likely to display protective behaviours regardless of exposure to programmes. Unfortunately, the psychological literature has been hampered by the use of a confusing array of terms encompassing self esteem (e.g. self belief, self concept, self efficacy, self worth), and there has been extensive debate in the educational psychology literature about its role in children's learning (<LINK REF="REF-Valentine-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valentine 2004</LINK>). Greater levels of precision in definition and measurement are required in future research.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Knowledge</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analysis of data from 18 studies for questionnaire-based knowledge and 11 studies for vignette-based knowledge suggested gains in factual and applied knowledge immediately (up to two weeks) post-intervention. Follow-up assessment of factual knowledge was limited to four studies with our meta-analyses showing that factual knowledge scores did not deteriorate for either intervention or control groups one to six months after interventions. Follow-up assessment of applied knowledge was conducted in some studies, however data were incomplete and not suitable for meta-analysis. Across all of the included studies, less than half of the studies (10 of 24) reported on short-term knowledge outcomes (within three months of the intervention), three studies reported medium-term outcomes (up to 12 months post-intervention), and only one study measured retention of knowledge beyond 12 months. A methodological problem in these studies was data completeness because, at the time of follow-up, control groups had already been exposed to the programmes and it is unethical to withhold programme delivery. Well-designed and timely follow-up is required to determine whether factual and applied knowledge can be sustained over time with the use of boosters and other maintenance strategies (such as reiteration of programme messages by parents and teachers).</P>
<P>An important source of heterogeneity across studies is the knowledge measure used. For the 24 studies included in this review, 15 discrete questionnaire-based measures and six discrete vignette-based measures were used to measure children's factual and applied knowledge respectively. For studies included in the meta-analyses, there were 10 unique questionnaire-based measures and six unique vignette-based measures represented. These were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD) as a summary statistic. In using SMDs, we treated the different assessment measures as though they were one standardised measure with comparable standard deviations (SDs). It is then difficult to relate this abstract figure back to the original measures to determine what this means in real life. For example, it is not clear what a 0.61 SD increase in factual knowledge or a 0.45 SD increase in applied knowledge translates to in practical knowledge terms. Are these findings sufficient to offer protective effects under threats of sexual abuse? Further research is required to address the magnitude of knowledge improvement required to produce clinically important protective effects. Research would be improved by the use of standardised rather than custom-made instruments.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Harm</HEADING>
<P>Adverse or negative effects in the form of harm to participants were assessed via measures of child anxiety or fear. Studies examining participants' anxiety or fear were based on child self report and parent report. Meta-analysis of three studies found no evidence of increased or decreased anxiety or fear in those exposed to programmes and this did not change when adjusted for clustering. Narrative synthesis of included studies revealed that a small proportion of programme participants experienced anxiety or fear but these (anxieties or fears) were mild rather than severe, and short- rather than long-term. There was insufficient information to assess whether harms varied according to participant age or grade level. Although parent satisfaction data were collected in some studies, parental anxiety or fear was not measured in any study. This may be important in future studies for determining the role of parents in moderating programme effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Disclosures</HEADING>
<P>The only direct measure of programme effects was participants' disclosures of past or current sexual abuse that were made following interventions. Disclosures were poorly reported or not reported in most studies. Our meta-analysis of three studies showed greater odds of disclosures by children receiving interventions. However, such disclosures cannot really be considered an adverse event since: (i) the onset of the alleged abuse would have occurred prior to the intervention; (ii) disclosing abuse, while potentially traumatic, can also prompt the provision of treatment; and (iii) the identification and reporting of perpetrators may prevent harm to other children. Details of how disclosures were dealt with were not reported in any of the studies. Appropriate systems for dealing with disclosures are important and must reflect jurisdictional legal reporting obligations (also known as mandatory reporting laws), and school policies for child maltreatment recognition, reporting, and response. Future studies should consider methods for recording and responding to disclosures; data linkage to child protection or police records, or both; and/or interviewing or surveying participants at repeated follow-up intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup effects</HEADING>
<P>Demographic characteristics (e.g. participant age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, and ability level) are potential sources of heterogeneity, and potential effect moderators. If studies do not account for these characteristics, important subgroup effects may be missed. Genuine but unidentified differences in study samples at baseline are potential sources of heterogeneity within and across studies. Baseline characteristics of intervention and control groups were inconsistently and poorly reported in the included studies. Control for baseline characteristics within individual studies is particularly important for criteria that are most relevant to learning such as academic ability, or reading age. These data were not reported or were absent by study design, therefore we were not able to explore whether programme effectiveness varied according to key baseline criteria. These issues have implications for programme delivery.</P>
<P>Demographic characteristics, such as participant age, would appear to be straightforward variables, however, mean age was not reported in eight of 24 included studies and in others was conflated with grade level. Few studies were undertaken with single grades, and most (18 of 24) studies were undertaken with multiple grade levels together. This study design limited the pooling of results across studies in meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses showed that older children (grades four and above) made greater knowledge gains than younger children (grades kindergarten to three) immediately post-intervention; results that are congruent with developmental and maturation theories. However, we do not know if younger children would respond differently with differentiated approaches (e.g. reinforcement of skills and knowledge by parents or teachers, or both). We were unable to assess programme effectiveness according to other potentially important participant variables (e.g. child gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, and ability level) as few studies reported on these data or provided subgroup effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of effective programmes</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient data were provided to evaluate the specific effects of programme type, duration, frequency, or setting. These programme characteristics have implications for delivery in schools and the ideal constellation of programme characteristics, which is not yet known. Although there was insufficient information to develop programme typologies and compare effects, we noted that approximately half of the programmes in included studies used content, such as the teaching of safety rules (e.g. "my body belongs to me"), and prevention concepts (e.g. distinguishing appropriate and inappropriate touches), and the use of delivery methods such as discussion, modelling, role-play, rehearsal, and feedback. Our narrative synthesis of included studies documented multidimensionality in intervention contents, methods, and delivery. This is an important finding in itself. To date, programmes have been categorised dichotomously as active or passive or behavioural or instructional. Our descriptive analysis shows this categorisation to be somewhat artificial as most programmes in this review were multifaceted with multiple components. Programmes covered multiple topics (e.g. body safety rules, distinguishing types of touches, reporting abuse to adults who can help), used teaching strategies in combination (e.g. discussion, modelling, role-play, rehearsal, and feedback), and integrated active or passive and behavioural or instructional approaches in one session (e.g. a video or DVD presentation encouraged children to listen and then partake in activities). The contribution to effectiveness of programme content, methods, and delivery will require documentation using standardised data collection tools in future studies.</P>
<P>The duration and frequency (dose) of programme interventions varied from one single 45-minute session to eight 20-minute sessions. There were insufficient studies to create subgroup analyses for total programme hours, or total number of sessions, or for the presence or absence of booster sessions or reinforcement strategies.</P>
<P>While interventions appear to increase protective behaviours and knowledge about sexual abuse, it is important that this learning is not seen as a replacement for adult responsibility to ensure child safety. Nor should education replace the need for appropriate medical and legal handling of those affected by child sexual abuse. We do not have evidence that these programmes reduce the incidence of child sexual abuse. The findings of this review need to be considered in the context of complementary prevention initiatives. Current child sexual abuse prevention frameworks suggest that strategies must not only target children, but must work on multiple elements of children's social systems to prevent abuse from occurring in the first place, namely at the level of the family, community, and society (<LINK REF="REF-Smallbone-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smallbone 2008</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-04 11:52:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were conducted in countries with high and upper-middle income economies according to the World Bank's analytical income categories (<LINK REF="REF-The-World-Bank-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">The World Bank 2013</LINK>). Most (16 of 24) were conducted in North America, the remainder in Europe, East Asia, and Central Asia. Ethnicity data were poorly or not reported in 10 of the 24 studies. Where data were reported, participants were from a diverse range of ethnicities, increasing the generalisability of the evidence, and also suggesting that concern about child sexual abuse prevention and the delivery of programmes in schools is a wide-spread phenomenon. Whether similar effects would be seen when programmes are implemented in countries not included is unknown.</P>
<P>All but one of the included studies was conducted in primary (elementary) school settings. There are several possible reasons for this. First, policy makers and school authorities may truly recognise that the age of greatest vulnerability is within the earlier school years (7 to 12 years according to <LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1986</LINK>). Second, from our searches, we gleaned that programmes for secondary (high) school students tended to be broader in scope and focused on the prevention of relationship and dating violence, sexually coercive peer relationships, sexual harassment, or sexual assault (see <LINK REF="REF-Fellmeth-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fellmeth 2013</LINK>). The purpose of these programmes was not predominantly prevention of child sexual abuse, the focus of this review. In our searches we noted a sizeable group of studies based in preschool settings, the effectiveness of which requires further scrutiny in a separate systematic review given that these programmes have qualitatively different delivery methods and contents, including greater parental participation, which we infer may have a mediating effect.</P>
<P>None of the included studies investigated the effectiveness of a web-based or online programme. This may be because rigorous programme evaluations have not yet been developed, conducted, or published. Online programmes offer the potential for technology to capture real-time evaluation data from children as they experience online interventions.</P>
<P>As noted above, the completeness and applicability of evidence was limited by methodology and failure to report the full range of child, intervention, and study design characteristics that could possibly account for variations in programme effects. In the period since the original review was conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Zwi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwi 2007</LINK>), Cochrane Reviews have become more rigorous in identifying methodological limitations in trials via risk of bias analyses, and the CONSORT statement has been developed to provide guidance on the reporting of randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Shulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulz 2010</LINK>). Nevertheless, the methodological quality of trials has not improved substantially. No study in this area has yet published a study protocol, and we found no clinical trials register records pertaining to studies of this type. Researchers must continue testing these interventions, but use study design methodology, data collection tools, registration, and reporting guidelines that enable rigorous scientific evaluation.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> presents the quality of evidence for each outcome of interest. We downgraded the quality of evidence to moderate quality either due to risk of bias, imprecision, or because of the impact of adjusting for the effect of clustering within some of the studies. Most studies in this review were at an unclear risk of selection bias as illustrated in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>, due to inadequate information regarding methods of random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Studies which randomised classes within a single school to intervention and control groups were at high risk of contamination effects owing to the interaction of children in school playgrounds, friendship groups and families, and also from chance exposure to programme concepts via teachers and other school staff familiar with programme contents. In addition, there was detection bias due to inadequate or unclear assessor, participant and personnel blinding, and inadequate or unclear reporting of attrition for assessments at post-test and follow-up. Double-blinding to minimise performance bias is seldom possible in school-based trials as group membership is obvious to participants, programme facilitators, and school staff. Blinding of staff responsible for assessing study outcomes can be controlled with careful planning and implementation. This would be particularly effective where outcome assessments are administered with children individually. However, group administration of self report questionnaires or vignette measures may be more susceptible to bias when used with younger participants who are not yet able to read independently. Alternative administration methods, including the use of digital devices and animations, may go some distance to minimising detection bias.</P>
<P>In 14 of the included studies children were randomised in groups of classrooms, schools, or school districts for ease of implementation. However, the appropriate analysis for cluster-randomisation was not used in any of the studies resulting in potential for overestimation of the effects of interventions. Initial analyses do not take account of unit of analysis errors that occurred in at least half of the studies in each meta-analysis. ICCs used in the meta-analysis are imputed and may not be appropriate for all of the studies included. Therefore, results might have differed had the true ICCs from these studies been available, or had cluster-adjusted results been provided by the authors. Furthermore, the same ICC was used for studies that had undertaken cluster-randomisation at class, school, and district level, which could further overestimate the magnitude of the findings.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-03-04 09:28:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In producing this review our aim was to provide an unbiased appraisal of the evidence available. We have attempted, therefore, to be comprehensive in our reporting and transparent in our methodology. The review was conducted in line with criteria in the published protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Zwi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwi 2003</LINK>), and where we deviated from these criteria to accommodate updates in Cochrane review methods or advances in the field, we have documented this in the subsection on <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>. The methodological decision to produce each meta-analysis was complex, involving a balance between the quest for an easily digestible summary of the information, and the danger of applying results when significant methodological caveats exist. We present the meta-analyses with accompanying cautions as outlined above, and invite debate and comments regarding the route we have chosen.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-03-04 11:52:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five previous meta-analyses of sexual abuse prevention programmes exist as noted in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, including the original version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Zwi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwi 2007</LINK>). Our review differs from previous reviews in that it assesses a broader range of outcomes, applies more rigorous inclusion criteria to select high quality studies, and excludes preschool programmes. Further, all previous reviews included studies with control groups but did not apply randomisation criteria, therefore unlike our review, previous reviews included controlled before-and-after studies. All previous reviews have found medium to large effects for knowledge outcomes in favour of intervention groups. These effect sizes ranged from 0.57 (<LINK REF="REF-Heidotting-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heidotting 1994</LINK>, 18 studies), through 0.71 (<LINK REF="REF-Rispens-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rispens 1997</LINK>, 16 studies) and 0.90 (<LINK REF="REF-Berrick-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berrick 1992</LINK>, 13 studies) to 1.07 (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2000</LINK>, 27 studies). Our previous review found a SMD of 0.59 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.74; nine studies, n = 3022) for the questionnaire-based knowledge outcome, which is the outcome most comparable to the outcomes reported in previous reviews. The current review found a SMD of 0.61 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.78; 18 studies, n = 4657).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2000</LINK> attempted subgroup analyses to examine moderator effects: age (mean age was divided into three groups: three to five years, 5.1 to eight years, older than eight years of age), level of participation (participation was analysed at three different levels: physical participation, verbal participation, no participation), and number of sessions (three subsets: one session, two to three sessions, more than three sessions). Due to inadequate reporting of study data, we were unable to replicate these meta-analyses, and would caution against using the broad variable of participation as the only marker for programme variation. Given that most programmes include multiple participatory opportunities, often in combination, it may be more informative to develop and explore the effects of multidimensional programme typologies as noted above.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-04-09 02:21:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-04-09 02:21:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our overall interpretation is that there is moderate quality evidence that school-based programmes for the prevention of child sexual abuse, of the types described in this review, are effective in increasing primary (elementary) school-aged children's protective behaviours and knowledge immediately post-intervention. Knowledge scores did not deteriorate for intervention participants one to six months after programme participation, signalling that booster sessions or other maintenance strategies for reinforcement of key messages remain appropriate follow-up strategies. Retention of knowledge should be measured beyond six months. It appears that older children make greater knowledge gains than younger children when tested using questionnaire-based measures, but not when using vignette-based measures, indicating the need for caution when interpreting study findings. None of the included studies evaluated programmes delivered via electronic means. On balance of evidence, programmes do not appear to increase or decrease children's fear or anxiety, and may result in greater odds of disclosures of past or current sexual abuse from children who have been programme participants, however results are uncertain because of inappropriate data analysis in individual studies. Hence, there is a need for ongoing monitoring of both positive and negative short- and long-term effects of programmes in more rigorous studies with more detailed reporting of potential moderators of programme effects in the form of child, programme, and contextual characteristics.</P>
<P>Currently, schools implement a variety of interventions aimed at preventing child sexual abuse. It is likely that these interventions will be most useful as part of wider community initiatives promoting the safety of children, the contents, processes, and outcomes of which must be clearly defined and measured in rigorous evaluation designs. Furthermore, children's increased knowledge of abuse should not be seen as a replacement for society's responsibility to ensure child safety. It must be emphasised that increasing children's knowledge in this area does not mean they are in any way responsible for abuse, which might then occur by their not being able to apply this knowledge in an actual abuse situation. Even if successful in only a small proportion of situations, given the prevalence of child sexual abuse, it is possible that the skills and knowledge learned in prevention programmes may be of assistance to a considerable number of children.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-04 12:55:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further evidence is required to assess the effectiveness of school-based programmes for the prevention of child sexual abuse. The current evidence is primarily focused on improvements in participants' skills (protective behaviours) and knowledge (both factual and applied knowledge), and to a lesser extent on assessing harm (child anxiety or fear) and disclosures of past or current child sexual abuse. Further research is needed to investigate the links (if any) between programme participation and actual prevention of child sexual abuse. This will require large cohort studies with repeated follow-up into adulthood. However, even large cohort studies may not provide definitive evidence for changes in child sexual abuse incidence, as it is under-identified and difficult to prove. Further research is also required to address uncertainties about the magnitude of skill or knowledge improvement (or both) that can (if at all) translate to clinically important protective effects. Such evidence is a necessary precursor to assessing programmes' cost-effectiveness.</P>
<P>Ongoing research is needed to more rigorously evaluate programmes. Research to date suggests several categories of factors that may influence programme effectiveness, such as child factors, including family microsystem factors; programme factors, including school contextual factors; and evaluation design factors (<LINK REF="REF-Heidotting-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heidotting 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rispens-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rispens 1997</LINK>). These require further investigation in well-designed experimental studies. Many demographic and other independent variables were poorly reported in the included studies. Reliable evidence of this type will advance assessment of programmes' cultural sensitivity, and the appropriateness of programmes for groups of children considered at greater risk. Future evaluations must be more comprehensive, use valid, reliable, standardised measures, and be more precisely reported, according to evidence-based guidelines for reporting of clinical trials such as the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement (<LINK REF="REF-Shulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulz 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further investigation of programme contents, methods, and delivery is required with a view to developing programme typologies that can incorporate the programmes' multidimensionality. To this end, typologies should be developed that capture variables emerging as important in newly developed frameworks for child sexual abuse prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Smallbone-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smallbone 2008</LINK>), such as the extent and nature of parent, teacher, and community education components within programmes.</P>
<P>Future studies should address problems with study design, in particular unit of analysis errors in cluster-randomised trials. Studies where cluster-randomisation is used should adjust results with appropriate statistical methods, and publish intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2004</LINK>). It may then be possible for meta-analyses to be more robust, and to overcome inadequate sample size and study power to test for differences in child characteristics and intervention types. Other design features that warrant particular attention in future studies include those domains associated with risk of bias: randomisation of study participants, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, reporting of attrition, and analysis based on intention-to-treat (ITT). Longer follow-up periods for measurement of study outcomes beyond six months are essential to monitor maintenance effects.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2015-04-09 02:22:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are five main differences between the protocol, <LINK REF="REF-Zwi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwi 2003</LINK>, and the review update.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Types of outcome measures. On p 2 of the review protocol, five outcomes were specified: (i) the development of protective behaviours; (ii) knowledge of sexual abuse and abuse prevention concepts; (iii) retention of knowledge over time; (iv) parental or child anxiety; and (v) disclosure of sexual abuse by child or adolescent during or after participating in programmes. In this review update we reported on six more precise outcomes: (i) protective behaviours; (ii) knowledge (questionnaire-based knowledge and vignette-based knowledge); (iii) retention of protective behaviours over time; (iv) retention of knowledge over time; (v) harm manifesting as parental or child anxiety or fear; and (vi) disclosures of past or current child sexual abuse.</LI>
<LI>Measures of treatment effect. On p 4 of the review protocol, calculation of odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous outcomes was specified in strategies for data synthesis, while relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) were specified for reporting on dichotomous measures of treatment effects. In this review update, we used the OR as this is the statistic used most often in this field and for ease of interpretation.</LI>
<LI>Unit of analysis issues. On p 4 of the review protocol, we indicated we would adjust for unit of analysis errors where the ICC was available. However, ICCs were not reported in the studies or available from study authors. Instead, we used estimates of 0.1 and 0.2 that had been previously used in a review of school-based violence prevention programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Mytton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mytton 2006</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Dealing with missing data. Requirements for Cochrane Reviews have changed since this study's protocol was written. In this review update we identified the following types of missing data: missing outcomes, missing summary data, and missing participants. For missing outcomes (e.g. disclosures, adverse outcomes) and missing summary data (i.e. group size totals, means, standard deviations (SDs)), we contacted corresponding study authors to provide outstanding data.</LI>
<LI>Data synthesis. Before starting the 2015 update of this review we had intended to combine data with a fixed effect model in the absence of moderate statistical heterogeneity (I square &lt;30%) and to adopt a random effects model where I square exceeded this threshold. Further consideration of the differences between the characteristics of the included studies prompted us to revise this approach. We decided to use a random effects model throughout the review in the expectation that variation between the results of the studies represented a distribution of related intervention effects.</LI>
<LI>Subgroup analyses. On p 4 of the review protocol, we specified the conduct of subgroup analyses to determine differential effects according to participant age, gender and previous reported abuse, and intervention type (passive or active involvement of participants). Subgroup analyses were only conducted for age, but not for other variables, as there was insufficient information provided in the included studies.</LI>

<P>Intervention 1: "The Safe Child Program" (written by Kraizer for this PhD) for children aged 3 to 10 years. Phase 1 is teacher training; phase 2 is parent training; phase 3 is training with the children</P>
<UL>
<LI>Content (of the child component): your body belongs to you; you have a right to say who touches you and how; if someone touches you in a way that you do not like, in a way that makes you feel funny or uncomfortable, or in a way that you think is wrong, it's okay to say no; if the person does not stop, say "I'm going to tell"; if you have a problem, or if something like this is happening to you, tell and keep telling until someone helps you; adults cannot read your mind, you need to communicate clearly and fully; touch should never have to be a secret. Programme also includes: prevention of abuse and abduction by strangers (as in <LINK REF="STD-Fryer-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Fryer 1987a</LINK> above); prevention of physical and emotional abuse; safety in self care</LI>
<LI>Methods: the video tape teaches concepts, skills and words. Classroom teachers use role-play and classroom activities used to "turn the concepts into skills for each child" (p 17)</LI>
