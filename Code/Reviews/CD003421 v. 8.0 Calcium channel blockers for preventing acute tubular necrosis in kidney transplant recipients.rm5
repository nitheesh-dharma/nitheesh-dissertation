<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Calcium channel blockers can reduce the death of tubular cells in the kidney after a transplant operation</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the sudden death of tubular cells in the kidney. ATN can happen after a kidney transplant if the kidney does not receive enough oxygen. Calcium channel blockers stop calcium ions flowing into the muscle cells of the heart and blood vessels. These blockers cause the muscles to widen and relax, lowering a person's blood pressure and improving their circulation. The review of 13 studies (724 participants) found that giving calcium channel blockers during a kidney transplant operation reduces the chance of ATN after the operation. The effect of giving the blockers after the operation still needs to be investigated.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>) MEDLINE (from 1966) and EMBASE (from 1980). The Trials Search Coordinator was contacted to develop the search strategy.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirteen trials (724 participants) were suitable for inclusion. Treatment with calcium channel blockers in the peri-transplant period was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of post-transplant ATN (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85) and delayed graft function (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.73). There was no difference between control and treatment groups in graft loss, mortality, requirement for haemodialysis. There was insufficient information to comment on adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>These results suggest that calcium channel blockers given in the peri-operative period may reduce the incidence of ATN post-transplantation. The result should be treated with caution due to the heterogeneity of the trials which made comparison of studies and pooling of data difficult.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-22 21:34:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-22 20:50:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The incidence of delayed graft function in cadaveric grafts has increased over the last few years for both primary and re-grafts. In 1999 the incidence of delayed graft function in Australia was 24% for primary grafts and 42% for re-grafts (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2000</LINK>). This high incidence is in part due to the large demand for cadaveric kidneys, which has necessitated the use of kidneys from marginal donors, and also the increase in total ischaemic time (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2000</LINK>). Grafts with delayed function have a poorer long-term survival than grafts that function immediately, with the difference between the two appearing after the first year and reaching 10% by nine years post-transplant (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2000</LINK>). The United States Renal Data System (USRDS) annual data report for 2006 defines delayed graft function as the need for dialysis during the first week after transplant. The rate of delayed graft function in 2004 was similar to the rate published in 1995 (21.4% and 20.9% respectively) (<LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>After ischaemia there is a rise in intracellular calcium which has a number of detrimental effects including; a rise in intra-mitochondrial calcium concentration which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and reduces ATP production (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1984</LINK>), activation of phospholipases causing an alteration in membrane enzyme and membrane damage (<LINK REF="REF-Chien-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chien 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matthys-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthys 1984</LINK>) and free radical generation (<LINK REF="REF-McCord-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCord 1985</LINK>). Renal vasoconstriction also occurs.</P>
<P>Calcium channel blockers have the potential to protect glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during renal ischaemia by several mechanisms. These include,</P>
<UL>
<LI>Prevention of the rise in intra-mitochondrial calcium</LI>
<LI>Prevention of re-perfusion injury</LI>
<LI>Increased renal blood flow</LI>
<LI>Selective dilatation of pre-glomerular vessels</LI>
<LI>Restoration of normal autoregulation during increased sympathetic stimulation</LI>
</UL>
<P>Evidence that calcium channel blockers are beneficial if given after the ischaemic event is not forthcoming. Most patients with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) present after the ischaemic event and therefore calcium channel blockers are unlikely to improve GFR in this situation. They do, however, have the potential to reduce the incidence of post-transplant ATN if given in the peri-operative period. In reality there is controversy surrounding their use in this particular situation, with authors disagreeing as to their effectiveness in reducing the incidence of initial non-function of the graft (<LINK REF="STD-Donmez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Donmez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harper-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ladefoged-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ladefoged 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 1996</LINK>). In addition, the studies use a variety of calcium channel blockers from different classes, given by different routes over different time periods. The issue is further clouded by the fact that some calcium channel blockers (especially diltiazem) may exert an immunosuppressive effect (<LINK REF="REF-Mandreoli-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandreoli 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McMillen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMillen 1985</LINK>). Diltiazem interacts with cyclosporin and cyclosporin A pharmacokinetics and lower doses of these immunosuppressive drugs can be given to obtain therapeutic levels (<LINK REF="REF-Chrysostomou-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chrysostomou 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1998</LINK>). Calcium channel blockers also minimise vasoconstrictive cyclosporin nephrotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Asberg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asberg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berg 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our aim was to review the literature and assess the effect calcium channel blockers given in the peri-transplant period had on the incidence of post-transplant ATN.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>Different calcium channel blockers clearly act in a number of ways in the transplant situation and separating out their various effects is difficult. However, we aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of using calcium channel blockers in the peri-transplant period in patients at risk of ATN following kidney transplantation. We only looked at the effect on delayed graft function due to amelioration of ATN which all calcium channel blockers have the potential to do. We did not examine in great detail the incidence of acute rejection episodes which is a different issue, and one which is not applicable to all calcium channel blockers.</P>

<P>Dichotomous outcomes (need for rescue medication, rate of pain recurrence, adverse event rate) results are expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data was pooled using the random effects model but the fixed effect model was also analysed to ensure robustness of the model chosen and susceptibility to outliers. Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (patient-rated pain scores, time to pain relief), the mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales were used. Heterogeneity was analysed using a Chi squared test on N-1 degrees of freedom, with a P of 0.05 used for statistical significance and the I statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). I values of 25%, 50% and 75% correspond to low, medium and high levels of heterogeneity respectively.</P>
<P>Analysis was used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity (e.g. participants, treatments and study quality). Heterogeneity among participants could be related to age, stone size/site, and drug route/dose and where possible these subgroups were explored. Heterogeneity in treatments could be related to prior agent(s) used and the agent, dose and duration of therapy. Where possible, the risk difference (RD) with 95% CI was to be calculated for adverse effects.</P>
<P>The applicability of the results to individual patients will be determined by calculating the reduction in risk of developing ATN post-transplant in the treatment groups relative to the risk of post-transplant ATN in the groups not given calcium channel blockers.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Very few studies have been designed specifically to look at the effect that calcium channel blockers have on the development of ATN post-transplantation. This meta-analysis of thirteen studies showed that the use of calcium channel blockers in the peri-operative period reduced the incidence of ATN post-transplantation. However, this result should be treated with caution due to the small number and heterogeneity of trials. Immunosuppression post-transplant was not comparable between groups, although all patients were on a calcineurin inhibitor. In addition, the type and administration of the calcium channel blockers varied between studies. In seven of the studies the graft was not perfused with perfusate containing calcium channel blocker and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Neumayer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Neumayer 1989</LINK>) assessed the effect of calcium channel blocker by only treating the donor kidney. The use of different types of calcium channel blockers may have affected the outcome. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lustig-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lustig 1996</LINK> did not show a significant difference between calcium channel blocker and placebo groups but, when analysed separately, the clinical course of recipients who received kidneys from donors aged greater than 50 years showed a significantly higher rate of ATN in the placebo group compared to matched calcium channel blocker recipients (91% versus 36%, P &lt; 0.02). Donor age and cold ischaemic times were apparently comparable (no data provided) but the age of recipients in the treatment group was significantly lower. By three months post-transplant there was no significant difference in serum creatinine. This finding needs further investigation as the use of kidneys from older donors is becoming much more common place due to the shortage of kidneys for transplantation. If this result can be reduplicated calcium channel blockers may have a role in reducing the risk of ATN in high-risk patients receiving kidneys from older donors.</P>
<P>Only one study routinely performed biopsies to confirm the clinical diagnosis of ATN, and the definition of ATN differed widely between studies, which contributes to the difficulty in comparing studies and pooling data. <B>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>
</B>
<BR/>The small number of studies available for review is disappointing and makes it difficult to come to any definite conclusion about the effects of calcium channel blockers on ATN in the post-transplant period. Overall study quality was poor with only one study having adequate allocation concealment. Inadequate allocation concealment may over exaggerate the efficacy of the experimental treatment and meta-analysis of trials with inadequate allocation concealment can overestimate the benefits of treatment.</P>
<P>Exclusion of unpublished trials will result in publication bias. As unpublished trials are more likely to show no effect of treatment, publication bias will also over estimate the benefits of treatment. Funnel plot asymmetry will indicate whether or not bias is present but due to the small number of studies was not possible. </P>
<P>It is difficult to assess what the long-term gain of a decrease in the incidence of ATN, as patients were followed up at different time periods and for different lengths of time. It would appear from the limited data available that calcium channel blockers given in the peri-operative period have no effect on renal function at three and six months post-transplant.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Calcium channel blockers given in the peri-operative period appear to reduce the incidence of ATN post-transplantation. The result should be treated with caution due to the small number of trials available and the heterogeneity of the trials, in particular the use of different calcium channel blockers given by different routes, the different definitions of ATN/initial non-function, marked differences in the immunosuppressive regimens and different lengths of follow-up. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Studies designed specifically to determine the relationship between the post-operative administration of calcium channel blockers and the incidence of ATN post-transplantation are still desirable. They should also assess the long-term benefits of any reduction in ATN. Subsequent trials should include protocol biopsies.</P>
