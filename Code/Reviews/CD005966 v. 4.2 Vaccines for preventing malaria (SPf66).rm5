<DESCRIPTION>
<P>2006, Issue 2: The original review of malaria vaccines (<LINK REF="REF-Graves-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graves 2003</LINK>) has been divided into three parts: SPf66, pre-erythrocytic, and blood-stage vaccines. This review includes only SPf66 trials; because of this change the text of the review has been completely rewritten. No new trials of SPf66 have been added since the original review, although additional publications from previously included trials have been added. The SPf66 trials have been subgrouped into Africa, South America, and Asia, instead of just the former two categories, for some outcomes. The second year of follow up for two trials in The Gambia has been added. Risk ratio is used as the default measure of effect.</P>

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>The SPf66 vaccine has little or no effect on preventing malaria</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The SPf66 vaccine was one of the first malaria vaccines to be tested extensively in endemic areas. SPf66 is a synthetic peptide vaccine containing antigens from the blood stages of malaria linked together with an antigen from the sporozoite stage. SPf66 has had 10 trials in Africa, Asia, and South America. Results were initially promising, but further trials showed only a small effect in some trials, and no effect in Africa. There is no evidence that SPf66 is effective enough to be introduced on a routine basis for prevention of malaria.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>A malaria vaccine is badly needed. SPf66 was one of the earliest vaccines developed. It is a synthetic peptide vaccine containing antigens from the blood stages of malaria linked together with an antigen from the sporozoite stage, and is targeted mainly against the blood (asexual) stages.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effect of SPf66 malaria vaccines against <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I>, <I>P. vivax</I>, <I>P. malariae,</I> and <I>P. ovale</I> in preventing infection, disease, and death.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-11 09:54:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (March 2008), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2008), EMBASE (1980 to March 2008), LILACS (1982 to March 2008), Science Citation Index (1981 to March 2008), and reference lists of articles.

<P>Two people independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, including adverse events. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Ten efficacy trials of SPf66 involving 9698 participants were included. Results with SPf66 in reducing new episodes of <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria were heterogeneous: it was not effective in four African trials (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; 2371 participants) or in one Asian trial (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.25; 1221 participants). In four trials in South America the number of first attacks with <I>P. falciparum</I> was reduced by 28% (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82; 3807 participants). It did not reduce episodes of <I>P. vivax </I>malaria or admission to hospital with severe malaria. Trials have not indicated any serious adverse events with SPf66 vaccine.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence for protection by SPf66 vaccines against <I>P. falciparum</I> in Africa. There is a modest reduction in attacks of <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria following vaccination with SPf66 in South America. There is no justification for further trials of SPf66 in its current formulation. Further research with SPf66 vaccines in South America or with new formulations of SPf66 may be justified.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-04 14:27:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Malaria is caused by four species of the parasitic protozoan <I>Plasmodium,</I> which are transmitted by many species of anopheline mosquitoes. <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> is the most widespread and also the most serious form. Recent estimates of the annual number of clinical malaria cases worldwide range from 214 to 397 million (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Breman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breman 2004</LINK>), although a higher estimate of 515 million (range 300 to 660 million) clinical cases of <I>P. falciparum</I> in 2002 has been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Snow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2005</LINK>). Estimates of annual mortality (nearly all from <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria) are thought to be around 1.1 million (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Breman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breman 2004</LINK>). Malaria deaths are believed to account for 3% of the world's total Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost and 10% of DALYs in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Breman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breman 2004</LINK>). Malaria also significantly increases the risk of childhood death from other causes (<LINK REF="REF-Snow-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2004</LINK>). Almost half of the world's population is exposed to the risk of malaria where they live (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 2004</LINK>), as are the increasing numbers of visitors to malarious areas.</P>
<P>Despite continued efforts to control malaria it remains a major health problem in many regions of the world, and new ways to prevent the disease are urgently needed. Early optimism for vaccines was tempered as the problems caused by genetic (hence, antigenic) variability of the parasite and the difficulty of generating high levels of durable immunity emerged. Recently, hope has been renewed by the development of several new vaccine candidates and delivery systems, as well as new formulations and adjuvants for previously existing candidates (<LINK REF="REF-Richie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richie 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ballou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballou 2004</LINK>). Vaccines currently under evaluation include recombinant proteins, synthetic peptides (including multiple antigen peptides), DNA vaccines, inactivated whole parasites, and vaccines comprising mixtures of a large variety of potential antigens.</P>
<P>To be effective, a malaria vaccine could either prevent infection altogether or mitigate against severe disease and death in those who become infected despite vaccination. Four stages of the malaria parasite's life cycle (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) have been the targets of vaccine development efforts. The first two stages are often grouped as 'pre-erythrocytic stages' (ie before the parasite invades the human red blood cells): these are the sporozoites inoculated by the mosquito into the human bloodstream, and the parasites developing inside human liver cells. The other two targets are the stage when the parasite is invading or growing in the red blood cells (blood, merozoite, or erythrocytic stage); and the gametocyte stage, when the parasites emerge from red blood cells and fuse to form a zygote inside the mosquito vector (gametocyte, gamete or sexual stage). Vaccines based on the pre-erythrocytic stages usually aim to completely prevent infection, while blood stage vaccines aim to reduce (and preferably eliminate) the parasite load once a person has been infected. Gametocyte vaccines would prevent the parasite being transmitted to others through mosquitoes. An ideal vaccine would be effective against all parasite stages (<LINK REF="REF-Richie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richie 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the complexity and wide range of malaria vaccines under development, we have chosen to consider them in three categories: (1) the SPf66 vaccine; (2) pre-erythrocytic vaccines (<LINK REF="REF-Graves-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graves 2006a</LINK>); and the (3) blood-stage vaccines (<LINK REF="REF-Graves-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graves 2006b</LINK>). This review considers trials of SPf66 vaccine, while other types of malaria vaccine are covered in separate forthcoming reviews; reviews of multi-stage and transmission-blocking vaccines will also be prepared when they have reached the trial stage.</P>
<P>The SPf66 vaccine was first formulated and tested in Colombia (<LINK REF="STD-Patarroyo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Patarroyo 1988</LINK>) and later also manufactured in the USA. SPf66 is a synthetic hybrid peptide polymer containing amino acid sequences derived from three <I>P. falciparum</I> asexual blood stage proteins (83, 55, and 35 kilodaltons) linked by repeat sequences from a protein found on the <I>P. falciparum</I> sporozoite surface (circumsporozoite protein). Therefore it is technically a multistage vaccine. SPf66 was one of the first types of vaccine to be tested in randomized controlled trials in endemic areas and is the vaccine that has undergone the most extensive field testing to date.</P>
<P>We have systematically reviewed the trials conducted to estimate the efficacy of SPf66 vaccine. Trials of SPf66 have been subgrouped by area of the world because the transmission rate of malaria is generally more intense in Africa than in South America and Asia. In this way we explore possible variation in efficacy dependent on the level of exposure of the host to infective mosquito bites, the age of the participants, and the seasonality of transmission, all of which contribute to the immune status of people living in the areas, which, in turn, can affect the response to a vaccine.</P>

<BR/>Ten trials involving 9698 participants aged from one month to 86 years met the inclusion criteria. These trials were done during the years 1990 to 1998. Four of the SPf66 vaccine trials were conducted in South America (<LINK REF="STD-Valero-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Valero 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sempertegui-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sempertegui 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valero-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Valero 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Urdaneta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Urdaneta 1998</LINK>), five in Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Alonso-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Alessandro-1995" TYPE="STUDY">D'Alessandro 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leach-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masinde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Masinde 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Acosta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Acosta 1999</LINK>), and one in Asia (<LINK REF="STD-Nosten-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nosten 1996</LINK>). All the included SPf66 trials were conducted in situations of natural challenge.</P>
<P>The decision about which age group to include in a vaccine trial is based partly on epidemiological considerations and partly on safety concerns. Different areas vary greatly in endemicity, and this has consequences for the age-specific incidence of infection, and of severe disease and death. Repeated malarial infections and inoculations of sporozoites from mosquitoes (even if not causing clinical disease) gradually result in the development of what is referred to as 'partial' immunity, and as a result, fewer full-blown infections become likely. When an infection does become established, the numbers of parasites are generally lower than they are in people with no experience of infection, hence no immunity. Because clinical manifestations are related to the parasite density, clinical manifestations are generally less serious (or absent) in people with partial immunity than in immune 'naïve' individuals. In most of sub-Saharan Africa, malaria infection begins early in life. Very young children, who have yet to develop any immunity to malaria, suffer the most infections and the most severe consequences of infection. However in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Thailand, there are non-immune people (and therefore, symptomatic infections) among all age groups. As a result, most African trials have involved young children while other trials have included older children, all ages, or adults only. The exception in Africa was <LINK REF="STD-Masinde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Masinde 1998</LINK>, which was conducted with adults.</P>

The <LINK REF="STD-Urdaneta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Urdaneta 1998</LINK> trial included people aged seven to 60 years. The <LINK REF="STD-Nosten-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nosten 1996</LINK> trial included children aged two to 15 years. Four trials were in children in areas of high endemicity: age at first dose was one to five years in <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 1994</LINK>; six to 11 months in <LINK REF="STD-Leach-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Alessandro-1995" TYPE="STUDY">D'Alessandro 1995</LINK>; and one month in <LINK REF="STD-Acosta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Acosta 1999</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose</HEADING>
<P>All but one trial used doses of 0.5 to 2 mg of SPf66 vaccine given at day zero, and one and six months; the <LINK REF="STD-Masinde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Masinde 1998</LINK> trial gave doses at day zero, four months, and seven to eight months, but the doses are not stated. In all trials except one, experimental and placebo vaccines were given at visits specifically for that purpose. In <LINK REF="STD-Acosta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Acosta 1999</LINK>, the trial was designed to coincide with the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccine schedule, so the first two doses of vaccine or placebo were given at the same time as the first and second diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTP) vaccine (injected into the opposite thigh); oral polio vaccine was also given at both visits. The third dose was given at a specialized visit except for 39 children (3%), who received dose three concurrently with measles vaccine.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition of a clinical malaria case</HEADING>
<P>Because of the differing levels of endemicity, trials used different definitions of a clinical malaria case. In the <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 1994</LINK> trial and both trials in The Gambia (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Alessandro-1995" TYPE="STUDY">D'Alessandro 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leach-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 1995</LINK>), the trials used fever together with a defined level of malaria parasites as a case definition, after having determined a cut-off level using the percentage of fevers which were likely attributable to malaria. In the <LINK REF="STD-Acosta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Acosta 1999</LINK> trial, the primary outcome was the incidence of fever with any level of parasitaemia, although secondary analyses requiring at least certain levels of parasitaemia to define a case were also performed. In other endemic areas, the presence of parasitaemia alone, parasitaemia with fever, or parasitaemia with clinical symptoms defined a case. Case definitions are noted under 'Outcomes' in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Use of antimalarial drugs</HEADING>
<P>In three of the five African trials of SPf66, parasites were cleared from all participants by chemotherapy before or shortly after vaccination (before each dose in the <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 1994</LINK> trial, before the first and third doses in the <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Alessandro-1995" TYPE="STUDY">D'Alessandro 1995</LINK> trial, and one week after the second and third doses in the <LINK REF="STD-Masinde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Masinde 1998</LINK> trial). This was done because of the high prevalence of parasitaemia in the target population and the difficulty this created for determining the incidence of new infections. In the <LINK REF="STD-Nosten-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nosten 1996</LINK> trial in Thailand, children found to be parasitaemic at surveys conducted before vaccination or on the day of vaccination were treated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Detecting malaria cases</HEADING>
<P>Some trials detected malaria cases when participants reported for treatment (passive case detection), some conducted population-based surveys at regular intervals (active case detection), and most used a combination of the two. The <LINK REF="STD-Nosten-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nosten 1996</LINK> trial conducted the most intensive active surveillance (daily home visitation for 15 months) combined with cross-sectional surveys and detection of self-reported cases. In this review, for outcomes that include clinical malaria episodes (cases), both self-reported cases and results of population-based surveys have been combined, where possible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence and prevalence of malaria</HEADING>
<P>All trials reported on the incidence or prevalence of <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria after vaccination. Incidence of <I>P. vivax</I> was also reported in all five trials conducted outside Africa. <I>P. malariae</I> is present at a low level in the African sites of trials, but incidence of this species after vaccination was not reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Length of follow up</HEADING>
<P>Total length of follow up in the SPf66 trials ranged from eight months to two years. The two Gambian trials continued follow up into the second year after vaccination, although intensive surveillance was only conducted during 18 weeks of the malaria season in the second year of each trial (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Alessandro-1995" TYPE="STUDY">D'Alessandro 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leach-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 1995</LINK>). In this review, the results of the first and second malaria seasons are reported separately.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes that we were able to extract from the trials were as follows: new malaria episode (<I>P. falciparum</I>) &#8722; by year of follow up in two trials; new malaria episode (<I>P. vivax</I>); death; admission to hospital; admission to hospital with diagnosis of malaria; prevalence of malaria; and adverse events.

<P>The proportion of participants lost to follow up was high in five of the 10 SPf66 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Valero-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Valero 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sempertegui-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sempertegui 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valero-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Valero 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masinde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Masinde 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Urdaneta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Urdaneta 1998</LINK>). In three of the South American trials, more than 20% of participants receiving the first vaccine dose withdrew before completion of the vaccine schedule (<LINK REF="STD-Valero-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Valero 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valero-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Valero 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Urdaneta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Urdaneta 1998</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Valero-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Valero 1993</LINK>, of those failing to complete the doses, one third were excluded because of "fever, allergy, pregnancy or malaria treatment" although the number due to each cause and breakdown by group is not provided. The rest were excluded because of absence, migration, or refusal. The high level of post-randomization exclusions led to an imbalance in numbers between vaccine and placebo groups in this trial and is a potential source of bias. This potential bias seemed to be less of a problem in <LINK REF="STD-Urdaneta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Urdaneta 1998</LINK> since the losses were of similar proportion in the two trial arms, and analysis showed that the losses were independent of malaria parasitaemia or adverse reactions to vaccine.</P>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Alessandro-1995" TYPE="STUDY">D'Alessandro 1995</LINK> trial, although the dropout rate was small, a mistake in coding syringes necessitated exclusion of a large number of the placebo group who wrongly received vaccine, leading to an imbalance in numbers between groups.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. New malaria episode (P. falciparum)</HEADING>
<P>Nine trials used new episodes of <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria as their primary outcome and reported data on the incidence of the first or only attack of clinical malaria. One trial reported prevalence as the major outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Masinde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Masinde 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Considering the trials individually, two trials showed significant protective effect against a new malaria infection (<LINK REF="STD-Valero-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Valero 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valero-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Valero 1996</LINK>) and the rest did not (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The combined RR from all nine trials was 0.90 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.96), giving an estimated vaccine efficacy of 10% (95% CI 4% to 16%). However, there was large heterogeneity between trials (chi-squared 29.10, df 8, <I>I</I>
<SUP>2</SUP> 72.5%), indicating that a combined estimate may not be a fair representation of the 'typical' effect of the vaccine.</P>
<P>The endemicity of malaria is greater in Africa than in the other sites of trials, and all the trials in Africa that used incidence as an outcome were performed in young children. To investigate whether the observed heterogeneity was related to endemicity levels, we subgrouped trials into those taking place in Africa, South America, or Asia (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In African trials, the combined RR was 0.98 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.07), showing no evidence of efficacy. In South American trials, the combined RR was 0.72 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), suggesting that in this area of the world the vaccine was significantly protective against <I>P. falciparum</I> with an efficacy of 28% (95% CI 18% to 37%). There was no evidence for efficacy in one trial from Asia (<LINK REF="STD-Nosten-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nosten 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials in The Gambia followed children during the second malaria season after vaccination, but there was no evidence of efficacy in the second year (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. New malaria episode (P. vivax)</HEADING>
<P>Five trials reported new malaria infections with <I>P. vivax</I>. As for <I>P. falciparum</I>, these trials were subgrouped according to area of the world. In South American trials, there was a suggestion that the vaccine increased the incidence of <I>P. vivax </I>infections (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The combined RR for the four trials in South America was 1.16 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.32). The one trial in Asia showed the opposite trend (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.98).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Serious outcomes: death, admission to hospital, and admission to hospital with a diagnosis of malaria</HEADING>

Total deaths and admissions are included in these trials because the cause of death or admission to hospital may not have been correctly ascribed, and also because malaria may have been a secondary factor in deaths from other causes. The SPf66 vaccine had no statistically significant effect on these serious outcomes in the few trials that reported them (<LINK REF="STD-Alonso-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Alessandro-1995" TYPE="STUDY">D'Alessandro 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Acosta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Acosta 1999</LINK>).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Systemic and local adverse events</HEADING>
<P>The frequency of local and systemic adverse events after vaccination with SPf66 was recorded after time periods varying from one hour to two weeks. The results are reported in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> (systemic adverse events) and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> (local adverse events). The intensity of surveillance varied among trials and there is little standardization in the definitions of symptoms.</P>
<P>In the overall trial groups given non-intensive surveillance for adverse events, there were a total of three severe systemic adverse events in the vaccine group (two hypotension, one facial oedema) and two in the placebo (alum) group (one hypotension, one rash). There was also a higher proportion of allergic reactions in the vaccinated group, particularly in the <LINK REF="STD-Nosten-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nosten 1996</LINK> trial where a large number of SPf66 recipients reported bilateral cutaneous reactions at the second or third dose, suggesting sensitization by the vaccine. This reaction had been observed previously in phase one non-randomized trials of SPf66 (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Migasena-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Migasena 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nosten-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nosten 1997</LINK>), which are not included in this review. These bilateral cutaneous reactions resolved within 24 hours with symptomatic treatment. Three cases of contralateral induration were also observed in the <LINK REF="STD-Alonso-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Alonso 1994</LINK> trial at the second or third dose, but two of these were in the placebo group (tetanus toxoid plus alum). In the <LINK REF="STD-Acosta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Acosta 1999</LINK> trial, bilateral cutaneous reactions were also observed after the first dose of vaccine or placebo (which was alum), presumably at the site of DTP vaccination that was given in the other thigh. Frequencies of these reactions were no different between vaccine and placebo groups.</P>
<P>Intense surveillance of the initial vaccinated group in the <LINK REF="STD-Acosta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Acosta 1999</LINK> trial (48 children given vaccine and 50 given placebo) resulted in high frequencies of reported systemic adverse events, but the proportions were higher in the placebo than the vaccine group after each dose. The proportion of children with fever after vaccination was higher in the <LINK REF="STD-Nosten-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nosten 1996</LINK> trial (11% to 16%) than in most of the other trials, although 10% to 13% of the placebo group also reported fevers after vaccination with the Engerix-B hepatitis vaccine in this trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>SPf66 malaria vaccine was not efficacious in five good quality trials in Africa. Four of these trials (which assessed incidence of new <I>P. falciparum</I> episodes) were in young children. The one trial in African adults assessed prevalence. In South America, four trials suggested that the vaccine has a low but statistically significant efficacy of 28% (95% CI 18% to 37%) against new episodes of <I>P. falciparum</I>. However, all four South American trials suffered from a high frequency of dropouts and losses to follow up. The four trials in South America also suggested a slightly elevated incidence of <I>P. vivax</I> in the vaccine groups, possibly demonstrating competition between the two malaria species. No effect of the vaccine was apparent in Asia against either malaria species, but this was studied in only one trial. </P>
<P>No significant effect of the vaccine on serious outcomes of malaria such as death or admission to hospital was apparent. However the trials were not designed to have sufficient power to evaluate vaccine efficacy against these rarer events. Although some allergic and bilateral cutaneous reactions were reported, the frequency of serious adverse events after immunization with SPf66 was not significantly higher than for the 'placebo' vaccines (mainly hepatitis B and tetanus toxoid for the first doses, and adjuvants alone for the second and third). </P>
<P>The SPf66 malaria vaccine did not work as well as had been hoped. In the 1990s, much attention focused on this vaccine, and there was controversy about its effectiveness. It is apparent from this review that SPf66 is not effective enough for routine use, and attention has moved on to other vaccine types which are described in separate reviews. It is possible that re-formulations of SPf66 to improve its effectiveness may lead to further trials of this vaccine outside Africa. For example, the adjuvant QS21 is being tested in an attempt to improve the immunogenicity of SPf66 (<LINK REF="REF-Kashala-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kashala 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>The trials described here used a wide range of different definitions of a malaria case, and different methods and frequencies of surveillance. Close attention should be paid to these issues in trial design, and their potential effects on estimation of vaccine efficacy. In deciding on a case definition, there is a trade-off between the high sensitivity required for statistical power and the high specificity required to determine vaccine efficacy. Intensive population-based surveillance for case detection could lead to inclusion of more mild and possibly self-limiting cases of malaria. This might underestimate the effect of the vaccine compared to trials that relied more heavily on self-referral for treatment. It appears unlikely, however, that these factors are responsible for the lack of demonstrated efficacy of the SPf66 vaccine in Africa. Most trials in Africa used a case definition based on clinical symptoms as well as demonstration of parasitaemia, and used a mixture of active and passive surveillance.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence to support the introduction of SPf66 vaccine for routine use in prevention of malaria, either in Africa or in other regions of the world.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is no justification for further trials of SPf66 in its current formulation for protection against malaria in Africa. The modest efficacy observed against <I>P. falciparum</I> in South America suggests that further research on new formulations of SPf66 with increased immunogenicity may be justified in areas outside Africa.</P>
