<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-20 16:51:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some patients may have insufficient bone to place dental implants but there are many surgical techniques to increase the bone volume making implant treatment possible.<BR/>Short implants appear to be more effective and cause less complications than conventional implants placed in resorbed lower jaws (mandibles) augmented with bone from the hip or bone substitutes (cow bone blocks). Bone can be regenerated in a horizontal and vertical direction using various techniques, but it is unclear which techniques are preferable, and complications especially for augmenting bone in a vertical direction are frequent. Some bone substitutes may cause less complications and pain than taking the own bone from various parts of the body.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Several dental journals were handsearched.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-20 16:51:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirteen RCTs out of 18 potentially eligible trials were suitable for inclusion. Three RCTs<B> </B>(106<B> </B>patients) dealt with horizontal and 10 trials (218<B> </B>patients) with vertical augmentation.

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-07-20 16:51:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These conclusions are based on few trials including few patients, sometimes having short follow-up, and often being judged to be at high risk of bias. Various techniques can augment bone horizontally and vertically, but it is unclear which are the most efficient. Short implants appear to be a better alternative to vertical bone grafting of resorbed mandibles. Complications, especially for vertical augmentation, are common. Some bone substitutes could be a preferable alternative to autogenous bone. Osteodistraction osteogenesis allows for more vertical bone augmentation than other techniques which on the other hand can allow for horizontal augmentation at the same time. Titanium screws may be preferable to resorbable screws to fixate onlay bone grafts.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-05 17:08:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-20 17:06:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Missing teeth and supporting oral tissues have traditionally been replaced with dentures or bridges permitting restoration of chewing function, speech, and aesthetics. Dental implants offer an alternative. These implants are inserted into the jawbones to support a dental prosthesis and are retained because of the intimacy of bone growth on to their surface. This direct structural and functional connection between living bone and implant surface, termed osseointegration, was first described by <LINK REF="REF-Branemark-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Branemark 1977</LINK> and has undoubtedly been one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in dentistry over the past 40 years.</P>
<P>Teeth may have been lost through dental disease or trauma or they may be congenitally absent. In addition, teeth may be lost as part of a surgical procedure to resect part of a jaw because of pathology such as cancer. Sometimes, there is a lack of supporting bone in addition to the absent teeth due to atrophy, trauma, failure to develop or surgical resection. Dental implants can only be placed if there is sufficient bone to adequately stabilise them, and bone augmentation permits implant treatment that would otherwise not be an option for some of these patients. Bone augmentation procedures may be carried out some time prior to implant placement (two-stage procedure), or at the same time as implant placement (one-stage procedure), using various materials and techniques. When carried out prior to placement, this necessitates an additional surgical episode and then the area is left to heal for a period of time before the implants are placed.</P>
<P>There are different indications, numerous alternative techniques, and various 'biologically active' agents and biomaterials currently used to augment bone. Some materials used to augment the bone volume may be described as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Autogenous bone grafts</LI>
</UL>
<P>These are bone grafts taken from an adjacent or remote site in the same patient and used to build up the deficient area and are considered to be the material of choice (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2000</LINK>) i.e. the 'gold standard'. They are biologically compatible as they are from the same patient and provide a scaffold into which new bone may grow. Sites from within the mouth may be used for relatively small graft requirements or sites such as the hip bone (iliac crest) for larger bone volumes. All of these require surgery at a second site and therefore the morbidity must be considered. Of the many possible sites, each has its own merits and disadvantages. Sometimes it may be possible to recycle bone taken from the site of implant placement when preparing the hole also by using a special filter to collect bone particles that would otherwise be lost and use this to build up a deficient area.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Allografts</LI>
</UL>
<P>These are bone grafts harvested from cadavers and processed by methods such as freezing or demineralising and freezing. The grafts are then sterilised and supplied by specially licensed tissue banks in several convenient ways such as bone particles or large blocks. They are resorbable. There may be some concern regarding their absolute non-infectivity.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Xenografts</LI>
</UL>
<P>These are graft materials derived from animals such as cow or coral. Animal bone, usually bovine bone, is processed to completely remove the organic component. There has been concern regarding the absolute non-infectivity of bovine-derived materials although this has been disputed (<LINK REF="REF-Wenz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenz 2001</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Alloplastic graft materials</LI>
</UL>
<P>These synthetic bone substitutes include calcium phosphates and bioactive glasses. Alloplasts provide a physical framework for bone ingrowth. Some surgeons use these materials in combination with autogenous bone grafts. These materials resorb completely or to some degree or not at all with time.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Barrier membranes for guided bone regeneration (GBR)</LI>
</UL>
<P>This technique uses special barrier membranes to protect defects from the ingrowth of soft tissue cells so that bone progenitor cells may develop bone uninhibited. Ingrowth of soft tissue may disturb or totally prevent osteogenesis in a defect or wound. Examples of membranes are expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, porcine collagen, and polyglactin. Membranes can be resorbable or non-resorbable.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Bone promoting proteins (BMPs) and platelet rich plasma (PRP)</LI>
</UL>
<P>BMPs are a family of proteins naturally present in bone and responsible for activation of bone development (<LINK REF="REF-Valentin_x002d_Opran-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valentin-Opran 2002</LINK>). BMPs may encourage bone formation. They may be incorporated into any of the above graft types. Growth factors and PRP are used to promote bone formation.</P>
<P>Some surgical techniques used to augment bone volume include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Onlay grafting</LI>
</UL>
<P>The graft material is laid over the defective area to increase width, or height or both of the alveolar jawbone. The host bed is usually perforated with a small bur to encourage the formation of a blood clot between the graft and recipient bed. The graft is immobilised with screws and plates or with dental implants (<LINK REF="REF-Kahnberg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahnberg 1989</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Inlay grafting</LI>
</UL>
<P>A section of jawbone is surgically separated and graft material sandwiched between two sections. Le Fort I osteotomy and interpositional bone graft procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Obwegeser-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Obwegeser 1969</LINK>) has been used for patients requiring implant treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Keller-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keller 1992</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Ridge expansion</LI>
</UL>
<P>The alveolar ridge is split longitudinally and parted to widen it and allow placement of an implant or graft material or both in the void. The longitudinal split can be limited by placing transverse cuts in the bone.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Distraction osteogenesis</LI>
</UL>
<P>The principals of distraction osteogenesis in which a gradual, controlled displacement of a surgically prepared fracture is used to increase bone volume, are not new but have recently been introduced into implant surgery to increase alveolar bone volume (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 1999</LINK>). The gap created during the displacement of the bone segment is filled with immature non-calcified bone that matures during a subsequent fixation period. The associated soft tissues are also expanded as the bone segment is transported.</P>
<P>Each type of augmentation material may be used in combination with a variety of different surgical techniques, so many permutations of treatment are possible and the situation is rather complicated. In addition, new techniques and 'active agents' are continuously introduced in clinical practice. Particular treatment options have strong proponents with surgeons claiming that a particular material or technique offers improved implant success.</P>
<P>There are some clinical situations in which the utility of augmentation procedures is questionable with some authors proposing as alternatives the use of short implants (8.5 to 5 mm long) or implants with smaller diameters (3 mm or less). Also zygomatic implants have been proposed as alternative to bone grafting procedures of the atrophic maxilla. Zygomatic implants are about 4 cm long implants passing through the sinus and engaged into the body of the zygomatic bone (<LINK REF="REF-Branemark-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Branemark 2004</LINK>). Zygomatic implants are evaluated in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review will focus exclusively on techniques aimed at augmenting the bone in a horizontal or vertical direction. Several reviews have been published on this topic (<LINK REF="REF-Tolman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tolman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fiorellini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiorellini 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rocchietta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocchietta 2008</LINK>), though their findings were not based on the most reliable clinical trials, therefore the information presented has to be interpreted with a great deal of caution. The reader can find information on the procedures for augmenting the maxillary sinus, post-extractive sites, bone fenestrations at implants in the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2008c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2008c</LINK>). Information about bone augmentation at implants affected by perimplantitis can be found in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2008b</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-07-20 17:00:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To test (a) whether and when horizontal and vertical bone augmentation procedures are necessary and (b) which are the most effective horizontal and vertical bone augmentation techniques.</P>
<P>Augmentation procedures were divided into two broad categories.<BR/>(1) Horizontal bone augmentation procedures: any technique aimed at making the recipient bone wider or thicker in order to receive dental implants of adequate diameter (usually of a 3.5 mm diameter or wider).</P>
<P>(2) Vertical bone augmentation procedures: any technique aimed at making the recipient bone higher in a vertical dimension in order to receive dental implants of adequate length (usually 9 mm or longer). In many instances a combination of horizontal and vertical bone augmentation is needed and these procedures were included in the vertical augmentation group.</P>

<P>The titles and abstracts (when available) of all reports identified through the electronic searches were scanned independently by two review authors. For studies appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there were insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, the full report was obtained.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>An assessment of the risk of bias in included studies was undertaken following the recommendations as described in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 5.0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Two review authors independently and in duplicate assessed the risk of bias of all included studies. Any disagreement was discussed and where necessary a third review author was consulted to achieve consensus. Authors were contacted directly for clarification. In the case that the paper to be assessed had one or more review authors in the authors list, it was independently evaluated only by those review authors not involved in the trials.</P>
<P>A specific tool for assessing risk of bias in each included study was adopted. This comprised a description and a judgement for each entry in a risk of bias table, where each entry addressed a specific feature of the study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate sequence generation</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment</LI>
<LI>Blinding (of outcome assessor and when possible)</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data addressed</LI>
<LI>Free of selective reporting</LI>
<LI>Free of other bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The judgement for each entry involved answering a question, with answers 'Yes' indicating low risk of bias, 'No' indicating high risk of bias, and 'Unclear' indicating either lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias.</P>
<P>After taking into account the additional information provided by the authors of the trials, the overall risk of bias in included studies was assessed using three key domains: allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors (when possible) and completeness of follow-up. Studies were graded into the following categories.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results) if all three key domains were met.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias (plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results) if one or more key domains were not met.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Further quality assessment was carried out to assess sample size calculations, definition of exclusion/inclusion criteria, and comparability of control and test groups at entry. The quality assessment criteria were pilot tested using several articles.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of effect of an intervention was expressed as odds ratios (OR) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, mean differences and standard deviations were used to summarise the data for each group using mean differences and 95% CIs. The statistical unit was the patient and not the augmentation procedure or the implants.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis was made only if there were studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures. Odds ratios were to be combined for dichotomous data, and mean differences for continuous data, using random-effects models. Data from split-mouth studies were to be combined with data from parallel group trials with the method outlined by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>), using the generic inverse variance method in Review Manager (RevMan).</P>
<P>The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials was to be assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which describes the percentage total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. Clinical heterogeneity was to be assessed by examining the types of participants and interventions for all outcomes in each study. It was planned to undertake sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of the study quality assessment on the overall estimates of effect. In addition, the effect of including unpublished literature on the review's findings was also to be examined.</P>
<P>We decided not to formulate any hypotheses to be investigated with subgroup analyses since no comprehensive meta-analysis was expected. However, this may be done in future updates of this review.</P>

Barriers were not used. PRP was made using the Platelet Concentration Collection System kit (PCCS kit, 3i Implant Innovations Inc. Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA). 54 ml of blood were mixed with 6 ml of anticoagulant (citrate dextrose) and processed with the platelet concentration system. To promote the release of growth factors from the platelets, 10% calcium chloride solution and the patient's serum, as a source of autologous thrombin, were added before actual reconstruction of the defect with the bone graft. The resulting gel was mixed with the bone graft and some gel was applied at the closure of the wound at the side treated with PRP. Three implants were inserted into the healed graft of each side and were left to heal for additional 6 months. All the augmentation procedures were performed under general anaesthesia.

The cortical bone of the recipient sites was perforated to create a bleeding bone surface and to open the cancellous bone. Bone blocks from the chin were fixed with a 1.5 mm diameter titanium screw (Martin Medizin Technik, Tuttlingen, Germany) and particulate bone from the chin was placed around the fixed bone grafts. Implants were placed 3 months after autogenous bone grafting and 6 months after augmenting sites with Bio-Oss. Single ITI-Esthetic<SUP>Plus</SUP> implants (Institut Straumann AG, Waldenburg, Switzerland) were placed using templates and left healing submerged for 6 months.

<LI>One trial addressed the issue of which is the best treatment alternative to provide an overdenture to patients with a resorbed mandible, i.e. symphyseal height 6 to 12 mm measured on lateral radiographs (<LINK REF="STD-Stellingsma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stellingsma 2003</LINK>). Three procedures were tested: (1) installation of four short implants (8 or 11 mm) left to heal for 3 months; (2) mandibular augmentation with an autologous bone graft from the iliac crest and (3) transmandibular Bosker implants. We were only interested in the former two procedures. Mandibles were augmented under general anaesthesia using the interpositional technique. In brief, the mandible was sectioned in the interforaminal area, and a bone block taken from the anterior ilium was positioned between the two segments which were stabilized with osteosynthesis wires and left to heal for 3 months. The wires were then removed, and four 13 to 18 mm long implants were placed and left to heal for an additional 3 months. Patients were not allowed to wear their dentures for the entire healing period (about 6 months). The short implants used were Twin Plus IMZ implants (Friatec, Mannheim, Germany), whereas the augmented mandibles were treated with four specially designed IMZ apical screw implants. No explanation was given why two different types of implants were used. Patients were rehabilitated with overdentures supported by an egg-shaped triple bar with a Dolder-clip retention system. The bars did not have cantilever extensions.</LI>

<LI>One trial compared the 7 mm short implants versus 10 mm or longer implants placed in atrophic posterior mandibles augmented with a bone substitute block (Bio-Oss, Geistlich Pharma, Wolhusen, Switzerland) placed according to an inlay technique (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2009a</LINK>). Posterior mandibles with 7 to 8 mm of bone height above the mandibular canal and a width of at least 5.5 mm as measured on CT scans were treated under local anaesthesia. In brief, after a paracrestal buccal incision, a horizontal osteotomy was made 2 to 4 mm above the mandibular canal. Two oblique cuts were made, the bone segment was raised sparing the lingual periosteum, and a Bio-Oss block was modelled and positioned between the two segments which were stabilized with osteosynthesis miniplates, covered with a resorbable membrane (Bio-Gide, Geistlich Pharma) and left to heal for 5 months. Patients were not allowed to wear their removable prostheses for 1 month after the augmentation procedure. Two to three implants (NanoTite, parallel walled, with external connection, Biomet 3i, Palm Beach, FL, USA) were placed 0.6 mm supracrestally and left to heal for 4 months in both groups. Provisional screw-retained acrylic restorations were delivered and replaced after 4 months by screw-retained metal ceramic restorations.</LI>

<LI>Vertical guided bone regeneration (GBR) with non-resorbable titanium reinforced ePTFE barriers (Gore-Tex, WL Gore and Associates, Inc., Flagstone, USA) supported by particulate autogenous bone harvested from the mandibular ramus and when the bone was not sufficient also from the chin (two patients) versus vertical distraction osteogenesis (<LINK REF="STD-Chiapasco-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiapasco 2004</LINK>). Two different vertical GBR procedures were used: six patients were treated with a one-stage approach (implants were inserted protruding 2 to 7 mm from the bone level and the augmentation procedure was performed on the same occasion; the abutment connection was performed after 6 to 7 months) whereas five patients were treated with a two-stage approach (first the bone at site was augmented and after healing of 6 to 7 months the implants were placed and left submerged for an additional 3 to 5 months). The two-stage approach was used when the risk of insufficient primary implant stability of implants was subjectively expected. With the two-stage approach, one or two titanium miniscrews were used as additional support for the titanium reinforced barriers. All barriers were stabilized with titanium fixating pins (Frios, Friadent GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) or miniscrews (Gebrüder Martin GmbH &amp; Co., Tuttlingen, Germany) or both. The distraction procedure was accomplished by using osteodistractors (Gebrüder Martin GmbH &amp; Co.) fixed to the bone segments with 1.5 mm diameter titanium screws. The distraction devices were activated after 1 week, twice a day (0.5 mm every 12 hours) until the desired amount of distraction was obtained (4 to 9 mm). The bone segments were then left to consolidate for 2 to 3 months, the osteodistractors were then removed and dental implants placed and left submerged for 3 to 6 months. The augmentation procedures were performed under local anaesthesia, local anaesthesia with intravenous sedation and general anaesthesia according to operator and patient preferences. Surgical templates were used to optimise implant insertion. Two implant systems were used: Brånemark Mark III implants (Nobel Biocare, Göteborg, Sweden) in 19 patients and ITI SLA implants (Institut Straumann AG, Waldenburg, Switzerland) in two patients. The choice of two different implant systems was dictated by the system used by the referring dentists. All patients were rehabilitated with screw-retained metal-ceramic fixed prostheses.</LI>

<LI>Autogenous onlay bone grafts harvested from the mandibular ramus versus vertical distraction osteogenesis (<LINK REF="STD-Chiapasco-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chiapasco 2007</LINK>) to vertically augment deficient mandibles. Patients were grafted with a two-stage approach: first bone blocks were fixed with 1.5 mm diameter miniscrews (Gebrüder Martin GmbH &amp; Co., Tuttlingen, Germany). Empty spaces were filled with cancellous bone chips. In case of severe vertical resorption, grafts were assembled in a multilayered fashion. No barriers were used. Bone grafts were harvested from the mandibular ramus of the same side of reconstruction in six patients, while in two patients, where larger defects were present, bone was harvested bilaterally. After 4 to 5 months, implants were placed and left submerged for an additional 3 to 4 months. The distraction procedure was accomplished by using osteodistractors (Gebrüder Martin GmbH &amp; Co.) fixed to the bone segments with 1.5 mm large titanium screws. The distraction devices were activated after 1 week, twice a day (0.5 mm every 12 hours) until the desired amount of distraction was obtained (2 to 7 mm). The bone segments were then left to consolidate for 2 to 3 months, the osteodistractors were then removed and dental implants placed and left submerged for 3 to 4 months. The augmentation procedures were performed under local anaesthesia, local anaesthesia with intravenous sedation and general anaesthesia according to operator and patient preferences.

<LI>Autogenous inlay bone grafts harvested from the iliac crest versus vertical distraction osteogenesis to vertically augment deficient posterior mandibles (<LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 2008</LINK>). Patients were grafted with a two-stage approach: first a monocortical bone block was interposed between the basal bone and an osteotomised segment raised coronally without flap elevation at the lingual side to preserve blood supply and fixed with titanium miniplates and miniscrews (KLS Martin, Tuttlingen, Germany). No barriers were used. After 3 to 4 months, miniplates were removed and implants were placed and left submerged for 3 to 4 months. The distraction procedure was accomplished by using osteodistractors of various brands (Track by KLS Martin, Al-Mar by Cizeta, LactoSorb by Wakterl Lorenz Surgical, the latter being a resorbable device) fixed to the bone segments with various titanium or resorbable screws. The distraction devices were activated after 1 week, twice a day (0.5 to 1 mm per day for 5 to 7 days) until the desired amount of distraction was obtained (7 to 15 mm). In two cases a prosthetic device was used to avoid lingual tipping. The bone segments were then left to consolidate for 3 to 4 months, the osteodistractors were removed and dental implants placed and left submerged for 3/4 months. All augmentation procedures were performed under general anaesthesia. Dental implants of several brands were used (A-Z implant, Biohorizons, Biomet 3i, Friadent, Nobel Biocare). All patients were rehabilitated with partial provisional prostheses for 14 to 16 months until definitive prostheses were delivered.</LI>

<LI>Autogenous inlay bone grafts harvested from the iliac crest versus blocks of anorganic bovine bone (Bio-Oss®, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) for vertically augmenting deficient posterior mandibles (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2008</LINK>). Patients were grafted with a two-stage approach: first a monocortical bone block was interposed between the basal bone and an osteotomised segment raised coronally without flap elevation at the lingual side to preserve blood supply and fixed with titanium miniplates and miniscrews (KLS Martin, Tuttlingen, Germany) and covered with a resorbable barrier (Bio-Gide®, Geistlich Pharma AG). The contra-lateral side was treated with a similar technique but using a Bio-Oss bone block instead. The removable prostheses were allowed 1 month after the augmentation procedure. After 4 months miniplates were removed and implants were placed and left submerged for 4 months. All augmentation procedures were performed under general anaesthesia and patients remained hospitalised for 3 days. Dental implants of three different brands were used (Nanotite Biomet 3i cylindrical implants with external connection, Ankylos and XiVe Dentsply-Friadent implants). All patients were rehabilitated with fixed partial provisional acrylic prostheses for 4 months until definitive metal-ceramic fixed prostheses were delivered.</LI>

<LI>Two-stage vertical GBR using non-resorbable titanium reinforced ePTFE barriers (Gore-Tex, WL Gore and Associates, Inc., Flagstone, USA), stabilized with miniscrews, comparing particulate autogenous bone harvested from the retromolar area with trephine drills and subsequently particulated with a bone mill versus an allograft made of malleable allogenic bone matrix (Regenaform, Regeneration Technologies, Alachua, FL, USA) (<LINK REF="STD-Fontana-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fontana 2008</LINK>). This allograft is a combination of assayed demineralized bone matrix (DFDBA) with cortico-cancellous bone chips uniformly dispersed in a thermoplastic biological carrier which became malleable when warmed between 43 to 49 degrees Celsius. The augmentation procedures were performed under local anaesthesia with sedative premedication half an hour prior to surgery. Two mini-implants were used as 'poles' to support the barrier. They were placed to protrude for the required height. One pole was a stainless steel miniscrew (6 to 12 mm long; Ace Dental Implant System, Brockton, MA, USA), and the other was an immediate provisional implant (IPI, Steri-Oss, Nobel Biocare, Göteborg, Sweden). This micro-implant (2 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length) was removed at implant installation with a 4 mm diameter trephine bur for histological examination. Several drill holes were made on the cortical bone to ensure bleeding. After 6 months of submerged healing, the barriers and the mini-implant were removed and<B> </B>Brånemark MK III (Nobel Biocare) implants with a TiUnite surface were placed. After 5 months of healing, implant stability was tested and abutments were placed.</LI>

<LI>Ultrasound or placebo were applied using a sonic-accelerated fracture-healing system (SAFHS model 2000, Smith and Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA) by patients subjected to vertical osteodistraction osteogenesis in the anterior mandible when active osteodistraction was initiated after a latency period of about 5 days (<LINK REF="STD-Schortinghuis-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schortinghuis 2008</LINK>). Ultrasound self treatment involved a daily treatment of 20 minutes for about 50 days on the skin of the chin covering the osteodistraction gap using 1.5 MHz pressure wave in pulses of 200 µs. Between pulses there was a 800 µs pause (on:off period = 1:4). Patient compliance was monitored by a memory chip inside the ultrasound equipment. Six weeks post-distraction the distraction devices were removed and two 12 mm long ITI Bonefit implants (Straumann AG, Waldenburg, Switzerland) were inserted and left to heal for 3 months before being loaded with an overdenture.</LI>

<LI>Inlay versus onlay autogenous bone grafts harvested from the iliac crest to vertically augment deficient posterior mandibles (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2009b</LINK>). Patients were grafted with a two-stage approach: a monocortical bone block was either interposed between the basal bone and the osteotomised segment raised coronally without flap elevation at the lingual side to preserve blood supply or placed as an onlay. Grafts were fixed with titanium miniplates or miniscrews (Gebrüder Martin GmbH &amp; Co, Tuttlingen, Germany). The grafted areas were covered with resorbable barriers (Bio-Gide®, Geistlich Pharma AG). All augmentation procedures were performed under general anaesthesia. Patients were instructed not to wear removable prostheses for 1 month after the augmentation procedure. After 3 to 4 months miniplates/screws were removed and two dental implants were placed and left submerged for 4 months. Dental implants of several brands were used (Biomet 3i and XiVe Dentsply-Friadent implants for the inlay group and Astra Tech, Biolok and Alpha Bio implants for the onlay group). All patients were rehabilitated with screw-retained acrylic partial provisional prostheses for 4 to 5 months until definitive screw-retained prostheses were delivered.</LI>

<P>A priori calculation for the sample size was undertaken in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felice-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felice-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2009a</LINK>). The calculation of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2007</LINK>) was based on the complications that occurred in another similar RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Friedmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Friedmann 2002</LINK>). Twenty-one patients were needed in each group to detect a difference between a proportion of complications from 0.27 to 0.80. However, the trial included only 11 patients per group, therefore the sample size requirement was not fulfilled. In one trial of split-mouth design (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2008</LINK>), the sample size was calculated to detect patient preference of one procedure over the other against the alternative hypothesis that treatments were equally preferred. This reduced to a simple one sample proportion scenario. A one-group Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level had 80% power to detect the difference between the null hypothesis proportion of 0.500 and the alternative proportion of 0.900 when the sample size is 10. The sample size was achieved. The calculations for another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2009a</LINK>) were based on implant failures. A two-group continuity corrected Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level had 80% power to detect the difference between a proportion of 0.100 and a proportion of 0.300 for patients experiencing at least one implant failure (odds ratio of 3.857) when the sample size in each group was 72. However, only 30 patients were recruited in each group and the size requirement was not fulfilled.</P>

<LI>One trial compared two techniques for augmenting resorbed maxillae including atrophic maxillary sinuses (<LINK REF="STD-Raghoebar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raghoebar 2005</LINK>) (data not shown).<B> </B>Only patients with less than 5 mm of alveolar bone height in the sinus floor were included. Five patients were treated with a split-mouth approach with two-stage sinus lift with autogenous bone together with buccal onlay grafts, harvested from the iliac crest, one side with platelet rich plasma (PRP) and the other without. All patients were followed for 2 years after implant loading and there were no drop outs.<B> </B>No serious complications occurred at the grafted sites: one sinus membrane was perforated during surgery but healing was uneventful. A small incision breakdown occurred in the first week at the non-PRP side of one patient. A seroma which healed uneventfully was the only complication that occurred at the donor sites. During the prosthetic phase one implant failed in the PRP side, but no prosthesis failed. There was no statistically significant difference for any of the outcomes considered in this review. The difference in cost and treatment time was the use of PRP. Prostheses were inserted about 10 months after augmentation. The trial was judged to be at high risk of bias.</LI>

<LI>One split-mouth trial compared two titanium versus two resorbable screws for fixating two-stage buccal onlay grafts, harvested from the iliac crest, to resorbed maxillae (<LINK REF="STD-Raghoebar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raghoebar 2006</LINK>) (data not shown).<B> </B>Eight patients were followed for 2 years after implant loading and there were no drop outs. No serious complications occurred at the grafted and donor sites. Two resorbable screws broke at insertion (one because of incorrect handling), but they could be removed and replaced.<B> </B>A small incision breakdown occurred in the first week at the titanium screw side of one patient. Another patient developed a slight submucosal swelling with redness of the mucosa above a resorbable screw 3 months after the augmentation procedure, that disappeared after implant placement. No prosthesis or implant failed. There was no statistically significant difference for any of the outcomes considered in this review. The difference in cost and treatment time was the use of different screws. Prostheses were inserted about 10 months after augmentation. The trial was judged to be at high risk of bias.</LI>

<LI>One trial compared three two-stage techniques to horizontally augment bone at maxillary sites (incisor, cuspid or first bicuspid) to allow placement of single implants (<LINK REF="STD-Meijndert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Meijndert 2007</LINK>). Thirty-one patients were included in each group and were followed up to 1 year after loading. The following procedures were tested: (1) autogenous bone block from the chin; (2) autogenous bone block from the chin plus a resorbable barrier; (3) 100% Bio-Oss plus a resorbable barrier. No patients dropped out. Not a single complication occurred. Two single implants failed early in the group treated with Bio-Oss plus resorbable barrier, though this difference was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Many other outcome measures (perimplant bone level changes, patient satisfaction, aesthetics judged by patients and by an independent dentist) could not be used in the present review because data were aggregated and not presented by study groups. With respect to cost and treatment time, the additional costs for the barriers, and Bio-Oss should be considered. Patients had to wait 9 months (bone block groups) or 1 year (Bio-Oss plus barrier group) to be rehabilitated. The trial was judged to be at high risk of bias.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stellingsma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stellingsma 2003</LINK>) evaluated the need to augment anterior atrophic mandibles (residual bone height between 6 to 12 mm) up to 2 years after loading (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Twenty patients received four short implants (8 to 11 mm), whereas 20 patients received interposed iliac bone grafts and four longer implants (13 to 18 mm) to support overdentures. Two patients dropped out, one from each group about 3 months after overdenture delivery due to death and moving. In the short implant group two complications occurred: bleeding during surgery and permanent unilateral hypoaesthesia, and no early implant failure. In the augmented group six complications occurred: one life threatening complication (post-operative sublingual edema which left the patient in intensive care for 3 days); two wound dehiscences; two unilateral dysaesthesiae, one of which completely recovered; and one necrosis of the osteotomised cranial fragment of the mandibles. In the augmented group four patients lost one implant each and a fifth patient lost all implants (possibly for necrosis of the osteotomised cranial fragment of the mandible and had to be re-treated), before or at abutment connection. Although the RevMan P value for the odds ratio (OR) was not statistically significant (P = 0.08), Fisher's exact test (two-sided) found a significant difference (P = 0.048), with higher implant failure in the augmented mandibles, confirming the findings of the original article. Statistically significant differences were also found at 3 weeks after the first surgical intervention: (1) 85% of the patients in the augmentation group reported serious pain for more than 1 week versus 20% of the patients in the short implant group (OR 22.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4 to 117.5); (2) 30% of the patients in the augmentation group reported no improvement in their facial appearance versus 80% of the patients in the short implant group (in this group, 70% reported no change, and 10% reported a deterioration of their facial appearance) (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.46). The article also reported a statistically significant difference with 50% of the patients in the augmentation group experienced the operation more negatively than expected versus 25% of the patients in the short implant group, however we did not find this difference significant. With respect to prosthetic aftercare: four unplanned interventions were required in the short implant group versus 10 interventions in the graft group. Numerous aspects of patient satisfaction including aesthetics were investigated using validated questionnaires at 1 year and no statistically significant differences among groups were found. With respect to cost and treatment time, while short implants were placed under local anaesthesia, the graft procedures required general anaesthesia, a mean of 5.9 days of hospitalisation (range 3 to 9; standard deviation (SD) 1.3), and the double healing time (about 3 additional months) and patients could not wear the lower denture for 6 months. The trial was judged to be at high risk of bias.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2009a</LINK>) evaluated the need to augment posterior atrophic mandibles (residual bone height above the mandibular canal between 7 to 8 mm and width of at least 5.5 mm) up to 4 months after loading (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Thirty patients received 2 to 3 7 mm short implants and 30 patients received an interposed anorganic bovine bone block (Bio-Oss) and, after 5 months of healing, 2 to 3 10 to 15 mm long implants to support fixed partial restorations. No patient dropped out. No complications occurred in the short implant group versus four complications (wound dehiscences/infections)<B> </B>in the augmented group:<B> </B>three of these dehiscences persisted until implant placement and in two patients partial loss of the bone graft occurred.<B> </B>Two augmentation procedures were considered a complete failure because the planned augmentation was not obtained and 7 mm short implants had to be used instead of the planned 10 mm or longer implants. These graft failures were associated with the fracture of the Bio-Oss blocks at the augmentation procedure. In the augmented group three patients lost one implant each versus one patient in the short implant group and the related prostheses could not be placed when planned, however all failed implants were successfully replaced and loaded. No statistically significant differences between groups were observed.<B> </B>With respect to cost and treatment time, short implants were loaded about 4 months after initiation of the treatment whereas longer implants placed in augmented bone about 9 months after treatment start. The cost of one additional surgical intervention and of the Bio-Oss block for patients treated with the augmentation procedure should also be considered. The trial was judged to be at low risk of bias.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>One trial compared distraction osteogenesis in 11 patients versus guided bone regeneration (GBR) with non-resorbable barriers and particulate autogenous bone grafts taken from the mandibular ramus (if not sufficient also from the chin) in 10 patients for vertically augmenting edentulous ridges for 3 years after loading (<LINK REF="STD-Chiapasco-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiapasco 2004</LINK>). No patient dropped out. Two complications occurred in two patients of the osteodistraction group: the bone fragment inclined lingually during the distraction phase probably due to the traction on the osteotomized segment by muscle forces of the floor of the mouth. The complications were successfully treated by applying an orthodontic traction until the bone segment consolidated in the desired position. Five complications occurred in four patients of the GBR group: three barrier exposures occurred, one of which was associated with an infection, and two transient paraesthesiae of the chin area lasting 1 and 4 weeks. Both paraesthesiae were associated with the only two procedures for harvesting bone from the chin. All procedures for harvesting bone from the ramus were complication free. There was no statistically significant difference for complications between the two procedures (<LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>). No implants or prostheses failed over the 3-year follow-up period. The mean bone gain after the augmentation procedure was reported for both groups, however without explaining how it was recorded or which were the reference points. Also data on perimplant bone loss were unclear and could not be used. With respect to cost and treatment time, in the GBR group it should be considered the cost of the barriers and the fixing pins, versus the cost of the intraoral distractor and related orthodontic therapy when needed. In the osteodistraction group, the time occurring for exposing the implants ranged between 6 and a half months (mandibles) to 9 and a half months (maxillae) and patients were not allowed to use prostheses for about 3 and a half months. In the GBR group, the time occurring for exposing the implants ranged between 6 to 7 months, when implants were placed simultaneously with the GBR procedure, and 9 to 12 months, when implants were placed after the ridge had been vertically augmented. Patients were left without removable prostheses for 6 to 7 months. The trial was judged to be at high risk of bias.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>One trial compared distraction osteogenesis in nine patients versus autogenous onlay bone grafts taken from the mandibular ramus in eight patients for vertically augmenting mandibular edentulous ridges for 3 years after loading (<LINK REF="STD-Chiapasco-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chiapasco 2007</LINK>). No patient dropped out. Three complications occurred in three patients of the osteodistraction group: the bone fragment inclined lingually during the distraction phase probably due to the traction on the osteotomised segment by muscle forces of the floor of the mouth. The complications were successfully treated by applying an orthodontic traction until the bone segment consolidated in the desired position. In the third patient, distraction was interrupted before completion, because of the impossibility to move further the distracted segment. This was probably caused by an incorrect design of the vertical osteotomic lines. Shorter implants (6 mm instead of the planned 8 mm) could be placed anyway. Four complications occurred in four patients of the bone graft group: three paraesthesiae of the alveolar inferior nerve, two transient but one permanent. In the last patient the graft became exposed and was partially lost. The treatment could be completed anyway using short implants. There was no statistically significant difference for complications between the two groups (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). No implants or prostheses failed over the 3-year follow-up period. The mean bone gain after the augmentation procedure was 5.3 <U>+</U> 1.58 mm for the osteodistracted sites and 5.0 <U>+</U> 1.07 mm for the grafted sites. No statistically significant differences were observed regarding marginal perimplant bone loss between groups at 1 and 3 years (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). Three years after loading, implants in osteodistracted sites lost on average 0.9 mm of perimplant bone versus 1.3 mm in grafted sites. With respect to cost and treatment time, in the bone graft group it should be considered only the cost of the fixing pins, versus the cost of the intraoral distractor and related orthodontic therapy when needed, making bone grafting cheaper. In the bone graft group, the time occurring for exposing the implants ranged between 8/9 months. Patients were left without removable prostheses for at least 2 months. In the osteodistraction group, the time occurring to expose implants was 7/8 months and patients were not allowed to use prostheses for about 3 months. The trial was judged to be at low risk of bias.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>One trial, compared one-stage particulate autogenous bone grafts from intraoral locations in 11 patients treated with non-resorbable titanium reinforced barriers versus 11 patients treated with resorbable barriers supported by osteosynthesis plates (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2007</LINK>). One implant per patient was used for the statistical calculations. No patient dropped out. Four complications occurred in the resorbable group: two abscesses which determined the failure of the grafting procedures, and two minor complications not affecting the outcome of the therapy (barrier exposure without signs of infection, and a swelling suggesting an early infection successfully treated with antibiotics). Five complications occurred in the non-resorbable group: one infection which determined the failure of the graft and three fistulas in three patients. The last complication was lymph nodes swelling 1 month after intervention suggesting an infection which was treated with systemic antibiotics. No study implant failed and all planned prostheses could be delivered. Both treatments resulted in statistically significant vertical bone gain (2.2 mm for the resorbable group and 2.5 mm for the non-resorbable group), however no statistically significant differences were found among the two procedures (<LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>). Three years after loading, both groups lost perimplant bone in a statistically significant way (about 0.5 mm) and there was no difference in bone loss between groups (<LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>). With respect to cost and treatment time, for the resorbable group it should be considered the cost of one or two barriers, the osteosynthesis plates and related fixating pins, versus the cost of a titanium-reinforced barrier and related pins in the non-resorbable group, which could be slightly cheaper. The healing time for both groups was about 4 and a half months; slightly less than originally planned (5 months), due to premature removal of some infected barriers. The trial was judged to be at low risk of bias.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>One trial compared distraction osteogenesis in five patients versus autogenous inlay bone grafts taken from the iliac crest in six patients for vertically augmenting mandibular edentulous ridges of 5 to 9 mm height above the mandibular canal for at least 1 year and a half after loading (<LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 2008</LINK>). No patient dropped out. Three complications occurred in the distraction group and one in the inlay group. In the distraction group, two patients developed progressive lingual inclination of the distraction segments possibly due to traction by the muscles of the floor of the mouth. Orthodontic traction was applied to avoid consolidation of the distracted segments in an unfavourable position. One patient developed a minor infection at implant insertion time resolved with local debridement. There were no statistically significant differences for complications between groups (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). In the inlay group recovery of the donor sites was uneventful in all cases with no complications. One patient developed a post-augmentation dehiscence of the distal fixation screw, infection and partial resorption of the cranial segment. This was resolved with local debridement. Those complications did not jeopardize the success of the augmentation procedures. No study implant failed and all planned prostheses could be delivered. Both treatments resulted in vertical bone gain (8.4 mm for the distraction group and 5.1 mm for the inlay group), with osteodistraction gaining statistically more bone<B> </B>(<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). With respect to costs, for the distraction group it should be considered the cost of the distractor device, versus the cost of the osteosynthesis plates in the inlay group, which could be slightly cheaper. The time needed to achieve the desired outcome was similar.The trial was judged to be at low risk of bias.</LI>

<LI>One split-mouth trial compared autogenous bone blocks taken from the iliac crest versus anorganic bovine bone blocks used as inlays in 10 patients for vertically augmenting posterior mandibular edentulous ridges of 5 to 7 mm height above the mandibular canal for 1 year after loading (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2008</LINK>). No patient dropped out. Three complications occurred in three patients: two infections at the sites grafted with autogenous bone, one determining the complete failure of the graft and the other a partial loss of the graft versus a minor soft tissue dehiscence at a Bio-Oss treated site.<B> </B>Because of the complete failures of one autogenous bone graft, the two planned implants and their prostheses could not be placed. One implant failed in the Bio-Oss group 11 weeks after loading. It was successfully replaced and a new prosthesis was made. There were not statistically significant failures for prosthesis and implant failures as well as complications (<LINK REF="CMP-003.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.10</LINK>). Both treatments resulted in vertical bone gain<B> </B>(6.2 mm for the bone substitute group and 5.1 mm for the autogenous bone group), and the difference of 1.1 mm<B> </B>was not statistically significant<B> </B>(<LINK REF="CMP-003.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.9</LINK>). One year after loading, both groups lost statistically significant perimplant marginal bone (0.82 mm the autogenous bone group and 0.59 mm the Bio-Oss group) but the 0.21 mm of difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. When asked for their preference, 1 month after delivery of the definitive prostheses, 8 out of 10 patients preferred the bone substitute versus two patients who had no preference since both interventions were fine for them. This difference was statistically significant (data not shown in RevMan graph, OR = 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.64, P = 0.02).<B> </B>With respect to costs, it should be considered the cost of the bone substitutes versus the need for an additional operation to retrieve autogenous bone for the iliac crest which has to be conducted in general anaesthesia. The time needed to achieve the desired outcome was similar.The trial was judged to be at high risk of bias.<B> </B>

<LI>One split-mouth trial evaluated vertical GBR with titanium reinforced barriers supported by two 'poles' comparing particulate autogenous bone harvested from the retromolar area with a thermoplastic allogenic bone substitute (Regenaform) in five patients for vertically augmenting posterior mandibular edentulous ridges up to 1 year after loading (<LINK REF="STD-Fontana-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fontana 2008</LINK>). No patient dropped out. Two complications occurred in one patient one at each of treated site. The side treated with autogenous bone showed an infection without barrier exposure 2 months after augmentation. The barrier and the small tissue portion affected by the infection were removed. On the contra-lateral side a buccal bone dehiscence developed around one of the implants. It was treated with autogenous bone and a resorbable barrier.<B> </B>Those complications did not jeopardize the success of the augmentation procedures.<B> </B>No study implant failed and all planned prostheses could be delivered. Both treatments resulted in vertical bone gain<B> </B>(4.7 mm for the bone substitute group and 4.1 mm for the autogenous bone group), and the difference of 0.6 mm was statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>). With respect to costs, it should be considered the cost of the bone substitutes versus the need for an additional flap operation to retrieve autogenous bone. The time needed to achieve the desired outcome was similar.The trial was judged to be at low risk of bias.</LI>

<LI>One trial evaluated the effect of ultrasounds on vertical distraction osteogenesis in anterior atrophic mandibles (<LINK REF="STD-Schortinghuis-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schortinghuis 2008</LINK>). Five patients were treated with ultrasounds and four patients with a placebo. The ultrasounds or placebo were delivered at the start of the active osteodistraction phase for about 45 days. No patient dropped out. No complication occurred, no implant failed and all planned prostheses could be delivered and followed for 2 years after loading. The distraction distance obtained was 4.6 mm for the ultrasound group and 5.8 mm for the placebo group. The difference of 1.2 mm was not statistically significant but clearly in favour of the placebo group (data not shown). With respect to costs, it should be considered the cost of the ultrasound equipment. The time needed to achieve the desired outcome was similar, though patients had to spend about 20 minutes per day for about 45 days to deliver the treatment. The trial was judged to be at low risk of bias.</LI>

<LI>One trial evaluated inlays (in 10 patients) versus onlays (in 13 patients) of autogenous bone grafts harvested from the iliac crest to vertically augment deficient posterior mandibles of 4.5 to 10 mm height above the mandibular canal for 1 year after loading (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2009b</LINK>). The number of patients in each group was unbalanced because toss of a coin was used to randomise patients. No patient dropped out. Four complications occurred in four patients of the inlay group (three dehiscences/infections with partial exposure of the miniplates, one determining the failure of the augmentation procedure; and one perimplantitis) versus six complications in five patients from the onlay group (three dehiscences/infections with partial exposure of the miniplates, one determining the failure of the augmentation procedure; two altered chin/lip sensations, one lasting 6 months and one permanent; and one perimplantitis in the same patient who had paraesthesia for 6 months) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.11</LINK>). No implant failed. Both treatments resulted in vertical bone gain (3.5<B> </B>mm for the onlay group and<B> </B>4.5<B> </B>mm for the inlay group), and the difference between the two procedures of 1 mm was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-003.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.12</LINK>) but was very close to significance (P = 0.07). There were no differences in costs and treatment time. The trial was judged to be at low risk of bias.<B> </B>

<P>This review was originally conceived as having a broad focus and was aimed to include any randomised controlled trial (RCT) dealing with any aspect of bone augmentation in relation to dental implant rehabilitation. In the present update we decided to split the original review into three more focused reviews:<B> </B>the present one dealing with horizontal and vertical bone augmentation procedures, one dealing with procedures to augment the maxillary sinus, and a third one dealing with minor augmentation procedures at extraction sockets, immediate implants and implants with bone fenestration. We are fully aware that there are limitations in this classification, as in many classifications, since the exact borders among the different categories may not always be clearly identified. Trials reporting histological outcomes only or which did not report any implant-related outcomes were not considered of interest since they would not be able to provide reliable clinical information for the prognosis of dental implant rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Sample size calculations were undertaken only in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felice-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felice-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2009a</LINK>). However, the planned sample sizes could only be achieved in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2008</LINK>). Sample sizes of all studies were relatively small. It is therefore likely that many of these studies were underpowered to demonstrate any significant difference in outcome measures between groups. Nevertheless some of the included trials did provide limited but indeed useful clinical information and indications which should be carefully evaluated by clinicians when deciding whether to perform an augmentation procedure or not, or which augmentation procedure to select. We have spent a great deal of time contacting RCTs' authors, who have kindly provided useful unpublished information on their trials. We feel that these contacts have made the present review more complete and useful for the readers. It is also worth observing that all authors of the included trials replied to our requests for clarifications. It is unusual to have such a high response rate. This might be partly explained by the serious research interests of the investigators conducting RCTs in the area, and may be indicative of a growing consciousness that high quality systematic reviews can be of great benefit to the entire society. We also noticed a considerable increase in the number of RCTs published over the last few years. This should be viewed positively since it may indicate that in the near future some currently unanswered clinical questions might finally get an evidence-based answer, going over the traditional 'opinion-biased' approach to clinical decision-making. The priority now is to concentrate research efforts on a few important clinical questions, increasing the sample size, and decreasing the number of treatment variables in the trials. This might be obtained through collaborative efforts among various research groups.</P>
<P>We tried to evaluate firstly whether a certain augmentation procedure is necessary, and secondly which could be the most effective augmentation techniques. This distinction is relevant since it is possible that many complicated, painful and even potentially dangerous procedures that are widely performed today, have no evidence-based justification and do not improve the prognosis or the patients' quality of life.</P>
<P>No trial evaluated whether and when horizontal bone augmentation is necessary, but two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Stellingsma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stellingsma 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felice-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2009a</LINK>) evaluated whether vertical bone augmentation procedures are needed or whether shorter implants could be used instead. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stellingsma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stellingsma 2003</LINK>) investigated whether it was better to use iliac crest bone for inlay augmentation procedures to allow the placement of 13 to 18 mm long implants rather than placing 8 to 11 mm long implants without augmentation to treat atrophic anterior mandibles with a residual bone height of 6 to 12 mm. The other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2009a</LINK>) compared an inlay augmentation technique with Bio-Oss blocks, to allow the placement of at least 10 mm long implants, with 7 mm long implants for treating posterior mandibles with a residual bone height above the mandibular canal of 7 to 8 mm. The meta-analysis of these two trials showed that vertical augmentation was associated with more implant failures (borderline significance) and complications (statistically significant) than short implants.<B> </B>Caution should be exercised when extrapolating these results since in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stellingsma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stellingsma 2003</LINK>) 11 mm implants were used, which are not considered to be short, and the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2009a</LINK>) had a follow-up of only 4 months after loading.<B> </B>Nevertheless, when considering resorbed mandibles, inlay augmentation techniques to allow the placement of longer implants may not be the optimal treatment choice.<B> </B>It is therefore useful to underline that when evaluating the only two properly designed trials to test whether augmentation procedures are needed (<LINK REF="STD-Stellingsma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stellingsma 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felice-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2009a</LINK>), the augmentation procedures resulted in more serious complications (including a life threatening sublingual edema), major discomfort and pain, significant more costs for society, longer treatment time, and clinically poorer outcomes. These examples clearly illustrate that a more critical approach should be taken when evaluating the need for vertical bone augmentation procedures for dental implants.</P>
<P>When evaluating which are the most effective augmentation techniques for horizontal ridge augmentation for single implants, only one trial was designed in a way to provide clinical useful information (<LINK REF="STD-Meijndert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Meijndert 2007</LINK>).<B> </B>This trial, which had the largest sample size included in this review, compared three different two-stage techniques to horizontally augment bone to allow placement of single implants (<LINK REF="STD-Meijndert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Meijndert 2007</LINK>). Thirty-one patients were included in each group and aesthetic outcomes were assessed both by the patients and a blinded experienced evaluator. Unfortunately most of the data were presented aggregated and not by study group, meaning that it was not possible to use them to compare advantages or disadvantages of the individual techniques. For 62 patients a block of bone was retrieved from the chin, whereas in 31 patients the defects were reconstructed with 100% bone substitute (Bio-Oss) and a resorbable barrier. Despite these relatively high numbers, the authors confirmed to us that not a single complication occurred. These are remarkable results not confirmed by other trials included in the present review. Only two implants failed early in the bone substitute group, although they were successfully replaced. The healing period used for the bone substitute group was 3 months longer, but on the other hand no autogenous bone was needed to complete the procedure. At present it is still difficult to recommend which should be the procedure to be used and additional information is needed to confirm these results. The other two trials evaluating aspects for horizontal bone augmentation (<LINK REF="STD-Raghoebar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raghoebar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raghoebar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raghoebar 2006</LINK>)<B> </B>had too small sample sizes to provide any reliable evidence. In fact, only five patients treated with a split-mouth design were recruited to evaluate the clinical efficacy, if any, of platelet rich plasma (PRP) (<LINK REF="STD-Raghoebar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raghoebar 2005</LINK>).<B> </B>When comparing titanium versus resorbable screws for holding buccal onlay autogenous grafts, despite no significant differences being observed (<LINK REF="STD-Raghoebar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raghoebar 2006</LINK>), although the sample size of eight patients was too small to be able to detect any difference, the observation that two resorbable screws broke at insertion and that a considerable amount of remnants of the resorbable screws were still visible after 9 months and were surrounded by fibrotic tissue rich in giant cells may suggest that titanium screws are still the best choice.</P>
<P>When evaluating which are the most effective augmentation techniques for vertical ridge augmentation<B> </B>eight<B> </B>trials were included (<LINK REF="STD-Chiapasco-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiapasco 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiapasco-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chiapasco 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fontana-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fontana 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felice-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schortinghuis-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schortinghuis 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felice-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2009b</LINK>). Osteodistraction osteogenesis, various GBR techniques, autogenous onlay block grafting, and inlay grafting with both autogenous bone and bone substitutes can be successful for augmenting bone vertically, however, there is insufficient evidence to suggest if one technique is preferable. The osteodistraction technique may not be used in all circumstances (for instance in the presence of thin knife-edge bone), it is more expensive than GBR and bone grafting, but may reduce treatment time and allow for more vertical ridge augmentation, if needed. On the other hand, GBR and onlay bone grafting techniques also allow for simultaneous bone widening, if needed. All the vertical augmentation techniques evaluated were associated with high complication rates ranging from 60% (<LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 2008</LINK>) to 20% (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2008</LINK>) with only one study on osteodistraction osteogenesis that reported no complications (<LINK REF="STD-Schortinghuis-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schortinghuis 2008</LINK>). However, in few cases (10% in <LINK REF="STD-Felice-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2008</LINK> and 15% in <LINK REF="STD-Merli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2007</LINK>) the vertical augmentation procedure failed. It is therefore recommended that both clinicians and patients carefully evaluate the pros and cons in relation to the desired outcome before deciding whether to use vertical ridge augmentation techniques. Results from some of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chiapasco-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chiapasco 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2007</LINK>) also suggested that the vertically augmented bone can be successfully maintained up to 3 years after loading with just a minimal bone loss in the range of 0.5 to 1 mm.</P>
<P>One study evaluated the efficacy of ultrasounds to stimulate osteogenesis at vertically distracted mandibular bone (<LINK REF="STD-Schortinghuis-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schortinghuis 2008</LINK>). Ultrasounds are used to stimulate healing in bone fractures especially in delayed healing and non-union fractures. The results of this pilot study suggested that ultrasounds had no positive effects on bone healing. When looking at the data it can be observed that ultrasound treated sites were distracted for 4.6 mm and placebo sites for 5.8 mm. The difference among the two procedures in amount of distracted bone (1.2 mm) was not statistically significant but it was clearly in favour of the placebo group. Ultrasounds were applied when the active osteodistraction phase was initiated. A possible interpretation of the results is that ultrasounds were effective in stimulating bone healing and this could explain why the placebo group gained more bone. It is possible that ultrasounds were delivered at the wrong time (the active osteodistraction phase) and stimulated bone healing reducing the osteodistraction potential. The results of this study remain difficult to interpret, but it is possible that ultrasounds should be delivered when the active osteodistraction phase is completed.</P>
<P>Autogenous bone is often considered the 'gold standard' material for bone augmentation. Three trials compared autogenous bone with bone substitutes (<LINK REF="STD-Meijndert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Meijndert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felice-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fontana-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fontana 2008</LINK>) and curiously the indications that these trials gave were not consistently in favour of autogenous bone. When augmenting bone horizontally to allow the placement of single implants, a bone substitute (Bio-Oss) could be successfully used (<LINK REF="STD-Meijndert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Meijndert 2007</LINK>). Implants placed in bone augmented with Bio-Oss showed trends to increased failure rates, though all failed implants could be successfully replaced without the need for additional augmentation. Another disadvantage with Bio-Oss was that the healing time was increased by 3 months. On the other hand, no autogenous bone had to be collected from the chin, meaning also a less invasive operation. Therefore, additional information is needed to establish which could be the most cost-effective procedure. A split-mouth pilot study evaluated whether anorganic bovine bone blocks (Bio-Oss) could replace autogenous bone harvested from the iliac crest for vertically augmenting atrophic posterior mandibles with an inlay technique (<LINK REF="STD-Felice-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Felice 2008</LINK>). Though no statistical differences for clinical outcomes could be found, 8 out of 10 patients preferred the augmentation procedure with the bone substitute and this was statistically significant. In addition, general anaesthesia is not needed when using blocks of bone substitute to augment atrophic posterior mandibles. Finally, another split-mouth pilot study, including only five patients, compared a malleable bone substitute (Regenaform) with particulate autogenous bone for vertical GBR at posterior mandibles (<LINK REF="STD-Fontana-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fontana 2008</LINK>). Significantly more bone (0.6 mm) was vertically augmented at the sites treated with the bone substitute. While a 0.6 mm of additional vertical bone gain may not have a significant clinical impact, it is also true that the bone substitute behaved similarly, if not better, than autogenous bone.</P>
<P>With respect to generalization of the results of the present review to general practice, many of the augmentation procedures evaluated were rather complex, were performed by experienced and skilful clinicians, patients were undergoing strict post-operative control regimens, complications were common, and in few instances serious. Caution is therefore recommended when deciding to use any augmentation procedure. The first clinical question that clinicians should ask themselves is which could be the added benefits for the patient by applying such procedures. Then the expected benefits need to be carefully weighted against the risk of complications of the chosen procedure.</P>

<P>These conclusions are based on few trials with small or very small sample sizes, relatively short follow-ups, and being sometimes judged to be at high risk of bias, therefore they should be viewed with great caution.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Two trials investigated whether vertical augmentation procedures are necessary to allow placement of longer implants when compared to simple placement of short implants.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Vertical augmentation of resorbed mandibles with inlay techniques resulted in more implant failures (statistically borderline significance), complications (statistically significant), pain, days of hospitalisation, costs, and longer treatment time than using short implants, therefore the current available scientific evidence does not justify these procedures for placing longer implants in resorbed mandibles. However, the long-term prognosis of shorter implants is yet unknown.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Three trials investigated which are the most effective techniques for horizontal bone augmentation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(1) Various augmentation techniques are able to regenerate bone in a horizontal direction, however, there is insufficient evidence to indicate which technique could be preferable. It appears that a bone substitute (Bio-Oss) can be used with a slightly higher risk (not statistically significant) of having an implant failure.<BR/>(2) There is insufficient evidence supporting or confuting the efficacy of various active agents such as platelet rich plasma in conjunction with implant treatment.<BR/>(3) Titanium screws might be preferable to resorbable poly (D, L-lactide) acid screws to fix onlay bone blocks.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Eight trials investigated which are the most effective techniques for vertical bone augmentation.</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-07-20 18:30:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In order to understand when bone augmentation procedures are needed and which are the most effective techniques, larger and well designed trials are needed. Such trials should be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>). It is difficult to provide clear indications with respect of which augmentation procedures should be tested first, however, once established in which clinical situations augmentation procedures are actually needed, priority could be given to those interventions which look simpler, less invasive, involve less risk of complications, and reach their goals within the shortest timeframe. Indications for using various bone substitutes should be explored in more detail and it should be evaluated which donor sites could provide the sufficient amount of bone with less risk of complications and patient discomfort. Patient-centred outcomes should also be considered when designing such trials.</P>

<P>Patients subjected to vertical augmentation procedures having residual bone above the mandibular canal of 5 to 9 mm. Adults treated at the University of Bologna, Italy. Patients were excluded if they presented a severe knife-edge ridge, bone defect following tumour resection, smoking more than 15 cigarettes per day, severe renal and liver disease, history of radiotherapy in the head and neck region, chemotherapy at the time of the surgical intervention, non-compensated diabetes, active periodontal disease, mucosal disease such as lichen planus in the areas to be treated, poor oral hygiene, non-compliant. 11 patients enrolled, 6 in the GBR group (1 patient treated bilaterally) and 5 in the osteodistraction group.</P>

<P>Autogenous inlay bone grafts harvested from the iliac crest versus vertical distraction osteogenesis to vertically augment deficient posterior mandibles. Patients were grafted with a 2-stage approach: first a monocortical bone block was interposed between the basal bone and an osteotomised segment raised coronally without flap elevation at the lingual side to preserve blood supply and fixed with titanium miniplates and miniscrews (KLS Martin, Tuttlingen, Germany). No barriers were used. After 3/4 months miniplates were removed and implants were placed and left submerged for 3 to 4 months. The distraction procedure was accomplished by using osteodistractors of various brands (Track by KLS Martin, Al-Mar by Cizeta, LactoSorb by Wakterl Lorenz Surgical, the latter being a resorbable device) fixed to the bone segments with various titanium or resorbable screws. The distraction devices were activated after 1 week, twice a day (0.5 to 1 mm per day for 5 to 7 days) until the desired amount of distraction was obtained (7 to 15 mm). In 2 cases a prosthetic device was used to avoid lingual tipping. The bone segments were then left to consolidate for 3 to 4 months, the osteodistractors were removed and dental implants placed and left submerged for 3 to 4 months. All augmentation procedures were performed under general anaesthesia. Dental implants of several brands were used (A-Z implant, Biohorizons, Biomet 3i, Friadent, Nobel Biocare). All patients were rehabilitated with partial provisional prostheses for 14 to 16 months until definitive prostheses were delivered.</P>

<P>Non-resorbable titanium-reinforced ePTFE barrier (Gore-Tex, WL Gore and Associates, Inc., Flagstone, USA) supported by particulate autogenous bone harvested from the mandibular ramus and sometimes from the chin versus vertical distraction osteogenesis. 2 different vertical GBR procedures were used: 6 patients were treated with a 1-stage approach (implants were inserted and the augmentation procedure was performed on the same occasion) whereas 5 patients were treated with a 2-stage approach (first the bone at the site was augmented and left to heal for 6 to 7 months, and then implants were placed). The 2-stage approach was used when the risk of insufficient primary implant stability of implants was subjectively expected. With the 2-stage approach 1 or 2 titanium miniscrews were used as additional support for the barriers. All barriers were stabilized with titanium fixating pins (Frios, Friadent GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) or miniscrews (Gebrüder Martin GmbH &amp; Co., Tuttlingen, Germany) or both. The distraction procedure was accomplished by using osteodistractors (Gebrüder Martin GmbH &amp; Co.) fixed to the bone segments with 1.5 mm large titanium screws. The distraction devices were activated after 1 week, twice a day (0.5 mm every 12 h) until the desired amount of distraction was obtained. Surgical templates were used to optimise implant insertion. 2 implant systems were used: Brånemark Mark III implants (Nobel Biocare, Göteborg, Sweden), and ITI SLA implants (Institut Straumann AG, Waldenburg, Switzerland). All patients were rehabilitated with screw-retained metal-ceramic fixed prostheses.</P>

Empty spaces were filled with cancellous bone chips. In case of severe vertical resorption, grafts were assembled in a multilayered fashion. No barriers were used. Bone grafts were harvested from the mandibular ramus of the same side of reconstruction in 6 patients, while in 2 patients, where larger defects were present, bone was harvested bilaterally.

<P>3 different techniques to horizontally augment local ridge maxillary defects (from 1st to 1st premolars) for allowing placement of single implants were tested: (1) bone graft from the chin; (2) bone graft from the chin with a resorbable barrier (Bio-Gide, Geistlich Pharmaceutical, Wolhusen, Switzerland); (3) 100% bovine anorganic bone (Bio-Oss, spongiosa granules of 0.25-1 mm, Geistlich Pharmaceutical, Wolhusen, Switzerland) with a Bio-Gide resorbable barrier. The cortical bone of the recipient sites was perforated to create a bleeding bone surface and to open the cancellous bone. Bone blocks from the chin were fixed with a 1.5 mm diameter titanium screw (Martin Medizin Technik, Tuttlingen, Germany) and particulate bone from the chin was placed around the fixed bone grafts. Implants were placed 3 months after autogenous bone grafting and 6 months after augmenting sites with Bio-Oss.

Between pulses there was a 800 µs pause (on:off period = 1:4). Patient compliance was monitored by a memory chip inside the ultrasound equipment. 6 weeks post-distraction the distraction devices were removed and 2 12 mm long ITI Bonefit implants (Straumann AG, Waldenburg, Switzerland) were inserted and left to heal for 3 months before being loaded with an overdenture.</P>

<P>3 procedures were tested: (1) installation of 4 short implants (8 or 11mm) left to heal for 3 months; (2) mandibular augmentation with an autologous bone graft from the iliac crest and (3) transmandibular Bosker implants. We were only interested in the former 2 procedures. Mandibles were augmented under general anaesthesia using the interpositional technique. The mandible was sectioned in the interforaminal area, and a bone block taken from the anterior ilium was positioned between the 2 segments which were stabilized with osteosynthesis wires and left to heal for 3 months. The wires were then removed, and 13 to 18 mm long implants were placed and left to heal for an additional 3 months. The short implants used were Twin Plus IMZ implants (Friatec, Mannheim, Germany) whereas the augmented mandibles were treated with 4 specially designed IMZ apical screw implants. Patients were rehabilitated with overdentures supported by an egg-shaped triple bar without cantilever extensions.<BR/>

<P>Article: "At the time of the first surgery, one side was randomly assigned to either the test group or the control group by opening an envelope with the group assignment sealed inside".</P>
<P>However, the protocol, as described in the materials and methods section, was not followed.</P>
<P>Author's reply: "In each patient one side was randomly assigned to receive allograft or autograft as described in the text. The randomization was done at the time of the surgery with a coin 'by pitch and toss'. After the full thickness flap was elevated by the surgeon, two 'tenting screws' were positioned in the residual bone and left to protrude for the required height and the membrane was bent and trimmed to adapt to the recipient site. Only at this time, an investigator completely extraneous to the surgery and not involved in the selection of the patients was invited to toss. Of course the surgeon could not be completely blinded, but he was informed of the graft to use only after flap elevation in order not to interfere with flap design, membrane preparation and tending screws positioning. In this way the DSB measurements (the first step to evaluate the amount of vertical bone gained) were performed prior to group allocation".</P>
<P>Additional request: "In the original paper it was written that assignment was done "by opening an envelope with the group assignment sealed inside", I wonder what was actually used: Toss of a coin or envelopes".</P>
<P>Author's reply: "The randomization was supposed to be done by opening an envelope as reported in the protocol that we wrote before the beginning of the study. This data has been then reported in the text. However, at the beginning of the RCT we found easier and quicker to use the 'pitch and toss'".</P>

<P>In the article, data of 20 patients were presented. However, after our query about how they ended up having 10 patients in each group by tossing a coin, which is quite unlikely to happen, the author replied that there were actually 23 patients enrolled, but they excluded data of 3 patients from 1 group to balance the numbers. After our request, they gave us the complete data.</P>
