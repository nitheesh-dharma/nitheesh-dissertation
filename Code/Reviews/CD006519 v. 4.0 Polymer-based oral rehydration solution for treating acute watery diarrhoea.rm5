<P>
<B>What is polymer-based ORS and how might it help</B>
</P>
<P>Acute diarrhoea is a common cause of death and illness in developing countries. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) have had a massive impact worldwide in reducing the number of deaths related to diarrhoea.</P>
<P>The original ORS was based on glucose and had an osmolarity of &#8805; 310 mOsm/L (ORS &#8805; 310). Glucose-based ORS with a lower osmolarity was later introduced in attempts to improve efficacy, and is considered better at reducing the amount and duration of diarrhoea. Most ORS is in the form of a sugar&#8211;salt solution, but over the years people have tried adding a variety of compounds ('glucose polymers') such as whole rice, wheat, sorghum, and maize. The aim is to slowly release glucose into the gut and improve the absorption of the water and salt in the solution.</P>
<P>This review updates a Cochrane Review published in 2009, and assesses the available evidence on the use of polymer-based ORS (both rice and non-rice based) versus glucose-based ORS.</P>
<P>
<B>What the research says</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane researchers examined the available evidence up to 5 September 2016. Thirty-five trials including 4284 participants met the inclusion criteria: 28 trials included children; five included adults; and two included both. Most trials compared polymer-based ORS with a sugar&#8211;salt ORS with a particular strength (ORS &#8805; 310), which is slightly more salty than the currently agreed best formula (&#8804; 270 mOsm/L). The trials' methodological quality varied.</P>
<P>In people given polymer-based ORS versus sugar-salt ORS &#8804; 270 mOsm/L there was insufficient evidence to show that one is better than the other (<I>low </I>to<I> very low quality of evidence</I>).</P>
<P>In those given polymer-based ORS versus sugar-salt ORS &#8805; 310 mOsm/L, there was a lower amount of stool and shorter time of diarrhoea in the polymer-based ORS group. No difference was observed between the two groups regarding the number of people who needed a drip to be rehydrated. Adverse events were similar (<I>low </I>to<I> very low quality of evidence). </I>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-09 13:24:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute diarrhoea is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality among children in low-income countries. Glucose-based oral rehydration solution (ORS) helps replace fluid and prevent further dehydration from acute diarrhoea. Since 2004, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the osmolarity of less than 270 mOsm/L (ORS &#8804; 270) versus greater than 310 mOsm/L formulation (ORS &#8805; 310). Polymer-based ORS (for example, prepared using rice or wheat) slowly releases glucose and may be superior to glucose-based ORS.</P>

<P>Eight trials (752 participants) evaluated this comparison, and seven trials used rice as a polymer source. Polymer-based ORS may decrease mean stool output in the first 24 hours by 24 mL/kg (mean difference (MD) &#8722;24.60 mL/kg, 95% CI &#8722;40.69 to &#8722;8.51; one trial, 99 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). The average duration of diarrhoea may be reduced by eight hours (MD &#8722;8.24 hours, 95% CI &#8722;13.17 to &#8722;3.30; I statistic = 86%, five trials, 364 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>) with polymer ORS but results are heterogeneous. Limited trials showed no observed difference in the risk of unscheduled use of intravenous fluid (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.02; I statistic = 30%; four trials, 376 participants, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), vomiting (<I>very low quality evidence</I>), and hyponatraemia (<I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-07 03:10:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Germana V. Gregorio">
<P>Acute diarrhoea is defined as three or more loose bowel movements in a 24-hour period (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_icddr_x002c_b-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/icddr,b 1995</LINK>), and is one of the principal causes of morbidity and mortality among children in low-income countries. <LINK REF="REF-Kosek-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosek 2003</LINK>, a review of 27 prospective studies from 20 countries published from 1990 to 2000, estimated the incidence of diarrhoea as 3.8 episodes per child per year for children under 11 months of age and 2.1 episodes per child per year for children aged one to four years. It has a negative impact on quality of life and can result in considerable healthcare costs. Most of these diarrhoeal illnesses occur in low-income countries and are mainly caused by infection. The cause is mainly viral in children aged under five years, while both bacterial and viral pathogens are implicated in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Casburn_x002d_Jones-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casburn-Jones 2004</LINK>). Other causes of acute diarrhoea are disordered motility, such as irritable bowel syndrome, intake of certain drugs, or ileal bile acid malabsorption.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-07 03:10:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Germana V. Gregorio">
<P>Since the 1980s, efforts to reduce the number of deaths from diarrhoea have been based on several interventions, including the improvement of water quality and sanitation, promotion of breastfeeding, and the introduction of treatment programmes that include oral rehydration therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Claeson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Claeson 1990</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the oral rehydration solution (ORS) in 1979, and it rapidly became the cornerstone of programmes for the control of diarrhoeal diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Claeson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Claeson 1990</LINK>). The osmolarity of the original formulation is 310 mOsm/L (referred to as ORS &#8805; 310) and consists of glucose (111 mmol/L), sodium (90 mmol/L), potassium (20 mmol/L), chloride (80 mmol/L), and citrate (10 mmol/L) or bicarbonate (30 mmol/L). The ORS was shown to improve signs of dehydration, including thirst, sunken eyeballs, sunken fontanelles, poor skin turgor, or a decreased or absence of urine output (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_icddr_x002c_b-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/icddr,b 1995</LINK>). It was considered to be both safe and effective (<LINK REF="REF-Santosham-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santosham 1991</LINK>), and mainly responsible for the decrease in case-fatality rates from acute dehydrating diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Victora-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victora 2000</LINK>). In 2004, the WHO recommended a different formulation in which the glucose and sodium content were each reduced to 75 mmol/L to give a total osmolarity of 245 mOsm/L (referred to as ORS &#8804; 270) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). The ORS &#8804; 270 reduces stool volume, shortens the duration of diarrhoea, and decreases the need for unscheduled intravenous therapy compared with ORS &#8805; 310 (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-06 11:27:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The physiological basis for the use of ORS &#8805; 310 was the co-transport of glucose and sodium across the intestinal membrane (<LINK REF="REF-Santosham-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santosham 1991</LINK>). While this glucose-based ORS is effective in replacing the fluid from acute diarrhoea and thus prevents further dehydration, it neither reduces stool loss nor shortens the duration of illness (<LINK REF="REF-Santosham-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santosham 1991</LINK>). Increasing the glucose concentration to greater than 111 mmol/L increases the osmotic load of the solution, which may further aggravate the fluid loss and induce hypernatraemia (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 1992</LINK>). In recent years, the WHO has recommended an ORS with 75 mmol/L of sodium, 75 mmol/L of glucose, and a total osmolarity of 245 mmol/L (ORS &#8804; 270).</P>
<P>The biochemical basis for the use of a polymer-based ORS is the presence of starch in rice, wheat, sorghum, and some fruits and vegetables (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pizarro-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pizarro 1991</LINK>). Even during diarrhoea, the digesting enzyme (amylase) is present in large amounts in the small intestine, so this starch is slowly broken down into glucose molecules. This glucose in turn provides the carrier molecules for co-transport of sodium and water across the intestinal epithelium, without the corresponding osmotic penalty that results if the quantity of glucose is further increased by the use of ORS &#8805; 310.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-09 13:31:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>New ORS formulations have been evaluated in attempts to improve the efficacy of ORS &#8805; 310 (<LINK REF="STD-Molla-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Molla 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoekstra-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hoekstra 2004</LINK>). Glucose polymer-based ORS (referred to as polymer-based ORS) may contain whole rice (amylopectins), as in rice-based ORS or rice syrups (maltodextrins). The difference is that the latter contains only a small amount of amino acids and protein. Other sources of polymers are wheat, sorghum, and maize (high amylase-resistant starch). In these polymer-based solutions, the glucose is slowly released after digestion and is absorbed in the small bowel, which enhances the reabsorption of water and electrolyte secreted into the bowel lumen during diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pizarro-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pizarro 1991</LINK>). Although ORS &#8805; 310 is no longer recommended, it remains unknown whether a polymer-based ORS is indeed more effective than a glucose-based ORS (that is, ORS &#8805; 310 or ORS &#8804; 270).</P>
<P>A Cochrane Review of rice-based ORS for treating diarrhoea concluded that it significantly reduced the mean 24-hour stool output in adults and children with cholera or cholera-like diarrhoea, but results were inconclusive for infants and children with non-cholera diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 1998</LINK>). In this Cochrane Review, we have updated the evidence on the use of polymer-based ORS (both rice-based ORS and non-rice based ORS) and expanded the primary outcome measures to include the number of participants who required unscheduled use of intravenous fluid therapy. Other primary outcome measures focus on the duration of diarrhoea and the stool output in the first 24 hours since these are considered crucial in the management of these patients and the first 24 hours is the time period of greatest stool loss. Our Cochrane Review also aims to provide more insights into whether polymer-based ORS is more effective than glucose-based ORS, and to inform future research.</P>
<P>Patients are dehydrated during the first six to eight hours, but once rehydrated, feeding is initiated and stool losses are replaced volume per volume with the ORS. The effect of feeding a rice-based or starch-based food as soon as the participants are rehydrated could confound the effects of glucose polymer-based ORS (<LINK REF="STD-Alam-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Alam 1992</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two review authors (GVG and LFD) independently screened the literature search results by title or abstract. We retrieved the full-text reports of studies that either one or both review authors considered potentially relevant and trials with unclear treatment allocation. We independently assessed the inclusion criteria of these trials using a standard eligibility form. We resolved any disagreements through discussion, or if necessary, we consulted a third review author (MLM Gonzales).쟙e scrutinized trial reports to ensure we detected that the result has not been previously published. We listed the excluded studies and the reasons for exclusion in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' section.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:15:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (GV Gregorio and EG Martinez or MLM Gonzales) independently extracted data from the included trials using pretested data extraction forms. We extracted the number of participants who were randomized and the number of participants analysed for all outcomes for each treatment arm in each trial to determine loss to follow-up, whether loss was comparable across treatments, and to determine the type of analysis used. Since the primary outcome measures were continuous, we extracted arithmetic means and standard deviations (SDs) for each treatment group and noted the number of participants in each group. In trials with multiple interventions (two or more different polymer-based ORS that were used as treatment groups), we pooled the means and SDs of the different polymer-based ORS across the treatment arms.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcome measures, we recorded the number(s) of participants that experienced the event and the number of participants analysed in each treatment group. In the meta-analysis, for multiple treatment arms, we combined the number of participants that experienced the outcome in two or more experimental interventions as appropriate and compared collectively with the control group.</P>
<P>We resolved any disagreements about data extracted by referring to the trial report and through discussion, or, if necessary, we consulted a third review author. Where data were insufficient or missing, we attempted to contact the trial authors for clarification. GV Gregorio entered the data into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-26 16:13:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (GV Gregorio and LF Dans or MLM Gonzales) independently assessed the risk of bias (methodological quality) of each trial using a prepared 'Risk of bias' assessment form. We assessed the generation of allocation sequence and allocation concealment as either 'high', 'low', or 'unclear'. We also noted who was blinded, such as the trial participants, care providers, or outcome assessors, and classified the inclusion of randomized participants in the analysis as either adequate if greater than 90% or inadequate if 90% or less. We used the results of the assessment to perform a sensitivity analysis. In the case of unclear or missing information, we attempted to contact the trial authors. We resolved disagreements by discussion between the review authors (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-08-23 14:38:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcome measures included: (1) total stool output in the first 24 hours from randomization (g/kg), (2) total stool output from randomization to cessation of diarrhoea (g/kg); and (3) duration of diarrhoea during the study period (hours). We extracted the arithmetic mean and standard deviation (or medians and ranges) values and the number of participants analysed in each treatment group.</P>
<P>The dichotomous outcomes included: (1) unscheduled use of intravenous fluid; (2) vomiting; (3) hyponatraemia; (4) hypokalaemia (low potassium levels); and (5) development of persistent diarrhoea (diarrhoea of more than 10 days' duration from onset). We recorded the number of participants who experienced the episode and the total number of participants in each group.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-08-22 11:16:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the weighted mean difference to combine continuous data that were summarized by arithmetic means and standard deviations data. If the included trials reported data using geometric means, this may have indicated that the data was skewed. Thus, we extracted the standard deviation on the log scale using the generic inverse variance method and reported it on the natural scale. We reported the medians and ranges in a table.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-08-22 11:17:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We attempted to contact the trial authors for any insufficient or missing data. If there was discrepancy in the number of participants randomized and the number of participants analysed in each treatment group, we reported the percentage loss to follow-up in each group.

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-08-18 01:28:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Germana V. Gregorio">
<P>We evaluated the presence of statistical heterogeneity among the interventions by inspecting the forest plot and by performing a Chi test for heterogeneity using a P value of 0.10 to determine statistical significance. Also, we used an I statistic value of 50% as an indication of moderate heterogeneity. If there was statistically significant heterogeneity, we used the random-effects or DerSimonian and Laird method to combine data (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>); otherwise we applied a fixed-effect model.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-08-22 11:17:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the presence of publication bias by looking for asymmetry in the funnel plots. We also assessed asymmetry of the funnel plots using the StatsDirect computer programme (<LINK REF="REF-StatsDirect-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">StatsDirect 2008</LINK>), and considered a P value of less than 0.05 on Egger's bias test as significant.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:15:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>GV Gregorio analysed the data using RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>), and presented the results with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We determined and reported the percentage of participants lost to follow-up for all trials based on the number randomized and the number analysed in each treatment group. We based analyses on a complete-case approach. For the participants who did not adhere to the study protocol, we based their outcome on what the trial author(s) reported (if they performed an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis) or on data we sought from the trial authors (if there was no ITT analysis).</P>
<P>We presented risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We determined continuous outcomes summarized as arithmetic means and SDs data using the mean difference (MD).</P>
<P>We checked the normality of the data by calculating the ratio of the mean over the SD. If the ratio (mean/SD) was less than two, then it was likely that the data were skewed and therefore we did not combine the data in the meta-analysis.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-08-18 01:32:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Germana V. Gregorio">
<P>We investigated heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. We subgrouped trials according to the osmolarity of glucose ORS (ORS &#8805; 310 or ORS &#8804; 270) and type of polymer (rice, wheat, maltodextrins, and sorghum). We also evaluated the effect of the participant age (&lt; 19 years (paediatric) and &#8805; 19 years (adult) and of cholera as a pathogen. When there was substantial statistical heterogeneity (that is, I statistic = 100%), we did not combine the trials in the meta-analysis.</P>

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-10-14 11:19:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the meta-analysis by excluding trials of a low methodological quality, that is, those that used an inadequate method of randomization, unconcealed treatment allocation, and inadequate inclusion of randomized participants in the analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GDT) to prepare the 'Summary of findings' tables (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK>). We considered generation of allocation sequence adequate if the study authors stated that they used a method with unpredictable sequence such as random number table or computer generated random numbers; unclear if trial authors stated that the trial was randomized but gave no further information; or inadequate when allocation was predictable and therefore introduced selection bias.</P>
<P>Allocation concealment was adequate if the investigator or the participant could not predict assignment to the group, such as by using central randomization, identical drug containers, or sealed opaque envelopes; unclear if the trial authors did not describe the method of concealment; or inadequate if the allocation of participant could be predicted.</P>
<P>We considered blinding adequate when the investigator or participant (double blind) did not know whether recruitment was to the intervention or control arms; unclear if the trial authors did not describe the method of blinding; and inadequate if the trial did not use blinding.</P>
<P>We considered follow-up to be adequate when study authors presented study end points for 90% or more of the participants enrolled at the beginning; inadequate when follow-up was less than 90%; and unclear when either the number of participants recruited at the beginning of the study or the number of participants who completed the study were unclear.</P>

<P>We observed substantial, significant heterogeneity in the primary outcomes and therefore we decided to use a funnel plot for the secondary outcome, where the data were homogenous. We constructed a funnel plot of 19 trials that compared polymer-based and ORS &#8805; 310 and measured the outcome of unscheduled use of intravenous fluid (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The funnel plot is asymmetric due to the absence of smaller trials at the base and to the right of the pooled estimate. Asymmetry in the funnel plot could result from possible selection bias where smaller studies reporting greater treatment benefit for the experimental group were published (publication bias). The gap in the bottom corner of the graph suggests that smaller studies without statistically significant effects remain unpublished. Differences in inclusion criteria (for example, cholera positive versus mixed pathogens) and method of assessment of unscheduled use of intravenous fluid may also account for the asymmetry.</P>

<P>We retrieved all relevant trials regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and ongoing) and we included those that met the inclusion criteria. Most clinical trials included infants and children with acute diarrhoea and were conducted in developing countries, which are the age group and the setting with a high incidence of diarrhoea. However, most of the clinical trials (77%) used ORS &#8805; 310. Since 2004, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of reduced osmolarity ORS &#8804; 270. There were only eight clinical trials that used ORS &#8804; 270, thus, data from this review could not adequately compare the two formulations.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Polymer-based versus ORS &#8804; 270</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of the evidence as low to very low. There was serious risk of bias. Of the eight trials, only five had adequate allocation sequence and only one had adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Maulen_x002d_Radovan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maulen-Radovan 2004</LINK>). No study was blinded and there was one with inadequate follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Nanulescu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nanulescu 1999</LINK>).

There is also risk of imprecision due to the limited sample size and wide confidence interval (CI) of the results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Polymer-based versus ORS &#8805; 310</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the evidence was from low to very low. Of the 27 trials, most trials (18 trials, 67%) had adequate allocation sequence but only 11 trials (41%) had adequate allocation concealment; the rest were unclear. Only three trials had complete blinding, the rest had partial, unclear, or no blinding. There is risk of indirectness as all but one trial was conducted in a hospital setting. There was no serious imprecision as the sample size was sufficient to detect any difference in the outcomes.</P>
<P>Overall, there is substantial heterogeneity in the clinical trials, despite statistically significant results in the primary outcomes. Different authors assessed the outcomes differently and this may explain the heterogeneity in the treatment effect (methodological diversity). Ideally, measurement of stool output should be made by taking the difference in the weight of the diaper before and after use. In some studies that included both males and females (especially in the paediatric group), the urine output may have been inadvertently mixed with the stool, giving an erroneously higher stool output. In adults, three trials used a cholera cot to measure stool output (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dutta-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dutta 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramakrishna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ramakrishna 2000</LINK>), while one trial did not state the measurement method used (<LINK REF="STD-Alam-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Alam 1992</LINK>). The cholera cot has a bucket underneath to measure the stool output more accurately. It was also unclear in most trials whether the duration of diarrhoea was measured from the initial onset of the disease, before admission to the study, or only from admission up to the time of discharge. Different trials may also have used different criteria to define patients who warrant an unscheduled use of intravenous fluid.</P>
<P>Polymer-based ORS may have several advantages that are independent of glucose. The protein and amino acid component found in certain polymer-based ORS, such as in rice-based ORS, may stimulate sodium absorption and the slow breakdown of starch into glucose molecules may promote reabsorption of intestinal secretions and reduce the volume and duration of diarrhoea. The new reduced osmolarity ORS formulation (ORS &#8804; 270) with reduced osmotic load is the currently recommended ORS (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). This Cochrane Review failed to show with certainty that polymer-based ORS is as effective as, or is more effective than, the reduced osmolarity ORS.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-08-07 03:03:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Germana V. Gregorio">
<P>We searched different databases for clinical trials on ORS and acute diarrhoea. Also we checked the web sites of organizations and pharmaceutical companies who may be funding a similar study for unpublished or ongoing clinical trials. However, we still observed publication bias as evidenced by an asymmetric funnel plot due to the absence of smaller trials at the base and to the right of the pooled estimate. This suggests that clinical trials with small numbers of participants or with negative results remain unpublished. Most trials were done in the hospital setting under ideal conditions with highly selected participants that had evidence of moderate to severe dehydration. This limits the review's ability to be generalized as most acute diarrhoea cases start at home and the severity of dehydration may be minimized by immediately initiating ORS.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-05 16:27:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The efficacy of rice-based ORS has previously been reported to decrease the stool output in the first 24 hours among <I>V. cholerae-</I>positive patients, in both adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 1998</LINK>). We observed that polymer-based ORS as compared with glucose ORS &#8805; 310 decreased the total stool output and duration of diarrhoea, regardless of whether the diarrhoea was secondary to <I>V. cholerae</I> infection or due to either bacterial or viral cause (mixed pathogens). This review considered all clinical trials that used rice and non-rice sources of polymers, such as wheat, maize, or sorghum, that are used as staple foods in other parts of the world.</P>
<P>On the other hand, polymer-based ORS &#8805; 310 decreased the need for intravenous fluid only among those infected with mixed pathogens but not in <I>V. cholerae-</I>positive patients. The difference in effect may be attributed to the difference in the diarrhoeal mechanism between these pathogens. Cholera is an enterotoxin-mediated diarrhoea and intestinal secretory processes are activated by the bacteria, which leads to massive fluid and electrolyte losses, without any macro- or micro-damage to the intestinal mucosa. Thus, there is a need for rapid fluid replacement which may not be possible with oral rehydration alone. On the other hand, commonly-encountered enteric pathogens in childhood diarrhoea, such as rotavirus, <I>Salmonella</I> spp, and <I>Shigella</I> spp, cause injury to the intestinal mucosae which leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of fluid, electrolytes, and nutrients.</P>
<P>In a large multicentre trial, the use of a reduced osmolarity ORS (ORS &#8804; 270) compared to a glucose-based ORS (ORS &#8805; 310) decreased the need for unscheduled use of intravenous fluid by 33% (<LINK REF="REF-CHOICE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CHOICE 2001</LINK>). In this review, most of the included clinical trials used ORS &#8805; 310 and only a few trials used the newer ORS &#8804; 270, which has a lower osmolarity. We were unable to make any definite conclusion on the efficacy of polymer-based ORS compared with ORS &#8804; 270.</P>

<P>Polymer-based ORS shows advantages compared to glucose-based ORS (at &#8805; 310 mOsm/L). Comparisons favoured polymer-based ORS over ORS &#8804; 270 but the analysis was underpowered.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-08-07 03:10:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Germana V. Gregorio">
<P>The rationale for the use of polymer-based ORS is the slow release of glucose from starch, which provides the carrier molecules for sodium without the osmotic penalty that results if the quantity of glucose is increased by the use of ORS &#8805; 310. Since the ORS presently recommended already has a reduced osmolarity (ORS &#8804; 270), more clinical trials are needed to compare the polymer-based ORS with ORS &#8804; 270.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Change in title: we changed the review title to highlight the fact that this is a review of polymer-based ORS (not glucose-based ORS).</LI>
<LI>New author: EG Martinez joined the review author team after the protocol was published.</LI>
<LI>Data extraction: we originally planned to extract count data by determination of the total number of episodes in each group (if the episode is rare) or the number of person years in each group for each treatment arm (if the episode is common). However, during the assessment of the trials, the trials reported the number of participants with unscheduled use of intravenous fluid, and thus we considered it to be a dichotomous rather than a count outcome. Similarly, in the data extraction for number of episodes of vomiting, there were only four trials that reported this outcome, while nine clinical trials reported the number of participants with vomiting. We decided that we would report the latter. Other adverse effects that were reported in the trials included number of participants with hypokalaemia (low potassium levels) and those with development of persistent diarrhoea (diarrhoea of more than 10 days' duration from onset), which we also included in the review.</LI>
<LI>Data analysis: in multiple treatment arms with two or more polymer-based ORS as treatment groups, we combined the outcomes as appropriate and compared them collectively with the control group. Most trials included both cholera and non-cholera cases, and we collectively termed this group as having mixed pathogens rather than non-cholera diarrhoea.</LI>
<LI>Subgroup analyses: these were limited to the osmolarity of the glucose ORS, the type of polymer, and the effects of participant's age and pathogen. The review authors did not evaluate the source of the polymer and the effect of feeding as most of the polymers were locally prepared and only one trial withheld feeding after hydration.</LI>
<LI>Publication bias: we confirmed the presence of publication bias with a statistical software programme (<LINK REF="REF-StatsDirect-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">StatsDirect 2008</LINK>).</LI>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2016-08-22 11:38:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The authors have rightly mentioned that since 2004, the WHO has recommended that low osmolarity (&lt; 270 mOsm/L) oral rehydrating solution be used as the treatment for dehydration. This being the case, the rationale for undertaking a systematic review to compare standard osmolarity oral rehydration solutions (glucose- or polymer-based) is not clear. It would have been more appropriate to conduct the review on currently recommended oral rehydration solutions (low osmolarity). In continuation to the above, it is therefore inappropriate to pool together (in meta-analysis) trials with low osmolarity ORS as well as trials with standard osmolarity ORS. Incidentally, polymer-based ORS has been shown to be superior only when these trials (apples and oranges) were pooled together. Similarly, it is inappropriate to pool data from adults and children together, because they behave differently in response to diarrhoea and consequent dehydration. Therefore, a re-analysis of data on low osmolarity ORS in children (the critical age group which is the focus of the WHO and Millennium Development Goals) reveals that there are only four trials that can be pooled together (these are present in the subgroup analysis). I have undertaken a fresh search on 25th April and have not come across any trials beyond the search date mentioned in the review; hence these four trials can be taken as the current evidence. There is significant heterogeneity among the four trials with respect to age of participants, type of diarrhoea, severity of dehydration, and outcomes chosen. However, the salient findings are as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Polymer based ORS is comparable to glucose-based ORS in terms of treatment failure (requirement of intravenous fluid).</LI>
<LI>Polymer-based ORS is comparable to glucose-based ORS for two adverse events viz vomiting and hyponatraemia. Hyponatremia was surprisingly frequent in the single trial reporting it (<LINK REF="STD-Dutta-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dutta 2000</LINK>); this trial was conducted in children with cholera diarrhoea having severe dehydration. This could be a matter of concern for using low osmolarity ORS (either type) if substantiated by other reports.</LI>
<LI>The duration and amount of diarrhoea were significantly reduced with non-glucose ORS. However, these statistically significant differences may not have as much clinical significance considering that the duration was shortened by only about 4.5 hours and the amount by less than 25 g/kg, that is, 2.5% body weight, although the latter represents approximately 25% decrease compared to glucose ORS. It may be recalled that 5% loss results in mild dehydration in infants and young children (3% in older).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Therefore, at best polymer-based ORS can be regarded as comparable to glucose-based ORS, but not superior. Of course, considering the limited data, further research may yield a more definitive answer.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2016-12-06 11:29:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have singled out the results of the low osmolarity glucose solutions (ORS &lt; 270) and have re-analysed the data considering separately the glucose ORS low and high osmolarity solutions. Based on a re-analysis, there were six trials that used ORS &lt; 270 (low) and 29 trials with ORS &gt; 300 (high).쟖sing the stratification of ORS &lt; 270 and ORS &gt; 300 in all analyses, we made the following conclusions.</P>
<UL>
<LI>No statistically significant difference between the polymer-based and glucose-based ORS groups in the number of participants with vomiting, hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, and development of persistent diarrhoea.</LI>
<LI>Total stool output in the first 24 hours is shorter in those who were given rice-based ORS as compared to those who were given glucose-based ORS &lt; 270(based on one trial).</LI>
<LI>Unscheduled use of Intravenous fluid was fewer in those given rice-based ORS as compared to those given ORS &gt; 300 (13 trials).쟕here was only one trial on ORS &lt; 270 that reported unscheduled use of Intravenous fluids.</LI>
<LI>Significantly shorter duration of diarrhoea in adults in those given rice-based ORS as compared with ORS &gt; 310 (two trials) or ORS &lt; 270 (two trials).</LI>
</UL>
<P>With stratification of the data on whether they were given ORS &lt; 270 or ORS &gt; 300, no definite conclusions could be made as significant data (bullet points 2 and 4 above) is based only on two trials with the use of ORS &lt; 270. The authors believe that we should wait for further trials on ORS &lt; 270 before doing a reanalysis of the review.</P>
