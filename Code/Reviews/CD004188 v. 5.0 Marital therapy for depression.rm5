<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-02 14:36:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Marital therapy has been suggested as a treatment for couples with a depressed spouse on the basis of the strong association between depressive symptoms and marital distress; the role played by marital negative factors on onset and maintenance of depressive disorders; and the possible buffering effect of interpersonal support and enhanced intimacy on depressive symptoms. Therefore, marital therapy has the two-fold aim of modifying negative interactional patterns and increasing mutually supportive aspects of couple relationships. This review aimed to provide an overall assessment of the role of marital therapy among psychological treatments for depression. The meta-analysis showed that there was no evidence to consider marital therapy as more or less effective than individual psychotherapy, either reducing depressive symptoms or the proportion of participants who remained depressed at caseness level (persistence of depression). The absence of a significant difference also held true when only distressed couples were included. However, in comparison to no/minimal treatment, the outcome for depressive symptoms and persistence of depression was better in the marital therapy group. There were no significant differences in the number of dropouts between the marital therapy group than in the individual psychotherapy group, this was also true when only distressed couples were analysed. Marital distress was significantly lower and persistence of marital distress significantly less frequent in the marital therapy group than in the individual treatment group. This effect was enhanced when distressed couples were considered separately. In comparison with drug therapy only data from two studies about dropout rates were available, showing significant relative risk in favour of marital therapy. All the results should be regarded in light of the methodological limitations of the studies, which, in general, are affected by small sample sizes; assessments at the end of treatment or short follow-up; unclear sample representation; and loss of patients at follow-up. The mediating role of other variables, such as improvement in marital satisfaction, could not be adequately tested. Although there is no evidence to consider marital therapy as more or less effective than individual psychotherapy or drug therapy for depression, the evidence for improvement in couple relationships due to marital therapy may favour the choice of marital therapy when marital distress is perceived as a major problem. Otherwise, the choice rests on patient preference and availability of specific resources.</P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Marital therapy for depression has the two-fold aim of modifying negative interaction patterns and increasing mutually supportive aspects of couple relationships, thus changing the interpersonal context linked to depression.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To conduct a meta-analysis of all intervention studies comparing marital therapy to other psychosocial and pharmacological treatments, or to non-active treatments. <BR/>2. To conduct an assessment of the internal validity and external validity. <BR/>3. To assess the overall effectiveness of marital therapy as a treatment for depression. <BR/>4. To identify mediating variables through which marital therapy is effective in depression treatment.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>CCDANCTR-Studies was searched on 5-9-2005, Relevant journals and reference lists were checked.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials examining the effectiveness of marital therapy versus individual psychotherapy, drug therapy or waiting list/no treatment/minimal treatment for depression were included in the review. Quasi-randomised controlled trials were also included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted using a standardised spreadsheet. Where data were not included in published papers, two attempts were made to obtain the data from the authors. Data were synthesised using Review Manager software. Dichotomous data were pooled using the relative risk (RR), and continuous data were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The random effects model was employed for all comparisons. A formal test for heterogeneity, the natural approximate chi-squared test, was also calculated.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eight studies were included in the review. No significant difference in effect was found between marital therapy and individual psychotherapy, either for the continuous outcome of depressive symptoms, based on six studies: SMD -0.12 (95% CI -0.56 to 0.32), or the dichotomous outcome of proportion of subjects remaining at caseness level, based on three studies: RR 0.84 (95% CI 0.32 to 2.22). In comparison with drug therapy, a lower drop-out rate was found for marital therapy: RR 0.31 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.61), but this result was greatly influenced by a single study. The comparison with no/minimal treatment, showed a large significant effect in favour of marital therapy for depressive symptoms, based on two studies: SMD -1.28 (95% CI -1.85 to -0.72) and a smaller significant effect for persistence of depression, based on one study only. The findings were weakened by methodological problems affecting most studies, such as the small number of cases available for analysis in almost all comparisons, and the significant heterogeneity among studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence to suggest that marital therapy is more or less effective than individual psychotherapy or drug therapy in the treatment of depression. Improvement of relations in distressed couples might be expected from marital therapy. Future trials should test whether marital therapy is superior to other interventions for distressed couples with a depressed partner, especially considering the role of potential effect moderators in the improvement of depression. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Depression is a common mental disorder primarily characterised by pervasive sadness with loss of interest or pleasure in most activities. It is often associated with changes in appetite, sleeping patterns or psychomotor activity, decreased energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impairment in concentration, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide ideation. It is generally agreed that, according to current diagnostic criteria, depressive disorders can be ranged along a continuum by levels of symptom severity, number of mental or physical symptoms and duration (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Depression is present in all countries and all age groups. Its distribution is nonetheless different across countries, age groups and sexes, probably reflecting cultural differences or variations in risk factors. In Western countries, one-year prevalence rates of major depression in adults cluster around 5%. Less reliable data are available for minor depressive disorders. However, recent estimates show a one-year prevalence of chronic minor depression at about 2%. Very low or very high rates have been found in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Waraich-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waraich 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Weissman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 1996</LINK>). One main feature of depression is the different distribution in the two sexes. Depression in women is twice as prevalent as it is in men (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2000</LINK>). Although depression is often short-lasting or self-limiting, in a substantial number of cases it follows a chronic, relapsing or recurrent course. Recovery following a major depressive episode occurs within one year in about 50% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>). Moreover, about 60% of people who have recovered from a first episode of major depression will experience further depressive symptoms in the following five years (<LINK REF="REF-Mueller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueller 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Depression carries an overall increased mortality risk, with a high risk of suicide compared to the general population. A Canadian study observed a two-fold standardised mortality rate for all causes (<LINK REF="REF-Newman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1991</LINK>). A recent meta-analysis estimated the lifetime suicide risk in depressed people at around 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Bostwick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bostwick 2000</LINK>). Depression can be a very disabling illness. Its symptoms interfere with daily functioning, social role performance, work productivity and physical wellbeing. According to recent estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Vos-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2000</LINK>), the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates per 1000 population for depression were 5.3 in males and 7.7 in females. Depression is considered the fourth most important cause of disability worldwide and it is expected to become the second one by the year 2020 (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Depression and other affective disorders impose a substantial economic burden on all economies in both developed and developing countries. In the United States, in 1998, it was estimated to have cost around US$ 65 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Berto-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berto 2000</LINK>). Hidden social and emotional costs, which are much more difficult to estimate, are relevant for patients, family members and caregivers (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Risk factors for depressive disorders are manifold, ranging from genetically-based neurobiological vulnerability to social and interpersonal factors. Childhood events, adverse life circumstances and stressful relationships play a significant role in the onset and maintenance of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Ogles-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogles 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment of depression<BR/>In addition to antidepressant drug therapy, a number of psychological interventions have shown to be effective as treatment for depression (<LINK REF="REF-Balslev-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balslev 1998</LINK>). Psychological treatments are increasingly becoming a focus of interest as a consequence of various factors, such as contraindications and side effects of medications, failure to comply with maintenance drug therapy and patients' preference (<LINK REF="REF-Chilvers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilvers 2001</LINK>). Although the best evidence is available for cognitive therapies, other treatment models, such as interpersonal therapy, psychodynamic therapy, non-directive counselling and marital therapy have been included in most guidelines as possibly effective interventions (<LINK REF="REF-CANMAT-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CANMAT 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Marital therapy, which is mainly based on social learning theory, has been suggested, on the basis of several converging lines of evidence, as an approach for couples where there is a depressed spouse (<LINK REF="REF-Beach-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beach 1998</LINK>). Firstly, a large body of research, coming from psychiatric epidemiological studies and surveys using self-report questionnaires, showed a strong association between depressive symptoms and marital distress (<LINK REF="REF-Whisman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whisman 2001</LINK>). Secondly, the longitudinal association between marital relationship variables and depression shows that marital negative factors, such as partner criticism, are among the most important stressors involved in the causal chain leading to depressive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Paykel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paykel 1992</LINK>). Thirdly, in contrast, interpersonal support and enhanced intimacy may have a buffering effect on depressive symptoms, thus facilitating recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Beach-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beach 1998</LINK>).<BR/>In summary, marital therapy has the two-fold aim of modifying negative interactional patterns and increasing mutually supportive aspects of couple relationships. A number of controlled clinical trials examining the effectiveness of marital therapy for depression have been conducted. Some authors showed that several forms of marital therapy can effectively treat depression (<LINK REF="REF-Baucom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baucom 1998</LINK>). However, although some narrative reviews do exist (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2003</LINK>), data from clinical trials have never been subjected to quantitative analyses. This review aims at filling this gap, by appraising and summarising evidence from all the available studies, to provide an overall assessment of the role of marital therapy among psychosocial treatments for depression.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives of this meta-analysis were:<BR/>1. To conduct a systematic review and, whenever possible, a meta-analysis of all intervention studies in which marital therapy was compared to individual psychotherapy, pharmacological treatment or to non-active treatment.<BR/>2. To conduct an assessment of the internal validity (i.e., the extent to which trials measured what they were intended to) and external validity (the extent to which results of the identified trials were generalisable or applicable to clinical practice).<BR/>3. To assess the overall effectiveness of marital therapy as a treatment for depression.<BR/>4. To identify mediating variables through which marital therapy was effective in depression treatment.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Inclusion criteria: <BR/>1. Randomised controlled trials.<BR/>2. Quasi-randomised controlled trials.<BR/>The inclusion of quasi randomised trials was a post-hoc decision.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria: <BR/>1. Naturalistic studies.<BR/>2. Observational studies.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Inclusion criteria:<BR/>1. Heterosexual adult couples (16 to 65 years old) with a depressed spouse, treated in community and outpatient settings.<BR/>2. The depressed spouse had to have had a primary diagnosis of depressive disorder according to an international validated diagnostic system (DSM-IV, ICD-10, RDC) with an assessment of the level of depressive symptoms by validated instruments.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria:<BR/>1. Ambiguous diagnosis (for instance, "psychological distress").<BR/>2. Inpatient setting.<BR/>3. Studies on the effectiveness of marital therapy focused on post-natal depression.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Inclusion criteria:<BR/>1. Marital therapy, for the purpose of this review, was defined as a structured psychological intervention in which a trained therapist met both partners in a couple, in regular sessions, with the explicit aim of modifying dysfunctional patterns of interaction.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria:<BR/>1. Family therapy interventions.</P>
<P>Treatment comparisons:<BR/>Marital therapy was evaluated through three main comparisons:<BR/>1. Versus individual psychotherapy. <BR/>2. Versus drug therapy.<BR/>3. Versus waiting list/no treatment/minimal treatment.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The main outcome was depressive symptom level, presented either as continuous (means and standard deviations) or dichotomous (significant versus not significant clinical improvement) measures, through use of self-rated questionnaires, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>), or clinician-rated scales, such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>). </P>
<P>We assumed that effectiveness assessment should be based on significant improvement of symptoms and wellbeing. Recovery from an episode of depression should represent the achievement of an asymptomatic status, rather than just having depressive symptoms fall below episode criteria. Operational criteria for definition of recovery and remission based on duration of significant reduction of symptoms have been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Frank-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 1991</LINK>) and recent surveys suggested for both BDI and HRSD cut-off points determined on normative samples which discriminate between mental health and psychopathology (<LINK REF="REF-Grundy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grundy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogles-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogles 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>Since we also aimed to assess the relationship between changes in depression levels and changes in marital distress (see point 4 in Objectives), we considered measures of such variables according to standard instruments, the most commonly used being the Dyadic Assessment Schedule (DAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Spanier-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spanier 1976</LINK>). </P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Electronic bibliographic databases<BR/>The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Register (CCDANCTR-Studies) was searched on the 5th September 2005 using the following strategy:<BR/>Diagnosis = (Depressi* or Dysthymi*)<BR/>and<BR/>Intervention = ("Marital Therapy" or Couples or Family)</P>
<P>Handsearching<BR/>Psychiatric and psychological journals identified as potentially including contributions relevant for this review were handsearched and then examined to assess effective relevance for the review. All issues of the following journals between 1986 and 2004 were checked : <I>Behavior Modification</I>, <I>Behavior Therapy</I>, <I>Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology</I>, <I>Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy</I>, <I>Family Process</I>, <I>Journal of Marital and Family Therapy</I>, <I>Clinical Psychology Review</I>, <I>American Journal of Family Therapy</I>, <I>Journal of Family Therapy</I>.</P>
<P>Other sources<BR/>References from the text of reports of relevant trials and reviews were examined for further trials not otherwise identified.<BR/>Relevant books and chapters identified through reviews, trial bibliographies and electronic databases were searched to identify trials published in books rather than journals.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Selection of trials</B>
<BR/>One reviewer (BD) screened the abstracts of all publications obtained by the search strategy, in order to identify the eligible studies. A first list of potentially eligible studies was drafted, and was cross-checked by a second reviewer (AB). By mutual consensus a final list of trials was decided. All papers were obtained and inspected to assess their relevance to this review. </P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Data were extracted using a standardised spreadsheet. Qualitative and quantitative data relating to the internal and external validity and study power were collected.</P>
<P>
<B>Unpublished data for included trials</B>
<BR/>Attempts were made to obtain data not included in some of the published papers. <BR/>The first author of the report was contacted with a standard letter explaining the purposes of the review and the reasons for requesting the additional data. In case of no answer in one month, an additional attempt was made. If no usable information was supplied, the study was excluded from the analysis related to the missing data.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of quality of trials</B>
<BR/>Various ways of incorporating the results of the quality assessment into the analyses of the reviews have been suggested. Several scales and checklists were used (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>). Other checklists of study characteristics have also been taken into account (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>). However, there was limited evidence of an association between quality scores and actual study outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>) and could be an important source of heterogeneity. Therefore, we decided to set a threshold for inclusion of studies, by considering only randomised and quasi-randomised clinical trials. We classified the studies according concealment of allocation adequacy, which had been considered as the most important aspect of study validity (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). Considerations on quality of studies are presented in the discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods of analysis</B>
<BR/>The data were synthetised using Review Manager software. </P>
<P>
<B>Methods for pooling data</B> <BR/>Dichotomous data were combined by calculating the relative risk (RR), with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous data were pooled by calculating the standardised mean difference (SMD), together with 95% CI. The SMD was used in order to combine different scales for measuring depressive symptoms or marital distress across studies. The random effects model was used to compute SMD and RR. The estimates produced through random effect models provide a conservative estimate of the average treatment effect, in contrast with fixed effect models, which provide the best estimate of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). As heterogeneity among studies was indicated, the random effects model was used. </P>
<P>
<B>Testing for heterogeneity</B>
<BR/>The formal test for heterogeneity, the natural approximate chi-squared test, was calculated.</P>
<P>At post-treatment, comparisons were conducted for marital therapy versus: <BR/>1. Individual psychotherapy. <BR/>2. Drug therapy. <BR/>3. No/minimal treatment, waiting list or placebo. <BR/>4. Individual therapy in distressed couples. <BR/>5. Individual therapy in studies showing improvement in marital distress. </P>
<P>At six month follow-up comparison was made versus individual treatment.</P>
<P>A post-hoc analysis was conducted on the two subgroups of studies on distressed couples and studies showing improvement in marital distress, to test whether a positive effect on marital distress was a mediator of positive effect on depressive symptoms.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>
<B>Included studies</B>
<BR/>In order to identify the studies to be included in the meta-analysis, the search strategy described in the protocol was applied. A total of eight studies were identified as evaluating the effect of marital therapy on depression using an experimental randomised and quasi-randomised design. The included studies were: <LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dessaulles-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dessaulles 2003</LINK>. They accounted for a total of 567 subjects.</P>
<P>
<B>Excluded studies</B>
<BR/>Six studies were excluded: one because depression was part of a wider problem related to the presence of a disruptive child (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000</LINK>); three, reported in two papers by the same author (<LINK REF="STD-Waring-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Waring 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waring-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Waring 1995</LINK>), because they did not give enough information to extract any data; a fifth study (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1993</LINK>) was excluded because it reported a follow up of the sub-sample of recovered patients already included in a previous clinical trial; a sixth study (<LINK REF="STD-Friedman-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 1975</LINK>) was excluded because primary diagnosis of depressive disorder was not settled according to an internationally validated diagnostic system. Moreover, it provided only poor description of the marital therapy offered. </P>
<P>
<B>Design</B>
<BR/>Seven of the included studies were randomised controlled trials with parallel groups. A closer inspection of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK> showed that it was a quasi-randomised trial, because cases were consecutively allocated according to the therapists' availability. Therefore the study was classified as C (inadequate method of randomisation). However, we decided to retain it for the analysis. </P>
<P>The duration of treatment ranged between 10 and 20 weeks and the follow up ranged between post-test and two years.</P>
<P>All studies were conducted in outpatient settings. One study was carried out in Israel (<LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK>), one in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>), two in The Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1997</LINK>), one in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Dessaulles-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dessaulles 2003</LINK>), and three in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although not all the papers described the treatment condition thoroughly, treatment models were defined as cognitive-behavioural (<LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK>); emotion focused based on integration of systemic and experiential approaches (<LINK REF="STD-Dessaulles-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dessaulles 2003</LINK>); interpersonal (<LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK>); systemic (<LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>). The systemic therapy in Leff's study was described according to a manual (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1999</LINK>). The control treatments were described as individual cognitive-behavioural therapy in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK>); interpersonal individual psychotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK>); drug therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Dessaulles-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dessaulles 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>). In both drug therapy group studies, desipramine or trimipramine (at adequate doses) were used as first line antidepressants, but patients were switched to other unspecified drugs if necessary. The study by Jacobson (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1991</LINK>) also included a group treated with a combination of individual and marital therapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>In five studies the population source was identified through a mix of newspaper advertisement and referral by general practitioners or mental health clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dessaulles-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dessaulles 2003</LINK>); two studies recruited the patients among those who sought treatment in outpatient psychiatric services (<LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK>), and Beach (<LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>) relied on newspaper advertisements only. </P>
<P>The original source population of 232 couples came into contact in the Beach study, of which 45 were then randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>). Leff (<LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>) reported the number of couples defined eligible (94) out of those who came in contact (290), but no other study gave information about that. Moreover, it was impossible to discriminate between the figures of those who came in contact with the recruitment centre and those who were defined eligible. </P>
<P>Some concerns arose, however, about selection bias with the study by Leff (<LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>), because of the large difference between the number of people who came into contact and the number of those randomised. This suggested the possible inclusion of patients seeking an alternative to drug treatment.</P>
<P>Three studies included couples with depressed wives (<LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dessaulles-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dessaulles 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1991</LINK>) and five (<LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>) included both husbands and wives with depression, although women were the majority of the identified cases. Whereas all studies included couples only if at least one spouse was depressed, five posed conditions about marital distress. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK>) the depressed spouse also had to show marital distress. In the Dessaulles study (<LINK REF="STD-Dessaulles-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dessaulles 2003</LINK>) couples were selected with the female partner depressed and she or the partner expressing marital distress. In the Beach study (<LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>) both the depressed wife and the partner had to report marital distress. In the Leff study (<LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>) the partner had to express at least two critical comments during the Camberwell Family Interview, an assessment tool used to identify families at high level of expressed emotion (<LINK REF="REF-Vaughn-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaughn 1976</LINK>). Only in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1997</LINK>) were patients selected as showing no marital distress.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria applied to subjects at risk of suicide; a spouse not willing to participate; a patient having psychotic symptoms or substance abuse; violence or abuse in the couple. No study gave numbers of patients excluded according to these criteria.</P>
<P>Antidepressants use in the experimental group were not allowed in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1991</LINK>), but were allowed in the Teichman study (<LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK>). This aspect was not clarified in the two studies that compared marital therapy to drug therapy.</P>
<P>The populations were relatively similar regarding sociodemographic characteristics. In the studies which had included couples where the male spouse was depressed, the percentages of females ranged, when given, between 53% and 79% with higher figures in the non-American studies. The mean ages of the patients were between 36 and 40, and in the study by Teichman it was 48 (<LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK>). Education level of the patients was 15 years in two studies, although one included only women (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1993</LINK>) and the other both sexes (<LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK>). Average length of marriage or relationship was given in five studies and ranged between 11 and 16.5 years. Social class was given in three studies: it was defined as average year income of US$37,700 in the study by Beach (<LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>); class III or IV for 72% of the subjects in the study by Foley (<LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK>); and the study population was defined as coming from a low and middle-low social class in that by Teichman (<LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome measures</B>
<BR/>All studies used self-rated questionnaires, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>), or clinician-rated scales, such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>). </P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="REF-Beach-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beach 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK>) used recovery as an outcome criterion, which set slightly different thresholds on BDI to define a patient as recovered.</P>
<P>The Dyadic Assessment Schedule (DAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Spanier-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spanier 1976</LINK>) was used in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK> used both the DAS and the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test (<LINK REF="REF-Locke-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locke 1976</LINK>), but did not present usable data on DAS global score. Therefore, data from the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment was used for this analysis. Emanuels-Zuurveen (<LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1996</LINK>) used the Maudsley Marital Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Arrindell-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrindell 1983</LINK>). Although values on marital distress were usually presented as continuous, <LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK> computed a threshold to identify the full resolution of marital distress, thus allowing analyses of dichotomous data.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>
<B>Randomisation</B> <BR/>With regard to allocation concealment (i.e., the method used to conceal the randomisation procedure, in order to prevent conscious or unconscious methods of avoiding randomisation of certain patients) one trial was classified as A (<LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>). Six studies were classified as B, since they stated that subjects were randomly assigned, but did not explain how, indicating unclear method of allocation concealement (Dessaulles 2003, Foley 1989, Jacobson 1991, Beach 1992, Emanuels 1996, Emanuels 1997). For the study by <LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK>, when giving us information about unpublished data, the author of this study specified that allocation was made according to therapist availability. Patients who were screened and received a diagnosis of depression were assigned to the first available therapist, and each therapist practiced only one type of treatment. The study was therefore classified as C.</P>
<P>
<B>Blind assessment</B>
<BR/>The Foley (<LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK>), Jacobson (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1991</LINK>) and Leff (<LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>) studies reported that assessment was conducted by an evaluator blind to the treatment condition of the subjects. This aspect was unclear in the other studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Duration of follow-up</B>
<BR/>In all studies assessment was done at the end of the treatment. In addition, a three and a six month follow-up was carried out in the Dessaulles study (<LINK REF="STD-Dessaulles-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dessaulles 2003</LINK>); a six month follow-up in the Teichman study (<LINK REF="STD-Teichman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Teichman 1995</LINK>); a one year follow-up in the Leff and Beach studies (<LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>); and a two year follow-up in the Leff study. However, follow-up data from the Leff and Dessaulles studies were not included in the meta-analysis, since no precise means and SD were given.</P>
<P>
<B>Intention-to-treat analysis</B>
<BR/>We assumed that an intention-to-treat analysis was performed when a) trial participants were analysed in the groups in which they were randomised, regardless of how long they were actually treated, and b) all participants were included regardless of whether their outcomes were actually collected. We considered that none of the studies conducted such an analysis, since all gave results based on treatment completers.</P>
<P>The Leff study used a likelihood approach in order to allow for drop-outs and to produce valid parameter estimates and standard errors, as long as the drop-outs were not informative. Moreover, in this same study the one-year follow-up comprised only of those who completed treatment, whereas in the two-year follow-up some patients who had dropped out of treatment were also evaluated and included in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Presentation of results</B>
<BR/>Standard deviations were given in all but three studies. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Foley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 1989</LINK> standard errors were given, but we could derive standard deviation values from standard errors and the number of subjects. The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Dessaulles-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dessaulles 2003</LINK> and by <LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK> gave no precise figures, but described the trend in graphs, and therefore they could not be included in the table of comparisons.</P>
<P>Information about unpublished or unclear data were sought from the following authors: Beach, Dessaulles, Emanuels-Zurveen, Jacobson, Leff and Teichman. Only Beach and Teichman gave the requested information. </P>

<P>
<B>Outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Marital therapy versus individual psychotherapy</B>
<BR/>For the marital therapy versus individual psychotherapy comparison, results for depressive symptoms were derived from six studies and indicated a very small non-significant difference between the two treatments: the SMD was -0.12 (95% CI -0.56 to 0.32), thus indicating that about 55% of controls scores in depressive symptoms were below the mean score of the experimental group. </P>
<P>Persistence of depression was not significantly less likely in the marital therapy group (based on three studies), with a RR of 0.84 (95% CI 0.32 to 2.22); the difference in drop-out rates was minimal (based on six studies), with a non-significant relative risk of being a drop-out of 1.16 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.01) in the marital therapy group.</P>
<P>
<B>Marital therapy versus drug therapy</B>
<BR/>In the comparison between marital and drug therapy only data on drop-outs, provided by two studies, were available. Drop-outs were less frequent in the marital therapy group, the RR being 0.31 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.61).</P>
<P>
<B>Marital therapy versus minimal/no treatment or placebo</B>
<BR/>In the comparison between marital therapy and minimal/no treatment or placebo, the SMD based on two studies was -1.28 (95% CI -1.85 to -0.72) for depressive symptoms, corresponding to the remarkable effect of marital therapy. Also persistence of depressive symptoms was significantly less frequent in the experimental group, with a RR of 0.50 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.81).</P>
<P>
<B>Marital distress</B>
<BR/>Marital distress was significantly lower, and persistence of marital distress less frequent, in the marital therapy group than in the individual treatment group: based on five studies, SMD for marital distress was -0.60 (95% CI -1.18 to -0.01), and RR of persistence of marital distress, based on two studies, was 0.71 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.98). </P>
<P>A subgroup analysis was conducted with the aim of exploring the relationship between improvement in marital distress and improvement in depressive symptoms in distressed couples only. Improvement in depressive symptoms was small and non-significant in the marital therapy group, the SMD from four studies was -0.20 (95% CI -0.62 to 0.21). <BR/>In distressed couples, drop-outs were not significantly more frequent in the individual therapy group. There was no difference in the probability of persistence of depression in the experimental and comparison group: RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.38 to 2.70).<BR/>Marital distress showed a highly significant improvement in the marital therapy group compared to individual therapy: SMD -0.94 (95% CI -1.38 to -0.50) corresponding to quite a large effect. The RR of persistence of marital distress was not significantly decreased in the marital therapy group: RR 0.44 (95% CI 0.11 to 1.71).</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis was conducted with the aim of exploring the relationship between improvement in marital distress and improvement in depressive symptoms on studies showing an improvement in marital distress. No effect on the depressive symptoms was found: SMD -0.23 (95% CI -0.69 to 0.22).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The main result of this meta-analysis is that there is no evidence to suggest that marital therapy is more or less effective than individual psychotherapy in the treatment of depression, either for continuous (depressive symptoms) or dichotomous (persistence of depression) outcome measures for depression.</P>
<P>Although the large effect favouring marital therapy versus no treatment may suggest that marital therapy could be included among psychological approaches considered effective in the treatment of depression, the finding is only based on two small studies. </P>
<P>The results of the comparison with drug therapy are greatly influenced by a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>), in which there is a strong suggestion of a selection bias, possibly leading to the inclusion of patients seeking an alternative to drug treatment. Moreover, only data on drop-outs were available for analysis. Such data show fewer drop-outs in the marital therapy group. </P>
<P>The above findings are somewhat weakened by many methodological problems affecting most studies, including the small number of cases available for analysis in almost all comparisons, and the considerable heterogeneity between studies, the only exception being the comparison between marital and individual therapy on continuous measures of depressive symptoms. Moreover, it is worth noting that heterogeneity is greatly reduced in the subgroup analysis of distressed couples only. </P>
<P>A closer examination of the methodological pitfalls show: <BR/>a) small numbers of randomised subjects compared to the eligible ones, and even smaller numbers compared to the source population (when indicated), thus raising concerns about the generalisability of the findings; <BR/>b) short follow-up periods: we could include only one study in the comparison of marital therapy versus individual psychotherapy at six months. The studies which compared marital therapy to drug therapy had longer follow-ups (six months in <LINK REF="STD-Dessaulles-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dessaulles 2003</LINK> and two years in <LINK REF="STD-Leff-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leff 2000</LINK>) but they did not provide precise figures to be included in the comparisons; <BR/>c) considerable number of drop-outs.</P>
<P>In this meta-analysis, we also addressed the effect of marital therapy on marital distress, to better understand the relationship between improvement in marital distress and improvement in depression, i.e., whether improvement in the marital relationship worked as a mediator in the improvement of depressive symptoms, as assumed by the main model of marital therapy for depression (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2003</LINK>). The evidence supporting the efficacy of marital therapy in reducing marital distress was quite strong. However, there was no indication of a relationship between improvement in depression and improvement in marital satisfaction. Even in the two studies by Emanuels (<LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Emanuels-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emanuels 1997</LINK>), where two different models of marital therapy were used with distressed and non-distressed couples, no difference was found in reduction of depressive symptoms, despite the obvious difference regarding the reduction of marital distress in distressed couples. Moreover, even in the studies showing a clear effect on marital distress, this was not coupled by a corresponding improvement in depression. It is worth noting that this hypothesis was not adequately tested. An attempt in this direction was made by Beach and O'Leary (<LINK REF="STD-Beach-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beach 1992</LINK>). They used multiple regression to show that change in marital satisfaction was a mediator of change in depression, because the coefficient for change in level of depression became non-significant when change in marital adjustment was added in the regression model. However, this positive result derived from a single study with a small sample of patients (13 in each group). </P>
<P>It was not possible to perform an analysis of mediators in this meta-analysis (e.g. using structural equation modelling techniques) in the absence of individual values for the variables of interest from each study (<LINK REF="REF-Kendall-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendall 2004</LINK>). Moreover, the hypothesis of the significant mediating role of improvement in marital adjustment is weakened by the lack of effect of marital therapy on depressive symptoms in studies showing an improvement in marital distress.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The available evidence suggests that there is no reason to consider marital therapy as more or less effective than individual therapy in the treatment of depression, even when associated with marital distress. However, an improvement in couples' relationship, at least in distressed couples, can be expected from marital therapy. <BR/>This finding may justify the choice of marital therapy when marital distress is a major problem or attention to the quality of marital relations is warranted.<BR/>No evidence is available about costs, which could be a disadvantage for marital therapy. Moreover, the available data cannot be applied to the elderly and to people with major depression, because the samples studied included only people with mild to moderate depression.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The pitfalls indicated above should be considered in order to produce better and more conclusive findings. In particular: a) clinical trials should have higher numbers of randomised subjects drawn from a clinically representative practice, thus improving generalisability of the findings; b) intention to treat analysis should be performed, at least for dichotomous outcomes; c) follow-up periods should be longer, at least one year; d) better strategies should be implemented to reduce the number of patients lost at follow up. <BR/>The role of change in marital discord as a mediating or moderating variable in treatment of depression is relevant to understand the specific action of marital therapy, and it needs to be better investigated through more adequate research designs and data analysis. To answer the question about superiority of marital therapy on individual therapy in distressed couples, the samples should be limited to couples with marital distress.<BR/>The efficacy of marital therapy in addition to drug therapy should also be investigated.</P>
