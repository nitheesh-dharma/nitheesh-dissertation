<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-21 15:26:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory disease, characterised by influenza-like (flu-like) symptoms, which first appeared in 2002. SARS is a rapidly progressive, acute, community-acquired respiratory illness, which spreads to all contacts. Integrated Chinese and Western medicines played an important role in the treatment of SARS and this review assessed the effectiveness and safety of this integrated treatment approach. Among 5327 confirmed cases, 3104 patients received traditional Chinese medicine. We explored the role of Chinese herbs in treating SARS to offer an effective method for SARS treatment.</P>
<P>We identified 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one quasi-RCT involving 640 SARS patients. Clinical evidence shows that integrated Western and Chinese medicine does not decrease the mortality rate. It is possible that different Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines may improve symptoms, quality of life and absorption of pulmonary infiltration, and decrease corticosteroid dosage. No severe adverse events were identified. The evidence is weak because of the poor quality of the included trials.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-13 06:57:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory disease, which first appeared in Foshan City, China on 22 December 2002. The primary clinical manifestations of SARS are characterised by influenza-like (flu-like) symptoms. In addition to fever, cough and breathing difficulties, SARS may be associated with other symptoms such as headache, muscular stiffness and pain, loss of appetite, malaise, chills, confusion, dizziness, rash, night sweats, nausea and diarrhoea. SARS is a rapidly progressive, acute, community-acquired respiratory illness, which spreads to all contacts.</P>
<P>By 24 June 2003, SARS had spread throughout China and 33 other countries and regions. The global death toll of SARS stood at 916 out of more than 8422 cases reported. Mortality was about 11%. There were a total of 1755 SARS cases reported in Hong Kong, China. On mainland China, 5327 cases of SARS, with 349 deaths were reported. The morbidity rate was about 7%. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region reported 300 deaths, with a mortality rate of about 17%. There were 655 SARS cases in Taiwan with 180 deaths. The mortality rate was 27% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). The case fatality ratio was estimated to be less than 1% in people aged 24 years or younger; 6% in people aged between 25 to 44 years; 15% in people aged between 45 to 64 years; and greater than 50% in people aged 65 years and older (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_05_07a/en/">http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_05_07a/en/</A>).</P>
<P>SARS is known to be caused by a new coronavirus, first identified by researchers in Hong Kong, the United States and Germany (<LINK REF="REF-Drosten-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drosten 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ksiazek-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ksiazek 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peiris-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peiris 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poutanen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poutanen 2003</LINK>). The virus was provisionally termed SARS-associated corona virus (SARS-CoV). Chinese clinicians diagnosed SARS by using the standard clinical diagnosis, issued by the Chinese Ministry of Health without the laboratory indexes (<LINK REF="REF-MoH-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">MoH 2003</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) diagnosed SARS patients using the standard clinical diagnosis, plus virus and antibody detection (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-05 00:05:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are many different Western treatment regimens with variations in dosage and duration of the same drug for the same stage of SARS. For example, the dose and duration of glucocorticoids for the same type and stage of SARS differed not only between hospitals in China, but also between countries. SARS patients received supportive therapy, such as maintaining oxygenation - intubation and ventilation as required. WHO recommended antibiotic therapy to cover common organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia (including atypical pneumonia). In severe cases, corticosteroids and ribavirin (an antiviral drug) were used. A systematic review of Western medicine for SARS showed that it was difficult to identify the benefit of Western medicine for SARS (<LINK REF="REF-Stockman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 2006</LINK>). In this review, Western medicines included antibiotics such as moxifloxacin and azithromycin; antiviral drugs such as ribavirin and an interferon; glucocorticosteroids or methylprednisolone; and thymosin or human immunoglobulin.</P>
<P>Chinese herbal therapies include single herbs, Chinese proprietary medicines and mixtures of different herbs. Any one of these three types can be combined with Western medicines. Chinese proprietary medicines are usually based on well-established and long-standing formulations, made into tablets or capsules for convenience and palatability. The mixture of herbs prescribed by Chinese herbalists depends upon the different symptoms according to Chinese diagnostic patterns (inspection, listening, smelling, inquiry and palpation) (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2003</LINK>). In this review, Chinese herbs are defined as either raw or refined products derived from plants or parts of plants (for example, leaves, stems, buds, flowers, roots or tubers) used for treating diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2002</LINK>). The synonyms of herbal medicines include herbal remedies, herbal medications, herbal products, herbal preparations, medicinal herbs and phytopharmaceuticals. The elements of Chinese herbs are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-05 00:06:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fever is the main symptom of SARS. During the early fever stage, Chinese herbs may reduce body temperature. Chinese herbs may also improve the immunity of SARS patients. In the early stage, Chinese herbal treatment could promote blood circulation and help reduce endotoxin absorption in the intestinal tract to protect the organs from damage by the SARS virus.</P>
<P>High doses of corticosteroids may induce serious disease (such as<B> </B>avascular necrosis of the femoral head) and cause complications such as secondary infections, secondary haemorrhage and adverse events. Use of Chinese herbs could result in a decreased need for corticosteroids which would reduce the potential complications and adverse events.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-02-18 14:18:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chinese herbs played an important role in the treatment of SARS. Among 5327 confirmed SARS patients, 3104 cases received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) including Chinese herbs (<LINK REF="REF-Yu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 2003</LINK>). This is the first systematic review to examine empirical evidence of the benefits and risks of TCM combined with Western medicines for treating SARS patients.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-03-21 15:25:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of single prescriptions for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. Different prescriptions of elements and dosages of each herb may result in different outcomes in SARS patients. Therefore, we did not pool all the data from the compound herbs. This may lead to a more valid result and more meaningful information for clinical practice. To help physicians understand the effectiveness of Chinese herbs for SARS, we describe the elements and dosages of all the prescriptions in this review in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>In this systematic review, three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bian-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bian 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004a</LINK>) only included SARS participants in the recovery stage. The results of the three trials suggest that Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines were more effective in improving the quality of life of SARS patients compared to Western medicines alone. It is possible that Chinese herbs play a more important role in the recovery stage of SARS participants. However, there is a need to conduct more high-quality trials to confirm this hypothesis.</P>
<P>The outcome measures of the included trials were complex. For symptom improvements, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2003</LINK>) reported symptom scores of SARS participants. However, the symptom score evaluation scales used in this trial were produced by the trial authors themselves, and were not an international or standard scale recognised in China. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004d" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004d</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2003</LINK>) reported symptom duration, not symptom scores. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004c" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004c" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004c</LINK>) reported days to loss of fever. Quality of life was reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bian-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bian 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004a</LINK>) using a scale produced by the trial authors and not using a standard international scale (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2001</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ren-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003a</LINK>) reported cases of absorption of pulmonary infiltration. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hou-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hou 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004c" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004c</LINK>) reported chest X-ray scores for absorption of pulmonary infiltration. The results of the five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hou-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hou 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ren-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004c" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004c</LINK>) showed that Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines were more effective in improving absorption of pulmonary infiltration than Western medicines alone. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004c" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2003</LINK>) reported duration of absorption of pulmonary infiltration in days. The results of the three trials showed no difference between Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines and Western medicines alone. However, we do not think that duration of absorption of pulmonary infiltration is a particularly meaningful outcome measure in clinical practice.</P>
<P>SARS was a new, virulent disease and its treatment protocols were complex. Western medicines for SARS patients included high doses of antibiotics and corticosteroids. Many Chinese physicians thought that Chinese herbs could lessen the severity of the adverse effects of Western medicines. Adverse effects were therefore very important outcome measures that needed to be reported. It was unfortunate that within the included studies, only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2004c" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ren-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2004</LINK>) reported adverse events at the end of 10 days of treatment. However, we appreciate that it was very difficult to perform clinical trials on SARS participants using traditional Chinese herbs; therefore we value the results obtained.</P>
<P>It is regrettable that the quality of the included trials is poor. We do not think that the evidence in this systematic review is strong enough to confirm some conclusions.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-21 15:25:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current evidence shows that Chinese herbs plus Western medicine have no benefit in terms of mortality, compared with Western medicine alone. However, significant benefits in improvement of symptoms, including decreasing body temperature, cough and breathing difficulties, decreasing dosages of corticosteroids, improving absorption of pulmonary infiltration and improving quality of life, were observed. Weak evidence suggests that Chinese herbs are beneficial in shortening the number of days spent in hospital. No adverse effects of Chinese herbs were observed.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-04 23:48:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The total of 640 Chinese SARS participants can be broken down to 167 normal SARS cases, 316 severe SARS cases, 91 SARS participants at recovery stage, 61 SARS participants with lung infiltrates and 55 SARS participants without disease type.<B> </B>The ages of the SARS patients ranged from 14 to 79 years old. Only six trials reported mortality. Three trials reported quality of life improvement. Two trials reported number of days spent in hospital. Six trials reported symptom improvement. Eight trials reported dosage of corticosteroid treatment. The reporting indexes of symptom improvement and corticosteroid usage varied, which reduced the completeness of our results.</P>

<P>A total of 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one quasi-RCT were identified. No trials pre-specified the sample size. The average size of the included trials was 46.15, ranging from 28 to 77. None of the trials described allocation concealment, reported the number and reasons for loss to follow-up or used blinding, and none used an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The longest duration of treatment for the participants was 21 days. No trials reported the long-term effectiveness of integrated Chinese and Western medicines for SARS patients. We therefore graded all the trials as at high risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias.</P>

<P>A systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2004</LINK>) has reported that integrated Chinese and Western medicines decrease mortality. These authors pooled data for different Chinese herbs. The basic principles of diagnosis and treatment in traditional Chinese medicine are based on syndrome differentiation. The traditional Chinese medicine doctor will prescribe different Chinese herbs depending on the syndrome, a syndrome being composed of various symptoms. Pooling the data from different Chinese herbs means pooling clinically heterogenous interventions. Therefore, the result of pooling different Chinese herbs in this systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2004</LINK>) is meaningless in clinical practice. Another review (<LINK REF="REF-Leung-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 2007</LINK>) showed that adjuvant herbal therapy improves symptoms such as fever, chest infection and leads to a decrease in steroid consumption.</P>

<P>We made some changes to the protocol.</P>
<P>We did not analyse mortality for different age groups because there were only one or two studies in each group.</P>
<P>We divided symptom improvement outcome measures into three categories: days to loss of fever, symptom scores and symptom duration, because no trial used international or domestic standard measures.</P>
<P>We divided absorption of pulmonary infiltration outcome measures into three categories: cases of absorption of pulmonary infiltration, duration in days of absorption of pulmonary infiltration and chest X-ray score for absorption of pulmonary infiltration, as no standard measures were used for reporting absorption of pulmonary infiltration.</P>
<P>We divided corticosteroid dosage outcome measures into the following three categories: average daily dose of corticosteroid, dosage of corticosteroid at the end of treatment and days of corticosteroid treatment, as no standard measures were used for reporting the dosage of corticosteroids.</P>
<P>We added number of days in hospital as an economic outcome measure. We did not conduct funnel plot and subgroup analysis because of the small number of included trials in each group. We also did not conduct a sensitivity analysis because the quality of the included trials was low.</P>
