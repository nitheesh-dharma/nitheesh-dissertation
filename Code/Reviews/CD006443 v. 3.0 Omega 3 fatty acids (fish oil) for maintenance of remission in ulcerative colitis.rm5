<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Omega 3 fatty acids for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Fish oil contains omega 3 fatty acids that may be beneficial in reducing inflammation, such as seen in the bowel of ulcerative colitis patients. Randomized placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the effect of daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids to maintain remission in ulcerative colitis were reviewed. Three studies were included of which none reported a reduction in the rate of disease relapse in comparison with placebo. When the studies were pooled for meta-analysis there was no benefit for omega 3 fatty acids. There were no serious side effects in any of the studies. None of the studies used enteric coated capsules which allow release of the fish oil in the small bowel. Non-enteric coated omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil) seem safe but ineffective for maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. Further studies of enteric coated capsules may be justified.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3, fish oil) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, n-3 therapy may be beneficial in chronic inflammatory disorders such as ulcerative colitis. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To systematically review the efficacy and safety of n-3 for maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis (UC).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The following databases were searched from their inception without language restriction: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Healthstar, PubMed, and ACP journal club. Experts were contacted for unpublished data. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of fish oil for maintenance of remission in UC were included. Studies must have enrolled patients (of any age group) who were in remission at the time of recruitment, and were followed for at least six months. The intervention must have been fish oil given in pre-defined dosage. Co-interventions were allowed only if they were balanced between the study groups. The primary outcome was relapse rate and the secondary outcome was frequency of adverse events. Other outcomes to assess efficacy were change in disease activity scores and time to first relapse. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality. Meta-analysis weighted by the Mantel-Haenszel method was performed using RevMan 4.2.8 software. Random or fixed effect models were used according to degree of heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity. A sensitivity analysis was performed excluding a study of questionable quality . </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The three studies that were included used different formulation and dosing of n-3 but none used enteric coated capsules. The pooled analysis showed a similar relapse rate in the n-3 treated patients and controls (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.51 to 2.03; P = 0.96). Combining the studies resulted in virtually no statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.93, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Various subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar results. However, the total number of patients enrolled in these studies was small (n = 138). No significant adverse events were recorded in any of the studies and not enough data were available to pool the other secondary outcomes for meta-analysis. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>No evidence was found that supports the use of omega 3 fatty acids for maintenance of remission in UC. Further studies using enteric coated capsules may be justified. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>
<B>Ulcerative colitis</B>
<BR/>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory disorder of the colon, characterized by periods of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. The traditional principles of management of UC are the induction and maintenance of remission. Prolonging symptom-free intervals while minimizing adverse reactions has been the aim of medical treatment. The various 5-aminosalicylic acid preparations meet these criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2006</LINK>), and are widely used. Azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Markowitz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowitz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hibi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Timmer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timmer 2007</LINK>) and recently infliximab (<LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 2005</LINK>) may be effective for maintenance of remission in moderate to severe UC, but the use of these agents is associated with more adverse events than 5-ASA. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (n-3)</B>
<BR/>Many randomized controlled trials have suggested a benefit of n-3 in various disease states, including cardiovascular, inflammatory, immunological, psychological, neurological and aging (<LINK REF="REF-Akabas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akabas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ergas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ergas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruxton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruxton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simopoulos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopoulos 2002</LINK>). The beneficial effect of n-3 in various diseases is thought to be a result of anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrythmic, hypolipidemic and vasodilatory properties. Omega 3 fatty acids are incorporated into the wall of inflammatory cells, thereby decreasing the concentration of arachidonic acid (C20:4, n-6). Arachidonic acid is, in turn, the substrate of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1991</LINK>). By reducing the amount of arachidonic acid available, n-3 reduces the production of leukotriene B4, thromboxane A2, prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor, and it has also been shown to scavenge free radicals (<LINK REF="REF-Simopoulos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopoulos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Endres-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endres 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1986</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although n-3 could be obtained from various vegetables, the major source of n-3 is fish oil. The marine sources of n-3 include eicosapentanoic acid (EPA or 20:5), docosahexanoic acid (DHA, 22:6) and docosapentanoic acid (DPA, 22:5), which are the longer chain n-3 and more effective clinically. Alpha linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3) is the shorter chain n-3 obtained from nuts and vegetable oils. Although an endogenous process exists whereby ALA can be partially converted to the longer chain n-3, there is some debate whether this conversion is effective (<LINK REF="REF-Ruxton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruxton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arterburn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arterburn 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>n-3 and UC</B>
<BR/>It has been proposed that a diet rich in fish oil, has historically protected the Japanese population from the higher incidences of IBD seen in Western countries. The increasing incidence of IBD observed in Japan correlates temporally with a dietary shift from n-3 to n-6 (<LINK REF="REF-Vilaseca-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilaseca 1990</LINK>). Studies in animal models and on tissues of IBD patients have demonstrated the strong anti-inflammatory properties of n-3 (<LINK REF="REF-Vilaseca-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilaseca 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakazawa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakazawa 2000</LINK>). Administration of fish oil, converts n-6 to n-3 in rectal mucosa (<LINK REF="STD-Lorenz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz 1989</LINK>), and reduces mucosal inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Belluzzi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belluzzi 1994</LINK>). Although n-3 have an excellent safety profile, raw fish oil has been shown to have troublesome adverse effects that reduce compliance including unpleasant taste, halitosis, heartburn, nausea and diarrhea (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Endres-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endres 1999</LINK>). Investigators have suggested the use of enteric coated capsules to improve compliance and absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Belluzzi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belluzzi 1994</LINK>). <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Importance of this review</B>
<BR/>Narrative reviews on the use of fish oil for IBD have reported conflicting conclusions, based on the same published studies (<LINK REF="REF-Nakazawa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakazawa 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Belluzzi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belluzzi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Endres-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endres 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simopoulos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simopoulos 2002</LINK>). A previous systematic review concluded that it is impossible to pool the studies on n-3 therapy in IBD into a meta-analysis, due to the different designs and endpoints (<LINK REF="REF-MacLean-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLean 2005</LINK>). However, the authors reviewed both CD and UC without clear differentiation between induction and maintenance of remission. More trials have now been published and, thus, a systematic review on the effectiveness of n-3 therapy for maintenance of remission in UC has been undertaken. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective was to systematically review the efficacy of fish oil for the maintenance of remission in UC. The secondary objective was to evaluate adverse events associated with fish oil.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomized placebo-controlled trials of n-3 maintenance therapy, administered for at least six months, and reporting at least one of the primary or secondary outcomes, published in any language, were included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Ulcerative colitis patients in remission at the time of recruitment were included without restriction of age. Clinical indices that were used to assess disease activity and remission, included: Truelove and Witts (<LINK REF="REF-Truelove-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truelove 1955</LINK>), Lichtiger (<LINK REF="REF-Lichtiger-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtiger 1990</LINK>), Powell-Tuck (St Marks) (<LINK REF="REF-Powell_x002d_Tuck-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell-Tuck 1978</LINK>), Mayo clinic (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 1987</LINK>), Rachmilewitz (<LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK>), Seo (<LINK REF="REF-Seo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seo 1992</LINK>), the simple colitis index (<LINK REF="REF-Walmsley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walmsley 1998</LINK>) and independent endoscopic assessment. Studies including chronic active patients together with quiescent patients were included if the analysis allowed the inclusion of the quiescent patients only.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Trials were included if the primary intervention was fish oil supplementation in any form (capsule, enteric coated or liquid) or dose, compared with placebo. Co-interventions were allowed only if they were balanced between the study groups, including but not restricted to, 5-ASA preparations, immunomodulators and chronic steroid use (i.e. therapy should be given to the same proportion of patients in both groups using similar average doses). </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>PRIMARY OUTCOME<BR/>The primary outcome was the relapse rate during the observation time. Definitions of relapse were allowed to be guided by the indices specified above. Other outcomes to assess relapse were recorded, if available: time to first relapse, hospital admission rate, steroid use, disease activity at the end of the follow-up period and quality of life. Studies reporting only a surrogate outcome (e.g. serum/tissue levels of cytokines or inflammatory markers) were excluded.</P>
<P>SECONDARY OUTCOMES<BR/>The secondary outcome was the rate of adverse events (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, halitosis, heartburn, alteration in LDL and glucose level, increase in bleeding time and abdominal pain). The withdrawal rates of participants among the intervention and control groups, were also recorded. </P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>
<B>Electronic databases</B>
<BR/>An on-line literature search was performed for human studies, without language restrictions, using the following databases: MEDLINE (NLM, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda; 1966-Jan 2007), EMBASE (Elsevier, NY; 1980-Jan 2007) and Healthstar (1966-Jan 2007) on OVID, as well as PubMed (NLM), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Collaboration, UK; 2007, issue 1) and ACP journal club. On-going trials were searched in the registry link: www.clinicaltrials.gov.</P>
<P>
<B>Search terms</B>
<BR/>The following keywords were used, including both text word [tw] and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms (using all subheadings) where appropriate and revised according to the database used (lines 1: ulcerative colitis, lines 2-6: n-3, line 7-9: combined):<BR/>1. ulcerative colitis [MeSH] OR ulcerative colitis [tw]<BR/>2. fish oil [Mesh] OR fish oil [tw]<BR/>3. fatty acids, omega-3 [Mesh] OR omega 3 [tw] OR omega-3 [tw] OR n-3 fatty acid* [tw] OR n3 fatty acid* OR purepa [tw] OR epanova [tw] OR maxepa [tw]<BR/>4. n-3 PUFA [tw] OR n3 PUFA [tw] OR n-3 polyunsaturated [tw] OR n3 polyunsaturated [tw] OR n-3 poly unsaturated [tw] OR n3 poly unsaturated<BR/>5. eicosapentaenoic acid [Mesh] OR docosahexaenoic acid [Mesh] OR eicosapentaenoic acid* [tw] OR docosahexaenoic acid* [tw] OR alpha-linolenic acid [Mesh], OR linolenic acid* [tw] OR EPA [tw] OR DHA [tw]<BR/>6. OR/2-5<BR/>7. 1 AND 6<BR/>8. Animal/ not human/ <BR/>9. 7 not 8</P>
<P>The search strategy was not restricted to study design, since the overall literature about UC and n-3 is limited. All abstracts underwent individual screening for eligibility.</P>
<P>
<B>Other sources</B>
<BR/>Additional citations were identified by manually searching the references of articles retrieved from the computerized databases and relevant review articles. Experts in the field were contacted for unpublished studies but none were identified. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>Abstracts of all articles meeting the above search strategy were screened for eligibility. Full text studies were retrieved if they were potentially eligible for inclusion or if they were relevant review articles, for manual reference search. The retrieved full text articles were then independently reviewed by DT and AMG for eligibility. Disagreements were solved by consensus with AHS.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction and management</B>
<BR/>Two investigators (DT, AMG) independently completed a data extraction form on all eligible studies. The following data were retrieved:</P>
<P>1. General information: title, journal, year, published/unpublished;<BR/>2. Study information: design (e.g. who was blinded), crossover or not, ways used to ensure adequacy of randomization, concealment of allocation and blinding, power calculation (a priori and post hoc);<BR/>3. Intervention: form and dose of n-3, type of comparison group, special diet used;<BR/>4. Eligibility: inclusion/exclusion criteria, total number screened and randomized; <BR/>5. Baseline characteristics (in each group): age, sex, race, disease severity (and how evaluated), concurrent medications used, length of period in remission prior to randomization.<BR/>6. Follow-up: length of follow-up, assessment of compliance, withdrawals and loss to follow-up.<BR/>7. Outcome: time to first relapse, disease activity at each evaluation time (and how was assessed) number of relapses during the follow-up period, adverse events, use of steroid, admissions and weight.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</B>
<BR/>A five point ordinal scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) was independently completed by DT and AMG for all eligible articles. Articles with poor quality (score of 0-2) were considered for exclusion. However, since the reliability of the Jadad score is not high (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>), the final score was used as a general guideline and decisions on eligibility were made by mutual agreement based on the adequacy of the randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of intervention and outcome, and completeness of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>). Studies were classified as "low risk of bias" (i.e. all above criteria met), "moderate risk of bias" (i.e. one or more criteria partly met") and "high risk of bias" (i.e. one or more criteria not met). The latter group were planned to be excluded and a sensitivity analysis taking quality into account was performed. Disagreements were solved by consensus with AHS.</P>
<P>
<B>Missing data</B>
<BR/>Authors were contacted for missing data, and sensitivity analysis was planned in case of non-response by the authors. </P>
<P>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</P>
<P>Categorical data (as relapsed or not during the follow-up period) for each study were transformed into 2X2 tables. <BR/> <BR/>
<B>Measures of treatment effect</B>
<BR/>The proportions of patients who relapsed, were calculated and reported as odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The number needed to treat (NNT) and absolute risk reduction (ARR), were calculated where appropriate. An analysis of time to relapse was planned using the log hazard ratio (HR) method or when not-available the estimation methodology described by <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. However, none of the studies reported sufficient data to utilize these methods.</P>
<P>
<B>Meta-analysis</B>
<BR/>Either random or fixed effects models were used to incorporate studies depending upon the degree of heterogeneity. Weighting of the studies was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Subgroup analysis and assessing for Heterogeneity</B>
<BR/>Studies were independently reviewed for clinical and methodological heterogeneity and possible reasons for heterogeneity were explored. The decision of whether to pool studies was aided by calculating the I<SUP>2 </SUP>measure, interpreted as 25% (low heterogeneity), 50% (moderate) and 75% (high) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The Cochran's Chi-Square test for homogeneity (Q test) was calculated and, since the test has low sensitivity to detect heterogeneity, P&lt;0.1 was considered statistically significant. A priori subgroup analyses were planned, governed by the number of identified studies: different dosing of EPA, &lt;1 year and &gt;1 year of follow-up, pediatric vs. adult studies, and different formulation of the fish oil (e.g. raw/encapsulated/enteric coated; triglyceride/ethyl esters/free fatty acids PUFA). In addition, subgroup analyses were planned for studies utilizing the same clinical index to assess disease activity, and for similar country of origin to account for possible confounding factors of regional dietary intake patterns.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis</B>
<BR/>To assess the robustness of the eligibility criteria, sensitivity analyses were planned a-priori after excluding poor quality studies, studies published in an abstract form, studies not reporting methods to assess compliance and small studies (&lt;50 patients). Sensitivity analyses were also performed on studies not reporting intention-to-treat analysis considering all drop-outs of the n-3 arms as failures and of the placebo arm as successes. Publication bias was to be assessed using a funnel plot. However, this was not possible due to the small number of eligible studies.</P>

<B>Results of the search</B>
<BR/>The initial search yielded 143 non-duplicated articles. Studies published in an abstract form only, were to be included if enough data was provided to assess outcome, but none were found. Studies in which the intervention group received diet enriched with fish products were to be excluded as the dose is not clear in these studies and other confounding variables could exist. However, no such studies were identified. </P>
<P>Two non-randomized controlled studies (<LINK REF="REF-McCall-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCall 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salomon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salomon 1990</LINK>) and 19 RCTs were retrieved, of which 11 enrolled only active patients (focusing on whether n-3 can induce remission (<LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aslan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aslan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barbosa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbosa 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bjorkkjaer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorkkjaer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dichi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dichi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stenson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stenson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seidner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seidner 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Socha-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Socha 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Almallah-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almallah 1998</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Tobin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 1990</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Varghese-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varghese 2000</LINK>) and two were duplicates of the excluded study by <LINK REF="REF-Almallah-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almallah 1998</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Almallah-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almallah 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Almallah-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almallah 2000b</LINK>). Of the six remaining eligible trials, three were excluded (table of excluded studies). The remaining three trials were of sufficient quality and included in this review (table of included studies). Nine of the 64 patients (14%) in <LINK REF="STD-Loeschke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Loeschke 1996</LINK> had active disease, but this study was not excluded since the vast majority of participants were in remission, the study was designed to assess prevention of relapse, the few active patients had only mild disease activity without the need for steroid therapy and they were balanced between the treatment arms. Nonetheless, a sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding this study from the analysis. </P>

<LI>
<B>Design</B>: A 1 year, double blind, placebo-controlled trial.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Sample size:</B> A total of 96 adults with UC (17 to 77 years of age, 55% male), 46 in the n-3 arm and 50 in the control arm. However, only 19 patients receiving fish oil and 15 receiving olive oil entered the study in remission and the results of only this subset of patients are included below.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Setting</B>: Two medical centers in the UK.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Participants</B>: Patients were enrolled either while in remission (no symptoms of active disease for at least one month prior to enrolment, and no corticosteroid therapy) or while recovering from relapse (active symptoms and/or inflammation on sigmoidoscopy, but clinical condition well enough to allow tapering of the steroid therapy to 20 mg/day). Patients were followed every two months until one year, and underwent sigmoidoscopy at baseline and two, six and 12 months.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Interventions</B>: Triglyceride concentrate of n-3 as 10 cc liquid form twice daily of HiEPA (5 g/day of EPA and 1.2 g/day of DHA) versus placebo of 10 cc twice daily of olive oil. Therapy with 5-ASA and corticosteroids (if the dose was less than 20 mg/day) was continued. No diet restrictions were applied.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Outcomes</B>: The main endpoint was the rate of relapse over one year of follow-up, as defined by the presence of active symptoms and/or inflamed rectal mucosa. Other endpoints included the time to relapse, total days spent in remission and the use of corticosteroids. Adverse events were also monitored (including bleeding time from the bowel mucosa biopsy site). </LI>

<B>Design</B>: A 2-year, double blind, placebo-controlled trial.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Sample size:</B> A total of 64 adults with UC (39 +/- 11 years of age for the 33 patients in the placebo group and 40 +/- 13 years for the 31 patients in the n-3 group, 52% male). </LI>
<LI>
<B>Setting</B>: Two medical centers in Germany.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Participants: </B>Patients were enrolled while in remission or had low disease activity as judged by a score below eight according to the criteria proposed by Gomez et al (<LINK REF="REF-Gomes-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomes 1986</LINK>), and at least one relapse during the past two years. Patients were excluded from the trial if they had been treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications within the last three months, suffered from any coincident disease, were or intended to become pregnant, or if their compliance was judged to be questionable by their physician. Twenty seven patients in each group (82% of the placebo and 87% of the n-3) were treated with 5-ASA preparations at randomization. Maximal colonic distribution of inflammation was similar between groups. Patients were followed every three months for two years, and underwent full colonoscopy at baseline and at 24 months.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Interventions: </B>Capsules containing 1 cc of 85% concentrated fish oil preparation of long-chain ethyl esters n-3 (six daily capsules equivalent to 5.1 g/day of total n-3; dosing of EPA and DHA were not reported) versus identical 1 cc placebo capsule of isocaloric maize oil. Both oils were enriched with 1 IU/ml tocopherol for antioxidative effect and stabilization of the oil. Therapy with 5-ASA was discontinued three months after randomization. No diet restrictions were applied.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Outcomes:</B> The primary outcomes were defined as: 1) relapse free survival; 2) mean clinical disease activity score calculated at each visit (every three months) until the study completion, or until earlier exit due to treatment failure (as defined by relapse, the need for steroid therapy or surgery, adverse events, and intercurrent illness); and 3) a change in histologic and macroscopic disease activity at repeated colonoscopy at exit. Relapse was defined by an increase in at least four points in the clinical index from baseline. A secondary outcome was change in laboratory markers of inflammation. At each visit, thromboxane metabolites and serum phosphocholine fatty acid composition were measured and patients were explicitly asked about adverse events.</LI>

<B>Design</B>: A 1-year, double blind, placebo-controlled trial.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Sample size</B>: A total of 50 adults with UC (17 to 65 years of age, 48% male), 27 in the n-3 arm and 23 in the control arm. However, shortly after randomization, five patients in each group did not comply with treatment and, therefore, were withdrawn from the study and not analyzed. The data presented here reflect the remaining 40 patients. A sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the five n-3 dropouts as treatment failures and the five placebo dropouts as successes. </LI>
<LI>
<B>Setting:</B> One medical center in Greece.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Participants</B>: Patients were enrolled while in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission as judged by the passage of normal stools without evidence of endoscopically active disease or acute inflammation on rectal histology. No exclusion criteria were specified. Maximal colonic distribution of inflammation, as other baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Patients were followed every three months for one year, and underwent rigid sigmoidoscopy with biopsies at baseline and 12 months.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Interventions:</B> n-3 as 10 cc liquid form twice daily of MaxEPA (3.2 gr/day of EPA and 2.1 gr/day of DHA as triacylglycerol) versus placebo of 10 cc twice daily olive oil. In addition, all patients received 3.6 gr/day of mesalazine, in three divided doses, throughout the study period. No diet restrictions applied.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Outcomes</B>: The primary outcome was the rate of relapse over the one year follow-up. Clinical symptoms criteria were used to define relapse: loose or watery stools with or without visible blood, in conjunction with endoscopic evidence of even mild signs of disease activity (i.e. loss of vascular pattern, erythema and/or friability). The secondary outcome was mean cumulative days in remission.</LI>

<BR/>The primary author was contacted and provided further details on the study's methodology. Randomization was carried out by the hospital pharmacy in blocks of four. This study was designed to be double blind, however, there was no way to disguise the taste of the oil, and so patients were aware of the treatment assignment. Patients were asked not to comment on the oil taste to the clinician and trial nurses. The randomization list was held in pharmacy and treatment allocation was revealed after the trial was completed. Compliance was confirmed by bottle count, treatment diary and measurement of EPA incorporation into RBC. Nine of 96 patients (6 of the 40 who were enrolled in remission: 5 from the placebo and 1 from the n-3 arm) withdrew consent during the first three months of treatment (4 for unpleasant taste, 1 for pruritis and 4 for domestic reasons). These patients were excluded from the primary analysis. However, a sensitivity analysis was performed in the original study regarding these patients as treatment failures. Very little fish oil was consumed in the control arm (0.3 g/day of EPA). Overall this study was judged to be at low risk for bias (Jadad score of 5).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Loeschke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Loeschke 1996</LINK>
<BR/>Randomization was carried out by serial numbers, stratified by disease activity score and by 5-ASA treatment. Concealment of allocation and blinding was ensured by coded, pre-packed, identical capsules of n-3 and placebo, and by adding orange flavour to achieve similar odor and taste. Compliance was confirmed by capsule count, questionnaire and measurement of EPA incorporation into plasma phosphocholines. Throughout the study period, a significant increase in EPA (six-fold) and DHA (two-fold) was measured in serum phosphocholines of the n-3 arm compared with placebo. A significant reduction in arachidonic acid was detected in the n-3 group compared to placebo. A high dropout rate was reported; 17/64 patients (27%) stopped therapy before reaching one of the study exit points (defined above): nine in the placebo arm (5 due to worsening of symptoms falling short of relapse definition, 1 underwent surgery, 1 pregnancy, and two for unrelated reasons), and 8 in the n-3 arm (2 due to worsening of symptoms falling short of relapse definition, 1 for psychiatric reasons, and 5 due to unrelated reasons). However, all dropout patients were followed until the completion of the study (including colonoscopy, clinical assessment and blood tests) and all data were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The overall quality judgment of this study was low risk for bias (Jadad score of 4).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 1996</LINK>
<BR/>No data were provided regarding the method of randomization, allocation concealment or double blinding. Since n-3 was administered as liquid, there was probably no way to disguise the taste of the oil, but no data were provided on techniques for blinding of the assessors. Dropouts were not analyzed but follow-up of the remaining participants was adequate. Compliance was assessed by a significant decrease in triglyceride and cholesterol levels before and after n-3 therapy, which is a surrogate measure of serum n-3 level. There are not enough data to assume good quality but, similarly, it cannot be assumed otherwise. Although this study was included in the review a sensitivity analysis was performed excluding this questionable study.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Relapse rate:</B> Only the subset of patients who entered the study in remission are included in this review. The relapse rate over a 1-year period was 42% in the n-3 arm (8/19) and 48% in the control arm (7/15, P = 0.54). Similarly, a sensitivity analysis of all 96 patients (considering the 9 dropouts as failures) did not show any benefit of fish oil therapy (numbers not presented). A sensitivity analysis of the subgroup which entered the study in remission, assuming all five dropouts in the placebo group as successes, and the one in the n-3 group as failure was performed. The relapse rate was similar in this sensitivity analysis: 9/20 in n-3 relapsed versus 7/20 in the placebo arm (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.75).</LI>
<LI>
<B>Time to relapse:</B> Patients treated with fish oil tended to spend more time in remission (median 365 days (IQR 265-365) compared to controls (349 days (IQR 240-365)), but this was not statistically significant (P value not stated). A Kaplan Meier curve was presented for the full cohort only and not for the subset of patients who were enrolled in remission.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Adverse events:</B> The only adverse event in the fish oil group requiring discontinuation of the drug was asthma worsening in one patient. Other adverse events were reported in the olive oil arm (pruritis and rash). Bleeding time of the rectal biopsy site was identical between the study arms.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Biological effect:</B> In the patients taking fish oil, EPA levels increased significantly in the rectal mucosa at all follow-up visits. Similarly, a significant increase of leukotrienes B<SUB>5</SUB> (LTB<SUB>5</SUB>) and decrease of LTB<SUB>4</SUB> in blood neutrophils was observed in the n-3 group versus the olive oil group.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Disease activity:</B> Not assessed.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Study's conclusion:</B> Fish oil has no benefit for maintenance of remission in UC.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Relapse rate:</B> Relapse rates over a 2-year period were similar between the two groups: 58% in the n-3 arm (18/31) and 55% in the control arm (18/33, P=0.81).</LI>
<LI>
<B>Time to relapse:</B> A Kaplan Meier curve calculated by the ITT principle, showed that the proportion of relapse free patients was significantly higher in the n-3 arm only during the second and the third months of treatment (clinical score of 2.2 in the n-3 arm compared to 4.4 in the placebo arm; P &lt; 0.05, exact value not stated). However, after this period of time, the relapse free curves were similar (log rank test, P&gt;0.05).</LI>
<LI>
<B>Adverse events:</B> No relevant adverse events were reported with the exception of fishy taste reported by three patients (two from the n-3 arm). This did not require cessation of therapy.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Biological effect:</B> In the patients taking fish oil, urine thromboxane metabolites as well as serum thromboxane were significantly lower than the placebo group, throughout the study period.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Disease activity:</B> Mean clinical disease activity scores were similar between the groups throughout the study with the exception of the 3-month visit, when the mean score was significantly lower in the intervention arm (P &lt; 0.05). However, this was not an ITT analysis as it included only patients still taking the study medication at the time of the visit. Colonoscopic assessment was available in 50/64 (78%) participants at the different exit points: in 26/32 suffering relapse, in 10/17 dropouts, and in 14/15 with complete remission during the study period. The changes in macroscopic and histologic scores were very similar between the groups, but numbers and statistical data are not presented.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Study's conclusion</B>: n-3 therapy seems mildly effective at start, but the benefit fades away within several months. The apparent early benefit could be secondary to synergistic effect with 5-ASA treatment that was stopped three months into the study.</LI>

<B>Relapse rate: </B>Relapse rates over the one year period were similar between the two groups: 27% in the n-3 arm (6/22) and 28% in the control arm (5/18, P=1.0). However, in a subgroup analysis of high risk patients for relapse (defined by &gt; 2 annual relapses per history) more patients in the placebo arm relapsed (5/7) compared with the n-3 (3/9). Although a P-value of 0.04 is reported for this subgroup comparison, our analysis showed a P-value of 0.32 (Fisher's exact test). Regardless of the statistical significance, this sample size is too small to draw any conclusions. As expected, a sensitivity analysis of the 10 dropout patients, considering the five n-3 patients as failures and the five placebo patients as successes did not change the overall results ((50% (11/22) relapse rate in the n-3 group versus 28% (5/18) in the placebo arm, P = 0.2)).</LI>
<LI>
<B>Time to relapse: </B>The mean cumulative days patients spend in remission was similar between the groups ((235 days (range 100 to 365) in the n-3 group versus 218 in controls (range 79 to 365), P &gt; 0.1)). In the subgroup analysis of the 16 high risk patients, the mean time that the nine n-3 patients spent in remission was significantly longer than the seven placebo patients ((240 days (range 200 to 250) versus 135 days (75 to 200), P &lt; 0.01)).</LI>

<B>Meta-analysis<BR/>
</B>Since all studies shared the primary outcome of relapse rate in quiescent UC patients, the data were pooled in a meta-analysis (See comparison 1, outcome 1.1). The pooled OR clearly indicates that n-3 was not effective in maintaining remission in these three studies of adult UC (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.51 to 2.03; P = 0.96). As expected, similar negative results were obtained in a sensitivity analysis of all three studies (See comparison 1, outcome 1.2), considering all n-3 dropouts as failures and all placebo dropouts as successes, for <LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 1996</LINK> (OR 1.54; 95% CI 0.79 to 3.0; P = 0.2). Combining the studies resulted in virtually no statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.93, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). A sensitivity analysis excluding <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 1996</LINK> was performed (See comparison 1, outcome 1.3), and the results remained statistically insignificant (OR 1.03 95% CI 0.46 to 2.29; P = 0.94). Subgroup analysis of the two studies that reported 1-year relapse rate (See comparison 1, outcome 1.4) was similarly negative (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.38; P = 0.83).</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Loeschke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Loeschke 1996</LINK>) presented a formal survival analysis. Cumulative days in remission was reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 1996</LINK>). It was impossible to combine these results since a reliable estimate of the effect size variance was not reported (one used range and the other IQR, which are not reliable for estimating standard deviation).</P>
<P>No significant adverse events were reported in any of the trials. One patient in the n-3 arm (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>) discontinued therapy due to asthma, but the association with n-3 is speculative. Two other participants taking n-3 capsules (<LINK REF="STD-Loeschke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Loeschke 1996</LINK>) complained of fishy taste.<BR/>
<BR/>Other planned outcomes (e.g. admission rate, steroid use, quality of life) were not reported in any of the trials.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Based on three small studies, this review suggests that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (fish oil) are not effective for maintenance of remission in UC. The pooled analysis demonstrated virtually no statistical heterogeneity. </P>
<P>5-ASA preparations are effective for the maintenance of remission in UC (<LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2006</LINK>), however, some patients are 5-ASA intolerant. This relates especially to sulphasalazine where up to 30% of patients may develop adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Nielsen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nielsen 1982</LINK>). Moreover, in a significant proportion of patients, 5-ASA fails to maintain adequate remission, and other medications are required (<LINK REF="REF-Travis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travis 2004</LINK>). Azathioprine has proven to be superior to 5-ASA for maintenance of remission in selected patients (<LINK REF="REF-Ardizzone-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ardizzone 2006</LINK>). However, there is still no evidence that combination therapy with azathioprine and 5-ASA is superior to azathioprine alone (<LINK REF="REF-Mantzaris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantzaris 2004</LINK>). Infliximab is also effective for maintenance of remission in UC (<LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 2005</LINK>), but azathioprine and infliximab, may cause serious adverse events. Besides serious short term adverse events (e.g. infections, infusion reactions, pancreatitis, hepatitis and severe cytopenia), it has been shown that 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Kandiel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandiel 2005</LINK>), and recently also infliximab (<LINK REF="REF-Rosh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosh 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thayu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thayu 2005</LINK>), may increase the risk of developing lymphoma. An effective low risk alternative for maintenance of remission in UC would, therefore, be welcome.</P>
<P>Various basic science studies provided the rationale for the use of n-3 in IBD. In UC, EPA incorporated into the colonic mucosa, thereby reducing arachidonic acid level and increasing LTB<SUB>5</SUB> (<LINK REF="REF-McCall-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCall 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1991</LINK>), which is a very weak inducer of inflammation. Similarly, n-3 reduced the production of other proinflammatory cytokines in the colons of IBD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Meister-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meister 2005</LINK>). Fish oil proved to be protective in animal models with experimental IBD (<LINK REF="REF-Vilaseca-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilaseca 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Nieto-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieto 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shoda-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoda 1995</LINK>). In a recent study, n-3 did not protect pigs from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced IBD, but accelerated clinical remission (<LINK REF="REF-BassaganyaRiera-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">BassaganyaRiera 2006</LINK>). Some reports indicated depleted serum n-3 in IBD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kuroki-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuroki 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siguel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siguel 1996</LINK>), but this was not replicated by others (<LINK REF="REF-Socha-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Socha 2005</LINK>). Finally, a greater reduction of inflammation (measured by IL-1ra/IL-1beta cytokine ratio) was observed in UC colon biopsies versus Crohn disease, following their emersion in fish oil enriched solution (<LINK REF="REF-Meister-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meister 2005</LINK>). In one included study (<LINK REF="STD-Loeschke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Loeschke 1996</LINK>), a mild benefit for n-3 was observed during the first 3 months of therapy. At this time, co-treatment with 5-ASA was permitted and the n-3 benefit may be explained by possible synergism with 5-ASA. However, the two other studies did not find a similar early effect, despite the use of 5-ASA, throughout the study period. </P>
<P>The discrepancy between the strong biological plausibility and the poor clinical results could be explained in several ways. First, it is possible that the studies did not use optimal n-3 formulations. It has been found that enteric coated n-3 fatty acids with 60 minutes timed release had the highest serum and RBC incorporation rate (<LINK REF="REF-Belluzzi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belluzzi 1994</LINK>). Interestingly, none of the studies in the current UC review used enteric coated formulation. This cannot be the sole explanation for the lack of efficacy in this review since two of the included UC studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loeschke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Loeschke 1996</LINK>) measured high incorporation of n-3 into cell membranes resulting in biological decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nonetheless, it is difficult to determine whether this reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines was sufficiently high to be translated into clinical benefit. </P>
<P>Three clinical trials showed a benefit of fish oil for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2007</LINK>). Different inflammatory pathways could account for the different response found in Crohn's disease and UC patients. The inflammation in UC is mediated through IL-13 pathway leading to a Th<SUB>2</SUB> response, in contrast to the IL-12, IL-23 and INF-&#947; related Th<SUB>1</SUB> response in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Monteleone-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monteleone 2006</LINK>). It had been shown that the intestinal absorption of n-3 is higher with free fatty acids (e.g. Epanova TM) compared with triacylglycerol (e.g. Max-EPA) or ester formulations (<LINK REF="REF-el-Boustani-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">el Boustani 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Belluzzi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belluzzi 1994</LINK>). The use of n-3 as triglyceride (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>), ethyl esters (<LINK REF="STD-Loeschke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Loeschke 1996</LINK>) and triacylglycerol (<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 1996</LINK>) in the included studies, could have further impacted the efficacy, despite some incorporation into red blood cells membrane. </P>
<P>Another explanation could be related to the fact that two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 1996</LINK>) used olive oil as the placebo, which may not be inert, leading to an erroneous result. It has been shown that oleic acid, the predominant fatty acid in olive oil, is also incorporated into colonic mucosa of IBD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1991</LINK>) and that it may possess an anti oxidative property (<LINK REF="REF-Marquez-Martin--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marquez Martin 2006</LINK>). Finally, it is important to note that the major limitation of the review is the small sample size of the combined cohorts and, thus, random variation cannot be ruled out.</P>
<P>Consistent with the fish oil literature in various disorders, no serious adverse reaction was observed in any of the included studies, and it can be concluded that n-3 is a remarkably safe treatment. The non-serious, but potentially bothersome, adverse events include unpleasant taste, halitosis, heartburn, nausea and diarrhea (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorenz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz 1989</LINK>). However, in the included studies, these events were not common, and did not require cessation of treatment in the majority of cases.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review demonstrates that omega 3 fatty acids are not effective for maintenance of remission in UC. The use of omega 3 fatty acids for maintenance of remission in UC cannot be recommended. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There seem to be little justification to perform further studies in UC using non-enteric n-3 formulation. Further large UC studies may be justified if enteric coated capsules preferably with free fatty acids, are used. Special care should be placed on selecting an inert placebo. </P>
