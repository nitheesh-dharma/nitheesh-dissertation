<P>A systematic overview of randomised trials does not provide sufficient evidence to determine whether thyroid hormone treatment of preterm infants with transiently low thyroid hormone levels results in changes in neonatal outcomes or reductions in developmental impairments. Extremely premature infants frequently have transiently low thyroid hormone levels in the first weeks after birth. These low thyroid hormone levels are associated with an increased incidence of complications and death in the newborn period and longer term developmental impairments. Thyroid hormone therapy might prevent these problems. One small trial comparing thyroid hormone treatment to no treatment of infants with transiently low thyroid hormone levels reported no benefit from treatment of these infants. However, this is insufficient evidence to determine if thyroid hormone treatment is effective. Further research is needed.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Extremely premature infants are at risk of transient hypothyroxinaemia in the first weeks after birth. These low thyroid hormone levels are associated with an increased incidence of neonatal morbidity, mortality and longer term developmental impairments. Thyroid hormone therapy might prevent these problems. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the evidence for thyroid hormone therapy in preterm infants with transient hypothyroxinaemia (low thyroid hormone level, normal TSH) for improvement of neonatal outcomes and neurodevelopment. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Searches were performed of The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 - March 2006), PREMEDLINE (March 2006), EMBASE (1980 - March 2006), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts and conference proceedings, supplemented by requests to expert informants. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Trials enrolling preterm infants with transient hypothyroxinaemia (low thyroid hormone level, normal TSH level) in the neonatal period, using random or quasi-random patient allocation to thyroid hormone therapy compared to control (placebo or no treatment). </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Independent assessment of trial quality and data extraction by each review author. Synthesis of data using relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) using standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only one study was eligible. Chowdhry (1984) enrolled 23 infants &lt; 1250 g and 25 - 28 weeks gestation with transient hypothyroxinaemia (serum total T4 &#8804; 4 &#956;g/dl and TSH &#8804; 20 IU/L). Infants were randomised to thyroxine 10 &#956;g/kg/day or placebo beginning on day 15 and continuing daily for seven weeks. Chowdhry (1984) reported no neonatal mortality and one infant death in each group prior to discharge. No significant difference was reported in CLD at 28 days or 36 weeks, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy or prematurity, weight gain, growth in head circumference or length. No significant difference was reported for mean T4 levels between thyroxine and placebo treated infants on day 21, 35, 49, 63 and 77 after birth. Free T4 was not measured. Neurodevelopmental follow up was inadequate to draw any conclusions from. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine whether use of thyroid hormones for treatment of preterm infants with transient hypothyroxinaemia results in changes in neonatal morbidity and mortality, or reductions in neurodevelopmental impairments. Further research is required. </P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>In preterm infants, values for serum T4 and free T4 (FT4) in the first days after birth vary directly with gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Rooman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>). However, unlike term infants, the concentrations of T4 and FT4 reach a nadir between day 10 and 14 after birth that is more severe at lower gestations and birth weights (<LINK REF="REF-Frank-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rooman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooman 1996</LINK>). Thyroid hormone levels then tend to return to normal levels after three weeks, but continue to increase up to six to eight weeks after birth (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK> found the incidence of infants with severely depressed T4 values (below 4 mg/dL) ranged from 40% at 23 weeks gestation to 10.2% at 28 weeks gestation. Furthermore, the levels of T4 and FT4 found in premature infants are lower than those seen in the normal fetus at similar gestational ages (<LINK REF="REF-Ballabio-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballabio 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorpe_x002d_Beeston-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorpe-Beeston 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radunovic-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radunovic 1991</LINK>). There is no consensus definition for levels of thyroid hormones consistent with 'transient hypothyroxinaemia' in preterm infants. </P>
<P>This period of low thyroid hormone levels in infants born prematurely has been termed "transient hypothyroxinaemia of prematurity". Suggestions as to the cause of these low thyroid hormone values include an immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in the extremely premature infant or a form of "nonthyroidal illness" (the "sick euthyroid syndrome") reflecting the infant's response to severe illness (monograph review by <LINK REF="REF-Paneth-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paneth 1998</LINK>). Risk factors for transient hypothyroxinaemia reported in observational studies have included lower gestational age (<LINK REF="REF-Franklin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rooman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kantor-Herring-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kantor Herring 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Filippi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filippi 2004</LINK>), maternal pre-eclampsia with placental insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Belet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belet 2003</LINK>), fetal growth restriction (<LINK REF="REF-Uhrmann-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uhrmann 1981</LINK>), perinatal asphyxia (<LINK REF="REF-Tahirovic-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tahirovic 1994</LINK>), respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Uhrmann-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uhrmann 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franklin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1986</LINK>), more severe respiratory disease (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>), mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kantor-Herring-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kantor Herring 2003</LINK>), low diastolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>) and dopamine infusions (<LINK REF="REF-Filippi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filippi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kantor-Herring-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kantor Herring 2003</LINK>). Adverse neonatal outcomes associated with transient hypothyroxinaemia have included intraventricular haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Paul-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2000</LINK>), chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>) and death (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hsu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Transient hypothyroidism (low T4, high thyrotropin concentration) also occurs in up to 5% of neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care (<LINK REF="REF-Rooman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooman 1996</LINK>), 0.4% of infants with birth weights &lt; 1500 g (<LINK REF="REF-Frank-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 1996</LINK>) and 1.8% of infants born &lt; 29 weeks gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1997</LINK>). There is evidence to suggest that this may be due to exposure to iodine-containing antiseptics used in neonatal care (<LINK REF="REF-Linder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linder 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thyroid hormones are necessary for the normal growth and maturation of the central nervous system (monograph reviews by <LINK REF="REF-Porterfield-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porterfield 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Beranl-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beranl 1995</LINK>). Congenital hypothyroidism is strongly associated with abnormal neurodevelopment. Neurological cretinism in its severest form is characterised by profound mental retardation, deaf mutism, spastic diplegia and squint (<LINK REF="REF-Porterfield-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porterfield 1993</LINK>). Even children who receive early thyroid hormone replacement therapy for congenital hypothyroidism have motor and cognitive deficits that persist to late childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Kooistra-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kooistra 1994</LINK>). Infants born prematurely also have a high incidence of motor and cognitive deficits that are worse at lower gestations (<LINK REF="REF-Lorenz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorenz 1998</LINK>). The question is whether the transient decrease in serum concentration of free T4 that occurs in some preterm infants during the first weeks after birth contributes to these neurodevelopmental problems. Three cohort studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Meijer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meijer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Den-Ouden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Den Ouden 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1996</LINK>) have documented an association between low thyroid hormone levels (T3 or T4) in the first weeks after birth and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome. All three cohorts documented a measure of abnormal mental development in children who had low neonatal thyroid hormone levels. One study (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1996</LINK>) found a 4.4 fold increase in risk of disabling cerebral palsy at two years. <LINK REF="REF-Den-Ouden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Den Ouden 1996</LINK> in the same cohort found children who had low neonatal T4 levels to have an increased risk of school failure at nine years. The associations in the cohorts persisted despite correction for potential confounders including gestation, measures of fetal growth (either birth weight or presence of growth restriction) and, in some studies, factors relating to severity of illness in preterm infants and independent risk factors for abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome.</P>
<P>Whether transient hypothyroxinaemia of prematurity is a causative factor for abnormal neurodevelopment is uncertain. Transient hypothyroxinaemia of prematurity is strongly correlated with low gestation and is more frequent in infants with respiratory distress syndrome and in ventilated infants. It may be that transient hypothyroxinaemia of prematurity is secondary to low gestation and/or illness severity in preterm infants. It is possible that other factors that are responsible for the abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants have not been taken into account adequately in the cohort studies.</P>
<P>This review examined the evidence from randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of thyroid hormone therapy in preterm infants with transient hypothyroxinaemia (low thyroid hormone level, normal TSH) for improvement of neonatal outcomes and neurodevelopment. Thyroid hormones have effects not only on neurological development, but also on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, and somatic growth. Therefore, studies that examined either neonatal morbidity, mortality and/or long term neurodevelopment were eligible for inclusion in this review. Separate reviews address the use of prophylactic postnatal thyroid hormones for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007a</LINK>), and postnatal thyroid hormones for treatment of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007b</LINK>). </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess whether thyroid hormone therapy in preterm infants with suspected hypothyroxinaemia (documented low thyroid hormone level, normal TSH) results in clinically important changes in neonatal and long term outcomes in terms of both benefits and harms. </P>
<P>Separate comparisons were planned to investigate the evidence for the use of different thyroid hormone preparations, doses and timing of treatment. Subgroup analysis were planned to investigate the evidence for a gestational age specific effect of treatment; and evidence for differences in effect according to study quality. </P>

<P>MEDLINE was searched using MeSH terms '(infant-newborn or infant-premature) and (thyroxine or triiodothyronine)' and text words using '(hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroxinaemia or thyroxine or triiodothyronine) and [MeSH terms] (infant-newborn or infant-premature)'. EMBASE and PREMEDLINE using terms '(hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroxinaemia or thyroxine or triiodothyronine) and newborn. The Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials was searched using the term 'thyroid disease', and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Register using 'thyroxine or triiodothyronine or hypothyroxinemia or hypothyroxinaemia'.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>One underpowered randomised trial reported no significant difference in mortality before discharge or any neonatal morbidity in infants with transient hypothyroxinaemia treated with thyroxine 10 &#956;g/kg/day beginning on day 15 and continuing for seven weeks. However, neurodevelopmental follow up was inadequate so that no conclusions can be made for long term effects. The mean gestation of enrolled infants was 26.3 weeks, so infants were of a gestation that researchers hypothesise may benefit from thyroid hormone supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-van-Wassenaer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Wassenaer 2004</LINK>). The dose of thyroxine 10 &#956;g/kg/day was higher than reported in a trial of prophylactic thyroxine treatment (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>). However, there was no measurable effect on total T4 levels. Free T4 and free T3 levels were not measured so effects on active thyroid hormone levels are unclear. In addition, treatment was started on day 15 and mean T4 levels only reached 5 &#956;g/dl on day 35, suggesting that infants were still exposed to a prolonged period of hypothyroxinaemia. Given the lack of clinical effect, the small size of the study, and that free T4 and free T3 levels were not measured, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of thyroid hormone treatment for transient hypothyroxinaemia, or any conclusions regarding timing and dose for future trials. </P>
<P>A separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007a</LINK>) found no significant effect of prophylactic postnatal thyroid hormone treatment in preterm infants on neonatal morbidity, mortality or neurodevelopmental outcome. Additionally, no significant effect was found from the use of thyroid hormones in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome, although neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported by the two included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007b</LINK>). Taken together, these reviews find no evidence of benefit from the use of postnatal thyroid hormones for the prevention (prophylactic use) or treatment of transient hypothyroxinaemia in preterm infants. In contrast, treatment of congenital hypothyroidism is essential to prevent subsequent neurodevelopmental impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Beranl-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beranl 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kooistra-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kooistra 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porterfield-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porterfield 1993</LINK>). However, this review found insufficient data to determine whether there is an effect on neurodevelopment from thyroid hormone treatment of preterm infants with transient hypothyroxinaemia. Further research is needed. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence from controlled clinical trials to determine whether the use of thyroid hormones for the treatment of preterm infants with transient hypothyroxinaemia results in changes in neonatal morbidity and mortality, or reductions in neurodevelopmental impairments. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research is required to determine what type of thyroid hormone preparation, timing and duration of treatment is required to return active thyroid hormone levels to the 'normal range', and to determine whether the use of thyroid hormones in preterm infants with transient hypothyroxinaemia results in reductions in neonatal morbidity, mortality and neurodevelopmental impairments. </P>
