<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Use of a tourniquet during surgery for varicose veins</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Varicose veins are obvious, dilated veins just under the skin. In normal veins the valves make sure blood only moves in one direction. The valves in varicose veins are faulty, allowing blood to pool and the veins to enlarge. This can cause aching legs, itching and poor cosmetic appearance. People with varicose veins may wear compression stockings, have an injection of irritant substance to close the veins under the skin (sclerotherapy), or have the veins removed surgically. There is a potential for large blood loss during surgery, especially if both legs are operated on at the same time. Tourniquets on the upper leg during surgery may be useful to minimise blood loss.</P>
<P>This review found that the amount of blood loss was clearly reduced when a tourniquet was used during surgery for varicose veins, with no overall increase in operative time, reported adverse events or change in patient reported pain and activity after surgery. Three trials were included in the review, in which a total of 176 men and women (211 legs) were randomised to either use or non-use of a tourniquet. All trials took place in the UK between 1989 and 2000. Those patients who did not have a tourniquet had a wider range of total blood loss and patients in the upper limits lost a significant amount of blood. A reduction in blood loss may also result in a reduction in post-operative bruising but only one of the trials (50 patients) looked at this. It found a clear reduction in the area of bruising with the use of a tourniquet. The trials did not have a large enough number of participants to determine any rarer complications of surgery with the use of a tourniquet such as nerve damage or arterial injury, especially in older patients.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Varicose vein surgery is a common surgical procedure but there is no consensus regarding the best surgical technique. The use of tourniquets during varicose vein surgery has been advocated as a means of reducing the potential for blood loss during the operation.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To identify whether the use of a tourniquet should be recommended when undertaking surgery for the management of primary varicose veins.</P>

<P>For this update<I> </I>the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched April 2013) and the CENTRAL (2013, Issue 3).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All studies described as randomised controlled trials that examined the use of tourniquets during surgery for patients with primary varicose veins were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-22 13:39:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from eligible studies were extracted and summarised independently by two authors. All studies were cross-checked independently by the authors.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-04-09 09:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<P>No additional studies were included or excluded in the updated review. Twenty papers detailing 18 trials were considered. Only three trials were randomised controlled trials and were included in the review. The remaining fifteen studies were excluded for various reasons. All three included trials had a small sample size and reported the trial design, outcome measures and analysis poorly. There were also variations in the outcome measures used between the trials. In addition, there was no consistency on the reporting of mean and medians for blood loss during the operation. It was therefore not possible to pool the data to perform meta-analysis. However, the reported blood loss when using a tourniquet was between 0 and 16 ml compared to between 107 to 133 ml when not using a tourniquet (P &lt; 0.01).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although there were significant quality issues with the available evidence, the use of a tourniquet would appear to reduce blood loss during surgery. There were no reported differences between the use or non-use of a tourniquet in terms of complications and morbidity. However, the available trials were not of sufficient size to detect rarer complications such as nerve damage.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-22 13:11:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the adult population, the age-adjusted prevalence of trunk varices (varicose veins of the deep veins of the legs) has been estimated as 40% in men and 32% in women (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1999</LINK>). Varicose veins account for 50,000 in-patient hospital episodes per year in England alone (<LINK REF="REF-London-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">London 2000</LINK>). Primary varicose veins are due to valvular failure. Treatment for primary varicose veins is considered appropriate if the veins are symptomatic (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2001</LINK>)<B>.</B> Common symptoms attributable to varicose veins include aching, itching and poor cosmesis (cosmetic appearance). Less common, but more serious, symptoms include haemorrhage and thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein with accompanying formation of a blood clot). </P>
<P>There are a variety of treatments available for varicose veins including compression stockings, injection sclerotherapy (injection of an irritant substance), as well as surgical methods of treatment. Many surgical treatments are practiced. These may involve ligation (tying) of the affected vein (long or short saphenous veins), stripping of the affected trunk veins and avulsions (removal) of the varicosities (dilated segments). Some surgeons use a combination of surgery and injection sclerotherapy. Newer surgical treatments include subfascial ligation and pin stripping. Subfascial ligation is a procedure that involves cutting through the skin and deep fascia (a sheet of connective tissue) and tying off the incompetent perforating veins that link the veins in the skin to the deep veins in the muscle. PIN-stripping (Perforate INvaginate stripping) is a technique that involves stripping the vein into itself in a manner similar to turning a stocking inside out. This results in a smaller exit wound. However, there is no consensus as to which is the best surgical technique to treat varicose veins.</P>
<P>The most common surgical operation is ligation of the sapheno-femoral vein, stripping of the long saphenous vein (LSV) and avulsions. The operation can be associated with significant blood loss, especially if it is a bilateral procedure. Tourniquets have been used as a means to exsanguinate (remove all blood from) limbs where there can be a risk of significant blood loss such as in orthopaedic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Wakankar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakankar 1999</LINK>), and arterial bypass surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Eyers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eyers 2000</LINK>). There are potential problems with the use of tourniquets on lower limbs including thrombosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 1998</LINK>), and nerve damage (<LINK REF="REF-On-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">On 2000</LINK>). The nature of varicose vein surgery is such that the potential for blood loss could be significant and this has led to some authors advocating the use of tourniquets (<LINK REF="STD-Farrands-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Farrands 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are a number of potential tourniquets in widespread use; these include the Rhys-Davies Cuff and Lofquist cuff. The Rhys-Davies cuff was developed as a means for exsanguination of limbs during orthopaedic operations (<LINK REF="REF-Rhys_x002d_Davies-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rhys-Davies 1985</LINK>). The Lofquist cuff, also known by its manufacturers name the Boazal cuff, is a pneumatic tourniquet originally invented by Dr. Johan Löfqvist. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 1989</LINK> was a trial undertaken in a district general hospital in the UK. The study involved 26 participants and, using the toss of a coin, randomised 40 limbs between use or non-use of a tourniquet. In bilateral cases the coin was spun twice, once to decide the surgeon (consultant or registrar), and once to decide to which leg the tourniquet would be applied. Both groups were similar at baseline. The severity of varicose veins was assessed on a subjective basis as either mild, moderate or severe.</P>
<P>Varicose vein surgery was performed using a sapheno-femoral flush ligation, stripping of the long saphenous vein (LSV) to below the knee and avulsions of varices through multiple stab incisions.</P>
<P>The type of tourniquet used was an Esmarch bandage which was applied in the sterile field in a circular motion (centripetal) to exsanguinate the limb, and secured at mid-thigh. Post-operatively the limb was bandaged up to the tourniquet before it was removed. Groin wounds were closed using an absorbable suture (PDS, Ethilon) and the stab incisions were closed with Micropore tape (See <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2000</LINK> was a trial undertaken in a district general hospital in the UK. The trial randomised 50 participants between use or non-use of a tourniquet. The two groups were comparable at baseline. Treatment groups were allocated randomly using sealed envelopes on the day of the operation. The severity of varicose veins was assessed using a 1 to 5 scale based on symptoms:</P>
<P>1 = no symptoms<BR/>2 = symptoms<BR/>3 = skin changes<BR/>4 = healed ulcer<BR/>5 = active ulcer</P>
<P>People with varicose veins were recruited from the waiting list and assessed using a hand held Doppler. People with deep venous insufficiency, extensive anterior thigh veins, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or sapheno-popliteal reflux were excluded.</P>
<P>The type of tourniquet used was a sterile Lofquist Cuff (Boazal, Sweden). This was inflated to 120 mmHg and secured to the upper thigh. All participants had a Trendelenberg 30° tilt, synchronous groin dissection and phlebectomies by a consultant and registrar, LSV stripping using a disposable Vasistrip (Astra), and phlebectomy using a stab incision and Oesch hooks. All legs had thrombo-embolic deterrent (TED) stockings, cotton wool and bandages applied post-operatively. The bandages were removed 48 hours post-operatively by the district nurse and the TED stockings were worn for two weeks. (See <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1990</LINK> was a trial conducted at a district general hospital in the UK. The trial randomised 100 consecutive participants to use or non-use of a tourniquet during varicose vein surgery. Twenty-one participants had bilateral (both legs) varicose veins and therefore a total of 121 limbs were included into the study. However, at the three month follow-up there were only 101 limbs available for analysis. No details were provided on the number of participants this equated to, or the reasons for withdrawals or losses to follow-up. No details were given regarding the method of randomisation or whether the unit of randomisation was the participant or the limb. Those with bilateral varicose veins had the tourniquet applied to the right leg only; the left leg acted as the non-tourniquet limb. Participants with vascular insufficiency, cardiovascular disease or previous DVT were excluded.</P>
<P>The type of tourniquet used was a Rhys-Davies cuff. This was applied to the leg and inflated to 500 mmHg. The non-tourniquet group was operated at a 30° Trendelenberg tilt. All participants in both groups had ligation of the sapheno-femoral junction flush with the femoral vein. Incisions were made using a number 11 scalpel blade and avulsions using Dunhill or mosquito forceps. Groin wounds were closed using either nylon or PDS (Ethicon) and stab wounds closed using steristrips. Legs were dressed with gauze, crepe and tubigrip. Participants were kept in overnight and the dressings were removed after three weeks (See <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was relatively poor. All three studies had a small sample size and there were no a priori sample size calculations performed by any of the studies. The methods of randomisation were also poorly reported and the blinding to allocation was unclear. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 1989</LINK>), reported that randomisation was on the basis of toss of a coin by the anaesthetist. Another reported that sealed envelopes were used (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2000</LINK>). However, there were details missing on how the randomisation sequence was generated and whether the envelopes were opaque. The final trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1990</LINK>), merely reported that it was a randomised study in the abstract and provided no other details. There were also concerns that in bilateral operations treatment allocation was not random, for example, the right leg having the tourniquet applied and the left having no tourniquet.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-09-19 13:40:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The extensive search strategy found a total of three trials that were included in the review. These trials randomised 176 participants and 211 limbs to either use or non-use of a tourniquet during varicose vein surgery. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 1989</LINK>
<BR/>The main outcome measures were intra-operative blood loss, operative time and weight of varices. The mean blood loss was estimated by weighing swabs but the authors state that blood loss onto drapes or surgeons' gowns was not taken into account. In addition, the measured blood loss was restricted to that lost during avulsing and did not include losses during groin dissection or stripping. The mean blood loss was 16 ml (range 0 to 136 ml) in the tourniquet group and 107 ml (range 16 to 581 ml) in the non-tourniquet group (P &lt; 0.001 using Wilcoxon's rank sum test). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of mean operating time or weight of varices. No details were provided regarding the blinding of outcome assessment. There were no reports of complications from use of the tourniquet.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2000</LINK>
<BR/>The main outcome measures were median peri-operative blood loss, operative time, bruising, patient pain and activity, and cosmesis. The median blood loss in the tourniquet group was 0 ml (range 0 to 20 ml) compared to 125 ml (range 20 to 300 ml) in the non-tourniquet group (P &lt; 0.01). No details were provided on how blood loss was estimated. The mean operative time was shorter when the tourniquet was used (30 min, range 11 to 47 min), compared to not using the tourniquet (37 min, range 18 to 50 min; P &lt; 0.01). Median bruising area of the thigh was reduced in the tourniquet group (72 cm², range 30 to 429 cm²) compared to the non-tourniquet group (179 cm², range 24 to 669 cm²; P &lt; 0.01). There were no significant differences in terms of patient pain, activity and cosmesis, as assessed using a zero to seven visual analogue score (VAS). No details were given on blinding of outcome assessment. Three patients had temporary saphenous neuralgia (two in the non-tourniquet group), and two patients had wound complications post-operatively (both in the non-tourniquet group).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1990</LINK> <BR/>The main outcome measures were mean blood loss, bruising, length of operation and cosmetic result. Results were reported on 101 legs (47 in the tourniquet group and 54 in the non-tourniquet group). No details of the reasons for losses to follow-up were provided. The mean blood loss was less in the tourniquet group (13.5 ml, range 1 to 56 ml) compared to the non-tourniquet group (133 ml, range 5 to 430 ml; P &lt; 0.01). No details were provided on how the blood loss was estimated. The cosmetic results at six weeks, as assessed by a blinded observer using a linear analogue score, were better in the tourniquet group (P &lt; 0.01). The mean score for cosmesis as assessed by the participant was also better in the tourniquet group (P &lt; 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences found in terms of length of the operation and bruising at three weeks.</P>
<P>All of the trials examined the effect of using a tourniquet in terms of total blood loss. However, there were variations in defining total blood loss and how it was measured, with only Corbett (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 1989</LINK>), reporting how blood loss was estimated. This lack of detail in the other two trials could mean that there were significant variations in how total blood loss was estimated. Furthermore, Corbett (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 1989</LINK>), and Thompson (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1990</LINK>), reported mean blood loss whereas Sykes (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2000</LINK>), reported median blood loss. A summary of the findings on blood loss is presented in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>All of the trials included operative time as an outcome measure but there were variations in how this was measured. Corbett (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 1989</LINK>), defined the operative time from the start of avulsing to dressing the wounds. However, Thompson (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1990</LINK>), defined it as the time from entering theatre to completion of the dressings. No details were provided in the third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the trials determined the relative cost-effectiveness of the use of a tourniquet. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The available evidence on the evaluation of the use of tourniquets in varicose vein operations is limited to three randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1990</LINK>). These trials were all of poor quality and had deficiencies in trial design, sample size and measurement of outcomes. None of the trials had sufficient power and sample size to determine the differences between use or non-use of a tourniquet during varicose vein surgery. There were also variations in how outcomes were measured, with two trials reporting means (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1990</LINK>), and the third reporting medians (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2000</LINK>). The small sample size also meant that there were insufficient numbers included to detect any rare potential complications from the use of tourniquet.</P>
<P>However, despite these limitations, all three trials agreed that the amount of blood loss can be significantly reduced when a tourniquet is used with no increase in operative time, reported adverse events or subjective outcome. The mean and median blood loss in the comparisons were relatively small and not necessarily clinically significant. However, those patients who did not have a tourniquet had a wider range of total blood loss, and those in the upper limits certainly lost a significant amount of blood. A further consideration is that any potential for reduction of exposure to blood for health care staff should be considered in light of the possibilities of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.</P>
<P>A reduction in blood loss could result in a reduction of post-operative bruising, but only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2000</LINK>), included this as an outcome measure. Although it did find a significant reduction in bruising area with the use of a tourniquet, the trial had a relatively small sample size of 25 patients in each group.</P>
<P>The trials were also not of sufficient size to determine the incidence of potential relatively rare complications such as nerve damage or arterial injury (especially in older patients). This is a consideration when recommending the use of tourniquets as large numbers of varicose vein operations are undertaken, and so there could be the potential for significant number of additional complications caused by using a tourniquet.</P>
<P>None of the trials explored the cost-effectiveness of the use or non-use of a tourniquet. The trials did not find any increase in the length of operation, which has a significant impact in terms of overall costs. However, there was no discussion of the costs of the tourniquets, other equipment or any additional potential costs such as staffing or training. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The limited evidence would seem to suggest that the use of a tourniquet in routine varicose vein surgery may reduce the blood loss during the operation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for a large randomised controlled trial, which includes an economic evaluation using a bottom up approach to costings, to determine whether the limited evidence for the use of tourniquets can be validated.</P>
