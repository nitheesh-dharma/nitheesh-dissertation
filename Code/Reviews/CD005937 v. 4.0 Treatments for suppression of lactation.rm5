<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-05 13:29:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women cannot always breastfeed after birth. Reasons may be because the infant dies or is adopted, or the mother is too ill, or for the well being of the mother or infant. HIV-positive mothers, particularly those not on antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy, avoid breastfeeding to reduce the risk of passing on the virus to their infants. Some mothers do not breastfeed on personal or social grounds. Without an infant suckling, milk production (lactation) eventually stops of its own accord. In the meantime, women can experience breast engorgement, leakage of milk, discomfort and pain. Clinicians may provide treatment to suppress lactation and reduce these symptoms. Binding the breasts or wearing a tight brassiere, applying an infra-red lamp, fluid and diet restrictions, external application of jasmine flower and ice packs are tried non-drug approaches. Drug treatments include oestrogens and bromocriptine which lowers prolactin levels. However, increased risks of thromboembolism, cerebral accident and myocardial infarction have been reported with their use.</P>
<P>The evidence to support treatments for preventing lactation is limited. The review authors identified 62 controlled trials that randomised a total of 6428 mothers to receive the treatment under investigation, no treatment or another treatment. Twenty-two trials did not contribute data to the meta-analyses. The trials were generally of limited quality and most were conducted among healthy women who chose not to breastfeed for personal reasons at hospitals in industrialised countries before 1980. Half of the trials involved bromocriptine. Two trials (107 women) reported that taking bromocriptine was better than no treatment in suppressing lactation in the first week after giving birth. The 11 trials using oestrogen preparations (diethylstilbestrol, quinestrol, chlorotrianisene, hexestrol) also showed suppression of lactation. A combination of testosterone and oestrogen preparations was of some benefit in reducing symptoms in three trials (436 women). Other pharmacologic agents (clomiphene, tamoxifen, prostaglandins, pyridoxine, oxytocin, L-dopa and homeopathic preparation) were tested in single small trials. Generally, side effects were poorly reported and no case of thromboembolism was recorded among trials that included it as an adverse treatment outcome. Most of the drugs tested are currently not available or registered for suppressing lactation. No trials compared non-drug approaches with no treatment and none of the included trials provided reliable data on women&#8217;s satisfaction with the treatment.</P>

<P>We included 62 trials (6428 women). Twenty-two trials did not contribute data to the meta-analyses. The trials were generally small and of limited quality. Three trials (107 women) indicated that bromocriptine significantly reduced the proportion of women lactating compared with no treatment at or within seven days postpartum (three trials, 107 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.54). Seven trials involving oestrogen preparations (diethylstilbestrol, quinestrol, chlorotrianisene, hexestrol) suggested that they significantly reduced the proportion of lactating women compared with no treatment at or within seven days postpartum (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.56). We found no trials comparing non-pharmacologic methods with no treatment. Trials comparing bromocriptine with other pharmacologic agents such as methergoline, prostaglandins, pyridoxine, carbegoline, diethylstilbestrol and cyclofenil suggested similarity in their effectiveness. Side effects were poorly reported in the trials and no case of thromboembolism was recorded in the four trials that reported it as an outcome.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-05 13:28:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>There is weak evidence that some pharmacologic treatments (most of which are currently unavailable to the public) are better than no treatment for suppressing lactation symptoms in the first postpartum week. No evidence currently exists to indicate whether non-pharmacologic approaches are more effective than no treatment. Presently, there is insufficient evidence to address the side effects of methods employed for suppressing lactation. When women desire treatment, bromocriptine may be considered where it is registered for lactation suppression in those without predisposition to its major side effects of public concerns. Many trials did not contribute data that could be included in analyses. Large randomised trials are needed to compare the effectiveness of pharmacologic (especially bromocriptine) and non-pharmacologic methods with no treatment. Such trials should consider the acceptability of the intervention and lactation symptoms of concern to women and be large enough to detect clinically important differences in major side effects between comparison groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Indications for lactation suppression</HEADING>
<P>For many years, the importance of breastfeeding to both infants and mothers has been emphasised by healthcare providers and various strategies have been employed to promote it globally. In spite of the well-known advantages of breastfeeding (for example, infant protection against diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality), there are instances when the well being of the mother or infant requires suppression of lactation. Suppression of lactation becomes essential when breastfeeding is no longer required (as in the events of perinatal death and infant adoption) or when the mother is too ill to breastfeed (as in cases of severe obstetric morbidity). Besides medical indications, some mothers in circumstances where alternatives to breastfeeding exist may seek lactation suppression on personal or social grounds. It is estimated that over 30% of women in the United States and United Kingdom do not breastfeed their infants, while a larger proportion discontinue breastfeeding within two weeks of childbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Hamlyn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamlyn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2002</LINK>). Although physiologic cessation of lactation eventually occurs in the absence of physical stimulus such as infant suckling, a variable proportion of women experience moderate to severe milk leakage and discomfort, before lactation ceases. Up to two-thirds of non-breastfeeding women experience moderate to severe engorgement and breast pain when no treatment is applied (<LINK REF="REF-Spitz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitz 1998</LINK>). Almeida and Kitay (<LINK REF="STD-Almeida-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida 1986</LINK>) showed that breast engorgement was responsible for puerperal fever in 13.3% of 75 non-breastfeeding mothers. However, the prevalence, characteristics and health implications of these symptoms have not been well described in the literature.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Lactation suppression and prevention of vertical transmission of HIV</HEADING>
<P>Unlike in the 1970s, when a social reason was the most common indication for lactation suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Eastham-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eastham 1976</LINK>), the need for complete avoidance of breastfeeding by HIV-positive mothers to reduce the risk of vertical transmission of HIV has offered a more compelling reason in the last decade. Postnatal transmission through breastfeeding accounts for one-third to one-half of all cases of vertical HIV transmission worldwide, with an estimated 16.2% rate of transmission for infants of women untreated with antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Nduati-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nduati 2000</LINK>). Although breastfed infants of HIV-positive mothers who receive antiretroviral treatment during pregnancy are less likely to be infected with HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Wiktor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiktor 1999</LINK>), the risk is further reduced when such infants are fed with substitutes of breastmilk (<LINK REF="REF-Shaffer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffer 1999</LINK>). Therefore, as the global prevalence of HIV continues to rise, the need for supervised inhibition of lactation may likely become increasingly relevant, especially in developed countries where safe alternatives of infant feeding are available. The symptoms associated with physiologic cessation of lactation may further compromise the physical and emotional status of the HIV-positive mothers and an effective method of suppressing lactation is desirable to avoid additional morbidity.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Non-pharmacologic methods of lactation suppression</HEADING>
<P>Interventions to suppress lactation in non-breastfeeding women have evolved for centuries. Healthcare providers have used different non-pharmacologic approaches to suppress lactation and relieve the associated symptoms. Before the 20th century, these approaches included breast binding or strapping, emptying of the breast by massage, fluid and diet restrictions and application of external products such as belladonna ointment to the breast and nipples. Later, the avoidance of tactile breast stimulation and application of external agents such as cabbage leaves, jasmine flower and ice packs were included. Although many of these methods are still in use today, data on their efficacy are few and inconclusive. A review by Spitz et al (<LINK REF="REF-Spitz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitz 1998</LINK>) showed that up to one-third of women may experience severe breast pain for most of the first postpartum week when these methods of lactation suppression are employed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pharmacologic methods of lactation suppression</HEADING>
<P>In the 1960s, oestrogen preparations given alone or in combination with androgens were demonstrated to be effective in 40% to 100% of women (<LINK REF="REF-Llewellyn_x002d_Jones-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llewellyn-Jones 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Senior-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Senior 1969</LINK>) but their reported association with a high rate of rebound lactation (resurgence of lactation following cessation of treatment) and increased risk of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism discouraged their use (<LINK REF="REF-Jeffcoate-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeffcoate 1968</LINK>). After it was demonstrated that postpartum lactation depends primarily on pituitary prolactin secretion, the synthetic dopamine agonist and strong prolactin inhibitor bromocriptine was introduced in 1972. Its efficacy in the suppression of postpartum lactation is well documented (<LINK REF="STD-Bhardwaj-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bhardwaj 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dewhurst-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Dewhurst 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duchesne-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duchesne 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Heijden-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Heijden 1991</LINK>). It is, however, associated with some unpleasant side effects and requires administration for about 10 to 14 days to prevent rebound lactation. It has also been implicated in serious puerperal complications such as cerebral accident and myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Iffy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iffy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruch-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruch 1989</LINK>). In 1989, the United States Food and Drug Administration recommended against the routine use of bromocriptine for suppression of postpartum lactation, noting that while there was no clear proof of adverse effects, there were also no proven health benefits (<LINK REF="REF-US-FDA-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">US FDA 1989</LINK>). In spite of this development, bromocriptine is still being used in many countries. Since then, many other drugs have been used for suppression of lactation, including those with recognised prolactin-lowering activity and those with uncertain mechanism of action. These include different preparations of oestrogens, oestrogens in combination with androgens or progestogens, or both, clomiphene, pyridoxine, prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB>, other dopamine agonists (cabergoline and lisuride) and serotonin antagonists (cyproheptadine, methysergide and methergoline). All these drugs have demonstrated variable effectiveness in the inhibition of postpartum lactation.</P>
<P>The search for another ergot derivative with clinical efficacy similar to bromocriptine but with better compliance and tolerability profile led to the trials on cabergoline. Various randomised studies in the late 1980s described similar effectiveness and a better side-effect profile of cabergoline, administered as a single dose compared with the conventional bromocriptine dose in the prevention of postpartum lactation (<LINK REF="STD-European-1991" TYPE="STUDY">European 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giorda-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Giorda 1991</LINK>). Recent reports suggest that a new drug, which belongs to the sulfhydryl compound, is also an effective inhibitor of lactation and breast engorgement (<LINK REF="REF-Akrivis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akrivis 2000</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-07-20 10:59:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>It is clear from this background that the evolution of lactation suppressants is not over. Thus, while the need for specific medical prevention of lactation in non-nursing mothers is being questioned from time to time, many clinicians still apply some kind of treatment. Besides, clinicians appear unclear about the most appropriate method for suppressing lactation when an intervention is indicated. In view of the numerous approaches of lactation inhibition and the continuous search for new drugs, it becomes necessary to synthesise previous research findings to determine the most effective intervention to suppress lactation in non-breastfeeding mothers. An ideal method would be one that has close to 100% efficacy, with minimal or no side effects and good acceptability profile. A systematic review of the previous studies was therefore conducted to understand whether further trials on new approaches or drugs, or both, are justified.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Most of the trials included healthy postpartum women who elected not to breastfeed for personal reasons and a few recruited women who could not breastfeed as a result of stillbirth or child adoption. Participants were women who delivered vaginally at term in most cases. <LINK REF="STD-Giorda-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Giorda 1991</LINK> randomised only women who were delivered by caesarean section while <LINK REF="STD-Piya_x002d_Anant-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Piya-Anant 2004</LINK> randomised healthy HIV-positive puerperal women. Exclusion criteria were not specified in many of the trials. In the few trials that specified exclusion criteria, these include abnormal findings that are relevant to prolactin secretion, liver disorders, agalactia (inability to lactate), previous breast surgery, tumour of the pituitary gland, use of drugs that might interfere with prolactin secretion and unwillingness to participate in the study. Recruitment of women was not limited to any parity group in any of the trials and parity ranged between one and eight in studies where it was reported.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Pharmacologic treatments were compared with placebo in 29 trials and another pharmacologic treatment in 30 trials. No trial was included for the comparison of non-pharmacologic treatments with placebo. Three trials compared non-pharmacologic approaches [Jasmine flower (<LINK REF="STD-Shrivastav-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Shrivastav 1988</LINK>), tight brassiere with intermittent infrared application (<LINK REF="STD-De-Gezelle-1979" TYPE="STUDY">De Gezelle 1979</LINK>), breast binding (<LINK REF="STD-Bhardwaj-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bhardwaj 1979</LINK>)] with pharmacologic treatments. Only one trial compared two non-pharmacologic treatments (breast binding versus wearing of support bra) (<LINK REF="STD-Swift-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Swift 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The classes of pharmacologic agents evaluated in these trials include ergot derivatives (bromocriptine, lisuride, methergoline, cabergoline and terguride); synthetic oestrogen preparations (quinestrol, diethylstilbestrol, ethinyl estradiol, chlorotrianisene and hexestrol); antioestrogenic preparations (tamoxifen, clomiphene and cyclofenil); oxytocics (intranasal oxytocin); androgen preparations (testosterone propionate); combined oestrogen and androgen preparations (testosterone and estradiol esters); combined oestrogen, progestogen and androgen preparations; dopamine agonists/precursors; prostaglandins and pyridoxine.

<P>Most of the pharmacologic agents were given orally and a few were given by intramuscular injections. No agent was given intravenously. Dosage varied widely between trials in both amount and duration of treatment. Except in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-England-1988" TYPE="STUDY">England 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giorda-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Giorda 1991</LINK>), treatments were commenced shortly after delivery (less than 12 to 24 hours). Of the drugs tested, only seven are currently included in the World Health Organization model list of essential medicines. These are ethinyl estradiol, clomiphene, tamoxifen, pyridoxine, oxytocin, testosterone and L-dopa. None of these drugs was listed for lactation suppression.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The definition of lactation suppression was not consistent among the trials. The primary outcome measures and the descriptions used in most of the trials were suppression of milk secretion or leakage, breast engorgement and/or breast pain. Some trials did not describe what was meant by suppression of lactation and only referred to it as such. For most of the trials, failure to achieve suppression of between one and three breast symptoms or signs (milk secretion or leakage, breast pain, breast engorgement) was presented as a measure of treatment failure. Other outcome measures prespecified for the review such as major and minor side effects, rebound lactation, use of analgesics and need for secondary treatment to achieve suppression were poorly reported in many of the trials. The method of outcome assessments varied widely across studies. In 15 trials, breast symptoms or signs were rated on a visual analogue scale or an ordinal scale of zero to between three and six to describe increasing severity of symptoms or signs (e.g., none, mild, moderate and severe). Most trials used dichotomous variables, or ones that could be dichotomised, to describe clinical efficacy of treatments while 10 trials described outcome measures in terms of means of the breast symptom 'scores', mean number of days or mean change in the degree of breast symptoms. There was no evidence that any of these scoring systems were previously validated. Assessments of clinical efficacy were based on physical examination of the breast by the clinicians or women in the trials, or both, while in the hospital and subsequently by the women at home after hospital discharge. Women were asked to document breast symptoms on a questionnaire or data card that was collected at a specified follow-up period. The duration and the frequency of outcome assessment also varied widely between studies. Follow-up varied from 72 hours to eight months postpartum although most assessments were conducted during the first one or two weeks.</P>
<P>As a result of the diversity of the interventions and the method, duration and frequency of outcome assessments, few trials could be included in meta-analyses for each comparison. It was not possible to conduct sensitivity analyses based on trial quality as most trials were generally at high risk of bias (e.g., allocation concealment was considered adequate in 8.1% of the included trials, all of which evaluated different interventions).</P>

<P>The use of second line drug or methods to achieve suppression was poorly reported in the trials. In the comparison of bromocriptine with any other pharmacologic treatment, there was no statistically significant difference between the risks of using a second line drug or method to achieve lactation suppression when bromocriptine was compared with oestrogen preparations (<LINK REF="STD-Utian-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Utian 1975</LINK>, 31 women, RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.15, <LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>.1) and other ergot derivatives (<LINK REF="STD-Scapin-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Scapin 1982</LINK>, 40 women, RR 2.67, 95% CI 0.82 to 8.62, <LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>.2). <LINK REF="STD-Boes-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Boes 1980</LINK> (97 women) suggested that bromocriptine was associated with reduced proportion of women in need of second line methods to suppress lactation compared to pyridoxine (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.51; <LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>.3). <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1975</LINK> (196 women) suggested that women who received chlorotrianisene were less likely to use supplemental or concurrent therapy (breast binders, ice bags or analgesics, or both) compared with women who had placebo at or within four days after admission (not in data and analysis table).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-08-06 11:49:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In spite of the questions on the need to apply treatment for suppressing lactation, a lot of research has gone into finding the most effective treatment. This review indicates that the emphasis for this search has been on pharmacologic treatments (compared with either no treatment or each other). The review included comparisons of orally and intramuscularly administered pharmacologic agents with placebo, other pharmacologic agents and non-pharmacologic methods. In terms of outcome, we used the persistence of one of the three common clinical symptoms or signs of postpartum lactation (i.e., milk secretion, breast engorgement and breast pain) as evidence of failure of lactation suppression. We also explored the consistency of results obtained from this definition with those obtained from separate consideration of each lactation symptom or sign as an indicator of treatment failure. In an attempt to reduce clinical heterogeneity, we extracted results on efficacy of treatment effects within a specified postpartum period.</P>
<P>This review shows that the search for the most effective lactation suppressant has relied on small trials, most of which have low methodological quality. The lack of recent randomised controlled trials on this subject may imply a supposed exhaustiveness and conclusion on this research topic. It may also be attributed to the lack of motivation of potential researchers because of the increasing number of questions on the need for treatments to suppress lactation. The gross variation in the dosage, interventions, duration of treatments and outcome assessments suggests a general lack of a clear understanding of the physiology of lactation and mechanisms of action of the treatments tested among researchers.</P>
<P>This is the first systematic review assessing the effectiveness of all forms of treatments for lactation suppression. Assessment of methodological quality of studies was based on stringent criteria, as evident by the number of relevant trials excluded from the review. In spite of this measure, however, the robustness of the results is diminished by the fact that the majority of included studies are of uncertain methodological quality, as evident in the proportion of trials with adequate allocation concealment (8.1%) and those that blinded their outcome assessments. Blinding of outcome assessment is particularly important for this topic, considering the subjective nature of main outcome measures (secretion, congestion and pain). The extent to which outcome measures are blinded in double-blinded trials where the women served the dual role of participant and outcome assessor is uncertain. Combining data on outcomes assessed by different observers (clinicians and women) is likely to contribute to ascertainment bias in included studies that employed such method. In addition, the validity of the results interpreted by the trialists could not be examined in included trials that reported data that were unsuitable for inclusion in the analyses table. Another major limitation of this review is the fact that a significant proportion of drugs tested in the included trials are currently no longer registered for use in most countries, either as lactation suppressants or otherwise. This may significantly limit the applicability of the findings of the review.</P>
<P>About half of the trials included compared drugs with placebo. In spite of its popularity, only five trials involving 206 women comparing bromocriptine with placebo met the inclusion criteria. All these trials used uncertain methods of generating allocation sequence and allocation concealment, none had outcome assessment blinded and all were conducted over two decades ago. It can thus be concluded that there is weak evidence that bromocriptine is better than nothing for suppressing the symptoms of lactation during the first seven days postpartum. Contrary to a number of case reports, there is insufficient evidence from this review to indicate whether or not bromocriptine is associated with an increased risk of major side effects (notably thromboembolism, myocardial infarction and maternal death) in the first postpartum week.</P>
<P>Although there is small evidence that oestrogen preparations may be better than nothing in the first postpartum week, none of the tested agents is presently available in the market. In addition, available data on their risks of major side effects are insufficient to make a reliable conclusion on their safety when used for lactation suppression. Of all the pharmacological agents compared with placebo, only bromocriptine is still registered for use in most countries although not necessarily for lactation suppression. It needs to be stated that bromocriptine appeared to be the gold standard in the 1970s and 1980s as shown by the number of trials where it was tested. The possibility of publication bias therefore exists in the face of seemingly 'overwhelming' evidence. This review did not show sufficient evidence to indicate if other pharmacologic agents (clomiphene, tamoxifen, prostaglandins, pyridoxine, oxytocin, L-dopa and homeopathic preparation) are useful in suppressing the symptoms of lactation postpartum, as they are all based on individual small trials. However, the combination of testosterone and oestrogen preparations appear to be somewhat effective in suppressing the symptoms of lactation.</P>
<P>Evidence on the comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic agents and non-pharmacologic methods is based on three trials, each testing different non-pharmacologic methods (<LINK REF="STD-Bhardwaj-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bhardwaj 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Gezelle-1979" TYPE="STUDY">De Gezelle 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shrivastav-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Shrivastav 1988</LINK>). It can be concluded from their results that there is not enough evidence to indicate which of the approaches is better than the other. The comparative effectiveness of jasmine flower with that of bromocriptine can only be useful once there is strong evidence that bromocriptine is better than placebo. There is currently no evidence on whether non-pharmacologic methods are better than placebo in lactation suppression.</P>
<P>There are mixed views on the subject of lactation suppression in most current obstetric textbooks, although the need for applying some kind of treatment is seldom disputed. Most authors refer to research findings indicating the effectiveness of previously tried approaches, many of which were excluded from this review as a result of low methodological quality and high potential for bias (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Generally, non-pharmacologic approaches such as use of a well-supporting brassiere and avoidance of nipple stimulation, are often recommended based on the presumed safety and effectiveness of these methods. This policy, however, is not supported by the findings of this review. While the methodological limitations of conducting high-quality trials involving non-pharmacologic methods are understandable, they should not compromise the need to provide evidence-based guidelines on their application.</P>
<P>It is unlikely that the findings from this review would inform any change in the recommendations of the United States' Food and Drug Administration on the routine use of bromocriptine for suppression of postpartum lactation, as the evidence indicating its effectiveness is weak even though the review also did not show any clear evidence of adverse effects.</P>
<P>Three issues related to the data and studies included in this review need to be discussed for a better understanding of the implications for practice and research regarding lactation suppression. The review addresses treatments for lactation suppression in postpartum women who do not desire to breastfeed their infant right from birth. Therefore, the findings are not directly applicable to women who had initiated breastfeeding but later wish to discontinue, or to women who lactate due to other pathology (e.g., hyperprolactinaemia). It is possible that the effectiveness as well as the side-effect profile of tested agents remote from delivery may be different from that in the immediate postpartum period. Secondly, participants in the included trials were healthy postpartum women (including healthy HIV-positive mothers) and it is uncertain if similar results, especially regarding side effects, would be found in postpartum women with a higher baseline risk of morbidity, e.g., those who are ill, or taking medications, or both, including antiretroviral drugs. It is important to note that this category of mothers for whom suppression of lactation may have particular health benefits, is likely to have increased risk of side effects, including drug interactions, which were not explored in the studies included in this review. Lastly, a fundamental question that is yet to be answered is whether postpartum women desire treatment for lactation suppression and, if so, which of the symptoms women are most concerned about. This would definitely go a long way in better interpretation of the effectiveness of the tested approaches. It is clear from this review that women's views about the treatment received was not a priority, as only four trials with unreliable data explored the acceptability profile of the tested approach.</P>
<P>With respect to side effects, there is insufficient evidence to show that pharmacologic agents are more associated with a higher risk of major adverse effects (notably thromboembolism) compared with no treatment or each other. Several case reports have been published on thromboembolism, myocardial infarction and cerebral angiopathy following the use of bromocriptine, although a causal relationship has not been established. It is interesting to note that, in spite of these concerns, emphasis was not laid on reporting these side effects in trials conducted subsequently. However, these findings should be interpreted against the background of our review of only published data as exploration of unpublished data, especially adverse outcome data from drug company trials, may provide a clearer picture.  </P>

<P>There is weak evidence that some pharmacologic treatments (most of which are currently unavailable to the public) are better than no treatment for suppressing the symptoms of lactation in the first week postpartum. There is currently no evidence to show that non-pharmacologic approaches are more effective than no treatment. Presently, there is insufficient evidence to address the issue of side effects of the pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic methods that are employed for suppressing lactation. When women desire treatment for suppressing lactation, consideration may be given to bromocriptine where it is still registered for such use in healthy mothers with no predisposition to major side effects of public concern. In spite of its importance, there is inadequate evidence to comment on the acceptability of approaches for suppressing postpartum lactation to women.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-06 11:47:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>For settings in which application of some forms of treatment for suppressing lactation is the norm, there is a need for well conducted and large randomised controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment, notably, bromocriptine to no treatment. Future research should also focus on comparison of non-pharmacologic approaches with no treatment since they presently do not appear to have any safety concerns for the public. The most important symptoms that concern women who desire not to breastfeed should be studied in large observational studies to ensure that effective treatment is sought by researchers on the inclination of clients' needs. Such studies should also be large enough to detect clinically important differences between interventions with respect to major side effects that have been reported through less rigorous research. Priority should be given to studying fewer dose regimens and cheap approaches in view of women in low-resource countries.</P>
