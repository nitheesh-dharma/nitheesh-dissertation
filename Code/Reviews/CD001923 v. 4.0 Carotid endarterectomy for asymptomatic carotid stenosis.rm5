<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This major revision was undertaken because of the publication of the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST) results in May 2004, more than doubling the number of patients randomised.</P>
<P>In the original review, Association Universitaire de Recherche en Chirurgie (AURC) data were included in a supplementary analysis. In this review AURC was excluded because of its methodological shortcomings and the substantive data obtainable from other included studies.</P>
<P>In this revision, the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) and Mayo Asymptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy (MACE) studies were excluded because surgical patients did not receive aspirin, thereby confounding the effect of carotid endarterectomy. Data from these studies were included in the original review. There were too few patients to test for aspirin effect.</P>
<P>The effect of gender, age, and degree of stenosis have been analysed in this update.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:20:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>For most people with a narrowing of the carotid artery which is not causing symptoms a surgical operation to remove the narrowing carries a risk and has little benefit. Carotid stenosis is a narrowing of a major artery in the neck taking blood to the brain. This can cause a stroke. If the narrowing is severe and has caused symptoms, surgery to remove the narrowing (carotid endarterectomy) reduces the risk of stroke. However, if the narrowing has not caused any symptoms the risk of stroke is not very high. Although this low risk can be lowered further by surgery, the surgery itself can sometimes cause a stroke or death. The overall effect of surgery is a small benefit.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is of proven benefit in recently-symptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis. Its role in asymptomatic stenosis is still debated.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:03:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (searched May 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2004), EMBASE (1980 to June 2004), Current Contents (1995 to January 1997), and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted researchers in the field to identify additional published and unpublished studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All completed randomised trials comparing CEA to medical treatment in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Attempts were made to contact investigators to obtain missing information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:03:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Three trials with a total of 5223 patients were included. In these trials, the overall net excess of operation-related perioperative stroke or death was 2.9%. For the primary outcome of perioperative stroke or death or any subsequent stroke, patients undergoing CEA fared better than those treated medically (relative risk (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83). Similarly, for the outcome of perioperative stroke or death or subsequent ipsilateral stroke, there was benefit for the surgical group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.90). For the outcome of any stroke or death, there was a non-significant trend towards fewer events in the surgical group (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02). Subgroup analyses were performed for the outcome of perioperative stroke or death or subsequent carotid stroke. CEA appeared more beneficial in men than in women and more beneficial in younger patients than in older patients although the data for age effect were inconclusive. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment effect estimates in patients with different grades of stenosis but the data were insufficient.

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:04:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Despite about a 3% perioperative stroke or death rate, CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis reduces the risk of ipsilateral stroke, and any stroke, by approximately 30% over three years. However, the absolute risk reduction is small (approximately 1% per annum over the first few years of follow up in the two largest and most recent trials) but it could be higher with longer follow up.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:04:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Whilst carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is of proven benefit in recently symptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis (<LINK REF="REF-ECST" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECST</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NASCET" TYPE="REFERENCE">NASCET</LINK>) the role of CEA in preventing stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis is still debated. Natural history studies indicate an annual risk of unheralded stroke of 1% to 3% (<LINK REF="REF-Abbott-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbott 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chambers-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 1991</LINK>). Even so, the number of asymptomatic stenosis patients undergoing CEA appears to be increasing in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-Barnett-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnett 1996</LINK>). More alarming is the trend to perform carotid angioplasty and stenting despite no evidence of efficacy. The Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (<LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK>) more than doubled the number of patients randomised to CEA trials. This revised review incorporates the recently published ACST results.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of CEA for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Our hypotheses were that CEA reduces overall rates of ipsilateral stroke, any stroke, and any stroke or death, despite some cases of perioperative stroke or death.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:21:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:04:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Truly randomised unconfounded controlled trials comparing CEA with medical management.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:04:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>All trials involving patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis were considered, irrespective of degree of stenosis or the method of determining the degree of stenosis, except where trials were performed in the context of coronary artery bypass and other sorts of surgery. Patients with no history at all of cerebrovascular symptoms, remote (more than six months) carotid territory symptoms, prior symptoms in the vertebrobasilar circulation, and prior carotid territory symptoms or a history of CEA on the contralateral side were deemed asymptomatic.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Carotid endarterectomy was the only intervention evaluated. Specific surgical techniques, type of anaesthesia, and whether the surgery was unilateral or bilateral were not addressed. Antiplatelet therapy was recognised as a potential confounder since in some trials patients in medical and surgical groups could be given antiplatelet therapy whereas in others only medical patients received antiplatelet therapy. We decided to exclude trials in which surgical patients did not receive antiplatelet therapy.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>We aimed to extract from each trial the number of patients originally allocated to each group to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. Within each treatment group we then extracted the number of patients with the following outcomes.<BR/>(1) Perioperative stroke (of any territory or type) or death (from any cause), including the interval from randomisation to surgery and 30 days after surgery. In medical patients, an equivalent period from randomisation was used for comparison.<BR/>(2) Perioperative stroke or death or ipsilateral carotid territory stroke of any pathological type during subsequent follow up.<BR/>(3) Perioperative stroke or death, or stroke of any territory or type during follow up. We chose this as the primary outcome measure.<BR/>(4) Any stroke or death during the perioperative period and subsequent follow up.</P>
<P>Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) was not included as an outcome. All strokes were counted, regardless of severity, provided the duration of neurological deficit was greater than 24 hours. It was not possible to extract data for the outcomes major stroke, vascular death, long-term disability, or quality of life from the available studies. These data should be reported in future studies.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:05:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Seven trials were identified but four were excluded from our analysis on methodological grounds. The Carotid Artery Stenosis with Asymptomatic Narrowing: Operation Versus Aspirin (<LINK REF="STD-CASANOVA" TYPE="STUDY">CASANOVA</LINK>) study was excluded because of a complicated randomisation process, precluding direct comparison of the results with the other studies. The investigators were unable to supply data for those patients with unilateral carotid stenosis who were truly randomised to CEA or medical management. The Association Universitaire de Recherche en Chirurgie (<LINK REF="STD-AURC" TYPE="STUDY">AURC</LINK>) study was conducted between 1983 and 1989 but the results of the trial were never formally published and the methodology was uncertain. Data derived by personal contact with the principal investigator were inconsistent with the little published material about this trial. It is suspected that outcomes included TIA but the principal investigator did not respond to a request for clarification. The Walter Reed Army Medical Centre Study (<LINK REF="STD-WRAMC" TYPE="STUDY">WRAMC</LINK>), and the Mayo Asymptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Study (<LINK REF="STD-MACE" TYPE="STUDY">MACE</LINK>) were small trials comparing CEA with aspirin. <LINK REF="STD-MACE" TYPE="STUDY">MACE</LINK> was terminated prematurely because of an excess of myocardial infarction and TIA in the surgical group attributed to aspirin being withheld. Although these trials were included in our original review, we excluded them from the updated review because they were confounded by the fact that CEA or lack of aspirin could cause the difference in outcome between the medical and surgical groups.</P>
<P>The three studies included in our analysis were the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study (<LINK REF="STD-VA" TYPE="STUDY">VA</LINK>), the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (<LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK>) and the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (<LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK>). These randomised 5223 patients (3579 males and 1644 females) in total. <LINK REF="STD-VA" TYPE="STUDY">VA</LINK> was restricted to males. The mean age was about 67 years. <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> excluded patients 80 years of age and over.</P>
<P>The method of angiographic measurement of degree of stenosis was as for <LINK REF="REF-NASCET" TYPE="REFERENCE">NASCET</LINK> in <LINK REF="STD-VA" TYPE="STUDY">VA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK>, and as for <LINK REF="REF-ECST" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECST</LINK> in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK>, patients were randomised on the basis of 60% to 99% stenosis by carotid duplex ultrasound alone (<LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK>) or either ultrasound or angiography (<LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK>). A few patients in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> also had angiography. In <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK>, angiography was then performed in those randomised to surgery who had not previously undergone angiography. In <LINK REF="STD-VA" TYPE="STUDY">VA</LINK>, all patients underwent angiography prior to randomisation, and were randomised if there was 50% to 99% carotid stenosis.</P>
<P>Antiplatelet therapy, usually aspirin, was administered to medical and surgical groups.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-VA" TYPE="STUDY">VA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK>, patients randomised to surgery were required to undergo CEA within 10 days and 14 days respectively. In VA, patients in the medical group who developed symptoms could cross over to surgery but it is not certain if they were censored at this point. In ACAS, crossovers from medical to surgical treatment occurred but subsequent outcomes were counted. In <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> only half the patients allocated immediate surgery had CEA within one month of randomisation and 88% by one year. Patients in the medical (deferred surgery) group underwent surgery if they developed symptoms, and subsequent outcomes were counted according to intention to treat.</P>
<P>Approximately one-quarter to one-third of the patients had a history of prior symptoms or CEA on the contralateral side. Twelve per cent of patients in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> had had ipsilateral symptoms more than six months prior to randomisation.</P>
<P>The mean duration of follow up varied from 2.7 to 4.0 years. Overall, there were 17037 person-years follow up, with mean follow up 3.3 years per patient.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:06:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomisation in each of the three studies was performed by a central co-ordinating centre. In <LINK REF="STD-VA" TYPE="STUDY">VA</LINK>, randomisation was stratified by the clinical centre and previous contralateral symptoms or CEA. In <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK>, patients were randomised using the permuted block method with at least three different block sizes determined randomly, and stratified according to clinical centre, gender, number of eligible arteries, and previous contralateral CEA. In <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK>, minimised randomisation was performed to balance demographic and potential prognostic variables. In each study, clinical centres could not predict or reject treatment allocation.</P>
<P>Outcomes were assessed by a neurologist and adjudicated by a blinded review committee in all three trials.</P>
<P>Three patients (0.2%) in <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> were lost after randomisation and excluded from the analysis. In <LINK REF="STD-VA" TYPE="STUDY">VA</LINK>, 35 patients (20 in the surgical group; 15 in the medical group; 7.9% overall) withdrew or were lost to follow up, but substantial follow-up data were available for these patients. In <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK>, 68 (2.2%) patients were lost to follow up.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-VA" TYPE="STUDY">VA</LINK>, 8 (3.8%) patients randomised to surgery did not undergo CEA. It is uncertain if there were crossovers to surgery in the medical group before the development of symptoms. Once patients in the medical group had a TIA they were permitted to cross over to surgical treatment. The number of patients doing so is uncertain. In <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK>, 101 (12.2%) patients in the surgical group did not have CEA and 45 (5.4%) in the medical group had CEA without prior ipsilateral TIA or stroke. In <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK>, about 10% of surgical (immediate surgery) patients did not have ipsilateral CEA, and about 10% of medical (deferred surgery) patients had ipsilateral CEA.</P>
<P>Data from each of the trials were presented in such a way as to permit intention-to-treat analysis, that is, treatment crossovers were analysed by their original allocated treatment.</P>

<P>The three trials included in our review involved 5223 patients and 17,037 person-years follow up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Perioperative stroke or death</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-VA" TYPE="STUDY">VA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK>, the overall perioperative complication rate was 3.0% but over the same period there were also events in medical patients (0.5%) giving a net excess of perioperative stroke or death of 2.5% (RR 6.49, 95% CI 2.53 to 16.61, P value &lt; 0.0001). These figures include complications from any angiography done after, but not before, randomisation. In <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK>, because there was a more leisurely approach to performing CEA after randomisation, data were presented differently. The operation-related 30-day rate of stroke or death was 3.1%. Combining data from all three trials revealed an overall operation-related complication rate of 2.9%.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Perioperative stroke or death or subsequent ipsilateral stroke</HEADING>

The absolute risk reduction (ARR) in <LINK REF="STD-VA" TYPE="STUDY">VA</LINK> was 1.0% over mean follow up of 4.0 years, in <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> 3.0% over 2.7 years and in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> 3.1% over 3.4 years.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Any stroke or death</HEADING>
<P>Higher event rates in <LINK REF="STD-VA" TYPE="STUDY">VA</LINK> (44.2% medical versus 41.2% surgical) are probably explained by the longer duration of follow up (mean 47.9 months).

<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> provided subgroup data. Perioperative complications in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> were obtained from a web table and added to data from the Lancet publication. We performed subgroup analyses for the outcome of perioperative stroke or death or subsequent carotid stroke. In <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> carotid stroke refers to ipsilateral, whilst in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> it refers to all carotid (since there were a large number of uncertain laterality carotid strokes).</P>
<P>For men the RRR from surgery was 51% (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.0.36 to 0.66), and for women it was 4% (RR 0.96, CI 0.64 to 1.44). This difference was statistically significant (<I>Q<SUB>int </SUB>
</I>= 7.08, P value 0.008). For men the ARR in <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> was 3.6% and in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> it was 4.2%.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> age 68 was used to distinguish younger and older patients and in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> age 75.

For younger patients, the RRR from surgery was 50% (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.68), and for older patients 9% (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.36).

</I>= 5.54, P value 0.02). However, there was mild heterogeneity between the two studies (<I>I<SUP>2 </SUP>
</I>= 27.6%) for patients in the older age category, there being a trend for benefit with CEA in <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> and the opposite trend in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK>. For younger patients in <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> the ARR was 2.7% and in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> it was 4.0%.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> grades of stenosis were defined (according to <LINK REF="REF-NASCET" TYPE="REFERENCE">NASCET</LINK>) as 60% to 69%, 70% to 79%, and 80% to 99%, but only in patients who underwent angiography prior to randomisation. In <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> grades of stenosis were defined (according to <LINK REF="REF-ECST" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECST</LINK>) as 60% to 79%, 80% to 89%, and 90% to 99%. We combined patients from <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> using the three grades of increasing severity (designated as grades 1 to 3) despite the slight variation in grading between the two studies. In these trials, only 58 outcome events occurred in patients with the most severe grade of stenosis and hence the estimate of effect between the different categories of stenosis was imprecise. There was no evidence of a difference in treatment effect between the different categories of stenosis (<I>Q<SUB>int </SUB>
</I>= 3.66, P value 0.16) but the analysis is underpowered.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:08:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Carotid endarterectomy reduces the overall risk of ipsilateral stroke and any stroke, even taking into consideration those strokes and deaths directly attributable to angiography and surgery. However, the absolute risk reduction is small: about 3% over three years for the outcome of any stroke. Since ARR is reduced by up-front perioperative complications one would expect the ARR to improve with longer follow up. The decision to extend follow up in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> will provide valuable long-term data.</P>
<P>Although the three studies included in our analysis were methodologically sound, yielding data which we consider of good quality, only 5223 patients were randomised compared with more than 100,000 patients randomised to trials of antiplatelet agents in the secondary prevention of stroke. Given that the two treatments have similar purported efficacy in stroke prevention some caution must be exercised in interpreting the CEA results.</P>
<P>It is possible that the studies included in this review are biased against surgery since patients in the medical arm were allowed to cross over to CEA after TIA.</P>
<P>The 2.9% net excess of operation-related stroke or death is lower than reported in trials of CEA for symptomatic stenosis (<LINK REF="REF-ECST" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECST</LINK> 7%; <LINK REF="REF-NASCET" TYPE="REFERENCE">NASCET</LINK> 5.4%), consistent with the view that operative risk is less for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. The trials were performed in centres of excellence where the risks of surgery would be expected to be less than in institutions where there is less expertise with CEA. Complication rates slightly higher than those reported would reverse the result.</P>
<P>One-quarter to one-third of randomised patients had a history of contralateral symptoms or CEA. Twelve per cent of patients in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> had ipsilateral symptoms more than six months prior to randomisation. In <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> medical patients who had previous contralateral symptoms or CEA had higher stroke rates than those who did not. In <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> medical patients with remote ipsilateral symptoms had a higher stroke rate than those who did not. Moreover, patients with prior contralateral symptoms or CEA seemed to benefit more from CEA of the study artery.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-VA" TYPE="STUDY">VA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ACAS" TYPE="STUDY">ACAS</LINK> 33% overall of eligible patients were not randomised. We do not know how many eligible patients were not randomised in <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK>. Whether this introduces bias is uncertain. However, the external validity is questionable. It is possible that some patients were considered to be at higher risk and operated on rather than randomised, while on the other hand, only patients in good general medical health with reasonable life expectancy were randomised.</P>
<P>Provided the excess stroke risk of unoperated asymptomatic carotid stenosis continues, the longer a patient survives after CEA the greater the potential benefit since the adverse consequences of surgery are limited to the perioperative period.</P>
<P>For the type of patients entered in the included trials who were at low absolute risk of stroke over the period of follow up the net gain from surgery was small. Operating on a population whose absolute risk of stroke is much higher may improve the utility of the procedure.</P>
<P>If CEA is to be a worthwhile treatment for asymptomatic carotid disease it is imperative that better risk stratification be achieved to identify patients at high enough risk to justify surgery. Gender, age, degree of stenosis, plaque morphology, number of risk factors, measures of intracranial haemodynamic insufficiency, microembolic signals detected by transcranial Doppler in the middle cerebral artery, and CT evidence of silent cerebral infarction are some of the parameters under evaluation but there is no clear consensus as to the best method yet.<BR/>
<BR/>Cost effectiveness of CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis is an important consideration. In Australia in 1997 it was estimated that the cost of preventing one stroke by CEA, over five years of follow up, is AUD$210,760 for asymptomatic stenosis compared with AUD$14,230 for symptomatic stenosis, over two years of follow up (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC</LINK>).</P>
<P>The public health impact of operating on all patients with asymptomatic disease is likely to be small. In Australia it has been calculated that if all eligible patients with 60% or greater carotid stenosis underwent CEA, only 1290 strokes would be prevented, representing 4.6% of the 28,000 first-ever strokes occurring each year (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC</LINK>). Thereafter, with the pool of eligible patients exhausted, and a relatively low incidence of asymptomatic 60% to 99% stenosis, there would only be a small number of patients being operated on each year.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses suggest that women may not benefit in the short to medium term. This is consistent with previous observations. Women have a higher surgical complication rate than men due to technical difficulty handling smaller arteries. The spontaneous stroke rate in women with asymptomatic carotid disease is less than in men. There is a case for more women to be randomised in CEA trials to ensure this possible lack of efficacy is not due to Type II error. It is also possible women will benefit with longer follow up.</P>
<P>There is limited evidence on the effects of CEA among older people. The underpowered subgroup analyses suggest that there may be no benefit from CEA in older people with asymptomatic stenosis. This runs counter to the evidence of greater benefit from surgery for symptomatic stenosis among older compared with younger patients (<LINK REF="REF-Rothwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothwell 2004</LINK>). Again, with only a small number of events among older patients there is a possibility of Type II error.</P>
<P>The data are insufficient to examine whether there is a gradient of increasing benefit from surgery with increasing degree of stenosis. Hence, it is unclear whether the apparent difference in effects in different categories of stenosis (with less apparent benefit in the most severe category) is real or merely due to the play of chance. The subgroup analyses of the effect of surgery in patients with symptomatic stenosis are more robust and provide clear evidence that benefit increases substantially with degree of stenosis, excepting the most severe category of stenosis or near-occlusion, where there is no benefit from surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Rothwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothwell 2004</LINK>). The longer-term data from <LINK REF="STD-ACST" TYPE="STUDY">ACST</LINK> may help to resolve this question.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:16:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:08:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This systematic review shows that in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, despite about a 3% perioperative stroke or death rate, CEA reduces the risk of ipsilateral stroke, and any stroke, by approximately 30% over three years. However, the absolute risk reduction is small (approximately 1% per annum over the first few years of follow up in the two largest and most recent trials) but it could be higher with longer follow up. Any benefit would be negated by a higher perioperative complication rate and only those centres with complication rates of 3% or less should contemplate performing CEA in asymptomatic patients. Whilst there is clear benefit for men, CEA did not appear to help women but it is possible that there could be a positive effect with longer follow up. At present, there is insufficient evidence on whether the surgical oucomes are different in older and younger people, and in patients with different degrees of stenosis. Longer follow up of patients in existing trials or recruitment of additional patients should help clarify these points.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-23 14:16:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>For CEA to become a more cost-effective and clinically-relevant treatment option in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, higher-risk patients must be reliably targeted. Clinical issues which must be resolved by randomisation of more patients and longer follow-up are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>whether there is a gradient of benefit with increasing degrees of stenosis, as seen for symptomatic carotid disease;</LI>
<LI>whether the benefit in women is definitely different to that in men;</LI>
<LI>whether there is a different degree of benefit in older patients compared with younger patients.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Other issues which may be resolved by meta-analysis of individual patient source data are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>whether the benefits of surgery are greater for those with more vascular risk factors;</LI>
<LI>whether the benefits of surgery can be related to an expected survival instrument based on age, sex and risk factor criteria.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Other approaches to identify high-risk patients are necessary, such as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>improved characterisation of plaque morphology;</LI>
<LI>detection of microembolic signals by transcranial Doppler.</LI>

Although included in our original review, we excluded this trial from the updated review because it was confounded by the fact that CEA or lack of aspirin could cause the difference in outcome between the medical and surgical groups.</P>
