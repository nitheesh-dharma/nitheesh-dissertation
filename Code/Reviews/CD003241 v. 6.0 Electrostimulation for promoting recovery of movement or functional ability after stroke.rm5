<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-19 10:47:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Electrostimulation is a potential treatment to improve recovery of movement control and functional ability after stroke but the results of this review are inconclusive. After stroke many people are unable to use their affected limbs in everyday activities such as walking, ascending/descending stairs, washing hair or opening a coffee jar. One way to improve recovery might be to train affected muscles by using electrostimulation. This review examined the findings of 24 randomised controlled trials of electrostimulation provided to improve the ability to voluntarily move the affected limb and/or use the affected limb in everyday activities. The available evidence suggests that when electrostimulation is compared to no treatment then there might be a small effect on some aspects of function in favour of electrostimulation. However, the majority of findings in favour of electrostimulation were found when it was compared to a group of stroke patients who were not receiving any treatment and for all but two of the outcomes examined there were no differences between either electrostimulation and placebo or between electrostimulation and another type of physical therapy. This review also found that there were many differences between randomised controlled trials in the types of stroke patients who were included, the doses of electrostimulation and the outcome measures used. This meant that many of the comparisons made in the review related to one randomised trial rather than two or more. In addition, the numbers of participants in trials were relatively small. The results of this review therefore need to be interpreted with caution.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Electrostimulation might improve motor recovery after stroke by providing neuromuscular re-training.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To find if electrostimulation improved functional motor ability, and the ability to undertake activities of daily living. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched August 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2004), EMBASE (1980 to January 2004), CINAHL (1982 to January 2004), AMED - Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (1985 to January 2004), Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), REHABDATA and the ISI Science Citation Index (1981 to 2003). We placed a request on the PHYSIO e-mail discussion list and contacted authors of relevant studies to elicit any unpublished or ongoing studies, searched the reference lists of included trials and contacted trialists.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of electrostimulation delivered to the peripheral neuromuscular system which was designed to improve voluntary movement control, functional motor ability and activities of daily living. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Of the 2077 references identified, 24 trials were included in this review. For electrostimulation compared with no treatment this review found that electrostimulation improved some aspects of functional motor ability and some aspects of motor impairment and normality of movement. In addition, there was a significant difference in favour of no treatment compared with electrostimulation for an aspect of functional motor ability. For electrostimulation compared with placebo this review found that electrostimulation improved an aspect of functional motor ability. For electrostimulation compared with conventional physical therapy this review found that electrostimulation improved an aspect of motor impairment. There were no statistically significant differences between electrostimulation and control treatment for all other outcomes. However, these results need to be interpreted with reference to the following: (1) the majority of analyses only contained one trial; (2) variation was found between included trials in time after stroke, level of functional deficit, and dose of electrostimulation; and (3) the possibility of selection and detection bias in the majority of included trials. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>At present, there are insufficient robust data to inform clinical use of electrostimulation for neuromuscular re-training. Research is needed to address specific questions about the type of electrostimulation that might be most effective, in what dose and at what time after stroke.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-19 12:50:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>A large proportion of stroke patients remain moderately or severely disabled (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bonita-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonita 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>) despite the considerable benefits of organised stroke care which both saves lives and reduces disability (<LINK REF="REF-SUTC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">SUTC 2001</LINK>). The magnitude of resultant physical disability is illustrated by the finding that patients who are able to perform voluntary movements early after stroke may only have 45% of normal lower limb strength by the time they are discharged from in-patient rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2000</LINK>). Even for those patients with initially mild impairment, outcome can be disappointing, and there are major health economic implications (<LINK REF="REF-Beech-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beech 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>To date there is no evidence that one physiotherapy approach is any better than any other approach (<LINK REF="REF-Ashburn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashburn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2003</LINK>). Some studies have indicated that physiotherapy as a whole may be beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Ashburn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashburn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dean-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dean 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feys-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feys 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kwakkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwakkel 1999</LINK>). Early intervention might be better than late (<LINK REF="REF-Cifu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cifu 1999</LINK>) but even late after stroke, physical therapy may be beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Dean-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dean 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wade-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yekutiel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yekutiel 1993</LINK>). Not surprisingly, the content of physical therapy might also influence outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Parry-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parry 1999</LINK>) but at present, choice of treatment by physiotherapists appears to be mostly determined by the treatment approach which was prevalent during their training (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore attention has turned to examining the effectiveness of interventions contained within the package (<LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pomeroy-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeroy 2000a</LINK>) used by physical therapists with the aim of producing an evidenced-based physical therapy package which reduces resultant disability for stroke patients. However, the large number of interventions that exist for a fairly small part of stroke rehabilitation, post-stroke shoulder pain (<LINK REF="REF-Pomeroy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeroy 2001</LINK>), suggests that systematic examination of all interventions would be an immense task (<LINK REF="REF-Pomeroy-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeroy 2000b</LINK>). It is logical to start by evaluating those interventions which have biological plausibility.</P>
<P>Recent advances in neuroscience have confirmed that the brain has the ability to reorganize after stroke. Several studies have associated elements of afferent stimulation with beneficial change in brain activity including: repetition (<LINK REF="REF-Hallet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallet 1998</LINK>), functional goal directed activity (<LINK REF="REF-Nudo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nudo 1996</LINK>) and electrostimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Golaszeski-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golaszeski 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamdy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamdy 1998</LINK>). These clues from neuroscience coincide with the less systematic observations from the physical therapy literature which suggest that repetition/intensity, functional activity, and electrostimulation might promote recovery of movement and functional ability after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Pomeroy-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeroy 2000a</LINK>). The scientific evidence indicates therefore that motor recovery may be enhanced with the provision of an appropriate dose of afferent stimulation normally arising from functional activities. However, many people with paralysis or even paresis after stroke would not be able to participate in functional training. If paralysis or paresis precludes sufficient voluntary activation of muscle to produce functional activity then electrostimulation might be beneficial. In addition, lack of use could be expected to lead to changes in the properties of skeletal muscle after stroke because of altered descending neuromuscular drive. Indeed, these expectations are supported by the findings of general reduction in the functional capacity of skeletal muscles after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Potempa-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potempa 1996</LINK>) unrelated to time elapsed since ictus or the severity of the paresis but related to the absence of daily physical exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Hachisuka-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hachisuka 1997</LINK>). Expectations are also supported by the findings that the descending commands from the damaged cortex to the paretic side fail to active high threshold alpha-motor neurones supplying Type II fibres (<LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 1998</LINK>). That electrostimulation could enhance ability to contract skeletal muscle after stroke is exemplified in a study in which maximal dorsiflexion force at the ankle following electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve was shown to be equal on both paretic and non-paretic sides, although the maximal voluntary dorsiflexion on the paretic side fell far short of symmetry with the non-paretic side (<LINK REF="STD-Landau-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Landau 2002</LINK>). Research findings suggest therefore that electrostimulation given in the appropriate dose might promote recovery of movement or functional ability after stroke more than the conventional physical therapy package. </P>
<P>Electrostimulation has already been the focus of systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bolton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Kroon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Kroon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glanz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glanz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Handy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handy 2003</LINK>) but these did not use a comprehensive Cochrane search strategy. A recent systematic review of defined physical therapy interventions for the improvement of performance of movement and/or functional ability (<LINK REF="REF-Pomeroy-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeroy 2000a</LINK>) was limited by the use of only one review author and the inclusion of data only from published English language studies. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if there is a difference in the recovery of movement or functional ability in patients with stroke between the provision of:<BR/>(1) electrostimulation and no treatment;<BR/>(2) electrostimulation and placebo electrostimulation;<BR/>(3) electrostimulation and conventional physical therapy interventions;<BR/>(4) different types of electrostimulation, for example transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS), functional electrical stimulation (FES).</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-19 10:52:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Controlled trials, where participants were randomly or quasi-randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups. Trials with or without blinding of participants, physiotherapists and assessors were included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Participants in studies were adults (over 18 years) with a clinical diagnosis of stroke (WHO definition) (<LINK REF="REF-Hatano-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatano 1976</LINK>). Participants with a diagnosis of either ischaemic stroke or haemorrhagic stroke at any time after stroke were included and confirmation of the clinical diagnosis using imaging was not compulsory. However, information pertaining to the type of stroke and the availability of confirmation of diagnosis was documented when describing the studies.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-19 10:51:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Electrostimulation delivered to the peripheral neuromuscular system by external or internal electrodes and designed to improve voluntary movement control (motor impairment and normality of movement), functional motor ability and activities of daily living (ADL). This application of electrostimulation has been termed 'neuromuscular re-training' (<LINK REF="REF-Alon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alon 2003</LINK>). Trials which investigated an experimental condition that differed from the control condition by combining electrostimulation with other interventions (for example, splints) were excluded from this review. We expected to describe electrostimulation as follows.</P>

<P>(1) Single channel<BR/>(2) Multi channel<BR/>(3) Patterned multi channel<BR/>(4) Functional electrical stimulation (FES; EMG triggered)<BR/>(5) Transcutaneous electrical neuromuscular stimulation (TENS)</P>
<P>Examination of identified studies, however, revealed that the terms used to describe the type of electrostimulation were used differently by different authors. For example, the term TENS was found to be used to describe electrostimulation that produced a muscle contraction as well as electrostimulation that did not produce a muscle contraction. Clearly, different definitions of types of electrostimulation were being used by different authors. To clarify types of electrostimulation we therefore modified the electrostimulation description so that it described the characteristics of the electrostimulation in terms of:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>whether the paretic limb was active or inactive when stimulation was given;</LI>
<LI>whether the electrostimulation was constant or triggered/intermittent;</LI>
<LI>whether the electrode was external or internal;</LI>
<LI>whether the electrostimulation did or did not produce a muscle contraction.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The resultant clinical descriptive groups were used to describe types of electrostimulation evaluated in a sample of five trials by three review authors independently (two researchers and one clinical senior physiotherapist who was independent of other dimensions of this review). Appropriate modifications were made which resulted in the final description which provides 16 possible types of electrostimulation which are shown in Additional Table 01 (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We had also planned to include electrostimulation delivered to the central nervous system. This was omitted after considering the complexity of this review which became evident as potential trials were identified.</P>

<P>This review considered outcome measures made at the end of the treatment period in identified trials. It was planned to also consider outcome measures at follow up but these were made at different time points in different trials and therefore presented difficulties for collation of data.

Where there was disagreement between review authors, or where the review authors were 'unsure', disagreement or uncertainty was resolved through discussion between the review authors. If the review authors were unable to agree or both were uncertain of the relevance of any trial, the trial was included at this stage.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Classification of types of electrostimulation</HEADING>
<P>Based on the classification of types of electrostimulation (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), independent review authors classified the interventions administered in each trial. If review authors disagreed on the classification, this was resolved by referral to the original paper. This process resulted in agreement and it was therefore not necessary to contact study authors for clarification or to consult with the clinical senior physiotherapist who was independent to this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Documentation of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>The two independent review authors documented the methodological quality of included studies. Documentation was made of:<BR/>(1) generation of allocation sequence, that is allocation sequence cannot influence order of recruitment of participants to the trial (selection bias);<BR/>(2) true concealment of randomisation up to time of allocation (selection bias);<BR/>(3) blindness of participants to treatment group (performance bias);<BR/>(4) blindness of providers of care to treatment group (performance bias);<BR/>(5) differences in control or underlying treatments, that is differences in the care provided apart from the intervention being evaluated (performance bias);<BR/>(6) protocol deviations, specifically, breaking of eligibility criteria for participants or divergence from prescribed treatments (attrition bias);<BR/>(7) analysis deviations, specifically, absence of intention-to-treat principle in data analysis or lack of report of withdrawals and reasons why (attrition bias);<BR/>(8) assessors blinded to interventions given (detection bias);<BR/>(9) selective reporting of results, for example specification of predefined primary outcomes and analyses (detection bias).</P>
<P>The assessment system was the standard Cochrane classification:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>A = adequate;</LI>
<LI>B = Unclear;</LI>
<LI>C = inadequate;</LI>
<LI>D = Not used.</LI>
</UL>
<P>An aspect of standard design that is not always possible to apply in rehabilitation research is blinding of participants and providers. To judge performance bias therefore for this review we gave a grading of C for 'participants blinded' if we considered that it was possible to provide a placebo electrostimulation and yet this was not done, whereas if it appeared that provision of a placebo electrostimulation was not possible then the grade of D was assigned. For 'providers blinded', a C grading was given if we considered that it was possible to provide a placebo that meant that the provider was unaware of what form of intervention was being given. Of course, if the electrostimulation was designed to produce a muscle contraction the provider would be aware if this did not occur and could infer that the placebo intervention was being given. In these circumstances we assigned a D grading.</P>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of each included study. Any disagreements were resolved through referral to the original paper. This process resulted in agreement and therefore it was unnecessary to contact study authors for clarification or to consult with the clinical senior physiotherapist who was independent of this review.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data, and contacted the study authors to clarify data or obtain missing data wherever possible. Documentation was made (where possible) on:<BR/>(1) the characteristics of participants in the experimental and control groups;<BR/>(2) inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trial;<BR/>(3) all assessed outcomes.<BR/>Any disagreements were resolved by discussion between the review authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis of results</HEADING>
<P>We planned to compare:<BR/>(1) electrostimulation and no treatment;<BR/>(2) electrostimulation and placebo electrostimulation;<BR/>(3) electrostimulation and conventional therapy;<BR/>(4) different types of electrostimulation.</P>
<P>Studies were placed in the electrostimulation versus no treatment comparison if they provided electrostimulation to the experimental group and nothing in the control group. To avoid the potential confounding factor of intensity of treatment, we also placed studies in this comparison if both groups received conventional therapy and the only difference was that the experimental group also received electrostimulation.</P>
<P>For each comparison, the study results for measures of motor and ADL ability, measures of motor impairment, and measures of movement were used. The Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager software (RevMan 4.2) was used to calculate the weighted treatment effect and 95% confidence intervals across trials. Different trials used different outcome measures. If trials used different outcomes but it was possible to combine them they are presented as standardised mean differences (SMD). We determined the SMD using the random-effects model.</P>
<P>To find the acceptability of electrostimulation intervention we calculated the relative risk for adverse events as assessed by the surrogate marker of withdrawal of participants during the treatment phase of all included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2003</LINK>). To clarify this analysis, we examined the reasons for withdrawal of participants.</P>
<P>Homogeneity between trials was tested using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, with a value greater than 50% considered to indicate substantial heterogeneity. We also planned to investigate the possible reasons for heterogeneity in sensitivity analyses for concealed compared to unconcealed allocation, blinded compared with unblinded outcome assessment and, the effect of including trial data which omitted data for participants who did not complete the treatment phase (intention-to-treat analysis).<BR/>
<BR/>Interpretation of the analysis was made with reference to the methodological quality of the studies reviewed.</P>

<P>The search strategy identified 2077 potentially relevant references. Screening of the titles and abstracts by the two independent review authors eliminated the vast majority of these, leaving 56 potentially relevant references. Of these, 29 references (six of which used the same participants) did not meet the inclusion criteria and these are listed in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table together with the reasons for their exclusion. One paper (<LINK REF="STD-Mokrusch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mokrusch 1997</LINK>) described an ongoing study and this is detailed in the 'Characteristics of ongoing studies' table. One reference was for an abstract that was not available in OVID in August 2005 and this has therefore been placed in 'Studies awaiting assessment'. Of the remaining 25 references, two used the same participant group and there are therefore 24 trials which are included in this present review (<LINK REF="STD-Bogataj-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bogataj 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burridge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chae-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chae 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cozean-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cozean 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daly-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daly 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Francisco-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gosman_x002d_Hedstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gosman-Hedstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heckman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heckman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kimberley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kimberley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1996" TYPE="STUDY">King 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macdonell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merletti-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Merletti 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pei 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Popovic-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Popovic 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sonde 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tekeoolu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tekeoolu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The 24 trials included 888 participants (median 30, range 11 to 102) who completed the baseline measurements. Eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chae-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chae 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cozean-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cozean 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daly-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daly 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Francisco-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gosman_x002d_Hedstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gosman-Hedstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2005</LINK>) reported participant withdrawals before outcome measures were undertaken (n = 53). There were therefore 835 participants who underwent outcome measurements at the end of the intervention. The reasons for withdrawal are given in the Results section.</P>
<P>Two of the 24 trials did not provide any data on the age of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2004</LINK>). The mean age of participants in the remaining 22 trials ranged from 52.05 to 76.50 years. Other information about participants was inconsistently reported in the trials and it is therefore not possible to provide a definitive description of participants. Only 17 trials provided a mean time after stroke which ranged from 9.4 days (<LINK REF="STD-Yan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2005</LINK>) to 4.29 years (<LINK REF="STD-Burridge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 1997</LINK>). Only 14 trials provided information about the side of hemiparesis in the experimental and control participants included in this review. In these trials, approximately 54% of participants had a left hemiparesis. A mere eight of the 24 trials provided any data on stroke type or stroke lesion (<LINK REF="STD-Daly-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daly 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heckman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heckman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kimberley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kimberley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pei 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Popovic-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Popovic 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1999</LINK>) which is insufficient information from which to describe the participants in this review.</P>

</P>
<UL>

<LI>Categories 5 and 7 combined (paretic limb active, external electrode, triggered or intermittent stimulus, contraction produced and paretic limb inactive, external electrode, triggered or intermittent stimulus, contraction produced) - 2 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Macdonell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonell 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Merletti-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Merletti 1978</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Thus the majority of trials used electrostimulation delivered by external electrodes which produced or enhanced contraction of paretic muscle.</P>
<P>Dose of electrostimulation combined global temporal aspects of the intensity (time period per day), frequency (number of intervention sessions per week) and duration (number of weeks) of treatment with the specific magnitude of electrostimulation in terms of parameters including: amplitude, frequency, pulse width and ramping up or down. Dose of electrostimulation is therefore complex and there is considerable scope for variation. Indeed, dose of electrostimulation varied between trials for both aspects of the prescription. For global temporal aspects across these 24 trials the duration of treatment ranged from one day to three months although one trial reported that the intervention continued for the length of the rehabilitation stay. The frequency of intervention ranged between one to five times a week. Intensity also varied across trials and ranged from 10 minutes to six hours a day. Details of the specific magnitude of electrostimulation dose are more difficult to summarise. In some trials the specific magnitude of electrostimulation was directed by the effect of electrostimulation on individual participants. For example, amplitude set to 80% of the amplitude which produced non-volitional movement in the joint of interest (<LINK REF="STD-Bogataj-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bogataj 1995</LINK>) and pulse frequency controlled to provide the maximum contraction within tolerable levels of discomfort (<LINK REF="STD-Cozean-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cozean 1988</LINK>). Interestingly, there was little evidence within the trials that either aspect of the dose of electrostimulation was based on experimental studies of efficacy; a subjective impression which is not confined to this review (<LINK REF="REF-Alon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alon 2003</LINK>). It was therefore not possible to extract specific details of global temporal and specific magnitude dose of electrostimulation for all trials.</P>
<P>Fifteen of the 24 trials compared an experimental group who received an electrostimulation intervention combined with a form of conventional (non-electrostimulation) therapy with a control group who received the same form of conventional (non-electrostimulation) therapy. We placed these 15 trials into the comparison group of electrostimulation versus no treatment as all participants received conventional therapy. Placebo forms of electrostimulation were compared with active electrostimulation in five trials and electrostimulation was compared with conventional (non-electrostimulation) therapy in four trials. None of the 24 included trials compared different forms of electrostimulation. The comparison of interventions for each trial is documented in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table.</P>

<P>The results of the methodological assessment of the 24 trials included in this review are provided in Table 2 (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Details of the possibility of bias are given in the following subsections and also in Table 2. Essentially:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>selection bias could have been present in the majority of trials as procedures for generation of allocation sequence and/or concealment of that sequence were unclear or inadequate in the majority of studies;</LI>
<LI>the possibility for performance bias is difficult to judge in this present review as although the majority of trials did not use participant blinding or provider blinding this could be because it was not possible to do so in the majority of the included trials because of the characteristics of electrostimulation and the comparator interventions. For this reason, and because the avoidance of differences in underlying care was only assessed as inadequate in four trials, we consider the possibility of performance bias to be minimal in this present review;</LI>
<LI>the possibility for attrition bias was considered minimal in the majority of trials included in this review;</LI>
<LI>the presence of detection bias is a possibility for the majority of included trials mainly because of a lack of clarity or the inadequate use of blinded assessment.</LI>
</UL>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection bias</HEADING>
<P>Selection bias was assessed by the methods of generation of allocation sequence and allocation concealment. The method of generation of random allocation and concealment of the allocation was unclear from the descriptions given in published papers of the majority of trials included in this present review. Allocation generation was assessed as adequate in only five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gosman_x002d_Hedstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gosman-Hedstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2005</LINK>) and allocation concealment in only five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cauraugh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cauraugh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Francisco-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gosman_x002d_Hedstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gosman-Hedstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1999</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Performance bias</HEADING>
<P>Performance bias was assessed by whether or not participants were blinded to the intervention they received, providers were blinded to the intervention they provided and whether or not there were any differences in care between the experimental and control groups apart from the intervention being evaluated. The procedures used for blinding participants were assessed as adequate in only five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chae-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chae 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cozean-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cozean 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kimberley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kimberley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tekeoolu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tekeoolu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yan 2005</LINK>) and the procedures used for blinding providers were assessed as adequate in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cozean-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cozean 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kimberley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kimberley 2004</LINK>) and inadequate in only four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Popovic-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Popovic 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonde-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sonde 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tekeoolu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tekeoolu 1998</LINK>). However, it must be appreciated that it is arguable that it was not possible to blind participants or providers to the experimental or 'control' intervention in the majority of trials because the experimental electrostimulation in the majority of trials was designed to produce a muscle contraction and when compared with conventional therapy is obvious what is being delivered (see 'Description of studies' - interventions and the documentation of methodological quality sections). The avoidance of differences in underlying care for the two groups was only considered inadequate in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bogataj-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bogataj 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burridge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pei 2001</LINK>). Overall, taking the difficulty of providing participant and provider blinding together with the lack of differences in underlying care between comparator groups in included trials, we consider that the possibility of performance bias to be minimal in this present review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Attrition bias</HEADING>
<P>Attrition bias was assessed by the presence of any deviations from the protocols (for example, breaking of eligibility criteria for participants or deviation from prescribed treatments) and the presence of analysis deviation (for example, absence of intention-to-treat principle in data analysis or lack of report of withdrawals). Attrition bias was absent from the majority of trials with 20 trials assessed as not deviating from the prescribed protocol and 14 trials not exhibiting analysis deviation. However, caution is required as attrition bias has been assessed from published reports of trials and therefore from what is reported in scientific papers which often need to adhere to specific word count limits.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Detection bias</HEADING>
<P>Detection bias was assessed by whether or not assessors were blinded to the interventions given and whether or not there was selective reporting of results (for example, deviation from predefined outcomes and analysis). From information provided in the published papers blinding of assessors was considered as adequate in 11 trials, unclear in 10 trials and inadequate in three trials. The avoidance of selective reporting of results was assessed as adequate in 14 trials, unclear in one trial and inadequate in nine trials.</P>

<P>There were four trials in this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Bogataj-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bogataj 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cozean-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cozean 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Francisco-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2004</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 4: Acceptability of electrostimulation</HEADING>
<P>There were a total of 53 participants who withdrew before the outcome measurements due to: pain or discomfort from surface stimulation (experimental = 7, control = 1); adverse reaction (experimental = 1, control = 0); medical problems (experimental = 5, control = 5); participants died (experimental = 3, control n = 6); cognitive problems (experimental = 0, control = 1); social support system compromised (experimental = 0, control = 1); declined to finish treatment (experimental = 5, control = 2); unable to stimulate without motor activation (experimental = 0, control = 1); unable to undertake assessment (experimental = 1, control = 0); discharged early (experimental = 0, control = 1); unknown (experimental = 1, control = 0). One study reported 5 withdrawals (experimental = 3, control = 2) but it is unclear what the reasons were for these particular participants (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1999</LINK>). One study reported seven withdrawals because of medical instability but no information was provided about experimental allocation of these participants (<LINK REF="STD-Francisco-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the 53 participants who withdrew only 9 were reported as experiencing either pain, discomfort or adverse events. A further seven participants declined to finish treatment but specific reasons for this decision were not given. In essence, 53 of 888 participants (6%) withdrew and only 9 of 888 participants (1%) withdrew because of an adverse event that could be expected to be directly related to electrostimulation. This level of withdrawals does not indicate unacceptability of electrostimulation to people who have suffered a stroke.</P>
<P>Statistical analyses support the conclusion that electrostimulation was found to be acceptable to participants in the included trials (as measured by withdrawal before outcome measurement). No statistically significant differences were found between the number of withdrawals from the electrostimulation and no treatment groups and from the electrostimulation and placebo groups. Two of the four studies which compared electrostimulation and conventional therapy reported withdrawals from the trial during the treatment phase (<LINK REF="STD-Cozean-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cozean 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Francisco-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco 1998</LINK>). However one of these trials did not provide information about the randomised allocation of those participants who withdrew (<LINK REF="STD-Francisco-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco 1998</LINK>). We therefore calculated the relative risk of withdrawal from the comparator groups with (sensitivity analysis) and without the assumption that all the withdrawals from the trial of Francisco and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Francisco-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco 1998</LINK>) were from the electrostimulation group rather than the conventional therapy group. This analysis showed that the relative risk of withdrawal from the electrostimulation group increased from 0.48 (95% CI 0.05 to 4.65) to 3.21 (95% CI 0.58 to 17.85) with the assumption that all withdrawals in the Francisco trial occurred in the electrostimulation group. However, neither analysis found that there were statistically significant differences between electrostimulation and conventional therapy. This meta-analysis detected no heterogeneity for number of withdrawals in the included trials.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-19 10:53:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The aim of this review was to find whether recovery of movement and functional ability after stroke could be enhanced by electrostimulation. This review considered data at outcome, and follow-up data was not included. The findings are divided into three sections, electrostimulation compared with no treatment, electrostimulation compared with placebo and electrostimulation compared with conventional therapy.</P>
<P>When electrostimulation is compared with no treatment this review found a statistically significant difference in favour of no treatment for functional motor ability upper extremity drawing test actual values and that electrostimulation improved:<BR/>(1) motor impairment - muscle function<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>motor reaction time</LI>
<LI>isometric torque</LI>
<LI>active joint range of movement</LI>
</UL>
<P>(2) functional motor ability<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Box and Blocks Test</LI>
</UL>
<P>However, these statistically significant differences in favour of electrostimulation for aspects of motor impairment and functional motor ability resulted from data of single studies. Therefore low power is an area of concern and represents a threat to the validity of these results. It is therefore important to be cautious about these findings. This review also found that electrostimulation was acceptable to participants as assessed by the finding of no statistically significant difference between groups for withdrawal of participants during the treatment phase. However, it could be important that there was a trend for more participants to withdraw from the electrostimulation groups especially as the number of participants included in trials was relatively low. It is also possible that participants might not have received a full course of treatment because of intervention-related problems. It has not been possible to examine this possibility in this review.</P>
<P>When electrostimulation is compared with a placebo intervention this review found statistically significant differences between groups in favour of electrostimulation for functional motor ability - Jebsen Hand Function Test feeding and muscle function - co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. However, both of these results were based on data from one study only. Cautious interpretation of this difference in favour of electrostimulation is therefore required. This review also found that electrostimulation was acceptable to participants as assessed by the finding of no statistically significant difference between groups for withdrawal of participants during the treatment phase.</P>
<P>When electrostimulation is compared with a conventional therapy intervention this review found that electrostimulation probably improves motor impairment as assessed by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment. No significant differences were found between groups for normality of movement, functional motor ability or global ADL. Electrostimulation was found to be acceptable to participants as assessed by the finding of no statistically significant difference between groups for withdrawal of participants during the treatment phase.</P>
<P>In summary, this review found the majority of benefits of electrostimulation in the comparison of electrostimulation with no treatment. That the majority of benefits were found for the comparison of electrostimulation and no treatment is not surprising as intensity of treatment is thought to be important for outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Kwakkel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwakkel 2004</LINK>). It is arguable therefore that the benefits found for electrostimulation in this review might be mostly due to the increased intensity of therapy apart from the one supporting finding of improvement in motor impairment (Fugl-Meyer Assessment) when electrostimulation is compared to conventional therapy. This interpretation is supported by the finding of no difference in motor score reported as part of the results of an earlier Cochrane review which investigated primarily whether electrostimulation prevented and/or reduced shoulder pain after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Price-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 2001</LINK>). However, four other systematic reviews have concluded that electrostimulation does have a beneficial effect on aspects of motor function after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Bolton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Kroon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Kroon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glanz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glanz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Handy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handy 2003</LINK>). There are, though, limitations to these four systematic reviews as they included non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bolton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glanz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glanz 1996</LINK>); included studies which combined electrostimulation with other interventions such as visual feedback (<LINK REF="REF-de-Kroon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Kroon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glanz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glanz 1996</LINK>); included follow up as well as outcome data (<LINK REF="REF-de-Kroon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Kroon 2002</LINK>); included a study with a sample containing both people with a head injury and people with stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Handy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handy 2003</LINK>); and included studies from which it was not possible to extract data precisely as these were presented graphically (<LINK REF="REF-Handy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handy 2003</LINK>). We had also identified two further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Faghri-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Faghri 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000</LINK>) but received no reply from the trial authors to our communications and were therefore unable to obtain the raw data. We therefore consider that more confidence can be placed in the findings of our present review than in the four previous systematic reviews as it is more comprehensive and has included more appropriate primary trials.</P>
<P>Although we consider the present review to be more robust methodologically than the four other systematic reviews that drew positive conclusions about the effects of electrostimulation after stroke, there is a possibility that potential benefits could have been missed in this present review because of the organisation of the analysis. For example, the systematic review undertaken by Bolton and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Bolton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolton 2004</LINK>) suggests that event-triggered electrostimulation improves functional outcome after stroke. This type of electrostimulation is described in this present review as groups 5 and 7 and these descriptors were used most often for the types of electrostimulation evaluated in the included trials (19 of 24 trials). Visual inspection of the results displayed in the graphs suggests that omission of data from trials evaluating electrostimulation in groups other than 5 and 7 (<LINK REF="STD-Daly-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daly 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gosman_x002d_Hedstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gosman-Hedstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pei 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tekeoolu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tekeoolu 1998</LINK>) would probably: (1) provide an extra statistically significant difference in favour of electrostimulation compared with no treatment for normality of movement; and (2) remove the statistically significant difference in favour of electrostimulation compared with no treatment for global ADL. As both of the probable changes would occur within the electrostimulation versus no treatment comparison and as this comparison is probably confounded by the extra intensity of treatment provided to the experimental groups any changes from a re-analysis would not be clinically important. We considered undertaking a sensitivity analysis to check our visual interpretation but the number of trials available within electrostimulation groups other than 5 and 7 are insufficient to allow meta-analysis in the different comparisons and therefore any results would be inconclusive. The results of this present systematic review therefore do not allow any inferences to be made about the comparative effectiveness of different types of electrostimulation.</P>
<P>Functional electrical stimulation is a form of triggered electrostimulation that is being used clinically in the UK to improve the ability of people to walk after stroke. The primary trials that have influenced clinical practice in the UK have been those conducted by Burridge and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Burridge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 1997</LINK>). At first sight it appears that this present review contradicts the prevalent positive interpretation of the findings of these studies. However, the aim of this present review was to investigate the effects of using electrostimulation to change voluntary movement control (motor impairment and normality of movement), functional motor ability and ADL whilst electrostimulation was not being delivered to participants (neuromuscular re-training) and not to investigate the use of electrostimulation as what has been termed a 'neuroprosthesis/orthosis' (<LINK REF="REF-Alon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alon 2003</LINK>). We therefore used outcome measurement data from participants walking without FES being applied (<LINK REF="STD-Burridge-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 1997</LINK>). This difference in examination of available data has led to the apparent disagreement with clinical use of FES and reviews conducted by other researchers (<LINK REF="REF-Kottink-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kottink 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Variation between primary trials is an important limitation that needs to be considered when interpreting the findings of this present review. For example, participant groups varied between included trials in time after stroke (ranged from 15.7 days to 4.29 years) and varied in the degree of functional deficit (included being able to stand unsupported and walk 10 metres, difficulty voluntarily initiating and controlling extension movements and also muscle grade 2/5 or less). It is possible that time after stroke and the degree of ability to voluntarily contract a muscle might affect response to electrostimulation. Another source of variation are the different conventional therapies used as comparator treatments in included trials which were: passive and active approaches to gait therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Bogataj-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bogataj 1995</LINK>); biofeedback (<LINK REF="STD-Cozean-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cozean 1988</LINK>); range of motion and strengthening exercises (<LINK REF="STD-Francisco-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco 1998</LINK>); and, Orthomercia Supra-Lite ankle-foot orthosis (<LINK REF="STD-Wright-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2004</LINK>). Yet another source of variation was provided by the different outcome measures which were not always possible to combine and resulted in some units of analysis containing data from one study only.</P>
<P>A further source of variation was the dose of electrostimulation which varied between included trials. It is possible that effectiveness might differ between different doses of electrostimulation. Which dose or doses might be more effective than others cannot be determined from this present review especially as it was unclear from the included trials whether dose of therapy was based on experimental studies of efficacy. This flaw in experimental design has also been highlighted by others (<LINK REF="REF-Alon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alon 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methodological limitations in the quality of several of the included trials limit the ability of this review to reach firm conclusions about the effectiveness of electrostimulation. We detected the possibility that both selection bias and detection bias could have been present in the majority of included trials. We therefore recommend cautious interpretation of the findings of this present review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Whether or not electrostimulation should be used for neuromuscular re-training after stroke cannot be answered with the data available at present. Although data suggest some benefits for aspects of motor impairment and also for global ADL these results need to be interpreted with reference to the findings that most of these benefits occurred when electrostimulation was combined with conventional therapy and compared to conventional therapy. Intensity of treatment might therefore have influenced the findings. Cautious interpretation of these findings is also indicated by methodological flaws in the trials included in this present review including the apparent lack of an experimental basis for the dose of electrostimulation investigated. Further caution is suggested because the results of this review were mostly informed from data from single studies rather than two or more studies.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Electrostimulation is thought to be a beneficial intervention for neuromuscular re-training after stroke and yet robust data to inform its use are lacking. Trials are needed which investigate well defined types of electrostimulation which have biological plausibility and are delivered in doses shown in experimental Phase I studies to be efficacious in enhancing the recovery of motor impairment, functional motor ability and/or ADL. Before undertaking such Phase I studies a logical first step is to undertake a systematic review (without meta-analysis) of investigative studies of electrostimulation (Phase I, II and III) to find whether there is preliminary evidence of efficacy for any dose of the 16 types of electrostimulation described in this review (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Where preliminary evidence to inform Phase III studies is lacking then it would be advisable to undertake Phase I studies of different types of electrostimulation to determine which dose might be most efficacious with least adverse effects for which groups of stroke survivors.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Design: A randomised crossover trial (in this review we only extracted data from baseline to crossover point). Randomisation: 'randomly assigned'.<BR/>Dropouts: None reported.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>20 inpatients recruited, all were right-side dominant.<BR/>Experimental: 5 male &amp; 5 female, 2 left hemiplegia &amp; 8 right hemiplegia, mean age 53.4 years (SD 11.5), mean time after stroke 116 days (SD 66).<BR/>Control: 6 male &amp; 4 female, 9 left hemiplegia &amp; 1 right hemiplegia, mean age 59.1 years (SD 9), time after stroke 104 days (SD 62).<BR/>Study criteria: (1) could stand independently or with aid of one or two therapists; (2) muscle contraction with indicated movement in the corresponding joint obtained by functional electrical stimulation for each muscle treated; (3) exertion during therapy would not adversely affect participant's health; (4) preserved perceptual and intellectual abilities; (5) no suspected or confirmed cardiovascular infarction or demand pacemaker; (6) no extreme reflex activity; (7) no hypersensitivity; (8) no pain; (9) no lower motor neurone lesion; (10) no changes to skin in area of stimulation; (11) no changes in bone-joint structures; (12) agreed to application of functional electrical stimulation.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Duration: 3 weeks<BR/>Experimental:<BR/>Category = 5.<BR/>Multichannel functional electrical stimulation therapy given for 30 to 60 minutes per session (including application of electrodes), once a day, 5 times a week for 3 weeks. Amplitudes of the stimulating pulses set to 80% of amplitude which produced non-volitional movement in joint. Stimulation sequence was determined for each participant so that optimum correction of anomalies was achieved. During stimulation gait could be facilitated by a therapist and a crutch could be used. Electrodes were applied to peroneal nerve, soleus, hamstrings, quadriceps femoris group, gluteus maximus and, optionally, to triceps brachii.<BR/>Control: Conventional gait therapy consisting of a 'passive and active approach'. The emphasis was on the active approach which consisted of Bobath techniques, PNF, visual biofeedback, audiovisual biofeedback, gait training and use of orthoses. The passive approach included icing, heating, brushing, positioning and use of a tilt table. Therapy was provided once a day, 5 times a week for 3 weeks.<BR/>Comparison: Electrostimulation vs conventional.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Baseline measurement: beginning of therapy period.<BR/>Outcome measurement: End of therapy period i.e. 3 weeks.<BR/>Included outcomes: (1) stride length; (2) gait velocity; (3) cadence; (4) Fugl-Meyer Assessment.<BR/>Other outcomes: (1) vertical ground reaction force during stance phase; (2) trajectory of centre of pressure under each foot in stance phase.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>The type of electrode used was changed at some point during the study and this may be a confounding factor.</P>
<P>Excluded patients who refused application of functional electrical stimulation.</P>
<P>Some weight shifting was facilitated by a therapist accompanying experimental participants walking with electrostimulation applied. This replicates some of the conventional therapy provided to the control group but it appears that this was minimal. However, this could be a confounding factor affecting interpretation of the results of this trial. </P>
<P>Some missing data in experimental group.</P>

<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>One of the study criteria excluded potential participants who had no observed improvement in walking with stimulation.</P>
<P>The co-intervention for the experimental group was not identical to that provided for the control group as it included adjusting the stimulation parameters for best dorsiflexion effect and not just provision of conventional physical therapy.</P>
<P>We excluded the outcome comparison of the experimental group walking with electrostimulation and control group walking without stimulation but included the outcome comparison of the experimental group walking without electrostimulation and control group walking without stimulation. This decision was taken to match the measurement conditions of the experimental and control group as it remains a possibility that the walking ability of the control group might have been better with electrostimulation than it was without it.</P>

<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>In addition to electrostimulation the two experimental groups received either random practice or blocked practice of movement, whereas the no-stimulation control group received passive movement and attempted voluntary movement. It is therefore not possible to isolate the effects of electrostimulation in either of the experimental groups as the additional therapy received was not replicated in the control group.</P>
