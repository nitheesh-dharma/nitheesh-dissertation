<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-22 17:13:17 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane researchers reviewed the evidence on the effects of two drugs that artificially reproduce the hormones needed for foetal conception: recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin (rhCG) and recombinant human luteinising hormone (rhLH), comparing them to urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (uhCG) for subfertile couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>For the last few decades, uhCG has been used to trigger final oocyte maturation in IVF and ICSI cycles. Recombinant technology has allowed the production of two drugs that can be used for the same purpose, to mimic the natural surge of luteinising hormone (LH). This allows commercial manufacturers to adjust production to market requirements and remove all urinary contaminants, facilitating patient safety during drug administration and standardisation of drug batches. However, prior to a change in practice, it is necessary to compare the effectiveness of the recombinant drugs to the currently used uhCG. The primary review outcomes were live birth or ongoing pregnancy, as well as incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found 18 studies in 2952 women undergoing IVF or ICSI. Fifteen trials in 2473 women compared rhCG with uhCG, and three trials in 479 women compared rLH with uhCG.</P>
<P>Women in the studies were 18 to 45 years old, with regular menstrual cycles and no history of OHSS. Types of subfertility included tubal disease, endometriosis, unexplained infertility and male factor infertility.</P>
<P>Pharmaceutical companies funded 9 of the 18 studies; 4 studies were free of commercial funding, and the remaining 5 studies did not clearly report a funding source. The evidence is current to April 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between rhCG and uhCG or between RhLH and uhCG in rates of live birth/ongoing pregnancy or OHSS.</P>
<P>Studies did not report much evidence on adverse events other than OHSS, and the evidence they did report was inconclusive.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence </B>
</P>
<P>For the comparison 'rhCG versus uhCG', the evidence was of moderate quality for ongoing pregnancy/live birth rate and of low quality for incidence of OHSS. The main limitation of the evidence was lack of precision (i.e. study size was too small to rule out the role of chance). For the comparison 'rLH versus uhCG', the evidence was of very low quality for both ongoing pregnancy/live birth rate and incidence of OHSS. The main limitations of the evidence were lack of precision and poor reporting of study methods.</P>

<P>For the last few decades urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (uhCG) has been used to trigger final oocyte maturation in cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Recombinant technology has allowed the production of two drugs, recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin (rhCG) and recombinant luteinising hormone (rLH), that can be used for the same purpose, to mimic the endogenous luteinising hormone (LH) surge. This allows commercial manufacturers to adjust production according to market requirements and to remove all urinary contaminants, facilitating the safe subcutaneous administration of a compound with less batch-to-batch variation.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-21 12:13:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (April 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1946 to April 2015), EMBASE (1980 to April 2015) and PsycINFO (1806 to April 2015) as well as trial registers at ClinicalTrials.gov on 13 May 2015 and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) search portal on 14 May 2015.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-04-22 17:13:42 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Two review authors independently scanned titles and abstracts and selected those that appeared relevant for collection of the full paper.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-04-19 19:13:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently performed assessment for inclusion or exclusion, quality assessment and data extraction. We discussed any discrepancies in the presence of a third author to reach a consensus. The primary review outcomes were ongoing pregnancy/live birth and incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Clinical pregnancy, miscarriage rate, number of oocytes retrieved and adverse events were secondary outcomes. We combined data to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic. We evaluated the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-22 17:13:25 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We included 18 RCTs involving 2952 participants; 15 compared rhCG with uhCG, and 3 compared rhLH with uhCG. The evidence for different comparisons ranged from very low to high quality: limitations were poor reporting of study methods and imprecision. Pharmaceutical companies funded 9 of the 18 studies, and 5 studies did not clearly report funding source.</P>
<P>
<B>Ongoing pregnancy/live birth</B>
</P>
<P>There was no conclusive evidence of a difference between rhCG and uhCG (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.49; 7 RCTs, N = 1136, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, moderate quality evidence) or between rhLH and uhCG (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.78, 2 RCTs, N = 289, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, very low quality evidence) for ongoing pregnancy/live birth rates.</P>
<P>
<B>OHSS</B>
</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between rhCG and uhCG in the incidence of OHSS: moderate to severe OHSS (OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.37 to 8.45; 3 RCTs, N = 417, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low quality evidence), moderate OHSS (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.27; 1 RCT, N = 243, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low quality evidence), mild to moderate OHSS (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.38; 2 RCTs, N = 320, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low quality evidence) or undefined OHSS (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.78; 3 RCTs, N = 495, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low quality evidence). Likewise, there was no evidence of a difference between rhLH and uhCG in OHSS rates for moderate OHSS (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.69, 2 RCTs, N = 280, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 5%, very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>Other adverse events</B>
</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference in miscarriage rates between rhCG and uhCG (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.25; 8 RCTs, N = 1196, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low quality evidence) or between rhLH and uhCG (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.40; 2 RCTs, N = 289, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, very low quality evidence). For other adverse effects (most commonly injection-site reactions) rhCG was associated with a lower number of adverse events than uhCG (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.76; 5 RCTS, N = 561; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%, moderate quality evidence). However, when we used a random-effects model due to substantial statistical heterogeneity, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.13). Only one study comparing rLH and uhCG reported other adverse events, and it was impossible to draw conclusions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-22 17:14:41 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-21 00:38:07 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A luteinising hormone (LH) surge is essential in the final stages of oocyte maturation and to trigger follicle rupture, which expels the oocyte from the follicle and precipitates its capture by the fallopian tube. In addition, the LH surge promotes luteinisation, or the formation of an active corpus luteum. These effects of LH are essential in order for conception to occur in both natural and IVF cycles.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-04-22 17:13:57 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>In assisted conception, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) from urine has traditionally been used to trigger final oocyte maturation. There are considerable structural similarities between hCG and human LH (hLH), and both hormones stimulate the same receptor (<LINK REF="REF-Fatemi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fatemi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leao 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pierce-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierce 1981</LINK>). HCG is readily available in the urine of pregnant women, whereas only low concentrations of LH are found in the urine of postmenopausal women.</P>
<P>Urinary preparations are, however, associated with a number of disadvantages that include being an uncontrolled source, lack of purity, and batch-to-batch variation in activity leading to variable clinical results (<LINK REF="REF-Leao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leao 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zegers_x002d_Hochschild-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zegers-Hochschild 1996</LINK>). In addition, administration of hCG leads to a higher and more prolonged biological signal than one induced by natural LH. Evidence suggests that this could be a possible contributing factor to the development of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Emperaire-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emperaire 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fatemi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fatemi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nastri-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nastri 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recombinant hCG (rhCG) and recombinant LH (rLH) preparations are derived from genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells through recombinant DNA technology. The production process begins after growth and expression of the cells from a well-characterised cell bank. The hCG is secreted into the culture medium and harvested over 30 days. The product is purified by repeated chromatographic steps to yield a product with a high specific activity. The high purity of this product facilitates characterisation and quantitation by physicochemical means, thus reducing the need for animal bioassays. This makes the drug suitable for subcutaneous injection and hence self administration (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fatemi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fatemi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leao 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pharmacokinetic profile of rhCG is comparable to that of uhCG with linearity over a dose range of 500 IU to 20,000 IU and a terminal elimination half life of approximately 30 h (<LINK REF="REF-Trinchard_x002d_Lugan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trinchard-Lugan 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Moderate or severe OHSS affects about 3% to 10% of all ART cycles (<LINK REF="REF-Nastri-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nastri 2015</LINK>). OHSS is characterised by growth of multiple, large follicles with a massive extravascular protein rich fluid shift. This may cause serious complications related to hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, oliguria, and electrolyte disturbance (<LINK REF="REF-Aboulghar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboulghar 1998</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-04-22 17:14:41 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>In assisted conception, both urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and recombinant preparations trigger final oocyte maturation by mimicking the endogenous LH surge by reinitiating and completing the first meiotic division from the germinal vesicle stage (prophase) to metaphase II, prompting an accompanying cytoplasmic maturation for fertilisation and early embryonic development (<LINK REF="REF-Cha-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cha 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two review authors (MY, WSL) were responsible for selecting studies, and a third author (MA or HA) helped to resolve disagreements. We first reviewed the titles and abstracts of studies using pre-specified criteria for inclusion. We obtained the full texts of studies for the records considered potentially eligible for inclusion. We contacted authors when papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelmassih-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelmassih 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farrag-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Farrag 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kovacs-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kovacs 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manau-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Manau 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Study-21447" TYPE="STUDY">Study 21447</LINK>).

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-04-19 20:42:47 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We developed and piloted a standardised data extraction form for consistency and completeness. Two review authors (MY, WSL) independently extracted data and then compared the two sets of extracted data in order to resolve discrepancies. Where studies had multiple publications, we collated reports of the same study, so that each study rather than each report was the unit of interest in the review. These studies have a single study ID with multiple references. When required, we requested additional information about the methodological quality of studies from study authors. We received some data about methodology and clinical outcomes from the authors of the following studies: <LINK REF="STD-Kovacs-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kovacs 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Madani-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Manau-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Manau 2002</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Study-21447" TYPE="STUDY">Study 21447</LINK>.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-04-21 13:00:10 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Two review authors (MY, WSL) independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool assessed: allocation (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective reporting; and other bias. We assigned a 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' risk to each domain and for every study. Below, we discuss the conditions necessary to merit a low risk assessment; when studies reported methods that differed meaningfully from these criteria, we assigned a high risk for that domain. When studies did not describe their methods in enough detail to permit a judgement, we assigned an unclear risk. We resolved disagreements by discussion and, when necessary, by arbitration from a third review author. We described all judgements fully and have presented the conclusions in the 'Risk of bias' table (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).The risks of bias were incorporated into the interpretation of the review findings by means of sensitivity analyses (<LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sequence generation</HEADING>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective outcome reporting</HEADING>
<P>We assessed within-trial selective reporting, for example trials failing to report obvious outcomes, or reporting them in insufficient detail to allow inclusion. We sought published protocols and compared outcomes of the protocol with the final published study. Where identified studies failed to report the primary outcome of live birth, but reported interim outcomes such as pregnancy, we informally assessed whether the interim values (e.g. pregnancy rates) were similar to those reported in studies that also reported live birth, as a discrepancy might be indicative of selective outcome reporting.</P>
<P>We allocated a low risk of bias if the study pre-specified all primary, secondary, and additional outcomes of interest to the review. We considered that reporting fewer outcome measures than planned to be a source of bias.</P>

<P>In view of the difficulty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, the authors aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data.

<P>In the graphical display of the meta-analyses, we considered rhCG to be the experimental treatment. An increase in the odds of an outcome with rhCG is displayed graphically to the right of the centre line. For an outcome such as pregnancy, an increase in odds is considered a benefit of the intervention, thus a benefit would be displayed to the right of the centre line. For an outcome such as OHSS, an increase in the odds is a detrimental effect of the intervention, and this is also displayed to the right of the centre line.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All trials included healthy female partners from subfertile couples, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria were very similar. The main common inclusion criteria were: aged 18 to 45 years, regular menstrual cycles ranging from 24 to 35 days, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &lt; 12 IU/L during the early follicular phase, and no prior history of OHSS. All trials involved IVF and ICSI cycles (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>The categories of infertility usually included tubal disease, endometriosis, unexplained infertility and male factor infertility.</P>
<P>One study included donor women (<LINK REF="STD-Vidal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vidal 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heterogeneity could stem from differences between the studies in ICSI use, means of GnRH agonist administration (nasal or by injection), and reason for infertility. However, subgroup analysis comparing the outcomes within the various categories of subfertility was not possible because sufficiently detailed data were not available.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>All trials performed pituitary down regulation using a long protocol of GnRH agonist administration, except <LINK REF="STD-Papanikolaou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Papanikolaou 2010</LINK>, which used a GnRH antagonist protocol. GnRH agonist was started in the mid-luteal phase (cycle day 21 to 24) by either daily intranasal or subcutaneous administration, except in <LINK REF="STD-Madani-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Madani 2013</LINK> where GnRH agonist was started on cycle day 17 to 19. Ovarian stimulation was started after two weeks if pituitary down regulation was established (serum estradiol level &lt; 50 pg/mL). Both treatment groups started ovarian stimulation with a daily dose of 75 to 450 IU recombinant FSH (follitrophin alpha, or Gonal-f Serono) or highly purified FSH for the first five stimulation days. Thereafter, physicians adapted the dose of gonadotrophin to the ovarian response as monitored via ultrasonography.</P>

<P>We assigned a low risk of bias for sequence generation to 11 trials that used a computer-generated randomisation list to allocate participants (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelmassih-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelmassih 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bellavia-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bellavia 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eftekhar-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Eftekhar 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ERHCG-Group-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ERHCG Group 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ERLH-Group-2001" TYPE="STUDY">ERLH Group 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farrag-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Farrag 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manau-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Manau 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papanikolaou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Papanikolaou 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Study-21447" TYPE="STUDY">Study 21447</LINK>).

In three trials the participants were randomised, but authors did not report the method of randomisation and so were at unclear risk of this bias (<LINK REF="STD-Goswami-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goswami 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jie 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoolcraft-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schoolcraft 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment refers to whether the randomisation sequence was adequately concealed from participants, operators and investigators until interventions were assigned. Among the 11 trials that used a central computer to generate randomisation, allocation concealment appeared to be adequate in 5 (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ERLH-Group-2001" TYPE="STUDY">ERLH Group 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manau-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Manau 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Study-21447" TYPE="STUDY">Study 21447</LINK>). We detected a high risk of selection bias related to concealment in <LINK REF="STD-Papanikolaou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Papanikolaou 2010</LINK> since there was no concealment. In the remaining trials there was not enough information to determine whether allocation concealment was adequate, hence they were at unclear risk of bias.</P>

Nine participants did not receive rhLH or uhCG treatment: one was discontinued before starting rhFSH treatment because she was found to be pregnant, five presented a risk of OHSS, and three failed to develop a follicle with a mean diameter of at least 17 mm. These participants were equally distributed over the different rhLH groups as well as over the control groups.

The most common reason for not receiving hCG was poor response to ovarian stimulation (four rhCG; two uhCG).

There was no evidence of a difference between the groups: over the trial, 158 events occurred in 71 women treated with rhLH (55%) and 171 events in 77 women treated with uhCG (63.6%) (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.19; <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three serious adverse events (excluding OHSS) requiring hospitalisation occurred in the uhCG treatment group: back pain, missed abortion and an ectopic pregnancy. In the rhLH group, six women experienced serious adverse events requiring hospitalisation: retention of foetal placenta, abdominal pain, suspected ovarian torsion, diarrhoea (two women), and pre-eclampsia.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-22 17:17:03 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>In subfertile women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, the use of human chorionic gonadotrophins to trigger final oocyte maturation is well established. Urinary hCG (uhCG) has been used for more than 30 years, but recombinant technology allows for the production of recombinant hCG with high purity and batch-to-batch consistency.</P>
<P>This updated review includes 18 randomised controlled trials involving 2952 women.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between rhCG and uhCG regarding the ongoing pregnancy/live birth rate (moderate quality evidence), clinical pregnancy rate (high quality evidence), miscarriage (low quality evidence), or incidence of OHSS (low quality evidence); rhCG was associated with an increase in the number of retrieved oocytes (high quality evidence) and a reduction in the incidence of local site reactions and other minor adverse effects (moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between rLH and uhCG regarding ongoing pregnancy/live birth rates (very low quality evidence), clinical pregnancy rate (very low quality evidence), miscarriages (very low quality evidence), incidence of OHSS (very low quality evidence) or number of retrieved oocytes (very low quality evidence).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-04-21 14:15:38 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>All trials recruited relevant participants (i.e. healthy female partners from subfertile couples) using similar inclusion and exclusion criteria, and all studies involved IVF and ICSI cycles. Only one study included donor women (<LINK REF="STD-Vidal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vidal 2005</LINK>). All studies utilised relevant interventions: 14 trials used recombinant hCG, and 3 trials used recombinant LH. All 18 studies used urinary hCG. One study performed the analysis per cycle, and we could not obtain per woman data to enter into meta-analysis (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=653501070611140317&amp;versionPK1=z1603291302524007912829348070312&amp;versionPK2=z1604180735337180464953383425775#STD-Borges-2004">Borges 2004</A>). For another unpublished study, we had no data to analyse (<LINK REF="STD-Study-21447" TYPE="STUDY">Study 21447</LINK>). Although we were able to analyse 16 studies comparing rhCG or rhLH versus uhCG, only 3 studies reported the primary outcome (live birth rate). However, data on the ongoing pregnancy rate were available for six trials providing additional evidence. Ten studies reported OHSS, also providing adequate evidence.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Abdelmassih-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelmassih 2005</LINK> reported the mean number of retrieved oocytes, but standard deviations were not available, so those data were not usable for the review. According to the study, there was no evidence of a difference in the mean number of retrieved oocytes between the groups (250 &#956;g rhCG = 15.6 versus 10,000 IU uhCG = 17.3, P &gt; 0.355). <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2001</LINK> reported adverse events, but the data were not usable since the number of women analysed included women before randomisation, and the data given in percentages might include women who suffered from more than one adverse event.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-22 17:17:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>The present systematic review update included seven randomised controlled trials with more or less similar inclusion and exclusion criteria, design and methodology. All were at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one of the domains assessed (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Only 13 of the studies clearly reported using a proper method of random sequence generation, and only 6 trials out of these 13 described use of adequate allocation concealment. Only eight studies were blinded, and only two of these eight were at low risk of performance and detection bias due to proper methods of blinding. Just 6 trials performed sample size calculations, and the analysis was not by intention-to-treat in 12 of the included studies. Moreover, there were available data on the live birth rate in three studies only. Outcomes were reported in a pre-specified manner in 14 studies. Nine trials had received commercial support from pharmaceutical companies.</P>
<P>The patient profiles in the trials included in this systematic review were relatively similar, and the IVF and ICSI procedures used were standard. Moreover, there was no difference in the type of gonadotrophin preparation administered. These factors have eliminated heterogeneity to a large extent, as seen in the graphs.</P>
<P>None of the individual trials demonstrated evidence of a difference in clinical outcomes between recombinant and urinary hCG, especially live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate and OHSS incidence, apart from <LINK REF="STD-Papanikolaou-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Papanikolaou 2010</LINK>, which suggested a better delivery rate in favour of rhCG. However, the authors admitted that adequately powered randomised controlled trials need to confirm whether this difference is true. Pooling the results of these trials showed similar outcomes, except that rhCG was associated with more retrieved oocytes (high quality evidence), and local injection site adverse effects were significantly less frequent with rhCG than with uhCG (moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>We assessed quality of the evidence for all outcomes for the comparison 'rhCG versus uhCG'. The main limitation we found was imprecision. For ongoing pregnancy/live birth rate, evidence was of moderate quality since the 95% confidence interval around the pooled effect included both the line of no effect and line of appreciable benefit (relative risk reduction (RRR) &gt; 25%). Thus, further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. For incidence of OHSS, evidence was of low quality since the total number of events was less than 300 and the 95% confidence interval around the pooled effect included both the line of no effect and line of appreciable benefit (RRR &gt; 25%) and harm (relative risk increase (RRI) &gt; 25%). Thus, further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Evidence for clinical pregnancy rate and number of oocytes retrieved was of high quality since generally there was no risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision or publication bias identified. Hence, further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Evidence for miscarriage rate was of low quality since the 95% confidence interval around the pooled effect included both the line of no effect and line of appreciable benefit (RRR &gt; 25%), and the total number of events was less than 300. Thus, further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Evidence of adverse events was of moderate quality since there were less than 300 total events. Therefore, further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</P>
<P>We assessed quality of the evidence for all outcomes for the comparison 'rLH versus uhCG'. The main limitations found were poor reporting of study methods leading to risk of bias and imprecision. Evidence for all outcomes was of very low quality, mainly because there were too few studies. Thus we are very uncertain about the estimates. For all outcomes, we downgraded quality of evidence by two points due to the total number of events being less than 300, and one of the two included studies did not provide information about methods of randomisation, allocation concealment, or blinding. For ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and incidence of OHSS, the pooled effect included both the line of no effect and appreciable benefit and harm. For the clinical pregnancy rate, the pooled effect included both the line of no effect and appreciable harm. For number of oocytes retrieved, the total population size was less than 400, and the pooled effect included both the line of no effect and minimal important difference (0.5 pooled standard deviation).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-04-21 13:51:54 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>There has been extensive research on the efficacy of rhCG and uhCG in IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Inany-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Inany 2005</LINK>). Overall, we did not find any differences in these studies between the two drugs with regard to the number of oocytes retrieved and the pregnancy rate. Moreover, the dose of 250 g rhCG has been shown to provide the optimal dose for final follicular maturation in treatment cycles for IVF/ICSI (<LINK REF="STD-Ludwig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ludwig 2003</LINK>). Results of one trial showed that increasing the dose of recombinant hCG (single 500 g dose of rhCG) may lead to a higher rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome compared with a 250 g dose (this difference was not statistically significant, perhaps due to small sample size, but trial authors interpreted it as being clinically important) with no significant improvement in pregnancy rate. Accordingly, based on efficacy and safety data, the dose of 250 g of rhCG seems to provide the optimal dose for final follicular maturation in treatment cycles for timed intercourse and intrauterine insemination (IUI), as well as IVF and ICSI.</P>
<P>Results of the two trials comparing rhLH and uhCG showed evidence of a difference in clinical outcomes. Due to the results of the unpublished trial (<LINK REF="STD-Study-21447" TYPE="STUDY">Study 21447</LINK>), Serono (the pharmaceutical company producing rhLH) has decided not to register high dose recombinant LH for clinical use. The results of this trial demonstrated to the company that to prevent OHSS, the dose of recombinant drug needed to be increased to a level that resulted in a decrease in the pregnancy rate.</P>
<P>Our results are in agreement with other reviews. The first review included three trials that met the inclusion criteria and involved 460 randomised women (235 allocated to recombinant hCG and 225 to urinary hCG) (<LINK REF="STD-Daya-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Daya 2002</LINK>). There was no significant heterogeneity of treatment effect across the trials. The primary outcome event of interest was single pregnancy confirmed by ultrasonography. Secondary outcomes were rates of live birth and multiple pregnancy. The overall pregnancy rates were also calculated by crudely aggregating the data. The pooled results on live birth rate were 26.0% (61/235) versus 23.6% (53/225). Another review included three trials and randomised 447 enrolled women (<LINK REF="STD-Ludwig-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ludwig 2003</LINK>). It concluded that a single 250 g dose of rhCG was at least as effective as single doses of 5000 or 10,000 IU uhCG but offered the advantages associated with use of a recombinant product; local injection site adverse effects were significantly less with rhCG than with uhCG.</P>
<P>Recently, a large retrospective study has been published (<LINK REF="STD-Sneeringer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sneeringer 2008</LINK>). The study enrolled 9328 assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles and compared the efficacy of rhCG versus uhCG in triggering final oocyte maturation. The total number of oocytes retrieved (10.4  6.7 versus 9.8  6.2), metaphase II oocytes (83.5% versus 82.9%) and 2PN (6.1  4.7 versus 5.8  4.2) and a higher implantation rate (21.3% versus 19.6%) showed statistical differences in favour of rhCG; however, an equivalent clinical pregnancy rate was achieved in both groups.</P>

<P>Although rhCG and rLH as the final oocyte maturation trigger do not seem to be better than uhCG on reproductive outcomes of IVF or ICSI cycles, further large randomised studies need to evaluate their use for other indications, such asin vitro maturation in patients at high risk of OHSS, in combination with FSH as an exogenous source for LH in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, or for luteal phase support in GnRH antagonist-GnRH agonist triggered cycles.</P>
<P>In addition, most studies included in this review compared uhCG with rhCG or rhLH in GnRH agonist down regulated cycles. More studies may be needed to evaluate them in GnRH antagonist cycles.</P>

Following treatment with rFSH, 190 women received hCG (97, rhCG; 93, uhCG) ('all participants population'). 15 participants did not receive hCG.

<P>All subjects underwent pituitary down regulation per each centre's normal practice prior to and during stimulation of multiple follicular development. The subjects were randomised into 2 groups. 1 group received rhCG 250 g and the other group received urinary hCG (Profasi) 10,000 IU. Each subject in both groups received a single injection of hCG when the follicular development was judged to be adequate. Oocytes were retrieved 36-38 h after the hCG injection and fertilised in vitro. Not more than 3 embryos or 2 blastocysts were to be replaced. Progesterone was administered daily according to centre's normal practice, starting after the oocyte pick up and continuing until a negative pregnancy test or for the first 3 weeks of pregnancy if the subject was pregnant. The subject was followed up and the treatment outcome (negative pregnancy test or pregnancy) was recorded.</P>
