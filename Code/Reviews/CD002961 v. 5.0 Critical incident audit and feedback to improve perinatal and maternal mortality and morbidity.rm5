<P>Recording the number and the causes of deaths of pregnant women and babies is essential health information to identify problem areas. Effective management of the health of a population is dependent on basic statistics that allow for the identification of problem areas. Recording the number and causes of deaths of pregnant women and babies falls into this category and is essential. No randomised controlled trials were identified; therefore, the depth of examination of these deaths and the methods of feeding back that information to health workers to obtain the most beneficial effect is not known.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The necessity of recording the number and cause of deaths is not in question. Mortality rates are essential in identifying problems within the healthcare system. Maternal and perinatal death reviews should continue to be held, until further information is available. The evidence from serial data clearly suggests more benefit than harm.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-12 13:06:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-01-12 13:02:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 (reducing the under-five year mortality rate by two-thirds) and 5 (reducing the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters by 2015 with 1990 as baseline) has been slow and many countries are unlikely to reach these targets. With regard to MDG 4, the major contributor now to under-five year child mortality is neonatal death.  The major causes of this are intrapartum asphyxia and prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2009</LINK>). The major causes of maternal death are postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, obstructed labour and puerperal sepsis and unsafe abortions (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>). Effective interventions are available to prevent most of these maternal and neonatal deaths. The problem lies more in the ability of the health system to manage these conditions than to lack of understanding and knowledge on how to prevent these deaths.  Sixty-eight low- and middle-income countries are responsible for 98% of maternal and neonatal deaths. If progress is to be made, these countries must be targeted (<LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>To design local solutions, local data are required.  Maternal and perinatal death reviews are potentially a simple cost effective way of defining the local problems and pointing the way to local solutions. In a recent review of perinatal audit, a meta-analysis of seven before-and-after studies in low- and middle-income countries indicated a reduction in perinatal mortality of 30% (95% confidence interval, 21% to 38%) after introduction of perinatal audit. This finding is, however, subject to potential publication bias as no audits were included that did not have a positive outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Pattinson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pattinson 2009</LINK>). Local information will also help identify gaps in management where inexpensive effective interventions are available and might be introduced, if not already in place (<LINK REF="REF-Tsu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsu 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-11-23 11:22:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen J Milan">
<P>Audit is defined in The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1993</LINK>) as 'a methodical and detailed review'. Audit of maternal and perinatal mortality can be performed at a number of different levels. It can take the form of simply recording the number of deaths in an area. Secondly, the causes of death can be categorised. Thirdly, potential avoidable factors (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1995</LINK>) or suboptimal care can be recorded. Hence, there are three levels of audit, each adding to the depth of the audit.</P>
<P>Audit and feedback is commonly used as a strategy to change health professionals' care of women. The audit process is used to identify modifiable behaviours of clinicians, such as lack of knowledge. The Cochrane systematic review by Jamtvedt et al (<LINK REF="REF-Jamtvedt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamtvedt 2006</LINK>) concludes that audit and feedback can indeed sometimes be effective in improving the practice of healthcare professionals.</P>
<P>The best known maternal mortality audit is the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-CE-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CE 1998</LINK>). The system of publishing triennial reports has functioned since 1953 and has been associated with a dramatic fall in maternal mortality rates in the UK. The reports combine a description of maternal mortality ratios, causes of maternal deaths and uses short cases to illustrate problems. There is also a discussion on suboptimal care and recommendations to reduce suboptimal care. It is assumed that the fall has been partly as a result of this audit system. A new confidential enquiry system has been launched into perinatal deaths in the UK, also in the belief that this audit and feedback is an effective means of reducing the perinatal mortality rate.</P>
<P>However, there might be adverse effects of this system. The collection of data and the holding of perinatal and maternal mortality meetings all take time. The meetings also have the potential to create conflict within a department, between departments, or between hospitals and health districts and this can be counter-productive.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-01-12 13:06:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Most academic departments and many non-academic departments of obstetrics and gynaecology collect data on perinatal and maternal mortality, often as a requirement by their hospitals or Departments of Health. These data may be collated and presented as a report by higher authorities, but may not be fed back to the original institution. Some obstetric and gynaecological departments go further and hold regular meetings as a method of feedback to their staff. These meetings would usually give the weekly/monthly departmental statistics (for example, number of births, deaths, caesarean sections) and a presentation of some cases (for example, maternal deaths, perinatal deaths and cases of severe morbidity). The cases are used to illustrate problems in care. The assumption is widely held that by identifying the areas of suboptimal care the clinicians will 'self-correct' and alter their behaviour to avoid making the same mistake again. This view is widely held but is only an assumption. The veracity of this assumption may lie at the heart of the effect or otherwise of audit and feedback. However, other factors such as the problems within the structure of the health system might make it impossible to change behaviour (for example, shortage of staff or equipment), and no change will be observed. It is commonly stated that there should be such meetings weekly or monthly in every site where deliveries occur and that all the deaths should be audited and discussed. It is believed that, by auditing the deaths, the perinatal and maternal mortality rates will decrease (<LINK REF="REF-Lilford-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lilford 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pattinson-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pattinson 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 1991</LINK>). These meetings are often used as opportunities for continuing medical education and the discussions take place around a specific case discussion of a death. Thus, the audit in this context takes place with a form of feedback, but not necessarily to key individuals or institutions who were involved in the care of the women, for example, general practitioners, administrators or people in-charge of human resources and municipal clinics. The key point of all these endeavours is to effect an improvement in the quality of care.</P>
<P>Feedback can therefore take a number of forms. This can be in the form of a general meeting and case discussions, a face-to-face meeting between individuals, a formal published report or by making use of new technologies such as telemedicine, among many others. These may have differing impacts on those receiving the feedback. The effectiveness of audit and feedback with respect to improving the quality of care probably relates more to the methods of feedback than the process of auditing the data.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-11-23 11:23:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen J Milan">
<P>This systematic review aims to review the evidence about whether or not perinatal and maternal mortality audits are effective in decreasing the mortality rates, and furthermore whether it is justified to advise that perinatal and maternal mortality audits become an integral part of the functioning of every maternal unit. It also aims to assess which are the most effective methods of providing feedback.</P>
<P>There are several problems in approaching these questions. The first is the ability to measure an effect. In high-income countries, the perinatal mortality rate is low; thus, the ability to detect change is severely limited because such large numbers are required in studies to show a significant difference. Lack of change might reflect the effect of the low perinatal mortality rate rather than lack of effect of audit and feedback. Perhaps measures of severe morbidity would be of more value here. In low- and middle-income countries, where mortality rates are high, effects on mortality rates might be seen.</P>
<P>The second problem is that to test the effect of audit and feedback versus no audit and feedback is problematic, as the very act of collecting the data is an intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Roethlisberger-1946" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roethlisberger 1946</LINK>). One immediate effect of introducing audits is more thorough data collection and thus more complete data than retrospective studies. Thus, more deaths might be recorded. This might lead to the conclusion that audit and feedback is not effective.</P>
<P>The third problem relates to the permanence of the effect, if it does occur. Does it wear off in time? Do the staff get bored with audit and feedback, and any positive effect regress? Are the effects of audit related to the personality of the person performing the audit and feedback? The fact that a publication has resulted might reflect that the effect of the audit is more a reflection of the drive of the person than the process itself. If the person leaves, what happens to the mortality rates?</P>
<P>Fourthly, does the ability of the group where audit and feedback have occurred and the outcome improved, reach a local ceiling? This might be a mortality rate above that which would normally be accepted but reflect what the group can locally achieve and the lack of further improvement due to barriers out of the control of the group.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-01-12 13:19:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>The core question in this review is whether critical incident audit and feedback is effective in reducing the perinatal mortality rate, the maternal mortality ratio, and severe neonatal and maternal morbidity. There are no randomized trials that address this issue.</P>
<P>The first issue to discuss is the necessity or otherwise of having basic perinatal mortality rates and maternal mortality ratios. Without this basic information on the magnitude of the problem, no action will ever be taken. Hence, it is absolutely vital to have these mortality rates. No randomized trial is necessary to prove this.</P>
<P>Audit of maternal and perinatal mortality can be performed at a number of different levels depending on what data are collected. The data collected also determine what information can be given in feedback, and also the cost. It can take the form of simply recording the number of deaths in an area to having a system of confidential enquiries into all deaths. The detail into which the confidential enquiry goes can also determine the information available; for example, if a woman is transferred from one institution to another and the information from one institution is lacking, the conclusions drawn from the enquiry might differ considerably. Hence the completeness of information will to some extent determine the conclusions related to suboptimal care. Furthermore, data on deaths at home can only be obtained by verbal postmortems, which are notoriously difficult to conduct and interpret. The organisational structure and cost required for a detailed confidential enquiry is obviously much greater than that of the simple recording of deaths. The question is: what depth of data collection will provide the most benefit for the least cost?</P>
<P>Many countries report maternal mortality ratios and perinatal mortality rates as part of their official reports to their Departments of Health. These reports form part of the epidemiological surveys of the country. Clinicians working in the field often have no or little access to any information about these reports. The effect of these reports on reducing mortality is minimal. Official statistics for consecutive years from different countries indicate little change in maternal mortality ratios. For example, during the 10-year period between 1990 and 1999, maternal mortality ratios changed from 53 to 61 per 100,000 live births in Panama, 63 to 42 per 100,000 live births in Kyrgystan, 21 to 22 per 100,000 live births in Bulgaria and 24 to 49 per 100,000 live births in Latvia without any apparent decreasing pattern throughout the years (WHO systematic review of maternal mortality and morbidity).</P>
<P>Knowing the pathology behind the cause of deaths is equally as important as rates. It does not help to know that many perinatal deaths are occurring without knowing what is causing the deaths. There are various classification systems, but the two most commonly used are based on the defining the pathology that caused the death (Wiggelsworth classification) and the primary pathological cause that set events in motion that lead to the death of the women (Aberdeen classification). This additional information does not add much to the cost of a mortality review system.</P>
<P>The final, most difficult and most controversial form of this type of outcomes audit is determining the presence or absence of suboptimal care and thereby identifying modifiable factors. Fear of litigation and harming morale are the most commonly cited reason for not including any aspects of suboptimal care. The basic assumption behind this greater depth of audit is that suboptimal care is widespread and present in the general care of women and is not specific to a woman that has a poor outcome. Therefore, by examining a few specified cases, solutions to the inadequacies found will improve not only the quality of care of similar cases but also the care of other women in the service. By concentrating on solving these problems identified by analysing perinatal deaths, the care of all pregnant women will improve. This assumption only holds where the mortality rates are relatively high. In high-income countries, maternal mortality is rare and the events leading to the death are usually peculiar to that death. This is the driving force behind the analysis of maternal 'near misses' or severe acute maternal morbidity. The use of a few easily identifiable cases to diagnose problems within the healthcare system (like transport, staffing, inadequate knowledge and inadequate facilities) is attractive and supposedly cost-effective.</P>
<P>Another rarely considered aspect of detailed enquiries into adverse outcomes is the information that can be conveyed to the families involved. This information would be of great value in helping the families understand what happened.</P>
<P>Just providing serial mortality data as in country reports is not effective in reducing mortality unless it is coupled with a feedback mechanism that reaches the relevant people (as described above). The question is, given the necessity of obtaining information mortality rates and the causes thereof, are there effective methods of feeding back the information to reduce mortality and morbidity, and if so what are they?</P>
<P>The purported value of incorporating suboptimal care or modifiable factors has been demonstrated in before and after studies, or longitudinal studies, the best example being the UK Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths (<LINK REF="REF-CE-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CE 1998</LINK>). Following the first publication of the revised system Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths for England and Wales in 1957 covering the years of 1952 to 1954, a decreasing trend was observed in maternal mortality, with maternal mortality ratios dropping from 37 to 16 in the first 10-year period (1958 to 1967) (<LINK REF="REF-Mcfarlane-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mcfarlane 2000</LINK>). This system is dependent on there being pre-determined criteria for determining what suboptimal care is. There must be criteria against which suboptimal care can be evaluated. There were no randomized studies on the advantage or otherwise of including suboptimal care into any mortality audit system over collecting the number and causes of deaths.</P>
<P>In most institutions the institutional management requires that mortality audit be performed. Many hospitals have mortality and morbidity reviews. The effectiveness of these meetings is uncertain. There are multiple reports of before and after studies, indicating dramatic reductions in mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Biswas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biswas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maresh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maresh 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pattinson-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pattinson 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 1997</LINK>), but reports on sustainability are missing, as are its negative effects and costs. Mancey-Jones and Brugha (<LINK REF="REF-Mancey_x002d_Jones-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mancey-Jones 1997</LINK>) reported that perinatal mortality reviews mainly affect the intrapartum management of women. This is possibly because the feedback is directed to the clinicians directly involved. More intractable problems of perinatal deaths due to hypertension, perinatal infections such as syphilis where people from outside the institution are involved do not appear to be affected. A possible explanation is often feedback does not involve clinicians working outside the institution. There are various randomized studies that demonstrate the potential benefit of audit and feedback in other areas for changing practice (<LINK REF="REF-Jamtvedt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamtvedt 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The costs of perinatal and maternal death and morbidity review are not covered at all by the various studies.</P>
<P>The harmful effects are also largely ignored. The risk of litigation arising from a death review is not known, and only anecdotal evidence exists regarding the effects on interpersonal relationships and hospital morale.</P>
<P>Finally, the issue of mandatory publication of the institutions perinatal and maternal mortality and morbidity audits might be another stimulus for effecting an improvement in the quality of care. The effects of mandatory publication of results are unknown.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-01-05 16:04:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-01-05 16:04:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The necessity of recording the number and cause of deaths is not in question. Mortality rates are essential in identifying problems within the healthcare system. Maternal and perinatal death reviews should continue to be held, until further information is available. The evidence from serial data that are made available to health workers clearly suggests more benefit than harm. The value of recording of suboptimal care for improving care is unknown.</P>
<P>Feedback is essential in any audit system. The most effective mechanisms for this are unknown, but it must be directed at the relevant people.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Research must concentrate on determining whether incorporation of suboptimal care into audits provides more advantages than disadvantages; and testing the various methods of feedback to clinicians. The cost of the various systems must be also taken into account as well as the potential harmful effects. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>All review authors independently assessed for inclusion all potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We resolved disagreements through discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the validity of each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection bias (randomization and allocation concealment)</HEADING>
<P>We planned to assign a quality score for each trial, using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation: such as telephone randomization, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes;<BR/>(B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation: such as list or table used, sealed envelopes, or study does not report any concealment approach;<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation: such as open list of random number tables, use or case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We designed a form to extract data. This form includes 48 items distributed in five modules, three of which were relevant to this analysis. Modules were designed to collect information on (i) the general study level characteristics such as design, population, setting, (ii) prevalence/incidence of maternal morbid conditions, and (iii) quality assessment of morbidity reports. Reporting of definitions and identification of cases for morbidities were part of the quality assessment.</P>
<P>We planned for at least two review authors to extract the data using the agreed form. We planned to use the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) to double enter the data.</P>
<P>Had information been unclear regarding any of the above, we would have attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We planned to carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). We would have used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data if trials are sufficiently similar.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we planned to present results as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We did not assess heterogeneity since there were no studies to include in the meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomized trials</HEADING>
<P>If we had identified cluster-randomized trials, we would have incorporated them into the analysis using the methods described by Gates (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2005</LINK>).</P>
