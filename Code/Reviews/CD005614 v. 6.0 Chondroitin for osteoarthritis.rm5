<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-25 06:17:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted a review of the effects of chondroitin sulfate for people with osteoarthritis. We found 43 studies with 9,110 people after searching for studies up to November 2013. Majority were studies of knee osteoarthritis (few hand, one hip) ranging from 1 month to 3 years. Several studies were funded by makers of chondroitin.</P>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis:</B>
</P>
<P>- Chondroitin may improve pain slightly in the short-term (less than 6 months);</P>
<P>- Chondroitin improves knee pain by 20% in slightly more people;</P>
<P>- Chondroitin probably improves quality of life slightly as measured by Lequesne's index (combined measure of pain, function, and disability);</P>
<P>- Chondroitin has little or no difference in adverse and serious adverse events versus other agents; and</P>
<P>- Chondroitin slightly slows down the narrowing of joint space on X-rays of the affected joint.</P>
<P>We identified a lot of studies in which unsound methods were used to assess the effects of chondroitin. For some outcomes, there was not enough data. In some studies, whose methodological quality was better, chondroitin showed no improvement in pain and in physical function. Other analyses based on different methodological quality criteria reported improvement in pain and physical functionality when chondroitin was given.</P>
<P>
<B>What is osteoarthritis and what is chondroitin? </B>
</P>
<P>Osteoarthritis is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage, but this bone growth may make the situation worse. This can make the joint painful and unstable, which can affect physical function or ability to use the joint.</P>
<P>Chondroitin is an over-the-counter nutritional supplement made primarily of chondroitin sulfate. It is said to work by stopping the degradation of cartilage and restoring lost cartilage. It also contains sulfur-containing amino acids, which are essential building blocks for cartilage molecules in the human body.</P>
<P>
<B>What happens to people with osteoarthritis who take chondroitin?</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Pain level after 6 months (lower score is better)</B>
</P>
<P>- People who took chondroitin scored 10 points lower on 0 to 100 pain scale than those who took a placebo (10% absolute difference).</P>
<P>- People who took chondroitin rated their pain at 18 on a 0 to 100 scale.</P>
<P>- People who took placebo rated their pain at 28 on a 0 to 100 scale.</P>
<P>In studies longer than 6 months, we are uncertain whether pain is reduced more by chondroitin than placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>Reduction in knee pain by 20% (as measured by the WOMAC<SUP>1</SUP> Pain subscale)</B>
</P>
<P>- 6 more people out of 100 experienced improvement of 20% in their knee pain (6% absolute difference).</P>
<P>- 53 people out of 100 who took chondroitin experienced improvement in their knee pain compared to 47 people out of 100 who took placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>Lequesne&#8217;s index (a combination index of pain and physical function, indicating quality of life) after 6 months</B>
</P>
<P>- People who took chondroitin scored 2 points lower (better) on Lequesne's index (score range 0 to 24).</P>
<P>- People who took chondroitin scored 5 on a scale of 0 to 24 on Lequesne's index.</P>
<P>- People who took placebo scored 7 on a scale of 0 to 24 on Lequesne's index.</P>
<P>
<B>Radiographic outcome: reduction in minimum joint space width (mm) (smaller decrease in reduction in minimum joint space width is better) after 2 years</B>
</P>
<P>- People who took chondroitin had 0.18 mm less reduction in minimum joint space width than those who took placebo.</P>
<P>- People who took chondroitin had a reduction in minimum joint space width of 0.12 mm.</P>
<P>- People who took placebo had a reduction in minimum joint space width of 0.30 mm.</P>
<P>
<B>Serious adverse events</B>
</P>
<P>- 3 fewer of 100 people who took chondroitin experienced serious adverse events (such as a serious lung infection or tuberculosis).</P>
<P>- 3 of 100 people experienced a serious adverse event with chondroitin compared to 6 of 100 people who took placebo. </P>
<P> <B>People who dropped out of the studies for adverse events</B>
</P>
<P>- People who took chondroitin had no difference in the risk of dropping out of the studies for adverse events than those who took a placebo.This may have happened by chance.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-16 11:11:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Osteoarthritis, a common joint disorder, is one of the leading causes of disability. Chondroitin has emerged as a new treatment. Previous meta-analyses have shown contradictory results on the efficacy of chondroitin. This, in addition to the publication of more trials, necessitates a systematic review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-10-17 16:07:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the benefit and harm of oral chondroitin for treating osteoarthritis compared with placebo or a comparator oral medication including, but not limited to, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, opioids, and glucosamine or other "herbal" medications.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-10-17 15:38:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched seven databases up to November 2013, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Current Controlled Trials. We searched the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) websites for adverse effects. Trial registers were not searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-01-16 11:11:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials lasting longer than two weeks, studying adults with osteoarthritis in any joint, and comparing chondroitin with placebo, an active control such as NSAIDs, or other "herbal" supplements such as glucosamine.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-10-17 16:07:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently performed all title assessments, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-16 11:11:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forty-three randomized controlled trials including 4,962 participants treated with chondroitin and 4,148 participants given placebo or another control were included. The majority of trials were in knee OA, with few in hip and hand OA. Trial duration varied from 1 month to 3 years. Participants treated with chondroitin achieved statistically significantly and clinically meaningful better pain scores (0-100) in studies less than 6 months than those given placebo with an absolute risk difference of 10% lower (95% confidence interval (CI), 15% to 6% lower; number needed to treat (NNT) = 5 (95% CI, 3 to 8; n = 8 trials) (level of evidence, low; risk of bias, high); but there was high heterogeneity between the trials (T<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0.07; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 70%, which was not easily explained by differences in risk of bias or study sample size). In studies longer than 6 months, the absolute risk difference for pain was 9% lower (95% CI 18% lower to 0%); n = 6 trials; T<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0.18; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 83% ), again with low level of evidence.</P>
<P>For the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Minimal Clinically Important Improvement (WOMAC MCII Pain subscale) outcome, a reduction in knee pain by 20% was achieved by 53/100 in the chondroitin group versus 47/100 in the placebo group, an absolute risk difference of 6% (95% CI 1% to 11%), (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24; T<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0.00; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) (n = 2 trials, 1253 participants; level of evidence, high; risk of bias, low).</P>
<P>Differences in Lequesne's index (composite of pain,function and disability) statistically significantly favoured chondroitin as compared with placebo in studies under six months, with an absolute risk difference of 8% lower (95% CI 12% to 5% lower; T<SUP>2</SUP>= 0.78; n = 7 trials) (level of evidence, moderate; risk of bias, unclear), also clinically meaningful. Loss of minimum joint space width in the chondroitin group was statistically significantly less than in the placebo group, with a relative risk difference of 4.7% less (95% CI 1.6% to 7.8% less; n = 2 trials) (level of evidence, high; risk of bias, low). Chondroitin was associated with statistically significantly lower odds of serious adverse events compared with placebo with Peto odds ratio of 0.40 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.82; n = 6 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Chondroitin did not result in statistically significant numbers of adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events compared with placebo or another drug. Adverse events were reported in a limited fashion, with some studies providing data and others not.</P>
<P>Comparisons of chondroitin taken alone or in combination with glucosamine or another supplement showed a statistically significant reduction in pain (0-100) when compared with placebo or an active control, with an absolute risk difference of 10% lower (95% CI 14% to 5% lower); NNT = 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); T<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0.33; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 91%; n = 17 trials) (level of evidence, low). For physical function, chondroitin in combination with glucosamine or another supplement showed no statistically significant difference from placebo or an active control, with an absolute risk difference of 1% lower (95% CI 6% lower to 3% higher with T<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0.04; n = 5 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Differences in Lequesne's index statistically significantly favoured chondroitin as compared with placebo, with an absolute risk difference of 8% lower (95% CI, 12% to 4% lower; T<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0.12; n = 10 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Chondroitin in combination with glucosamine did not result in statistically significant differences in the numbers of adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, or in the numbers of serious adverse events compared with placebo or with an active control.</P>
<P>The beneficial effects of chondroitin in pain and Lequesne's index persisted when evidence was limited to studies with adequate blinding or studies that used appropriate intention to treat (ITT) analyses. These beneficial effects were uncertain when we limited data to studies with appropriate allocation concealment or a large study sample (&gt; 200) or to studies without pharmaceutical funding.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-25 05:42:23 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A review of randomized trials of mostly low quality reveals that chondroitin (alone or in combination with glucosamine) was better than placebo in improving pain in participants with osteoarthritis in short-term studies. The benefit was small to moderate with an 8 point greater improvement in pain (range 0 to 100) and a 2 point greater improvement in Lequesne's index (range 0 to 24), both likely clinically meaningful. These differences persisted in some sensitivity analyses and not others. Chondroitin had a lower risk of serious adverse events compared with control. More high-quality studies are needed to explore the role of chondroitin in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The combination of some efficacy and low risk associated with chondroitin may explain its popularity among patients as an over-the-counter supplement.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-11-04 13:02:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Osteoarthritis, the most common of all joint disorders, is one of the leading causes of disability in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Gabriel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabriel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peyron-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peyron 1992</LINK>). Pathologically, osteoarthritis is characterized by softening and degeneration of articular cartilage, formation of new bone at joint margins, and capsular fibrosis. Clinically, osteoarthritis manifests as joint pain, stiffness, deformity, and loss of function. Clinical and radiographic surveys have found that the prevalence of osteoarthritis increases with age, from 1% in people &lt; 30 years to 10% in those &lt; 40 years to more than 50% in individuals &gt; 60 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Felson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Saase-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Saase 1989</LINK>). Autopsy studies show cartilage changes in almost all people above 65 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Felson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1988</LINK>). Osteoarthritis is equally common in men and women between 45 and 55 years but is more common in women after 55 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1990</LINK>). Risk factors for osteoarthritis include obesity, joint dysplasia (abnormal anatomy of the joint due to abnormal growth), trauma, occupational activity, and family history, among others (<LINK REF="REF-Solomon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomon 2001</LINK>). Osteoarthritis is classified as primary or secondary based on the absence or presence of anteceding joint abnormality or injury. Primary osteoarthritis is further classified as generalized or localized to a joint area such as hand, knee, hip, spinal apophyseal joints (between spinal bones/vertebrae), and foot, or to other joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist, and ankle) (<LINK REF="REF-Solomon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomon 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-05-04 13:27:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment of osteoarthritis is primarily directed at relieving pain and improving functional status. Various treatment options are available for patients with osteoarthritis, including the following: (1) oral medications: analgesics such as acetaminophen, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioids (<LINK REF="REF-Cepeda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cepeda 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Towheed-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towheed 2006</LINK>); (2) local therapies (applied as gels or creams): topical NSAIDs and capsaicin; (3) intra-articular therapies: corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid injections (<LINK REF="REF-Bellamy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellamy 2006</LINK>); (4) nonpharmacologic methods: physical therapy, aerobic therapy, strengthening exercises, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, and wedged insoles (<LINK REF="REF-Fransen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fransen 2008</LINK>); and (5) surgical treatments: joint replacement and arthroscopic debridement of the affected joint (<LINK REF="REF-Laupattarakasem-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupattarakasem 2008</LINK>). However, frequent side effects, limited efficacy, and variable rates of success limit the use of many non-surgical treatments.</P>
<P>Over the past few years, various nutritional supplements, including chondroitin, glucosamine, avocado/soybean unsaponifiables, and diacerein, have emerged as new treatment options for osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Deal-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deal 1999</LINK>). These supplements are characterized by both slow onset of action over six to eight weeks and a carryover of effect for up to two months after withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Fajardo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fajardo 2005</LINK>). According to recent recommendations from the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism, drugs for treatment of osteoarthritis are classified as symptom-modifying or structure-modifying drugs, depending on their capacity to interfere with disease progression (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pendelton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pendelton 2000</LINK>). The current body of evidence suggests that chondroitin falls into the symptom-modifying category (i.e., chondroitin has a primary effect on improvement of pain and function), and glucosamine and diacerein into the structure-modifying category (<LINK REF="REF-Dougados-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dougados 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richy 2003</LINK>) (i.e., they have an effect on progression of arthritis, such as an effect on joint space narrowing as assessed by radiography of the involved joint).

<P>Chondroitin sulfate belongs to a family of heteropolysaccharides called <I>glycosaminoglycans,</I> or GAGs. Chondroitin sulfate is found in human cartilage, bone, cornea, skin, and arterial wall. Sources of chondroitin used in nutritional supplements include bovine trachea, pork byproducts, shark cartilage, and whale septum (<LINK REF="REF-Hendler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hendler 2001</LINK>). Proposed mechanisms of action include restoring the extracellular matrix of cartilage, preventing further cartilage degradation (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2001</LINK>), and overcoming a dietary deficiency of sulfur-containing amino acids, which are essential building blocks for cartilage extracellular matrix molecules (<LINK REF="REF-Cordoba-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cordoba 2003</LINK>). A large number of patients with osteoarthritis in the United States and around the world are already using chondroitin alone or in combination with glucosamine for relief of osteoarthritis-related joint pain. Both glucosamine and chondroitin are available over the counter as nutritional supplements, and combination therapy of glucosamine and chondroitin has been used, but it is unclear whether these two supplements produce an additive or a synergistic effect.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-05-01 09:23:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A meta-analysis of glucosamine and chondroitin for treatment of osteoarthritis published in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-McAlindon-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAlindon 2000a</LINK>) concluded that both supplements were effective for pain relief and functional outcomes with moderate to large effects, but quality issues and publication bias seemed to inflate the effect sizes. The Cochrane review of glucosamine for treating osteoarthritis concluded that studies using a non-Rotta preparation or adequate allocation concealment failed to show benefit in pain and function, while studies evaluating the Rotta preparation showed that glucosamine was superior to placebo in the treatment of pain and functional impairment resulting from symptomatic osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Towheed-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towheed 2005</LINK>). Meta-analyses of chondroitin for osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Leeb-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leeb 2000</LINK>) and glucosamine and chondroitin for knee osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Richy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richy 2003</LINK>) that included studies up to March 2002 concluded that chondroitin was effective for pain and function compared with placebo. A limitation noted in both of these meta-analyses is that trials included in the analyses allowed coadministration of analgesics or NSAIDs during the study, leading to possible confounding of the results. Publication of additional studies of chondroitin over the past few years since these meta-analyses were published necessitates a new systematic review.</P>

<LI>Pain: pain subscale of the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) (<LINK REF="REF-Bellamy-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellamy 1988</LINK>) or Numeric rating scale or Visual Analog Scale; rest pain; pain on motion; pain on walking for index joint; pain in index joint during activities other than walking; or other similar pain scale. A higher score indicates worse pain state in general. Clinically clinically meaningful threshold in pain intensity has been defined as an improvement of 0.9-1.3 cm on a 0-10 cm pain scale (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Todd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1996</LINK>). This threshold was also endorsed by the The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>). Percent pain responders, defined as the proportion with minimal clinically important improvement [MCII] on WOMAC (<LINK REF="REF-Escobar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escobar 2007</LINK>), was another major outcome of interest.</LI>
<LI>Physical function: both performance-based (e.g., 50-foot walk) and patient-based (WOMAC minimal clinically important improvement, MCII (<LINK REF="REF-Escobar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escobar 2007</LINK>); WOMAC total and subscale scores). WOMAC subscale scores are transformed on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse pain, function, and overall status.</LI>
<LI>Lequesne's index (<LINK REF="REF-Lequesne-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lequesne 1997</LINK>): combines pain, walking ability, and activities of daily living into a composite, with scores ranging from 0 to 24 and higher score indicating worse status of osteoarthritis and disability/quality of life (composite pain, function and disability scale). Clinically meaningful thresholds have not been defined in publications, therefore we used the moderate effect size of 0.5 as meaningful. Personal communications with developer of the scale (Dr. Lequesne) indicated that a change of approximately 2-units for a baseline score of 9-11.5 may be clinically meaningful.</LI>

<P>Pharmacoeconomics: whenever applicable, we attempted to perform analyses by comparing chondroitin with a comparator regarding the cost of drugs per month and the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to prevent one participant from having an adverse event and the NNTB to have one participant achieve MCII on WOMAC. We analyzed direct medical and non-medical costs as well as indirect medical costs in the analysis and reported indirect costs (productivity losses) separately (<LINK REF="REF-Gabriel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabriel 2003</LINK>).</P>

For each randomized controlled trial, we calculated point estimates, such as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous measures, we calculated mean differences when possible because results presented in this form are more readily interpreted by clinicians. Standardized mean differences were used as measures of treatment effect when outcomes assessed the same construct but used different outcome measures, such as data that used different and inconvertible scales to measure the same construct of interest. In our extraction of pain data, we applied a hierarchy when extracting data on various scales, extracting data on a 0 to 100 scale first, a 0 to 10 cm VAS scale second, a WOMAC pain subscale third, and all other pain outcomes thereafter. Whenever possible, we standardized the data presented to a 0 to 100-mm scale. In our extraction of physical function data, we extracted physical function on a WOMAC scale first and all other physical function measures thereafter. Data on this outcome were standardized to a 0 to 100-mm scale whenever possible.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-10-17 16:45:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The random-effects model was the default model for pooling outcomes in the meta-analysis. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk difference. We used the Wells Calculator, available at the CMSG editorial office, to calculate NNTs for continuous outcomes. The following minimally important clinical differences (MCIDs) were used for the calculator:<BR/>Pain: 15 on a 0-100 scale (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2001</LINK>)<BR/>Lesquene Index: 0.5 SD<BR/>Reduction in minimum JSW: 0.4mm (<LINK REF="REF-Maillefert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maillefert 2002</LINK>)</P>
<P>Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to calculate the benefit of chondroitin over the comparator group for continuous outcomes such as pain measured on a VAS or other similar scales. Standardized mean difference is very similar to the term "effect size," which is commonly used in presenting comparisons of active treatment with control. When calculating the SMD, we divided the difference in mean outcome between groups by the standard deviation of the outcome among participants. We obtained the relative difference in the change from baseline (benefit) by dividing the absolute benefit by the baseline mean of the control group.</P>
<P>The "Summary of findings" tables included in RevMan 5 was completed to communicate the key outcomes of the review.

For the main analysis, we divided the studies into short-term trials&#8212;those lasting less than six months&#8212;and long-term trials&#8212;those lasting six months or longer. This was done on the a priori clinical impression that short-term benefits and harms of chondroitin sulfate may differ from long-term benefits and harms. We made a decision that where both long- and short-term effects of chondroitin could be calculated for an outcome (such as pain, physical function etc.), we will present them separately.</P>
<P>We analyzed in one analysis trials that had the same composition in their treatment and control arms.

<P>Review authors found a total of 187 potential studies in the first search for this systematic review. Of these 187, 57 studies were obtained on 1 January 2006 for further investigation (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Of these, 19 studies met the inclusion criteria. The remaining studies were excluded (refer to "<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>"). We performed a second search via MEDLINE on 12 September 2006 and identified 26 additional potential studies. Of these 26, two studies qualified for inclusion. We performed another search on 4 June 2007. This search yielded 12 results, of which three qualified for inclusion in our review. We performed another search on 21 May 2008. This time, we identified 15 additional references, of which one study qualified. On 30 June 2009, we performed another search that identified 32 studies. Of the 32 references pulled in the MEDLINE search, 15 were duplicates that had been pulled in the 21 May 2008 search. Of the remaining 17 new references, six qualified as potential studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Of these six studies, two qualified. One of our Russian translators identified two additional studies for inclusion in our review. Later, on 20 July 2011, we performed another search, which yielded 29 results. Of these 29 potential studies, six fit the inclusion criteria. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 2009</LINK>) was a duplicate from our previous search; therefore, five studies were picked for inclusion. On 12 June 2012, another search was performed to make sure that we included all studies that had been published up to the completion of our meta-analysis. This search yielded 764 results. Of these, sixteen were pulled for further review. Upon examination, five of these studies were deemed to fit the inclusion criteria and were added to our meta-analysis. A review of other meta-analyses performed on chondroitin revealed seven new possible studies for inclusion, of which two fit our inclusion criteria. A final search update was done in November, 2013 that yielded 794 titles/abstracts. An additional 4 studies were included from this search, of which one was a long-term follow-up of a previously included study by <LINK REF="STD-Wildi-2011A" TYPE="STUDY">Wildi 2011A</LINK>, but with a different outcome. Overall, therefore, 45 studies were included in our review. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Brandao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brandao 2009</LINK>, could not be obtained, and another study, <LINK REF="STD-Vertkin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vertkin 2007</LINK>, was found to have an obvious mismatch in its data, as reported by the translating abstractor.

<LINK REF="STD-Messier-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Messier 2007</LINK> was a participant- and investigator-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial that lasted 12 months, of which six months was applicable to the current review. For the remaining six months, investigators assessed the effect of exercise combined with chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine, and thus the data could not be used. Participants were included if they were 50 years of age or older, had mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis on a Kellgren-Lawrence scale (II or III) according to ACR criteria, and were not currently participating in another study. A total of 45 participants were randomly assigned to the chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride group and received 1200 mg of chondroitin sulfate plus 1500 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride once or three times daily. In all, 44 participants were randomly assigned to the placebo group and received placebo sachets of identical appearance and odor in a blinded fashion. The primary outcome of the study was physical function as measured on the WOMAC. Secondary outcomes were pain on WOMAC, distance walked in six minutes, mental status as measured on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), balance, and strength of concentric extension and flexion in the most affected knee.</P>

<P>Five comparison groups were used for this analysis. We performed the meta-analysis by stratifying the compiled data into the following comparable groups.</P>
<P>1. Chondroitin sulfate versus placebo</P>
<P>2. Chondroitin sulfate versus control</P>
<P>3. Chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine versus placebo</P>
<P>4. Chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine versus NSAIDs control</P>
<P>5. Chondroitin sulfate/chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate plus other supplement versus placebo or control</P>
<P>Overall, 43 studies were included in this review. Of the 43 studies, 30 provided usable data, since outcomes reported matched with those specified for our systematic review. Several studies provided data for more than one of our comparison arms, such as <LINK REF="STD-Clegg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sawitzke-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sawitzke 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sawitzke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sawitzke 2010</LINK>, which tested the efficacy of chondroitin alone, in combination with glucosamine, and in comparison with both placebo and an NSAID control. We came across additional studies that were not classifiable into these comparison arms or did not provide usable data. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Alekseeva-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Alekseeva 2008</LINK> were not used in the meta-analysis because this study compared intermittent versus constant therapy with chondroitin and glucosamine. This treatment regimen did not fit into any of the comparison arms of the meta-analysis. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2001</LINK> were not used, except for data on safety, because the study was designed in a before and after design by which all participants received treatment with chondroitin sulfate, which was not compatible with the setup of any other study included in this review. We summarized the results of this study in the discussion section. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Magrans_x002d_Courtney-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Magrans-Courtney 2011</LINK> were not usable in the meta-analysis because the chondroitin arm was confounded by additional co-treatments, including a diet and exercise program. Findings of this study were also summarized in the discussion section. Moreover, data from <LINK REF="STD-Rovetta-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rovetta 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rovetta-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rovetta 2004</LINK> were not included in the data meta-analysis because the authors did not provide the data gathered during their study&#8212;only their conclusions. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK> were not used in this meta-analysis because this study compared topical treatment with chondroitin sulfate, not oral treatment with placebo. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Fardellone-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fardellone 2013</LINK> were summarized but not used in meta-analyses, since the trial compared two different preparations of chondroitin, namely the bovine and the avian chondroitin preparations&#8212;these results were summarized in the systematic review. <LINK REF="STD-Conrozier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conrozier 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-L_x0027_Hirondel-1992" TYPE="STUDY">L'Hirondel 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rai-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 2004</LINK> were not included in the main analysis because they did not provide standard deviations. We included these studies in the sensitivity analysis only when all studies without standard deviations were included after an estimate had been calculated for them. Therefore, results of the studies are summarized in the discussion section. Moreover, although we came to a consensus that data from three-month and 12-month time points from <LINK REF="STD-Uebelhart-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Uebelhart 2004</LINK> should be used, the study was based on an intermittent design, by which participants in the chondroitin sulfate group were treated with chondroitin sulfate for the first three months, were not treated for the next three months, were treated again for another three months, and then were no longer treated.</P>

Studies using appropriate ITT analyses had an effect size of -0.46 for pain which was significant , similar to the overall effect, while those with unclear ITT had a larger effect size of -1.00, while 1 study with high risk of bias for ITT analyses had an effect size 0.24, which was insignificant. Most included studies used appropriate ITT analyses.</P>
<P>Among studies that used adequate methods of allocation concealment, no significant difference was reported between placebo and chondroitin while studies that used unclear methods of allocation concealment, participants treated with chondroitin had statistically significantly better scores than those in the placebo group.A difference was seen between the results of studies with large and small sample sizes. Studies with large sample sizes reported no statistically significant difference in pain scores between chondroitin and placebo while studies with small sample sizes reported that pain scores for participants in the chondroitin group were significantly better than those in the placebo group.</P>
<P>Studies funded by chondroitin sulfate manufacturers showed that participants in the chondroitin group had statistically significantly better pain scores than those in the placebo group, and the effect size was -0.52. Studies that did not specify their source of funding or with no pharmaceutical sponsorship did not report a statistically significant difference between participants in the chondroitin group and those in the placebo group, but the effect size was greater at -0.73. Thus, the effect of study sponsorship on findings was mixed.</P>
<P>Studies published before 2000 showed that participants treated with chondroitin had significantly better pain scores than those in the placebo group while studies published after 2000 reported no statistically significant difference between chondroitin and placebo.</P>

<P>In the comparison group of chondroitin sulfate versus control, one study was added (<LINK REF="STD-Alekseeva-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alekseeva 1999</LINK>). The addition of this study resulted in notable differences in the outcomes of pain and Lequesne's index. For pain, the main analysis revealed no significant difference between chondroitin sulfate and control (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.07; P = 0.29); this held true after <LINK REF="STD-Alekseeva-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alekseeva 1999</LINK> was added with an estimated standard deviation (SMD 0.34, 95% CI -0.85 to 0.18; P = 0.20).

<P>In the comparison group of chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine versus NSAIDs, the sensitivity analysis revealed notable changes in physical function, WOMAC stiffness, and WOMAC Total. For physical function, a moderate difference between the results of the main analysis and the results of the sensitivity analysis was observed, with the SMD increasing to -0.17 (95% CI -0.57 to 0.23; P = 0.41).

<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2001</LINK> studies the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride in participants diagnosed with capsulitis, disk displacement, disk dislocation, or painful osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This study found no statistically significant decrease in the VAS pain ratings of participants treated with chondroitin sulfate-glucosamine hydrochloride, although it did find that participants in the placebo group experienced a statistically significant decrease in their pain ratings. In the outcome of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), again no statistically significant change was observed in the sensory, affective, miscellaneous, total, and number of words pain rating indices in the chondroitin sulfate-glucosamine hydrochloride group. Only in the evaluative Pain Rating index was a significant decrease seen in the pain rating, which changed from 3.4 to 2.4. It is interesting to note that participants in the placebo group again underwent statistically significant changes in sensory, evaluative, miscellaneous, and number of words Pain Rating indices. In the placebo group, the evaluative pain rating also decreased from 3.1 to 2. In summary, this study showed that participants treated with chondroitin sulfate-glucosamine hydrochloride showed improvement in one scale of the MPQ, and participants treated with placebo experienced statistically significant improvement on four scales of the MPQ. In measures of mood and functioning, the results were again interesting, as participants in the chondroitin sulfate-glucosamine hydrochloride group showed slight worsening of their mood and functioning score, although this decrease was not statistically significant. Participants in the placebo group, on the other hand, showed improvement in their mood and functioning, although this was not significant either. In the outcome of TMJ palpation score, participants in the chondroitin sulfate-glucosamine hydrochloride group showed a statistically significant decrease, and those in the placebo group did not. In the outcome of myofascial pain, no statistically significant improvement was observed in the placebo group or the active group. In the outcome of jaw range of motion, no statistically significant improvement was observed. However, this study did show that chondroitin sulfate-glucosamine hydrochloride participants took statistically significantly less medication per day than those in the placebo group (1.42 in the placebo group vs 0.72 in the active group).<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Rovetta-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rovetta 2004</LINK> studies the efficacy of chondroitin at 800 mg daily plus naproxen versus naproxen alone in participants with erosive osteoarthritis of the hands. This study found that participants in the active and placebo groups showed worsening in their scores on nearly all outcomes as compared with baseline. In the outcomes of degree of erosion, Heberden and Bouchard nodes, and Dreiser index scores, the treated group showed significant worsening, and the Patient and Physician global assessment showed no significant change. The untreated group also showed significant worsening in degree of erosion, Heberden and Bourchard nodes, Dreiser index, and Physician and Patient global assessment scores. Using the Mann-Whitney test, the authors concluded at the end of the study that the results show less worsening in study outcomes in the treated group than in the placebo group.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Rovetta-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rovetta 2002</LINK> is a study conducted to evaluate the effect of 800 mg of chondroitin sulfate in combination with naproxen per day on the joint count for erosions in participants with erosive osteoarthritis of the hands as compared with naproxen alone. In both the active group and the placebo group, the general tendency for the joint count was for erosion to increase over time. Progression of erosion over 24 months, however, was significantly less for participants in the chondroitin sulfate&#8211;treated group than for those treated with naproxen alone. After the first year, although 11 of the 12 participants in the chondroitin sulfate group had remained at the same joint erosion count, only six in the placebo group had done so. Although only one participant in the chondroitin sulfate group increased by one erosive joint count, five participants in the naproxen alone group experienced a one-count increase in the number of their erosive joints. The authors concluded that the difference between participants with erosive joint count increases and those without in group B versus group A is statistically significant.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Magrans_x002d_Courtney-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Magrans-Courtney 2011</LINK> is a study undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in combination with a 14-week exercise program and one of two different diet programs. All participants participated in a 14-week exercise plan. Simultaneously, participants were randomly assigned to receive a high-protein or a high-carbohydrate diet program. Then, they were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or 1500 mg of glucosamine, 1200 mg of chondroitin, and 900 mg of methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) daily. The study found that participants in all groups experienced improvement in their physical functioning test, as well as on WOMAC, VAS, and quality of life measures. However, the authors do not note any significant correlation between the use of chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, and MSM and improvement on these scales, stating, "no significant differences [were] observed among diet and supplement groups," which would indicate such a correlation.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-25 05:58:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, 43 trials were included in this meta-analysis, of which 30 contributed data to meta-analyses for clinical outcomes analyzed. Of these 30 studies, 18 assessed the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate in comparison with placebo, three assessed chondroitin sulfate in comparison with control, seven assessed chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine in comparison with placebo, and eight assessed chondroitin sulfate in combination with glucosamine in comparison with control (some studies had more than one active intervention arm). Three studies presented data on more than one of the comparison groups in this meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Clegg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sawitzke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sawitzke 2010</LINK> (a follow-up of Clegg 2006) compared the efficacy of chondroitin versus placebo, chondroitin and glucosamine versus placebo, and chondroitin and glucosamine versus active control. <LINK REF="STD-Sawitzke-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sawitzke 2008</LINK> compared the efficacy of chondroitin versus placebo and of chondroitin and glucosamine versus active control. Chondroitin (alone or in combination with glucosamine) seemed to be more effective for pain than the comparator among these studies and seemed to be well tolerated. Even though adverse events reporting by most trials was not very detailed, very few participants in either treatment groups reported adverse events.</P>
<P>Eleven studies (with 12 reports; <LINK REF="STD-Sawitzke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sawitzke 2010</LINK> was a follow-up of <LINK REF="STD-Clegg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 2006</LINK> provided data on pain for chondroitin versus placebo, the first major outcome. These data showed that those treated with chondroitin sulfate alone had statistically significantly better scores on pain than those treated with placebo with a mean difference of -10.1 mm (95% CI -14.1 to -4.9) between chondroitin and placebo for pain on 0-100 scale in studies less than 6 months. The corresponding standardized mean difference was -0.51 (95% CI, -0.74 to -0.23) and absolute risk difference -9% (95% CI, -14% to -5%) between chondroitin sulfate alone vs. placebo. Standardized mean difference was -0.63 (95% CI, -0.93 to -0.33) for pain for chondroitin with/without glucosamine vs. placebo; this equals mean difference of -9.96 mm (95% CI -15.86 to -0.34). The risk of bias was high and the level of evidence was low. A common statistic used in non-Cochrane literature is effect size, such as Cohen's effect size, which is conceptually similar to standardized mean difference in its depiction of the influence of the effects of the experimental treatment. Cohen's effect size categorizes an effect size of 0.20 as small, 0.50 as medium, and 0.80 as large (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1992</LINK>). Based on this categorization, the observed standardized mean difference of -0.51 for pain corresponded to a medium/moderate effect size with chondroitin alone and -0.63 corresponding with medium/moderate effect size with chondroitin with/without glucosamine.</P>
<P>Analyses of pain studies has shown a reduction of pain between 0.9-1.3 cm on a 0-10 cm pain scale is clinically meaningful (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Todd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1996</LINK>), and as expected lower than the thresholds for "much improved" pain thresholds (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2000</LINK>). The clinically meaningful threshold of 1 cm reduction in pain intensity was also endorsed by the The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>). Using the threshold of 0.9 cm on 0-10 cm scale for a clinical meaningful improvement, chondroitin alone or in combination with glucosamine led to clinically meaningful and statistically significantly improvement in pain, compared to placebo. The absolute improvements shown in the Summary of Findings tables of 9-10% also meet the clinically meaningful change threshold. One should note that the actual improvement with chondroitin alone or in combination with glucosamine was higher, given that 0.9 represents the difference between chondroitin (with/without glucosamine) and placebo/control groups. However, assessments of quality of evidence using GRADE method (see summary of findings table) indicated that several studies reporting on pain suffered from low quality of evidence; thus, we performed further sensitivity analyses to detect the influence of study quality on this observed effect from pain.</P>
<P>When stratified by study size, for example, studies with large sample sizes (100 or more) found no statistically significant difference in the pain scores of participants treated with chondroitin and those treated with placebo, but studies with smaller sample sizes showed a statistically significant difference in favor of chondroitin. With the exception of three studies, most studies had a sample size of fewer than 100. Stratification by study sponsorship further revealed that studies that were not funded by a manufacturer of chondroitin showed no significant difference between chondroitin and placebo, but among studies sponsored by a manufacturer of chondroitin, participants treated with chondroitin showed significantly better pain scores than those treated with placebo. However, sensitivity analysis by the blinding method or the ITT confirmed our initial results in favor of chondroitin, with studies that had adequate blinding methods and those using ITT analyses finding that participants treated with chondroitin sulfate had statistically significantly better pain ratings than those treated with placebo.</P>
<P>These sensitivity analyses indicate that the effects of chondroitin are variable in sensitivity analyses that adjust for study quality and/or funding source. The standardized mean differences varied from small-medium and statistically significant overall in some sensitivity analyses to minimal to nonexistent and statistically insignificant in others. Statistically insignificant results were seen particularly in studies with large sample sizes, independent sources of funding, and adequate methods of allocation concealment that did not show any statistically significant difference between the pain scores of participants treated with chondroitin and those treated with placebo.</P>
<P>The studies also showed better Lequesne's index scores (range 0-24) in patients receiving chondroitin compared to control/placebo with effect sizes of -0.52 with chondroitin and -0.48 with chondroitin with/without glucosamine (2.1 or 1.9 unit difference), compared to placebo. This corresponded to small to medium effect size benefit with chondroitin, and seemed clinically meaningful (though no published MCID threshold, a 2-point difference on this scale corresponds to ~10% or more improvement in one group compared to the other).</P>
<P>Of the 28 studies assessing chondroitin versus placebo, only two provided data for WOMAC MCII (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Clegg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 2006</LINK>). This is not surprising because this outcome has been defined recently, and many studies precede the description of this outcome; many others published since then have reported pain on various scales as the primary outcome. When chondroitin was compared with placebo, a significantly greater number of participants treated with chondroitin attained clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement on WOMAC in pain than those treated with placebo (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24; P = 0.04).</P>
<P>Other outcomes that were significantly better in the chondroitin group compared with the placebo group were the patient and physician global assessments. Significantly higher proportions of participants reported very good or excellent on the global assessment in the chondroitin group compared with the placebo group.</P>
<P>For a few outcomes, the data reveal that participants treated with chondroitin had statistically significant improvement as compared with those treated with placebo. For instance, participants in the chondroitin sulfate group experienced statistically significantly less loss of cartilage volume in global, lateral compartment, tibial plateaus and medial tibial plateaus, and less reduction in minimal joint space narrowing. However, among studies that found a statistically significantly positive effect with chondroitin for these various outcomes, heterogeneity was moderate, and factors that affect the study's quality, such as size and independence of funding, were generally low quality.</P>
<P>In nearly all other outcomes, including physical function, stiffness, grip strength, morning stiffness, global assessment on VAS (mm), change in bone marrow lesion scores of several different compartments, OMERACT-OARSI, HAQ Disability, HAQ continuous, HAQ MCID scores, and both mental and physical components of SF-36, no statistically significant difference between chondroitin and placebo was noted.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Of the 43 studies contributing data to this systematic review and meta-analysis, seven studies assessed the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate in combination with glucosamine versus placebo. Among these studies, five provided data on some measure of pain. When data were not stratified by any of our considered factors, the studies showed no statistically significant difference between pain scores for participants in the placebo group compared with those in the chondroitin in combination with glucosamine group. Stratification by blinding, study size, study sponsors, and publication year confirmed these results, showing again no significant difference between chondroitin sulfate in combination with glucosamine and placebo in any of the subgroups. For other outcomes, no significant difference between chondroitin and placebo was reported, except in the number of participants achieving OMERACT-OARSI responder status; significantly more participants achieved OMERACT-OARSI responder status in the chondroitin in combination with glucosamine group than in the placebo group and had significantly better scores on balance than those in the placebo group. Few studies provided data on efficacy outcomes in this comparison arm, and only one study reported under many of the outcomes, making the authors' conclusions less reliable than desired.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Of the 43 studies contributing data, eight studies provided data that compared the efficacy of chondroitin in combination with glucosamine (along with NSAIDs) with the efficacy of NSAIDs or another active control alone. These studies allowed for the concomitant use of NSAIDs along with chondroitin and glucosamine and assessed whether the use of chondroitin in combination with glucosamine and NSAIDs was more effective than the use of NSAIDs alone. Four studies provided data on pain in this comparison arm. Participants in the chondroitin sulfate in combination with glucosamine and NSAIDs group had statistically significantly lower pain scores than those in the NSAIDs control group before sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity was statistically significant among the studies. Sensitivity analysis by blinding method showed that studies that reported adequate blinding did not find a statistically significant difference between the use of NSAIDs in combination with chondroitin and glucosamine and alone. Studies that were not blinded, however, reported that those treated with chondroitin in combination with glucosamine and NSAIDs scored statistically significantly better on pain scales than those taking NSAIDs alone. Moreover, sensitivity analysis by study size revealed that those studies with large sample sizes (more than 100) showed no statistically significant difference between therapy with NSAIDs in combination with chondroitin and glucosamine and NSAIDs alone, and studies with small sample sizes did reveal such a statistically significant difference. This shows again that studies of higher quality (large sample sizes and adequate methods of allocation concealment) detected no statistically significant difference between chondroitin and placebo. No statistically significant difference was noted between the active and control groups in any other outcomes, except WOMAC stiffness and Patient and Physical global assessments of good to very good, where the studies revealed that participants treated with chondroitin and glucosamine in combination with NSAIDs did have statistically significantly better scores than those treated with NSAIDs alone. However, heterogeneity was high among these studies. Moreover, most outcomes that did not show a significant difference between active treatment and placebo were populated by studies of higher methodological quality, and those that did show a statistically significant difference were populated by studies with significant between-study heterogeneity and typically lower methodological quality.</P>
<P>
<BR/>We also performed data analysis combining all studies that reported on pain and physical function without differentiating between the various compositions of their treatment arms, as long as chondroitin was included in the intervention arm. For pain, this sensitivity analysis revealed that participants treated with chondroitin alone or in combination with another supplement including glucosamine in most instances scored statistically significantly better on pain scales than those treated with placebo or control (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.35; P &lt; 0.00001), which translated into an absolute risk difference of -9.6 (95% CI -14 to -5.2) on a 0 to 100 scale (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). A similar result was found when we restricted the analysis to studies with a dose of chondroitin &#8807;800 mg/day, the therapeutic dose, with an SMD -0.67, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.34; P &lt; 0.0001); absolute percent change 10% lower (14.6% lower to 5% lower). Our previous conclusion was again confirmed in this analysis, when all studies were combined and stratified by study size. Studies that had large sample sizes showed no significant difference between chondroitin and placebo, and studies with small sample sizes showed that participants treated with chondroitin alone or in combination with other supplements scored better on pain scales than those treated with a placebo or control. These results were replicated in our sensitivity analysis by source of funding and allocation concealment, showing that higher-quality studies found no statistically significant difference between participants treated with chondroitin alone or in combination with other supplements such as glucosamine and placebo or control. In the outcome of physical function, no statistically significant difference was noted between participants treated with chondroitin alone or in combination with other supplements such as glucosamine (P = 0.52 before the sensitivity analysis), and these results were confirmed in our sensitivity analysis.</P>

<P>The evidence presented herein is up to date. Furthermore, the data presented here are taken from a large number of studies that span a long range of time for their publication. The review authors compared their list of included studies with those of other published reviews and meta-analyses to ensure the inclusion of all relevant studies. In this process, we discovered several studies, which, although they assessed the efficacy of chondroitin, did not offer data that could be used in our meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK> assessed the efficacy of a chondroitin sulfate cream and since chondroitin was not orally administered chondroitin sulfate, the study could not be used. <LINK REF="STD-Vertkin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vertkin 2007</LINK> had an obvious mismatch in study data and therefore could not be used. <LINK REF="STD-Das-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Das 2000</LINK> divided its participants by the severity of their osteoarthritis and presented separate data for severe and moderate/mild cases of osteoarthritis; therefore, we estimated overall scores using these numbers. <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2001</LINK> had a before and after trial design; therefore, only its safety data were used, and the rest of the study results are summarized above, at the end of the <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> section. <LINK REF="STD-Alekseeva-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alekseeva 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conrozier-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Conrozier 1992;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Conrozier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Conrozier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x0027_Hirondel-1992" TYPE="STUDY">L'Hirondel 1992</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Rai-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 2004</LINK> did not provide standard deviations in their data reports and could not be used in the main meta-analysis, except with categorical outcomes. As has been done previously in the systematic review and meta-analysis published by <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK>, we estimated standard deviations using the formula presented in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and performed a sensitivity analysis, in which we included all studies with estimated standard deviations as well.</P>
<P>In studies that were included in the data analysis of this review, we made sure to confirm the accuracy of studies with suspect data, such as data presented that appeared more like standard errors than standard deviations, despite the article's claims that they were standard deviations. In these instances, we contacted the authors of the study to double-check the accuracy of the data and indeed found and corrected several such errors.</P>
<P>Furthermore, because the current review assesses the efficacy of not only chondroitin sulfate in comparison with an inert placebo but also chondroitin sulfate in combination with glucosamine and in comparison with NSAIDs, the evidence applies to a broader range of clinical practice. Additionally, we performed numerous sensitivity analyses to try to more completely understand our results. In fact, as our conclusion suggests, the sensitivity analyses performed offer indispensable insight into the efficacy of chondroitin, as the sensitivity analyses show that studies with higher methodological quality show no significant difference between chondroitin and placebo or control.</P>

<P>Because (1) the funnel plot suggested publication bias and (2) we noted two radiographic studies, both with positive data, we contacted IBSA, the manufacturer of chondroitin sulfate and a supporter of several of these studies, on July 30, 2013 to request all unpublished radiographic data. In its response, dated July 30, 2013, IBSA provided us with five published studies, all of which had been considered in the screening process. They also responded that no radiographic data related to chondroitin from their studies were unpublished.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-10-26 16:57:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence presented in the various studies here may be limited by the fact that heterogeneity between the studies was rather large, and various subscales of an outcome were normalized and used in one overall outcome. For instance, pain on WOMAC, pain on VAS, and pain on the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scale were normalized and presented as one overall pain outcome. The decision to combine various subscales of an outcome was made a priori because a high degree of heterogeneity among the studies was suspected for the scales used to present data, thus hindering the execution of a fruitful meta-analysis. Several studies in the past have looked at multiple pain scales including numeric rating scales and visual analogue scales and have determined that they provide similar information and are comparable (<LINK REF="REF-Breivik-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breivik 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferreira_x002d_Valente-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferreira-Valente 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Furthermore, the methodological quality of several studies included in the meta-analysis was low. Although most of the studies reported adequate blinding methods and performed appropriate ITT analyses, these authors did not report adequate methods of allocation concealment or randomization. Moreover, most of the studies were funded by manufacturers of chondroitin sulfate, such as IBSA, Rexall Sundown Inc., etc. The degree to which the involvement of chondroitin manufacturers played a role in these studies was not definitively clear. The quality of the evidence from many of these studies was further compromised because study authors did not clearly describe blinding and allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Several other studies with no sponsorship from chondroitin sulfate manufacturers had large sample sizes and minimal amounts of bias, such as <LINK REF="STD-Clegg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Messier-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Messier 2007</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Uebelhart-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Uebelhart 2004</LINK>. These four studies clearly described adequate methods of randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, and handling of missing outcome data, although the remaining studies are unclear in addressing at least one key source of bias, and in most of the studies, more than half of these factors of bias were not described. Additionally, we did not have access to enough information such as complete study protocols to make definitive judgments regarding the risk of selective reporting. Thus, we performed sensitivity analysis by blinding, study size, publication year, source of funding and ITT to detect the impact of such biases on our main results.</P>

<P>In this meta-analysis, most of the published studies detected a statistically significant positive effect on pain. However, sensitivity analyses showed that the effect of chondroitin was persisted in some sensitivity analyses (those with adequate blinding and ITT analyses), but not in other sensitivity analyses. Current guidelines of the ACR, using the GRADE approach, discourage the use of supplements because of lack of evidence from high-quality trials (<LINK REF="REF-Hochberg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochberg 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other recently published meta-analyses have reported similar findings, with fewer trials, some with a different interpretation.

<P>In this meta-analysis, <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> included all "randomized or quasi-randomized trials which compared chondroitin with either no treatment or placebo." The review authors performed sensitivity analyses on the data by concealment of allocation, use of placebo in control, participant blinding, use of ITT, trial size, funding, use of co-intervention, route of administration, and length of follow-up. In so doing, they found that higher-quality studies with adequate concealment of allocation and proper ITT analysis showed small to nonexistent effects from chondroitin. The review authors also found a high degree of heterogeneity between the studies included.</P>
<P>We observed several points of agreement and disagreement between <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> and our review, as noted in the Methods and Results sections. For instance, <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> had broader inclusion criteria than we did. They included studies published in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Fleisch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fleisch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazieres-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mazieres 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soroka-_x0026_-Chyzh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soroka &amp; Chyzh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uebelhart-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Uebelhart 1999</LINK>), but we decided a priori to include only full publications. In addition, they included studies that assessed the efficacy of chondroitin administered intramuscularly and topically (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerzberg-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kerzberg 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rovetta-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rovetta 1991</LINK>). However, we decided a priori to include only studies that assessed the efficacy of oral chondroitin to limit heterogeneity of effect; therefore, we did not include the results of <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK> in our meta-analyses but have only summarized them.</P>
<P>Furthermore, we discovered that over the several years that passed between the publishing of <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> and the preparation of this review, several new published studies had assessed the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate (<LINK REF="STD-Alekseeva-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Alekseeva 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gabay-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gabay 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kanzaki-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kanzaki 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magrans_x002d_Courtney-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Magrans-Courtney 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Messier-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Messier 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakasone-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Nakasone 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pavelka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pavelka 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawitzke-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sawitzke 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawitzke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sawitzke 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wildi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wildi 2011</LINK>). We included these studies in our review so we could assess whether the publication of more recent studies had any influence on the previously arrived at conclusions regarding the use of chondroitin.</P>
<P>Moreover, we found that <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> did not account for the possible clinical effect of heterogeneity arising from combining studies assessing the efficacy of chondroitin alone with those assessing the efficacy of chondroitin in combination with other treatments such as glucosamine or NSAIDs. The inclusion of studies that assess the effects of using a combination of chondroitin with other supplements poses the risk of confounding the observed results. It is difficult to see in such studies whether the observed effect in the active group is due to the presence of chondroitin or to another of the matrix components that was administered along with chondroitin. In our review, therefore, to control for any confounding effects arising from the use of other treatments in combination with chondroitin sulfate, we decided to stratify our data based on the make-up of the active treatment groups; therefore, we have separate comparison arms for studies that used chondroitin alone, studies that used chondroitin in combination with supplements, and studies that used chondroitin in combination with NSAIDs. To facilitate the comparison of our results with those of other reviews, however, we performed a sensitivity on all studies, regardless of whether they included confounding treatments, as long as they had chondroitin in the active arm compared with placebo/control (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK> and associated sensitivity analyses).</P>
<P>Moreover, we discovered that many of the studies included in <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> had data for which standard deviations were provided in published studies. In such instances, <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> et al. had estimated the standard deviations. We also therefore performed a sensitivity analysis wherein we included studies for which we estimated standard deviations to allow comparisons.</P>
<P>Comparing the results of <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> with ours, we discovered that both reviews agreed to a large extent regarding what the data showed. Both discovered that chondroitin was more efficacious as compared with placebo for pain-related outcomes; however, with the performance of sensitivity analysis, it became obvious that in some sensitivity analyses, beneficial effects from chondroitin were uncertain, while in others these beneficial effects persisted. This is where our findings differ from <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>In our study, findings of clinically meaningful benefit with chondroitin compared to placebo for pain and Lequensne's index was robust for sensitivity analyses limited to studies with adequate blinding or studies that used appropriate intention to treat (ITT) analyses, but were uncertain when we limited data to studies with appropriate allocation concealment or a large study sample (&gt; 200) or to studies without pharmaceutical funding.</P>
<P>For pain-related outcomes, 20 of the 22 studies included in <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> provided data. These included studies for which no standard deviations were available and had to be estimated. Among these studies, the review authors witnessed a large "effect size" of -0.75 (95% CI -0.99 to -0.50). This effect size corresponded to a difference in pain scores of 1.6 cm (on a 10-cm VAS) between chondroitin and placebo groups. However, among studies reporting on this outcome, investigators witnessed an I<SUP>2</SUP> of 92%, indicating a high degree of between-trial heterogeneity.</P>
<P>For pain-related outcomes, we identified a total of 22 studies that provided data; for some of these, we were forced to estimate standard deviations (included only in the sensitivity analysis). To facilitate the most accurate comparison possible between our review and <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK>, we used data from <LINK REF="CMP-030.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 30.1</LINK> <LINK REF="CMP-029.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 29.1</LINK>, which analyzed the results of all studies, including those with estimated standard deviations and those that assessed the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate alone or in combination with other supplements in the active group and in the placebo group, with no treatment or control in the control arm. For the outcome of pain, our analysis revealed an SMD of -0.64 and a 95% CI of -0.88 to -0.41, corresponding to a P-value &lt; 0.0001 and a moderate-large effect size. This SMD corresponded to a 11.2 mm difference in pain scores on a 0 to 100-mm VAS scale. Among these studies, we observed a large degree of between-trial heterogeneity, with an I<SUP>2</SUP> of 91%. It is clear from these results that before sensitivity analysis was performed, the findings of our study were largely in agreement with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>Our results also found agreement after the sensitivity analysis was performed. <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> performed sensitivity analysis by allocation concealment, source of sponsorship, and sample size, among others. The mentioned sensitivity analyses revealed a significant interaction between the presence of adequate allocation concealment and sample size and the effect size of chondroitin.</P>
<P>In studies with adequate allocation concealment, chondroitin sulfate showed smaller effects, with a P for interaction of 0.05. Two studies in <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> had adequate allocation concealment. Among these two studies, the "effect size" decreased to -0.01 with a 95% CI level of -0.12 to 0.10. Our sensitivity analysis by allocation concealment revealed the same conclusion. We identified a total of four studies that had adequate allocation concealment. These studies showed no significant effect from chondroitin with an SMD of 0.03, a 95% CI of -0.08 to 0.14, and a P value of 0.62. Heterogeneity was also non significant, with an I<SUP>2 </SUP>of 36%.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis by sample size showed the same conclusion. In <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK>, when data were stratified according to sample size, studies with large sample sizes (more than 200) showed a non-significant "effect size" of -0.26 with a 95% CI of -0.56 to 0.04. When our data were stratified by sample size, studies with large sample sizes (greater than 100) had a decreased SMD of 0.03, with 95% CI of -0.08 to 0.14. Neither <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> nor our review discovered any significant difference between chondroitin and control.</P>
<P>Moreover, sensitivity analysis by source of funding again revealed the same conclusion. <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> stratified results between those funded by nonprofit organizations and those not funded by nonprofit organizations or those with unclear sources of funding. Studies that had nonprofit sponsorship showed no significant effect from chondroitin, with an "effect size" of 0.01 and a 95% CI of -0.15 to 0.16. In our review, we stratified our data according to whether the study was sponsored by a manufacturer of chondroitin sulfate or whether the study did not specify its source of funding or was not supported by a manufacturer of chondroitin sulfate. This analysis revealed an SMD of 0.00 with a 95% CI of -0.15 to 0.16 in one study that was not funded by a chondroitin sulfate manufacturer. Studies funded by manufacturers had a smaller effect size of -0.52 compared to -0.75 for studies with unclear funding. Therefore, the results of our meta-analysis and the results of <LINK REF="REF-Reichenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichenbach 2007</LINK> are in some disagreement in these regards.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Richy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richy 2003</LINK> is another meta-analysis on the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate. Upon performing a meta-analysis on nine studies, <LINK REF="STD-Richy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richy 2003</LINK> found that chondroitin was more effective on Lequesne&#8217;s index, visual analogue scale for pain, mobility, and responder status. Although the review authors note that the quality of the chondroitin studies included in their review was lower than that of studies reporting on the efficacy of glucosamine, they do not perform sensitivity analyses to discover the effect of low methodological quality on their outcomes. This accounts for the high level of variation between results of our meta-analysis and the results presented in <LINK REF="STD-Richy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richy 2003</LINK>. Our overall conclusion revealed a positive effect from chondroitin in comparison with placebo, as does <LINK REF="STD-Richy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Richy 2003</LINK>. However, upon further stratification of the data by factors such as sample size, and source of sponsorship, it became clear that studies with high methodological quality, we found that effects persisted in some, but not all sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>Other reviews, such as <LINK REF="REF-Hochberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochberg 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2010</LINK>, studied the efficacy of chondroitin in slowing the progression of joint space width loss. Although the number of studies included in this meta-analysis was small&#8212;three in <LINK REF="REF-Hochberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochberg 2010</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Michel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawitzke-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sawitzke 2008</LINK>) and four in <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2010</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Michel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uebelhart-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Uebelhart 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uebelhart-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Uebelhart 2004</LINK>)&#8212;investigators did detect a small but significant positive effect in the rate of joint space width narrowing in participants treated with chondroitin.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2010</LINK> concludes that chondroitin sulfate "had a small but significant protective effect on minimum JSN [joint space narrowing] after two years (SMD 0.261, 95% CI 0.131-0.392, <I>P </I>&lt; 0.001). This meta-analysis of available data shows that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate may delay radiologic progression of osteoarthritis of the knee after daily administration for over 2 or 3 years." <LINK REF="REF-Hochberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochberg 2010</LINK> echoes these results, stating that the analysis results showed "a small significant effect of chondroitin sulfate on the reduction in rate of decline in minimum joint space width of 0.13 mm [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06, 0.19] (P &lt; 0.0002) that corresponded to an effect size of 0.23 (95% CI 0.11, 0.35) (P &lt; 0.0001). These results demonstrate that chondroitin sulfate is effective for reducing the rate of decline in minimum joint space width in patients with knee OA.&#8221; Our estimates of minimum joint space width changes agree with those of <LINK REF="REF-Hochberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochberg 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2010</LINK>. What is not known is whether these radiographic differences are clinically meaningful. Moreover, the small number of studies used in the meta-analysis makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions, indicating that more data are needed.</P>
<P>Another review, <LINK REF="REF-Wandel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wandel 2010</LINK>, studied the efficacy of glucosamine, chondroitin, and glucosamine and chondroitin in combination as compared with placebo in reducing pain and joint space width loss and in ensuring safety. This review includes ten studies (<LINK REF="REF-Herrero_x002d_Beaumont-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrero-Beaumont 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McAlindon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAlindon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Novack-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novack 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pavelka-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavelka 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reginster-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Reginster 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rozendaal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rozendaal 2008</LINK> in glucosamine vs placebo comparison arm; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mazieres-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazieres 2007</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Michel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Michel 2005</LINK> in the chondroitin vs placebo comparison arm; and <LINK REF="STD-Clegg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 2006</LINK> for glucosamine and chondroitin combination vs the placebo comparison arm). In their analysis of the three studies comparing chondroitin alone with placebo, the authors found that participants treated with chondroitin did not experience a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity with a 95% confidence interval level of -0.3 cm (-0.7 to 0.0 cm) on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. Treatment with chondroitin alone was shown to have "minute" effects on radiographic joint space width, with a 95% confidence interval level of -0.1 mm (-0.3 to 0.1 mm) in favor of chondroitin. In the safety outcomes, chondroitin was shown to have an odds ratio of 0.99 with a 95% confidence interval level of 0.49 to 2.00 in the number of adverse events and 0.92 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.56 to 1.51 for withdrawals or dropouts due to adverse events. This meta-analysis differed from ours in that it included a much smaller number of studies in both the chondroitin versus placebo comparison arm and the chondroitin and glucosamine combination versus placebo comparison arm, thus limiting the scope of the presented findings. Despite the small number of studies included in each of the comparison arms, <LINK REF="REF-Wandel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wandel 2010</LINK> still found, as did our meta-analysis, that studies with industry sponsorship showed that chondroitin had a greater effect on pain than studies that did not have industry sponsorship. "On average, the estimated differences between supplements and placebo were 0.5 cm less pronounced in industry independent trials compared with industry sponsored trials, and estimated treatment effects in industry independent trials were minute to zero and by no means clinically relevant," the authors write.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-25 06:03:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-02-25 06:03:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The improvement in joint pain with chondroitin (alone or in combination with glucosamine) in participants with osteoarthritis was clinically meaningful and statistically significantly better than placebo, based on trials of mostly low quality. Participants reported statistically significantly more favorable ratings on patient and physician global assessment scales, Lequesne's index (a combination of pain, physical function and disability), which seemed clinically meaningful as well, based on evidence of low to moderate quality. There was statistically significantly less reduction in minimal joint space width with chondroitin compared to placebo groups, based on evidence of moderate to high quality, but the significance of this radiographic benefit is unclear to us.</P>
<P>Differences in physical function (by WOMAC) and most other clinical and radiographic outcomes were not statistically significant. WOMAC scores were reported in few trials, but Lequesne's index (a pain, physical function and disability composite) was reported by several studies, and was statistically significantly different between chondroitin and control/placebo, and the difference is considered clinically meaningful. It is important to note that the risk of serious side effects was lower in the chondroitin group than in comparator groups. Chondroitin was also tested alone and in combination with glucosamine against placebo or control treatments (NSAIDs), and similar observations were made. These differences in pain with chondroitin (alone or in combination with glucosamine) compared with placebo were attenuated or were no longer significant in some sensitivity analyses, but they persisted in other sensitivity analyses (blinding, ITT). Results were sensitive to trial quality, trial sponsorship, and trial sample size, such that trials with unclear or no allocation concealment, with pharmaceutical sponsorship, and with smaller sample size were more likely to show significant differences between groups, and those not in these categories showed a smaller and/or insignificant difference between chondroitin and comparator. On the other hand, when we limited analysis to studies with adequate blinding and studies using intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the differences in pain between chondroitin (alone or in combination with glucosamine) and placebo persisted.</P>
<P>Osteoarthritis is a challenging disease, and at present, very few effective and safe treatment options are available. Frequently used treatments such as NSAIDs are associated with significant adverse events, especially in the elderly. In addition, these medications are not universally effective, and a large proportion of patients fail with these over time. Analgesics such as acetaminophen are not very effective in severe osteoarthritis, and also have potential liver toxicity. The elderly may experience adverse events to narcotics, such as constipation, falls, confusion, etc. which sometimes are used for the treatment of severe osteoarthritis. Thus, a clear need exists for several more effective and safe treatment options. </P>
<P>Chondroitin is available over the counter as a supplement. Chondroitin seems to be well tolerated with no major safety issues, and its efficacy seems to range from small to medium treatment effect. However, most data have come from several small trials of short duration, with most sample sizes &lt; 100. Given the widespread use of this supplement, it is important that we understand its efficacy and role in the treatment of osteoarthritis. At this time, we suggest that patients and physicians discuss the pros and cons of using chondroitin for osteoarthritis and use it in conjunction with other modalities for osteoarthritis treatment, including weight loss and quadriceps strengthening and appropriate pharmacological treatment. We believe that larger high-quality studies of chondroitin in various subgroups of osteoarthritis (early vs late vs end-stage osteoarthritis, mild vs severe osteoarthritis, erosive vs. non-erosive osteoarthritis) are needed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-10-22 16:43:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most evidence for chondroitin comes from small trials. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has already sponsored and conducted the GAIT trial (<LINK REF="STD-Clegg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Clegg 2006</LINK>), which showed no statistically significant difference from placebo. Well-designed high-quality RCTs of chondroitin in participants with early and late osteoarthritis are desirable because they can add valuable information to knowledge gaps in this area. Larger samples and appropriate controls (placebo or NSAIDs) are needed, and trials need to provide longer follow-up and closer monitoring so investigators can see long-term effects and detect any safety concerns.</P>

<P>We used the outcomes recommended for summary of findings tables for osteoarthritis reviews based on guidance from the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Editorial Group (allows up to 7 outcomes). Since the original protocol listed pain and WOMAC pain MCII as the co-primary outcomes, we included them in main SOF tables. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool instead of the older system in the protocol. We changed the definition of "short-term" studies to 6 months from 3 months in the protocol. We used the GRADE system to assess the quality of evidence rather than the older grading system described in the protocol.</P>

The target hand was defined as the participant's most symptomatic hand or, when both hands were equally painful, the participant's dominant hand. To be eligible for the study, participants had to present with symptomatic osteoarthritis. The minimal level of symptoms was joint pain of at least 40 mm on a 0 to 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and a Functional Index for Hand osteoarthritis (FIHOA) score of at least 6 in the target hand (0 to 30 scale)</P>

<P>"The main analysis for efficacy and safety was an intent-to-treat analysis. Missing follow-up assessments were replaced using the last observation carried forward (LOCF)<BR/>method. Alternative techniques of imputing missing follow-up assessments were performed to test the robustness of this assumption. We performed a sensitivity analysis using linear interpolation (mixed regression model) for missing follow-up assessments. We further performed a per-protocol completer analysis including only patients who completed the planned treatment. Overall, sensitivity analyses yielded qualitatively very similar results to those from the LOCF analysis, suggesting that results were not driven by selective dropouts or differential missing data"</P>

<BR/>Comment: The present study, along with many others on management of chronic pain (my focus of practice for 20 years) relies on patient bias. As mentioned by the authours, many patients think that "natural is better" and the marginal benefit versus placebo may be a consequence.<BR/>
<BR/>Some hard, objective end-points that illustrate lack of disease progression (unlikely reversal) on chondroitin treatment are needed e.g. Xray, MRI, etc. to correlate with patient symtom scales. These could then quantify its purported anti-inflammatory effects.<BR/>
<BR/>I agree with the conflict of interest statement below:<BR/>

<P>We appreciate the comment by Dr. Kumar. We have presented the outcomes as recommended by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group for osteoarthritis systematic reviews. These include pain, function and quality of life in addition to radiographic changes etc. Many included studies were blinded, therefore the risk of bias is reduced for outcome assessment. The main symptoms of OA are pain and functional limitation. Therefore, assessment of any therapy of OA has to include these outcomes. OA therapies are frequently assessed as symptom-modifying, structure-modifying or both. We believe that at present, the bulk of evidence supports the symptom-modifying role of chondroitin. We also agree that more data are needed to assess its structure-modifying role. We have highlighted this in the conclusions of our review</P>
