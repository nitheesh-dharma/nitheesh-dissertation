<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>For most patients with unresectable or inoperable oesophageal cancer, providing clinical benefit with palliative treatment is highly desirable. However, the optimal palliative technique for dysphagia improvement and better quality of life is not established.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Dysphagia (difficulty or discomfort in swallowing) is common among patients with unresectable or inoperable oesophageal cancer. There are five levels of dysphagia, ranging from the ability to eat a normal diet to some solids, semisolids, liquids and to complete dysphagia.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The review included randomised controlled studies comparing the use of different interventions to improve dysphagia among patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer. To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The review updates the previous version but still fails to present any obvious superiority of one technique over another among the different kinds of interventions. Self-expanding metal stents provided safer and more effective relief of dysphagia compared to rigid plastic stents. Other techniques like radiotherapy or brachytherapy were also suitable alternatives and might be favourable in improving quality of life and prolonging survival. Individual differences should be emphasised when the intervention type was determined.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Half of the studies included in this review were of high quality. Most studies did not state the methods used to seek and report quality of life outcomes and adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-09-03 22:44:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in which patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer underwent palliative treatment. Different interventions like rigid plastic intubation, self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) insertion, brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, chemotherapy, oesophageal bypass surgery, chemical and thermal ablation therapy, either head-to-head or in combination, were included. The primary outcome was dysphagia improvement. Secondary outcomes included recurrent dysphagia, technical success, procedure related mortality, 30-day mortality, adverse effects and quality of life.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-09-03 22:45:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data collection and analysis were performed in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-03 23:04:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 3684 patients from 53 studies. SEMS insertion was safer and more effective than plastic tube insertion. Thermal and chemical ablative therapy provided comparable dysphagia palliation but had an increased requirement for re-interventions and for adverse effects. Anti-reflux stents provided comparable dysphagia palliation to conventional metal stents. Some anti-reflux stents might have reduced gastro-oesophageal reflux and complications. Newly-designed double-layered nitinol (Niti-S) stents were preferable due to longer survival time and fewer complications compared to simple Niti-S stents. Brachytherapy might be a suitable alternative to SEMS in providing a survival advantage and possibly a better quality of life, and might provide better results when combined with argon plasma coagulation or external beam radiation therapy.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-09-03 23:05:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Self-expanding metal stent insertion is safe, effective and quicker in palliating dysphagia compared to other modalities. However, high-dose intraluminal brachytherapy is a suitable alternative and might provide additional survival benefit with a better quality of life. Some anti-reflux stents and newly-designed stents lead to longer survival and fewer complications compared to conventional stents. Combinations of brachytherapy with self-expanding metal stent insertion or radiotherapy are preferable due to the reduced requirement for re-interventions. Rigid plastic tube insertion, dilatation alone or in combination with other modalities, and chemotherapy alone are not recommended for palliation of dysphagia due to a high incidence of delayed complications and recurrent dysphagia.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-09-03 23:28:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oesophageal cancer was the sixth most common cause of cancer death in 2008, which led to 406,000 deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-IARC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 2008</LINK>). More than 80% of the oesophageal cancer cases occur in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-IARC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 2008</LINK>). The prognosis of oesophageal cancers is poor. Patients with such a tumour have a five-year survival rate less than 20%, with the presence of locally advanced and undetected metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Shibata-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibata 2011</LINK>). Basically, treatment with curative intention was excluded and palliation became the most suitable option (<LINK REF="REF-Weigel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weigel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2012</LINK>). Dysphagia is the predominant symptom in more than 70% of patients with oesophageal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Brierley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brierley 1998</LINK>). Many types of intervention have emerged in recent years such as newly-designed stent insertion, external beam radiation, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, laser treatment and photodynamic therapy. Desipte recent progress in therapeutic methods, the optimal intervention has not been established (<LINK REF="REF-Allum-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allum 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weigel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weigel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2012</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-09-03 23:30:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Technique developments have led to a number of interventions including self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) insertion, thermal laser therapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) and argon plasma coagulation (APC), while conventional oesophageal bypass surgery, dilatation and chemoradiotherapy have been phased out (<LINK REF="REF-Acuna_x015f_-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuna&#351; 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sur-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sur 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2012</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-09-03 23:37:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have presented evidence that SEMSs are effective, and safer compared to plastic tubes (<LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verschuur-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Verschuur 2008</LINK>). However, at the same time there were complications. Stent migration, tumour ingrowth and overgrowth may require re-intervention for recurrent dysphagia. The use of the conventional SEMS stimulated the development of the anti-reflux SEMS (<LINK REF="REF-Dua-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dua 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laasch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Laasch 2002</LINK>) and retrievable SEMS (<LINK REF="REF-Song-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2002</LINK>). High-dose intraluminal brachytherapy is considered as a suitable alternative to SEMS insertion (<LINK REF="STD-Sur-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sur 2002</LINK>), while laser treatment, despite effective dysphagia improvement, has introduced adverse effects like perforation (<LINK REF="REF-Maciel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maciel 1996</LINK>). Combinations of laser and other treatments have provided better quality of life compared to laser alone (<LINK REF="STD-Rupinski-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rupinski 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>The primary outcome of interest was improvement in dysphagia. Several dysphagia scales have been used to assess improvement in dysphagia grade across the studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bown-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bown 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mellow-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mellow 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Rourke-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Rourke 1988</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Recent studies have used these scales with modifications. We compared dichotomous outcomes extracted from the studies using 1-point and 2-point improvement in dysphagia grade for each intervention and between the studies. We expressed and compared continuous data using the mean and standard deviation. We used standardised mean difference for studies using different scales.</P>

<P>The review was designed to include published and unpublished studies, and studies published in all languages. Specialist translation help was sought to obtain data during data collection.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome was the improvement in dysphagia grades. We encountered both dichotomous and continuous data in the trials assessing dysphagia improvement. We expressed dichotomous data (1-point and 2-point or more improvement in dysphagia grade) as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If only continuous data were reported, these were expressed as mean improvement in dysphagia grade with standard deviation following each intervention and were compared between the groups at specific follow-up periods. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) to compare dysphagia improvement between studies using different grades of measurement of dysphagia.</P>

<P>Most studies had stratified their patients for tumour location and histological type during randomisation. However, there was a paucity of data reporting the outcomes separately for oesophageal versus gastro-oesophageal junction tumours or squamous versus adenocarcinoma. Hence the outcomes could not be analysed in these subgroups. Most studies included in this review did not report the method used to collect the incidence of adverse effects with the intervention used, increasing the potential for reporting bias for the outcomes related to adverse effects.</P>

Twenty-two compared two of the available modalities head-to-head and 12 compared different treatment combinations or had more than two groups for comparison.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. SEMS versus plastic tube</HEADING>
<P>Seven RCTs comparing the use of plastic tubes and SEMS were included (<LINK REF="STD-De-Palma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Palma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyika-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyika 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>) had four treatment arms comprising 18 mm SEMS (51 patients), 24 mm SEMS (53 patients), plastic tube (52 patients) and a non-stent group (47 patients). The two SEMS groups in this study (<LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>) were combined and compared with the plastic tube group. The non-stent group was excluded for this comparison and hence 433 patients from the above seven trials were included. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>) reported outcomes separately for gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. None of the studies reported outcomes separately for the different histologies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<P>All trials reported dysphagia improvement as the primary outcome but this was evaluated and reported in different ways precluding quantitative assessment of the data to obtain a pooled effect. Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK>) could be included in the quantitative analysis for the primary outcome. In a total of 231 patients, the standardised mean difference (SMD) of the dysphagia grade at four or more weeks post-intervention was -0.36 (95% CI -0.63 to -0.09, P = 0.009, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), favouring SEMS. There was no statistical heterogeneity between the two trials. However, the Shenfine study had included two separate types of stents (18 mm and 24 mm stents). In a post hoc sensitivity analysis performed by excluding either group the result remained robust.</P>
<P>Of the other studies, two (<LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyika-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyika 1999</LINK>) reported significantly greater improvement of dysphagia with SEMS insertion. The Roseveare study observed a median dysphagia grade of 1 (1 to 4) at one week in the SEMS group compared to 2 (1 to 3) in the plastic tube group (P = 0.03). They also reported that 89% of patients treated with SEMS had at worst grade 1 dysphagia compared to 50% in the plastic tube group. In <LINK REF="STD-Sanyika-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyika 1999</LINK> the mean dysphagia score was 0 at 24 hours after SEMS insertion compared to 2 after plastic tube insertion. Also the patency (dysphagia grade 0 to 2) was 90% compared to 66% in the plastic tube group. The three remaining studies (<LINK REF="STD-De-Palma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Palma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK>) did not find a significant difference in dysphagia improvement between the two groups. The evidence from the above analyses indicates that SEMS insertion is superior to plastic tube insertion in improving dysphagia in these patients.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Overall survival</HEADING>
<P>There was considerable variation in the reporting of overall survival among the seven studies. <LINK REF="STD-De-Palma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Palma 1996</LINK> found no difference in the median overall survival between patients treated with SEMS and a plastic tube (6.6 months and 6.2 months, respectively). <LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK> found no difference in the mean overall survival between patients treated with SEMS and plastic tubes (167 (standard deviation (SD) 28) days and 146 (SD 29) days respectively). <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK> reported a trend towards an increased overall survival in the SEMS group (median 107 days) compared to the plastic tube group (median 62 days). <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK> observed a significant difference in the overall survival favouring the SEMS insertion (median 96 days) compared to plastic tube insertion (41 days) (P = 0.003). <LINK REF="STD-Sanyika-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyika 1999</LINK> did not report the survival figures in their study but found 10% in each group had died at three-months follow up with a further 10% of patients lost to follow up in the plastic tube group. <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK> reported a median survival of 13.29 weeks in the SEMS group, which was significantly less than in the non-SEMS group (median 18.86 weeks). This non-SEMS group comprised 57 patients with plastic tube insertion and 52 patients undergoing a variety of other palliative modalities. No separate survival data were presented in figures for the plastic tube group. <LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK> reported no difference in the survival figures between patients treated with SEMS or plastic tubes (median 81 days and 69 days respectively).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Persistent or recurrent dysphagia</HEADING>
<P>The data for persistent or recurrent dysphagia could be extracted from all trials (<LINK REF="STD-De-Palma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Palma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyika-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyika 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK>). Recurrent dysphagia was reported in 64 patients out of 241 in the SEMS group and 95 of 192 patients in the plastic tube group. There was significant statistical heterogeneity among the studies (Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 15.97, df = 6, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 62.4%). Hence, we used a random-effects model to obtain the pooled summary statistic. The pooled OR by the random-effects model was 0.41 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.85, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), which was statistically significant (P = 0.02). When the individual studies were excluded in sensitivity analysis the results remained robust but the statistical heterogeneity remained.</P>
<P>We performed a secondary analysis using a random-effects model for studies with concealment of allocation grade A (<LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK>). This showed no significant difference between the groups for this outcome and persistence of statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.01, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 72.3%). Secondary analysis of studies with concealment of allocation not grade A (<LINK REF="STD-De-Palma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Palma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyika-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyika 1999</LINK>) showed no significant difference between the two groups for this outcome and persistence of statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.08, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 60%). This was probably due to the clinical heterogeneity amongst the studies due to the extremely low rate of recurrent dysphagia in the SEMS group (10%) as reported in the Sanyika study (<LINK REF="STD-Sanyika-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyika 1999</LINK>) and the high rate of recurrent dysphagia in the plastic tube group (66%) in the Shenfine study (<LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Technical success of intervention</HEADING>
<P>This outcome was reported by all studies. Technical success was observed in 237 out of 241 patients in the SEMS group and 181 out of 192 in the plastic tube group. This resulted in a pooled OR of 2.42 (95% CI 0.92 to 6.38). The result was not statistically significant and there was no statistical heterogeneity among the studies, (P = 0.74, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). The result was robust during the sensitivity analysis performed by deselecting each of the studies. Secondary analysis of studies with concealment of allocation grade A (<LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK>) showed no statistically significant difference between the groups but analysis of studies with concealment of allocation not grade A (<LINK REF="STD-De-Palma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Palma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyika-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyika 1999</LINK>) showed a pooled OR of 4.9 (95% CI 1.03 to 23.24). This was statistically significant (P = 0.05). This was primarily due to the extremely low success rate with plastic tube insertion (75%) in the Sanyika study (<LINK REF="STD-Sanyika-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyika 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Initial hospital stay</HEADING>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK>) reported the mean initial hospital stay in days. However, the Roseveare study did not present the SD for the mean and hence the effect could not be estimated. From the other two studies, the MD for initial length of stay was -3.05 days (95% CI -5.86 to -0.25, <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) in favour of SEMS and the result was statistically significant (P = 0.03). No statistical heterogeneity was demonstrated between the studies. Shenfine et al (<LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>) also reported median initial length of stay, but only in graphical format. This was not statistically different between the SEMS group and the plastic tube group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Procedure related mortality</HEADING>
<P>This outcome was described by all studies. The procedure related mortality was 9 out of 241 patients in the SEMS group and 16 out of 192 patients in the plastic stent group. This resulted in a pooled OR of 0.36 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.84, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>), which was statistically significant in favour of SEMS insertion. Although there was no statistical heterogeneity among the studies (P = 0.56, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%), the results probably reflect the variation among the older and the more recent studies in the methodology of the procedures. General anaesthesia and pre-stent dilatation up to 20 mm were routinely used in the studies showing higher mortality with plastic stents (<LINK REF="STD-De-Palma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Palma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK>). The other recent studies (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; Shenfine 2005) attempted to restore methodological comparability by standardising dilatation and the use of conscious sedation. No increased mortality was evident in the pooled OR from these studies. Concealment of allocation analysis for high quality studies (grade A) confirmed the overall result but this difference was not demonstrated in the analysis of low quality studies (not grade A).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Thirty-day mortality</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-day mortality was reported by four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK>). This was observed to be 33/177 in the SEMS group compared to 34/127 in the plastic tube group. The pooled OR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.18). The result was not statistically significant and there was no statistical heterogeneity among the studies (P = 0.63, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). This result remained robust for high and low quality studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>All studies reported on adverse outcomes but only one study (<LINK REF="STD-De-Palma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Palma 1996</LINK>) reported this outcome in relation to a defined timescale. In the SEMS group 152 patients had adverse events out of 241 and in the plastic group 152 out of 192 patients, resulting in a pooled OR of 0.25 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.39, <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). The results were highly statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001). Although there was no significant statistical heterogeneity among the studies, we found clinical heterogeneity among the studies in terms of actively seeking for and reporting this outcome. In particular, in <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK> there was a very high rate of adverse events in the plastic tube group but a review of the study indicated the meticulous reporting of all minor and major adverse events, and several patients might have had more than one adverse event in the early as well as the late period of reporting. However, on excluding this study in the sensitivity analyses the results remained robust. The other possible reason for the heterogeneity was the lack of uniformity in reporting minor adverse effects like chest pain and reflux, which were reported in only four studies (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanyika-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sanyika 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK>) included 37% of patients who had undergone previous chemoradiotherapy. It was possible that this might have skewed the adverse effects data. However, on excluding this study and performing a sensitivity analysis all results remained robust. This result also remained robust with sensitivity analysis performed by deselecting each of the studies and on secondary analysis for high and low quality studies.</P>
<P>Quantitative analyses on individual side effects was undertaken in this review. All studies reported on perforation rates. Three perforations were reported in 241 patients in the SEMS group compared to 14 in 192 patients in the plastic tube group. The pooled estimate was OR 0.22 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.67, <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>), which was statistically significant (P = 0.007) in favour of SEMS.</P>
<P>Migration of the prosthesis was reported in all studies. This occurred in 16 of 245 patients in the SEMS group compared to 37 of 195 in the plastic tube group. The pooled OR was 0.24 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.46, <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) favouring SEMS insertion (P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>Bolus obstruction was noted in 13 of 241 patients in the SEMS group compared to 25 of 192 in the plastic group, with a pooled OR of 0.41 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.80, <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>), which was statistically significant in favour of SEMS (P = 0.01).</P>
<P>Tumour ingrowth was noted in 8 of 137 patients in the SEMS group and 2 of 139 in the plastic stent group. The pooled OR was 3.81 (95% CI 0.89 to 16.30), which was not statistically significant (P = 0.07). Although there was no statistical heterogeneity among the studies, the higher incidence of tumour ingrowth was a result of the use of uncovered SEMS in the older studies (<LINK REF="STD-De-Palma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Palma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>). The more recent studies used a covered SEMS, which appeared to have offset this adverse event. The Shenfine study did not report any tumour ingrowth.</P>
<P>There was no statistical difference between the groups for other adverse events such as tumour overgrowth, chest pain, haemorrhage, fistula formation, aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, reflux or stent malfunction.</P>
<P>All these results remained robust on sensitivity analysis performed by deselecting each of the studies. Secondary analysis performed on high quality studies (grade A) demonstrated the same result as the overall analysis, however analysis of low quality (not grade A) studies demonstrated a statistically significant difference in favour of SEMS insertion only for the migration outcome and not for perforation or bolus obstruction.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of life (QOL)</HEADING>
<P>Only four studies reported performance scale or QOL data (<LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK> found no difference in the Karnofsky performance scales of patients before and after treatment between the SEMS and plastic tube treated patients. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK> measured QOL using the EORTC QLQ-30, a multidimensional cancer-specific QOL questionnaire, and included a oesophageal cancer-specific component. The authors found no statistical difference in any of the 26 components but reported that a trend was seen in favour of SEMSs in 21 of the 26 measured components. <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK> studied the enjoyment of swallowing between the groups at six weeks and found a significant difference between the SEMS group and the plastic tube group (89% versus 33%). They also studied QOL with the Nottingham health profile and Spitzer QL questionnaire and found no difference between the two groups.</P>
<P>Shenfine et al (<LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>) studied QOL in detail using four different questionnaires including the Spitzer QL index, Karnowsky performance scale, EuroQol EQ-5D and EORTC QLQ-30. They also used proxy and self-administered questionnaires. They reported differences in the baseline QOL index favouring the non-SEMS group and reported one-week and six-week QOL data for the different treatment groups. The mean QL index for the SEMS group at six weeks was 6.27 (SD 2.25), which was significantly lower than the QL index at baseline for the same group. The QL index in the plastic tube group at baseline reduced to a lesser extent, from 7.23 (SD 1.65) to 7.08 (SD 2.12). The authors concluded that decreased QOL in the SEMS group at six weeks, although not statistically significant, reflected the presence of pain following the intervention and that the effect of pain on QOL had significant implications for treatment with SEMS.</P>
<P>In summary, this review showed evidence that SEMS provides greater dysphagia improvement and reduced recurrent dysphagia rates compared to plastic tube insertion. Although the analyses demonstrated less procedure related mortality, this had to be viewed in perspective considering the lack of evidence to support this in the recent trials which performed plastic tube insertion under conscious sedation rather than using GA. We could not find any evidence to suggest that SEMSs are better than plastic tubes in improving overall survival or QOL. However, there was evidence to show that SEMS insertion had a lower incidence of overall adverse events and major adverse events such as perforation, migration and bolus obstruction. From the above analyses there appeared to be evidence to show that the initial hospital stay for SEMS insertion was less than that for plastic tube insertion. Overall, we concluded that SEMS insertion was safer and more effective than plastic tube insertion.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<P>Both the studies reported dysphagia improvement as the primary outcome. Quantitative analysis to estimate the pooled effect was not possible due to the variation in the reporting of this outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Adam-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 1997</LINK> reported a median (range) improvement in dysphagia score of 2 (1 to 3) in the covered SEMS group and 2 (2 to 4) in the uncovered SEMS group, both of which were significantly better (P = 0.03) compared to laser treatment (1 (0 to 2)) at one month. They also observed that similar results were noted at one week, two months and three months. <LINK REF="STD-Dallal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dallal 2001</LINK> reported the median improvement of dysphagia grade in both groups, with a score of 0 in both, hence concluding that the procedures were similar in improving the dysphagia.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions for recurrent dysphagia</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-five of 73 patients required intervention in the SEMS group and 31/52 patients received repeated intervention in the laser group. The pooled OR was 0.27 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.60, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), which was statistically significant in favour of SEMS insertion (P = 0.001). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in reporting between the trials (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> P = 0.005). This was likely to be due to the design of the studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Adam-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 1997</LINK> all patients required more than one laser treatment and these were reported as re-interventions resulting in a 100% re-intervention rate. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Dallal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dallal 2001</LINK> thermal ablation was performed on a four to six-weekly interval as required, but this was not reported as an additional unscheduled intervention.

There was no statistical heterogeneity between the studies. Data could be extracted from both studies for all other important adverse effects including perforation, fistula, haemorrhage, bolus obstruction, tumour regrowth and overgrowth.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of life (QOL)</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dallal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dallal 2001</LINK> evaluated and reported comprehensive data on QOL. The authors evaluated cancer-specific and oesophageal cancer-specific questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-30 and EORTC QLQ-OES 24) along with a generic questionnaire (SF-36) and psychometric questionnaire (Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale). The baseline QOL data were reported to be similar in the two groups. However, at one month the SEMS group was significantly worse in physical function, physical health, pain and emotional health. Results of the cancer-specific questionnaires were reported to be significantly worse in the SEMS group for fatigue, emotional, cognitive and social function, and troublesome taste. No difference was noted in dysphagia, deglutition and eating scores.</P>
<P>In summary, from the above analyses no evidence was found to suggest that either of these modalities was different to the other in improving dysphagia, recurrent dysphagia and procedure related mortality. It was uncertain if patients treated with laser had a better overall survival and QOL. There was evidence that SEMS insertion has a better technical success rate and also reduced the number of repeat interventions. We did not find any evidence from the above analysis to suggest an increase in overall adverse effect in the SEMS group although it was evident that certain adverse effects were more common in each group.</P>

Neither study reported outcomes separately with respect to the location or histology of the tumour. Quantitative analysis was not undertaken due to the variation in outcomes and reporting between the two studies. The primary outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Bergquist-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bergquist 2005</LINK> was assessment of HRQOL. This assessment also incorporated patient assessed dysphagia grade. The study did not assess or report other secondary outcomes defined in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Homs-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Homs 2004a</LINK>, in their multicentre study, observed and reported dysphagia improvement and other secondary outcomes defined in this review and, in addition, also assessed HRQOL in detail using generic and disease-specific validated questionnaires to address various aspects of health.

<LINK REF="STD-Homs-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Homs 2004a</LINK> assessed dysphagia scores at 14 days, one, three, six, nine and 12 months and reported at least 1-point dysphagia grade at one month for the two groups. Sixty-four (73%) patients in the brachytherapy group compared to 70 (76%) in the SEMS group achieved at least a 1-point improvement in dysphagia grade. This result was not statistically significant. However, they also graphically reported the trend in dysphagia grades between the two groups. A statistically significant difference in improvement of dysphagia was noted at two weeks post-intervention and better dysphagia scores were noted in the brachytherapy group from six to 12 months. The differences diminished gradually after 12 months.

Thirteen (13%) had major complications in the brachytherapy group compared to 27 (25%) in the SEMS group. This was statistically significant (P = 0.02).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of life (QOL)</HEADING>
<P>Both studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bergquist-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bergquist 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homs-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Homs 2004b</LINK>) assessed and reported QOL in detail. In the Homs study (<LINK REF="STD-Homs-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Homs 2004b</LINK>) the disease-specific EORTC OES-23 scale scores showed overall significant differences in favour of brachytherapy on the dysphagia (P = 0.009) and eating scales (P = 0.003). Other scales including deglutition, indigestion, retrosternal pain, emotional scales and single symptom scales showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups. In all patients dysphagia scales improved in both the groups until one month and gradually deteriorated subsequently. The scores on deglutition, indigestion and pain scales remained stable during follow up. The emotional scale and single symptom scale deteriorated to a moderate degree during follow up. The VAS for pain increased slightly during follow up in both groups, with a trend favouring brachytherapy (P = 0.07).</P>
<P>General HRQOL was measured using the EORTC QLQ-30 scale. This showed an overall significant difference favouring brachytherapy on four out of five scales including role functioning (P = 0.05), emotional functioning (P = 0.04), cognitive functioning (P = 0.006) and social functioning (P = 0.03). The self-rated health questionnaire EQ-5D and EQ-VAS for general health status were not significantly different between either of the groups. Overall, the general health quality deteriorated in both groups for all functional and individual symptom scales, particularly on physical and role functioning scales. These were comparatively more pronounced at six months, -28 and -30 in the stent group compared to -18 and -19 in the brachytherapy group, respectively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bergquist-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bergquist 2005</LINK> assessed dysphagia improvement as part of the EORTC OES-23 and found a statistically significant improvement (P &lt; 0.05) in dysphagia grade, ability to swallow saliva, choking and coughing with SEMS compared to baseline scores. There was no improvement in these outcomes for patients treated with brachytherapy. In an interim inter-group analysis at one month, improvement in dysphagia scale favoured the SEMS group. This result was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). At three months some of the dysphagia related parameters continued to show clinical improvement in the SEMS group but these did not achieve statistical significance. In the brachytherapy group clinically significant improvement was noted in some of the parameters related to dysphagia at three months and were maintained at six months. However, these did not achieve statistical significance.</P>
<P>General health QOL was measured using the EORTC QLQ-30 scale. In the stent group all functional scales and single symptom scales deteriorated compared to the mean scores at inclusion. The largest deterioration was found for social function, followed by pain, role function and insomnia. In the brachytherapy group, a clinically relevant deterioration was found for most variables on the function and single symptom scales, with physical function, global quality of life and pain scales reaching statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05). Only six patients of the randomised 23 patients at inclusion provided these data so the result has to be viewed in perspective.</P>
<P>In summary, the above analysis of two well-designed studies confirmed that SEMS insertion provided a swift palliation of dysphagia compared to brachytherapy. However, this difference gradually diminished over time and brachytherapy appeared to provide better dysphagia improvement and related QOL scores along with better general HRQOL scores in these gradually deteriorating patients. Also, the lower incidence of major complications substantiated the role of high-dose rate brachytherapy as a suitable alternative to SEMS insertion in the palliation of patients with advanced oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal junction cancers.</P>

<P>All the studies reported the dysphagia grade of individual patients before and after intervention, although slightly differently.

After treatment 26/40 patients had a dysphagia grade of 0 or 1 in the laser group compared to 21/40 in the plastic tube group. The pooled OR was 3.22 (95% CI 0.78 to 13.37). This was not statistically significant. Although, there was no statistical heterogeneity, there was clinical heterogeneity in the reporting of this outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Carter-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1992</LINK> reported that 19 patients out of 20 in the laser group had no dysphagia (grade 0) and one patient had dysphagia grade 1. In the plastic group they observed one patient with dysphagia grade 0 and 18 patients with grade 1. Hence they concluded significant dysphagia improvement with laser compared to a plastic tube. This was not reflected by the above analysis due to the pooling of grades 0 and 1 to reach a summary effect. <LINK REF="STD-Carter-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1992</LINK> also reported that the best median dysphagia and the median dysphagia before death were significantly worse in the plastic tube group.</P>

The authors used a linear analogue self-assessment score (LASA) at zero, two, four, six and 10 weeks. The authors reported an improvement in QOL after the index laser treatment in both the groups, and no deterioration in either group until six weeks follow up. They reported a deterioration in both groups at 10 weeks follow up without any difference between the laser and combination groups.</P>
<P>In summary, from the above analyses, laser treatment and brachytherapy were comparable in palliating dysphagia in these patients. The above analyses provided evidence to support the augmentation of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy to laser treatment to improve the dysphagia-free interval and decrease recurrence of dysphagia. There was equivocal evidence that addition of brachytherapy to laser treatment reduced the need for repeat intervention. We did not find any evidence to suggest that adding brachytherapy to laser improved overall survival and QOL or reduced the incidence of adverse effects.</P>

<P>One hundred and fifteen patients had adverse effects out of 140 treated with PDT compared to 102 out of 138 treated with laser. The pooled OR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.07, P = 0.08). This was not statistically significant. The above result was mainly due to the incidence of significant sunburn in the PDT group, which was noted in 25 of 140 patients treated with PDT. The pooled OR was 0.03 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.24, P = 0.00008, <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>). The authors also reported that most patients became photosensitive for one to two months. This was also reflected in the occurrence of fever in 22 of 140 patients treated with PDT compared to 7 of 137 treated with laser. The pooled OR for this outcome was 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.70, P = 0.006, <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>). However, there was an increased incidence of perforation in the laser group, occurring in 10/137 patients compared to 2/140 patients.

<P>Neither study reported this outcome, but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Heier-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heier 1995</LINK>) evaluated and reported the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and dietary performance. The mean change (SD) in KPS at one month was 7.2 (14.5) in the PDT group compared to -7.2 (14.3) in the laser group. This was statistically significant (P = 0.001). The mean change in dietary performance at one month was reported to be 1.8 (1.2) compared to 1 (1.5) in the laser group. This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.006).</P>
<P>In summary, from the above analysis we found no evidence to suggest any difference between PDT and laser treatment in improving dysphagia and procedure related or 30-day mortality. There was equivocal evidence to suggest that PDT decreased the need for repeated endoscopic interventions or improved QOL and dietary performance compared to laser treatment. Although the overall adverse effects were no different, it was apparent that certain adverse effects were more common in patients treated with either procedure.</P>

<P>Median survival was 132 days in patients with Ultraflex stents, 102 days in those with Polyflex stents, and 159 days in those with Niti-S stents (P = 0.13). Most patients died from tumour progression, while three patients, two with a Polyflex stent and one with an Ultraflex stent, died from stent related complications.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Persistent or recurrent dysphagia</HEADING>
<P>At a median of 79 days after stent placement, recurrent dysphagia occurred in 22/42 (52%) patients with an Ultraflex stent, 15/41 (37%) with a Polyflex stent, and 17/42 (31%) with a Niti-S stent. The difference was of statistical significance (P = 0.03). Recurrent dysphagia was caused by tissue ingrowth or overgrowth, stent migration, or food obstruction.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Technical success</HEADING>
<P>Stent placement was technically successful in 42/42 (100%) patients with an Ultraflex stent, in 34/41 (83%) patients with a Polyflex stent, and in 40/42 (95%) patients with a Niti-S stent (P = 0.008). The reasons for technical failures were that they were too proximal (Polyflex stent N = 4) or too distal (Polyflex stent N = 3, Niti-S stent N = 2). In six patients the stent was successfully repositioned with grasping forceps. In two patients the Polyflex stent was again loaded in the introducer sheath and placed successfully, while another patient was randomised to another type of Polyflex stent.</P>

<P>A total of 2/42 (5%) patients with an Ultraflex stent died in 30 days, and the 30-day mortality for the Polyflex stent group and Niti-S stent group was 17% and 5% respectively (P = 0.07).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Complications occurred in 9 (21%) patients with Ultraflex stents, in 10 (24%) with Polyflex stents, and in 9 (21%) with Niti-S stents (P = 0.89). Perforations were observed in two patients with Polyflex stents, and one of them died from septic complications. Haemorrhage occurred in five patients with Ultraflex stents and five with Polyflex stents; nobody died as a consequence of haemorrhage.</P>
<P>Stent migration occurred more frequently in patients with Polyflex stents (12/41, 29%) compared to Ultraflex stents (7/42,17%) and Niti-S stents (5/42,12%), and was mainly treated with a second stent or repositioning of the stent.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of life (QOL)</HEADING>
<P>At four weeks after stent placement, the median WHO performance scores remained the same as those before treatment, and no differences in WHO performance score were observed (P = 0.31). Following stent placement, 24/125 (19%) patients, most of whom had Niti-S stents (N = 15) or Ultraflex stents (N = 7), received six courses of additional palliative chemotherapy. After that the tumour was considered to be resectable in five patients. The surgery with curative intent was performed.</P>
<P>In summary, all three stents offered adequate palliation of dysphagia, but Polyflex stents seemed to be the least preferable as placement of the stent was technically demanding and associated with a high rate of stent migrations and haemorrhage.</P>

<P>Canto et al (<LINK REF="STD-Canto-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Canto 2002</LINK>) randomised 56 patients to either SEMS insertion or PDT. Dysphagia improved significantly for both groups but more patients in the SEMS group had normal swallowing at three weeks (P = 0.03). However, at three months the dysphagia grade was similar in both groups. Patients treated with PDT underwent re-intervention more frequently (P = 0.04). QOL decreased significantly in the stent group at three weeks (P = 0.01) but not in the PDT group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2004</LINK> randomised 53 patients with inoperable oesophageal carcinoma to either SEMS insertion alone (n = 27) or to SEMS insertion followed by chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (n = 26). The median dysphagia score improved from 3 to 0 in both groups immediately after the intervention. The overall survival at six months was 52% in both groups and 19% at one year in the SEMS only group compared to 22% in the combination treatment group. This difference was not statistically significant. Sixteen patients in the SEMS only group had complications compared to 14 in the combination group. This difference was not statistically significant.

<LINK REF="STD-Horneaux-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Horneaux 2001</LINK> randomised 40 patients with advanced squamous carcinoma to either SEMS insertion (n = 20) or oesophageal bypass surgery using the Posthelwaite technique (n = 20). The mean dysphagia score (SD) decreased significantly in both groups following the intervention. In the SEMS group dysphagia improved from 3.3 (0.9) to 1.2 (0.8) at one month, and 1.7 (0.5) at four months (P &lt; 0.001). In the surgical group, dysphagia improved from 2.5 (1.2) to 1.4 (1) at one month, and 1.1 (0.9) at four months (P = 0.002). The difference in improvement between the groups was not statistically significant. The median Karnofsky performance status improved from 50 to 75 in the SEMS group compared to the surgical group (68 to 70). No procedure related mortality was noted in either group.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Konigsrainer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Konigsrainer 2000</LINK> randomised 39 patients with inoperable advanced oesophageal carcinoma to either laser treatment and radiotherapy (n = 21), laser therapy followed by SEMS insertion (n = 8) or SEMS insertion alone (n = 10). The mean dysphagia scores (SD) at the end of treatment were 0.48 (0.12) in the laser and radiotherapy group compared to 0.40 (0.13) in the SEMS only group. This difference was not statistically significant. Recurrent dysphagia occurred in nine (43%) patients in the laser and radiotherapy group compared to 3 (16.6) in the SEMS plus laser group and one (5.5%) in the SEMS only group.

<P>In a multicentre crossover RCT, Turrisi et al (<LINK REF="STD-Turrisi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Turrisi 2002</LINK>) randomised 32 patients to either SEMS insertion or external beam radiotherapy. The median dysphagia-free survival in the stent group was 32 days compared to four days in the radiotherapy group. This difference was not statistically significant. However, median overall survival in the radiotherapy group was longer (141 days, 95% CI 188 to 209) compared to the SEMS group (101 days, 95% CI 146 to 127). Further details of this study were not available at the time of this analysis. Communication with the authors is ongoing and further details will be added at the next update of this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Javed-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 2012</LINK> randomised 37 patients to the SEMS group and 42 to SEMS plus external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). The mean dysphagia scores at baseline were 3.22  0.48 in SEMS group and 3.10  0.3 in the SEMS plus EBRT group. The dysphagia improvement was significantly different after stent placement (P &lt; 0.001). Until three months after treatment the dysphagia score was significantly lower in the SEMS plus EBRT group (P &lt; 0.002), and then the dysphagia scores remained comparable between groups. The median survival was 120 days in the SEMS group and 180 days in the SEMS plus EBRT group (P = 0.009). The authors also reported a mean dysphagia-free survival of 96.8  43 days in the SEMS group, and 118.6  55.8 days in the SEMS plus EBRT group (P = 0.054). Major complications occurred in 27 patients (35%). The authors did not report on how many minor complications there were, but no significant difference was found in the incidence of major and minor complications between the two groups (P = 0.26). <LINK REF="STD-Javed-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Javed 2012</LINK> also compared the QOL in the two groups at baseline, one week after stenting, and one week after completion of EBRT. Significant improvements were found in all QOL indices in both groups at one week. However, patients in the SEMS plus EBRT group showed significant worsening in all QOL parameters except physical functioning at one week after EBRT.</P>
<P>In summary, SEMS insertion was effective, safe and swift for palliating dysphagia compared to other modalities and avoided delays in effectively treating these patients. However, from the above analysis there appeared to be some evidence that other modalities including brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy might provide a survival advantage and possibly a better QOL compared to SEMS treatment.</P>

<P>Homs et al (<LINK REF="STD-Homs-2004c" TYPE="STUDY">Homs 2004c</LINK>) randomised 15 patients to open stents and 15 patients to anti-reflux stents. Only 12 patients underwent 24-hour pH monitoring, nine in the anti-reflux stent group and three in the open stent group. The median (range) total reflux time was 23% (0% to 65%) in the anti-reflux stent group compared to 10% (0.1% to 19%) in the open stent group, and this difference was not statistically significant. The median (interquartile range) number of reflux episodes longer than five minutes was 14 (2 to 19) in the anti-reflux stent group compared to 5 (0 to 10) in the open stent group. This result was not statistically significant. The authors reported indigestion scores assessed using the EORTC OES-23 questionnaire at 14 days. The median (interquartile range) indigestion score (0 (best) to 100 (worst)) in the anti-reflux stent group was 22 (11 to 33) compared to 11 (11 to 28) in the open stent group.

The mean (SD) score in the open stent group improved from 3.25 (0.45) at the baseline to 1 (0.6) post-procedure (P = 0.002). In the DO stent group, dysphagia improved from 3.08 (0.69) to 1.08 (0.69) after the stent insertion (P = 0.001). In the newly designed S-type anti-reflux stent group dysphagia improved from 2.83 (0.58) to 0.91 (0.51) post-procedure (P = 0.001). However, the differences in improvement amongst the three stent groups was not statistically significant.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Shim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Shim 2005</LINK> assessed the reflux symptom score in their patients using a simple Likert scale for heartburn, acid reflux, chest pain, foreign body sensation and hoarseness (scored 0 (best) to 4 (worst)). The mean (SD) reflux symptom score in the open stent group was 4.42 (3.4) at baseline and increased to 6.25 (2.7) after stent insertion. This was statistically significant (P = 0.049). In the DO stent group, the mean (SD) reflux symptom score at baseline was 5.58 (3.4) and increased to 5.75 (6.15). This result was not statistically significant (P = 0.798). In the newly designed S-type stent group, the baseline mean (SD) reflux symptom score was 5.42 (3.4) and this decreased to 2.5 (1.78) after stent insertion, which was statistically significant (P = 0.005). The difference in dysphagia improvement was superior to both the open stent and the DO stent (P = 0.005). On 24-hour pH monitoring, the DeMeester score in the open stent group was 60.44 (48.66), 105.29 (51.96) in the DO stent group, and 12 (21.51) in the newly-designed S-type anti-reflux stent group. The difference between the-newly designed S-type stent group and the other two stent groups was statistically significant in favour of the newly-designed S-type stents (P &lt; 0.001). Other outcomes during the 24-hour pH monitoring, including total number of reflux episodes, longest duration of reflux and total time with pH &lt; 4, were all less in the newly-designed S-type stent group compared to the open stent group and the DO stent group.

With regard to the types of complications, authors reported stent migration (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.50, P = 0.56, <LINK REF="CMP-008.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.6</LINK>), stent occlusion (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.49, P = 0.87, <LINK REF="CMP-008.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.6</LINK>), bleeding (OR 1.93, 95% CI 0.31 to 11.98, P = 0.48, <LINK REF="CMP-008.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.6</LINK>), oesophageal perforation (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.94, P = 0.43, <LINK REF="CMP-008.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.6</LINK>) and gastric perforation (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.94, P = 0.43, <LINK REF="CMP-008.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.6</LINK>). No statistical heterogeneity between the two studies was found. Anti-reflux stents had an advantage over standard open stents in causing stent migration and perforation.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Wenger-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wenger-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 2010</LINK> assessed the QOL with EORTC QLQ-30 and EORTC QLQ-EOS 18 questionnaires. The authors reported comparable QOL scores in the anti-reflux and open stent groups. The SMD was -0.04 (95% CI -0.42 to 0.35, P = 0.85, <LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>) and there was no statistical heterogeneity. The SMDs for the reflux score and dyspnoea score were 0.36 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.75, P = 0.07, <LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>) and -0.62 (95% CI -1.02 to -0.23, P = 0.002, <LINK REF="CMP-008.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.4</LINK>) respectively. No statistical heterogeneity was found. Therefore, there was no difference between the two treatments in improving QOL and reflux, but the anti-reflux stent had an advantage over the standard open stent in decreasing dyspnoea.</P>
<P>According to <LINK REF="STD-Power-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Power 2007</LINK>, at one week patients with the anti-reflux stent reported fewer supine gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) and heartburn symptoms. The difference was found to be significant. At two months the heartburn severity and modified DeMeester symptom score remained significantly less in the anti-reflux stent group (P &lt; 0.01). The authors also measured 24-hour pH. The acid reflux score in the anti-reflux stent group was significantly lower than that in the standard stent group. Moreover, the percentage of recording time, time in the upright position, and time in the supine position when the oesophageal pH was &lt; 4 was significantly less in the anti-reflux stent group.</P>
<P>In summary, a variety of anti-reflux stents were available and were effective in rapidly palliating dysphagia with comparable complication rates and QOL to conventional SEMSs. Although some of the stents appeared effective in reducing GER, further research is required to confirm this favourable outcome.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Barr-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Barr 1990</LINK> randomised 20 patients to laser therapy only and 20 patients to laser therapy followed by plastic tube intubation. The mean (SD) dysphagia grade in the laser group during follow up was 1.6 (1) compared to 1.7 (1) in the laser plus intubation group. This difference was not statistically significant. Recurrent dysphagia occurred in five (25%) patients in the laser group compared to nine (45%) patients in the combination group. Mean overall survival was 18.3 weeks in the laser only group compared to 16.1 in the combination group. These differences were not statistically significant. Overall complications occurred in two (10%) of the laser only group compared to eight (40%) in the laser plus intubation group. This was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05).

The dysphagia grades changed from 2.81  0.56 before APC treatment to 0.41  0.50 in the HDR plus APC group, from 2.69  0.55 to 0.38  0.50 in the PDT plus APC group, and from 2.67  0.62 to 0.44  0.51 in the APC group; no significant differences were found between the groups. The median dysphagia-free period was 88 days in the HDR plus APC group, 59 days in the PDT plus APC group, and 35 days in the APC group (P = 0.006).</P>
<P>In one month there were four deaths, one from the HDR plus APC group, one from the PDT plus APC group, and two from the APC group. No difference was found to be significant. The median survival was 6.2 months (4.4 to 9.9) in the HDR plus APC group, 5.2 months (4.4 to 9.9) in the PDT plus APC group, and 6.0 months (2.0 to 9.2) in the APC group (P = 0.27).</P>
<P>At the 30-day follow up after completing treatment the QOL (Spitzer Quality of Life Index (SQLI)) had declined in all three groups compared to immediately after recanalisation.

The only major complication was fever, which occurred in three patients in the HDR plus APC group. Minor complications were observed significantly more frequently in the PDT plus APC group compared to the APC group (P &lt; 0.001), such as worsening dysphagia, pain and skin sensitivity.</P>
<P>One RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Amdal-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Amdal 2013</LINK>) allocated 21 patients to an experimental stent with brachytherapy and 20 to brachytherapy.

<P>Three RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sur-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sur 2004</LINK>) compared brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sur-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sur 2004</LINK>) reported comparable data and were included in a quantitative analysis. Because there was heterogeneity (Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 3.03, df = 1, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 67%) in stricture occurrence, a random-effects model was applied and the OR was 1.43 (95% CI 0.16 to 12.85, P = 0.75, <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>). For fistula the OR was 1.34 (95% CI 0.57 to 3.16, P = 0.51, <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>); no statistical heterogeneity was found.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sur-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sur 2004</LINK> measured dysphagia-free survival at six months. More than 50% of patients showed dysphagia-free survival at six months in the brachytherapy as well as the brachytherapy plus EBRT group. This result did not show any statistically significant difference. The overall survival in the brachytherapy group was 7.2 months compared to 7.5 months in the EBRT group. This difference was not statistically significant. Seven patients developed strictures and three patients developed fistula due to tumour progression in the brachytherapy group compared to four and one respectively in the EBRT group. These differences were not statistically significant. The authors also performed multivariate and univariate analysis for factors predicting an impact on the outcomes. Presenting weight and performance were the factors having an impact on overall survival.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 2010</LINK> allocated 109 patients to the HDR brachytherapy group and 110 to the HDR brachytherapy plus EBRT group. The authors reported that at 100 days, the DRE was 66.7% in the HDR brachytherapy group and 82.7% with EBRT. At 200 days the indices were 51.8% and 69.6% respectively, and at 300 days they were 36.9% and 55.9%, indicating a continued benefit in the HDR brachytherapy plus EBRT group. The mean dysphagia and mean odynophagia scores were 1.23 and 0.81 for the HDR brachytherapy group and 0.79 and 0.58 for the HDR brachytherapy plus EBRT group, and the mean regurgitation and mean Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores were 0.72 and 1.29 for the former, and 0.36 and 0.89 for the latter respectively, indicating a greater improvement in the HDR brachytherapy plus EBRT group. There was no significant difference between the two groups on overall survival (P = 0.35). The authors also reported step-wise regression showing that overall survival was significantly influenced by age (P = 0.002) and ECOG score (P = 0.038). There were many kinds of complications but no significant difference was found between groups in their occurrence. Dilatation and fistulae had the highest incidence rate.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2008</LINK> randomised 20 patients to arm A: external radiotherapy plus HDR brachytherapy, 21 to arm B: brachytherapy, and 21 to arm C: external radiotherapy. The authors used the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-OES 18 to assess QOL before radiation, at the end of radiation, and three months after treatment. With regard to the QLQ-C30, the mean global health status scores improved at the completion of treatment compared to before treatment, and at three months after treatment only arm C had a decreased score. The mean social functioning score changed from 43 before treatment to 54 at three months in arm A. In arm B it increased from 42 to 46 at three months, and in arm C from 29 to 41. Other symptoms like fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss and constipation achieved improvements after treatment. With regard to the QLQ OES 18, arm A (57.6%) had the maximum improvement in dysphagia scores. It was 54.4% in arm B, and minimum (24%) in arm C at three months after radiotherapy. Improvements in eating problems were 20.6% and 43.1% at the first follow up and at three months respectively in arm A, and 13.4% and 31.3% in arm B, and 10% and 20% in arm C. Reflux symptom scores had a deterioration in all three groups, but improvements were seen later in arm B and arm C.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-05 12:26:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most patients with oesophageal or gastro-oesophageal junction carcinoma are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Palliative treatment is greatly desirable. This review aims to update the previous review published in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Sreedharan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sreedharan 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rigid plastic tube insertion was the traditional endoscopic palliation treatment for malignant dysphagia. In this review, plastic tube insertion was reported to be less safe and effective than SEMS insertion due to the high occurrence of recurrent dysphagia and major adverse events. One new study (<LINK REF="STD-Verschuur-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Verschuur 2008</LINK>) showed that the Polyflex stent was the least preferable choice compared to Ultraflex or the Niti-S stent as the Polyflex was technically demanding and associated with high rates of stent migration. According to <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>, the high incidence of late complications due to migration of plastic tubes resulted in an overall increase in recurrent dysphagia in the non-SEMS treatment groups. Plastic tubes did not contribute to improvement in dysphagia when combined with other modalities, and even caused more complications. This review further proves that plastic tube insertion is not an effective intervention for improvement in dysphagia in comparison to other modalities.</P>
<P>Thermal and chemical ablative techniques including laser, photodynamic therapy (PDT) and ethanol injection had greater requirements for re-intervention and expertise than SEMS insertion. Brachytherapy has been found to be effective for palliation in these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rupinski-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rupinski 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sur-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sur 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sur-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sur 2004</LINK>). Better improvement in dysphagia and decreased complication rates were identified with brachytherapy treatment compared to SEMS (<LINK REF="STD-Bergquist-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bergquist 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homs-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Homs 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homs-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Homs 2004b</LINK>), however this procedure is not widely available. As reported in <LINK REF="REF-Suntharalingam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suntharalingam 2003</LINK>, of 59 US hospitals only 6% had access to brachytherapy. The combination of brachytherapy and external radiotherapy presented a trend towards better quality of life and consistent relief from dysphagia (<LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2008</LINK>), and the combination was well tolerated and safe (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>SEMS insertion is the most common intervention for palliation of dysphagia in inoperable oesophageal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bergquist-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bergquist 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK> reported that SEMS insertion groups had shorter time periods from inclusion to commencement of treatment and from randomisation to treatment than non-SEMS groups. The differences were statistically significant. It is worth noting that many newly-designed stents have come into use, like the irradiation stent, anti-reflux stent and Niti-S stent. <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2008</LINK> reported that a stent loaded with <SUP>125</SUP>I had potential benefit in that it provided a slightly longer relief of dysphagia and extended survival. Both covered and double-layered Niti-S stents were effective for malignant dysphagia, nonetheless double-layered Niti-S stents were preferable due to longer survival time and fewer complications (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009</LINK>). Although some anti-reflux stents were seemingly functional, further research is required to confirm the outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Power-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Power 2007</LINK>). Most newly-designed stents were as effective as SEMS and, more importantly, they provided new perspectives for palliative treatment.</P>
<P>In this review quality of life data are reported as a secondary outcome. Several generic (<LINK REF="REF-Aaronson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaronson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blazeby-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blazeby 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwarz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarz 2001</LINK>) and disease-specific (<LINK REF="REF-Blazeby-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blazeby 2003</LINK>) tools have been developed to measure this parameter. In this review we found 10 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barr-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Barr 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergquist-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bergquist 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dallal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dallal 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heier-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heier 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homs-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Homs 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roseveare-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roseveare 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wenger-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 2010</LINK>) using a variety of validated questionnaires to measure quality of life. Quality of life is a major reflection of the patients' prognostic situation. We need to include a comprehensive assessment of this outcome using validated questionnaires. Also, the review suggests that some aspects of quality of life are improved, shown in patients treated with non-SEMS modalities, particularly brachytherapy, compared to SEMS insertion alone.</P>
<P>No absolute superiority of any particular intervention was shown in the review, but it is feasible that combinations of different modalities would provide better treatment results. Several studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sander-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sander 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1998</LINK>) have shown that augmentation of laser treatment with brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Sargeant-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sargeant 1997</LINK>) increases the dysphagia-free interval and reduces the need for re-intervention for recurrent dysphagia. <LINK REF="STD-Rupinski-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rupinski 2011</LINK> has shown that argon plasma coagulation with photodynamic therapy and argon plasma coagulation with brachytherapy produced better dysphagia improvement and fewer complications.</P>
<P>Cost-effectiveness was not studied in detail in this review. Shenfine et al (<LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>) observed a statistically significant increased initial cost and total intervention cost in the SEMS group but thecost of hospital stay and total costs were comparable for the SEMS and non-SEMS treatment groups. Wenger et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wenger-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 2006</LINK>) observed SEMS insertion to be cost-effective in palliating patients with inoperable oesophageal or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.</P>
<P>The combination of different modalities to palliate these patients is faced with several challenges. For example, there is still no evidence to recommend the appropriate timing of SEMS insertion in combination with other modalities. Non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kozarek-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kozarek 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raijman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raijman 1997</LINK>) have reported conflicting results regarding complication rates after SEMS insertion among patients who have undergone previous chemoradiotherapy; and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Shenfine-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shenfine 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siersema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Siersema 1998</LINK>) have reported an increased rate of device related complications after SEMS insertion in patients previously treated with chemoradiotherapy. It is also important to note that the last review suggested that temporary SEMS insertion achieved a good palliative situation enabling further interventions to be administered, but no further studies were found. As a consequence, additional RCTs are needed to confirm this.</P>
<P>In the updated review, due to different methods of expressing outcomes, some quantitative analysis were not possible. Also, newly-designed stents need to be subdivided and compared in future studies. Cost-effectiveness assessment was not conducted.</P>

<P>Self-expanding metal stent insertion is a safe, effective and swift treatment in dysphagia palliation compared to other modalities, and high-dose intraluminal brachytherapy is a suitable alternative with fewer requirements for re-intervention, additional survival benefits and a better quality of life. Rigid plastic tube insertion, chemotherapy alone, and combination chemoradiotherapy and bypass surgery are not recommended for palliation of dysphagia due to a high incidence of delayed complications and recurrent dysphagia.</P>
<P>Palliative treatment for patients with inoperable oesophageal or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer should achieve improvements in dysphagia and quality of life. This updated review has not shown an obvious superiority of any of the interventions over others. Individual differences should be emphasised when the intervention type is determined.</P>
