<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Schizophrenia is a serious, chronic and relapsing mental illness with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about one percent. <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>First generation 'typical' antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been the mainstay of treatment up until the introduction of the second generation 'atypical' antipsychotics such as risperidone and olanzapine. Typical and atypical antipsychotics do provide a treatment response for most people with schizophrenia, whether that is a reduction in psychotic episodes or a lessening in the severity of their illness. However, a proportion of people still do not respond adequately to antipsychotic medication. Additionally, atypical and especially typical antipsychotics are associated with serious adverse effects which can often compromise compliance with medication and therefore increase the incidences of relapse.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Treatment of people with schizophrenia using older typical antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol can be problematic. Many fail to respond to these older antipsychotics and more people experience disabling adverse effects. Aripiprazole is said to be one of a new generation of atypical antipsychotics with good antipsychotic properties and minimal adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (September 2005) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. We contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, the FDA and authors of trials for additional information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All clinical randomised trials comparing aripiprazole with placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Despite the fact that 7110 people participated in fifteen randomised aripiprazole studies, we were unable to extract any usable data on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment; economic outcomes or cognitive functioning. Study attrition was very large and data reporting poor. Compared with placebo, aripiprazole significantly decreased relapse in both the short and medium term (n=300, 1 RCT, RR 0.66 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 5 CI 4 to 8). It also produced better compliance with study protocol (n=2271, 8 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.5 to 0.97, NNT 26 CI 16 to 239). Aripiprazole may decrease prolactin levels below that expected from placebo (n=305, 1 RCT, RR 0.32 CI 0.1 to 0.8, NNT 14 CI 11 to 50). Compared with typical antipsychotics there were no significant benefits for aripiprazole with regards to global state, mental state, quality of life or leaving the study early. Both groups reported similar rates of adverse effects, with the exception of akathisia (n= 955 RR 0.31 CI 0.2 to 0.6, NNT 20 CI 17 to 32) and the need for antiparkinson medication (n=1854, 4 RCTs, RR 0.45 CI 0.3 to 0.6, NNT 4 CI 3 to 5) which were lower in those receiving aripiprazole. When compared with olanzapine and risperidone, aripiprazole was no better or worse on outcomes of global state and leaving the study early. The rates of adverse effects were also similar, with the exception of less elevation of prolactin (n=301, 1 RCT, RR 0.04 CI 0.02 to 0.1, NNT 2 CI 1 to 2.5) and less prolongation of the average QTc (30 mg/day) (n=200, 1 RCT, WMD -10.0, CI -16.99 to -3.0) compared with risperidone. When compared with standard care (mixed group receiving typical and atypical antipsychotics) one aripiprazole study did have significantly less people not responding to treatment (n=1599, RR 0.70 CI 0.7 to 0.8, NNT 5 CI 4 to 6 ), not satisfied with care (n=1599, RR 0.62 CI 0.6 to 0.7, NNT 4 CI 4 to 5) and less people leaving the study early (n=1599, 1 RCT, RR 0.81 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 13 CI 8 to 39). Results from the five new papers identified from the updated review search, did not significantly alter the main results or conclusions of the original review.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Aripiprazole may be effective for the treatment of schizophrenia, but it does not differ greatly from typical and atypical antipsychotics with respect to treatment response, efficacy or tolerability. In comparison with typical antipsychotics, aripiprazole may have a lower risk of akathisia, and in comparison to atypical antipsychotics, less risk of raised prolactin and prolongation of the QTc interval. Clearly reported pragmatic short, medium and long term randomised controlled trials should be undertaken to determine its position in everyday clinical practice.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-02 18:16:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>'Conventional' antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have traditionally been used as a first line treatment for people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kane-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1993</LINK>). However, approximately<B> </B>5 - 25% of people with schizophrenia show poor response to these treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Christison-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christison 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Davis-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 1992</LINK>). In addition, adverse effects such as movement disorders and sedation often make compliance with these medications problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1990</LINK>). Although their efficacy in alleviating positive schizophrenic symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations) is reasonably clear, their effect on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (such as apathy and poverty of speech) is limited (<LINK REF="REF-Crow-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crow 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1985</LINK>). </P>
<P>'Atypical' or 'second generation' antipsychotics include drugs such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, amisulpiride and ziprasidone. Initially, these were said to differ from typical antipsychotics in that they were found not to cause movement disorders (catalepsy) in rats at clinically effective doses. Other more clinically-important distinguishing factors include their reputed effects on both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (although this is far from certain), their more limited adverse effect profiles, particularly in relation to movement disorders, and the possibility that these drugs may improve cognitive function (<LINK REF="REF-Gelder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelder 2001</LINK>). These atypical drugs however are far from ideal, and problematic adverse effects do occur. With the exception of ziprasidone, most atypicals are associated with marked weight gain and disruption of glucose metabolism that may lead to diabetes. Clozapine, which is used for people whose illness is 'treatment-resistant', may induce life-threatening decreases in white blood cells (agranulocytosis) as well as heart problems (acute myocarditis, cardiomyopathy) and diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Rivas_x002d_Vasquez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivas-Vasquez 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Aripiprazole is claimed to be at least as effective as haloperidol for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as fixed, false beliefs (delusions) and perceptions without cause (hallucinations). It is also effective for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as apathy and slowing and paucity of movement and thought. It has also been suggested that aripiprazole may be associated with fewer movement disorders (parkinsonism, dystonias, tardive dyskinesia), less weight gain and reduced negative effects on the heart (QTc interval abnormalities) and on glucose metabolism compared with standard antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Rivas_x002d_Vasquez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivas-Vasquez 2003</LINK>). In addition, Aripiprazole is said to be useful in both the acute and maintenance phases of schizophrenia, and to have cognitive-enhancing effects.</P>
<P>Technical background<BR/>Aripiprazole is a new antipsychotic which is currently being marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical and Bristol-Myers Squibb. It is said to be the prototype of a new third generation of antipsychotics; the so-called dopamine-serotonin system stabilisers. It is reported to exert its antipsychotic effects by acting as a partial agonist at D2 dopamine- and 5-HT1a serotonin receptors, and as an antagonist at 5-HT2 serotonin receptors. It has been postulated that, through the above receptor site actions, and hence dopamine and serotonin system stabilisation, a partial D2 agonist would be able to act as an antagonist in pathways where an abundance of dopamine was producing psychosis, yet it would stimulate receptors as an agonist at sites in which low dopaminergic tone would produce side effects (e.g. areas mediating motor movement and prolactin release)<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Rivas_x002d_Vasquez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivas-Vasquez 2003</LINK>). Aripiprazole, however, also has an affinity to other receptors including D3, D4, 5-HT2c, 5-HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and H1 histamine receptors. This may explain adverse effects associated with this compound such as somnolescence, headache, gastrointestinal upset and light-headedness (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2002-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2002 a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recommended target dose for aripiprazole is 10-15 mg per day (dose range 10-30 mg). Phase III trials were initially conducted in Japan in 1995, and the drug was granted Approvable Status by the FDA (USA) on the 15th November 2002, for the treatment of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2002-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2002 a</LINK>). Aripiprazole has since been licensed in most countries worldwide.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the effects of aripiprazole compared to placebo and conventional antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included all relevant randomised controlled trials. Where a trial was described as 'double-blind', but it was implied that the study was randomised, we included the trial in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes (see 'types of outcome measures') when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then we included these in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, we only analysed clearly randomised trials and described the results of the sensitivity analysis in the text. We excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included people with schizophrenia and other types of schizophrenia-like psychoses (schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders).

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>[For definitions of terms used in this, and other sections, please refer to the Glossary] </P>
<P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>Material downloaded from electronic sources included details of author, institution or journal of publication. </P>
<P>The principal reviewer (HGE) inspected all reports. These were then re-inspected by CM in order to ensure reliable selection. We resolved any disagreement by discussion, and where there was still doubt, we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained, we (HGE and CM) decided whether the studies met the review criteria. If disagreement could not be resolved by discussion, we sought further information and these trials were added to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality <BR/>We assessed the methodological quality of included trials in this review using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) and the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The categories are defined below: </P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results) <BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment). For the purpose of the analysis in this review, trials were included if they met the Cochrane Handbook criteria A or B. </P>
<P>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scale includes three items:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind? <BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop outs?</P>
<P>Each item receives one point if the answer is positive. In addition, a point can be deducted if either the randomisation or the blinding/masking procedures described are inadequate. For this review we used a cut-off of two points on the Jadad scale to check the assessment made by the Handbook criteria. However, the Jadad Scale was not used to exclude trials. </P>
<P>3. Data collection <BR/>HGE independently extracted data from selected trials, while CM separately re-extracted information from two different samples (10%). When disputes arose we attempted to resolve these by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, data were not entered and we added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>4. Data synthesis <BR/>4.1 Data types<BR/>We assessed outcomes using continuous (for example changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (for example, one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such as 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change') or dichotomous (for example, either 'no important changes' or 'important changes' in a person's behaviour) measures. Currently RevMan does not support categorical data so we were unable to analysis this.</P>
<P>4.2 Incomplete data <BR/>We did not include trial outcomes if more than 40% of people were not reported in the final analysis. </P>
<P>4.3 Dichotomous - yes/no - data <BR/>We carried out an intention to treat analysis. On the condition that more than 60% of people completed the study, everyone allocated to the intervention were counted, whether they completed the follow up or not. It was assumed that those who dropped out had the negative outcome, with the exception of death. Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. If the authors of a study had used a predefined cut off point for determining clinical effectiveness this was used by the reviewers where appropriate. Otherwise it was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score, this could be considered as a clinically significant response. Similarly, a rating of 'at least much improved' according to the Clinical Global Impression Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>) was considered as a clinically significant response.</P>
<P>The relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated based on the random effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios which tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. We inspected data to see if an analysis using a fixed effects model made any substantive difference in outcomes that were not statistically significantly heterogeneous. When the overall results were significant we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number-needed-to-harm (NNH) as the inverse of the risk difference. </P>
<P>4.4 Continuous data <BR/>4.4.1 Normally distributed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is difficult to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants would have been entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data poses less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and would have been entered into a synthesis.</P>
<P>For change data (endpoint minus baseline), the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if data are skewed, though this is likely. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, the reviewers presented change data in MetaView in order to summarise available information. In doing this, it was assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analyses could cope with the unknown degree of skew. Without individual patient data it is impossible to test this assumption. Where both change and endpoint data were available for the same outcome category, only endpoint data were presented. The reviewers acknowledge that by doing this much of the published change data were excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. Authors of studies reporting only change data are being contacted for endpoint figures. Non-normally distributed data were reported in the 'other data types' tables. </P>
<P>4.4.2 Rating scales: A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, or even ad hoc. For outcome instruments some minimum standards have to be set. It has been shown that the use of rating scales which have not been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) are associated with bias, therefore the results of such scales were excluded. Furthermore, we stipulated that the instrument should either be a self report or be completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist), and that the instrument could be considered a global assessment of an area of functioning. However, as it was expected that therapists would frequently also be the rater, such data were included but commented on as 'prone to bias'. </P>
<P>Whenever possible we took the opportunity to make direct comparisons between trials that used the same measurement instrument to quantify specific outcomes. Where continuous data were presented from different scales rating the same effect, both sets of data were presented and the general direction of effect inspected.</P>
<P>4.4.3 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups was estimated, again based on the random effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. </P>
<P>4.5 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. Then visual inspection of graphs was used to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, we did not summate data, but presented the data separately and investigated the reasons for heterogeneity.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias <BR/>We entered data from all identified and selected trials into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses <BR/>Results for high doses (however 'high' was defined in the study or, if such a definition was not presented, greater than 15 mg aripiprazole per day) were compared to those for lower doses with regard to the primary outcome of relapse. </P>
<P>8. General <BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for aripiprazole.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>For substantive descriptions of the studies please see Included and Excluded Studies tables.</P>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>We excluded nine studies from the review. Three were review articles (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-a" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petrie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Petrie 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2003</LINK>). One study was excluded because participants were healthy volunteers (<LINK REF="STD-Mallikaarjun-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mallikaarjun 2000</LINK>). We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Auby-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Auby 2002</LINK> because, although randomised, it evaluated one dose of aripiprazole versus another and also reported no data that could be included. We will contact the authors for further information. <LINK REF="STD-Stroup-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stroup 2003</LINK> was excluded from the study as participants who received aripiprazole in this trial were not randomised at that stage. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2003</LINK> since the study described was a review of other short term studies, not an original research article. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Casey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Casey 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Saha-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Saha 2004</LINK> from this version of the review as different administration regimens of aripiprazole were randomised rather than the new drug versus others or placebo.</P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>Fourteen studies currently await assessment. All reports are minimal and contain no usable data. It is impossible to know if some of these represent further reports of already included or excluded studies. Interestingly, only three of these reports were initially identified by our standard but comprehensive database search (<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ramamurthy-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ramamurthy 2000</LINK>). The other eleven studies were found after a search of the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) USA web site. These studies have been identified numerically only. Where possible, relevant sources will be contacted for further information. We have already contacted Bristol-Myers Squibb and the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company for more information on their trials. </P>
<P>3. Ongoing studies<BR/>We have identified five ongoing studies. All these reports were identified on the FDA web site and are only identified by a study number. Bristol-Myers Squibb and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company have been contacted for more information.</P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>We identified fifteen studies that we could include. All were described as randomised and all but three as being double-blind. <LINK REF="STD-Kern-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stock 2005</LINK> were open-label studies. One of the double-blind studies (<LINK REF="STD-Adson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adson 2003</LINK>) allowed the option of open-label administration of aripiprazole during weeks three to six of the study for people who had not responded to treatment. </P>
<P>4.1 Length of trials<BR/>Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness that affects young people. Ten studies reported data on short-term follow-up (up to 12 weeks), three on medium-term follow-up (13 to 26 weeks) and two studies reported data on long-term follow-up (over 26 weeks, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stock 2005</LINK>). Two studies involved the administration of intramuscular aripiprazole and had extremely short follow-up periods (<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>). Some of the ongoing studies may involve medium or long-term follow-up. </P>
<P>4.2 Participants<BR/>Eight of the fifteen included studies involved participants without clearly operationalised diagnoses (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kern-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McQuade-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McQuade 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stock 2005</LINK>). All but six trials included people with a sole diagnosis of schizophrenia. The remaining six studies included patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000-a" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000 a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kern-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK>). The majority of participants in most studies were male, and had a mean age in their late thirties to early forties. In nine trials we could not elicit definitive exclusion criteria from available reports (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Kern-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McQuade-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McQuade 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stock 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Adson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adson 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK> required people taking part in the trial to have had a history of response to other antipsychotics excluding clozapine, whereas another study excluded participants if they had previously been resistant to clozapine therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>). In the same vein, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK> excluded people with a history of resistance to anti-psychotic medication. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK>) included participants who were due to be prescribed antipsychotics for the first time, or for whom a change of medication was deemed appropriate. Most people in these studies were moderately to severely ill and many were acutely ill.</P>
<P>4.3 Setting<BR/>Eight of the fifteen studies were described as occurring in hospital or inpatient settings (<LINK REF="STD-Adson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adson 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000-a" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000 a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK>). Two trials took place in out-patient or mixed settings (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK>) and we could find no explicit information on the settings of the remaining studies. </P>
<P>4.4 Study size<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK> with 1599 participants and <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK> with 1294 people were by far the largest studies. <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK> randomised only 103. All the remaining studies included between 200 and 500 participants.</P>
<P>4.5 Interventions<BR/>The trialists administered aripiprazole in a wide range of doses from 1mg per day to 30 mg per day. Comparators were placebo, conventional antipsychotics, (haloperidol (6.5-20 mg/day) and perphenazine (8-64 mg/day)) and the newer generation antipsychotics (olanzapine (10-20 mg/day) and risperidone (6 mg/day)). Most drugs were given orally, however in two studies medication was given intramuscularly (<LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>). In one open label, naturalistic study, patients were randomised to a safety control group which included antipsychotic medications (both typical and atypical) chosen by the investigator (<LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK>). The medications used in the safety control group were known to include zisprasidone, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, clozapine at varying doses. </P>
<P>4.6 Outcomes<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK> compared aripiprazole with placebo and reported usable data on global state and mean change in CGI. <LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK> also reported data for global state, Clinical Global Impression 'improvement scale' (CGI-I). No other study explicitly reported usable data on this outcome. We have used 'poor compliance with study protocol due to lack of efficacy, deterioration or psychosis' as a global outcome because, surprisingly, there were no more data relevant to global outcomes to be found in any of the reports. <B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Of all the studies only <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>, comparing aripiprazole with perphenazine, reports usable mental state data. A mental state response was derived from a CGI score of 1-2 or a 30% decrease in PANSS. The validity of this dichotomising from these measures may be widely accepted but is, nevertheless not investigated. </P>
<P>Four studies report usable data on adverse effects but only those spontaneously reported in more than 5-10% of participants. This design precludes reporting of important less frequent effects. Three studies reported usable weight gain data. In <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kern-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2001</LINK> weight gain of at least 7% was documented as being clinically significant. <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK> reported the mean change in body weight. </P>
<P>All but one included study provides usable data on leaving the study early. </P>
<P>One study reported data on Quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>). The Quality of Life Scale data were dichotomised and a clinically significant improvement in this scale was defined as being at least a 20% improvement from baseline. </P>
<P>4.6.1 Outcome scales: details of the only scales that provided usable data are shown below. Reasons for exclusions of data are given under 'Outcomes' in the 'Included studies' table.</P>
<P>4.6.1.1 Global state - Clinical Global Impression Scale - CGI Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>).<BR/>This is used to assess both severity of illness and clinical improvement, by comparing the conditions of the person standardised against other people with the same diagnosis. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores showing decreased severity and/or overall improvement. A CGI-I (CGI-Improvement) score was also validated for used in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK> reported usable data for this outcome.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2 Mental state - Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)<BR/>This schizophrenia scale has 30 items, each of which can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from 1 - absent to 7 - extreme. This scale can be divided into 3 sub-scales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P), and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A low score indicates lesser severity. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.1.3 Quality of life - Quality of Life Scale -QLS, (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1984</LINK>)<BR/>This is a semi structured interview administered and rated by trained clinicians. It contains 21 items rated on a 7-point scale based on the interviewers judgement of patient functioning. A total QLS and four sub-scale scores are calculated, with higher scores indicating less impairment. <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>4.6.2 Redundant data<BR/>Enormous efforts were invested in studies rating and recording data that are then reported in such a way as to render them useless for reviews such as this. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000-a" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000 a</LINK> the trialists compare aripiprazole with both haloperidol and placebo. Outcomes such as death, clearly of interest, were reported in an obscure manner so we could not be sure of either the number of deaths or the groups in which they took place. We are only sure that they did take place. At a meeting held with workers from the Outcomes Research department of Bristol Myers Squibb pharmaceuticals (UK) on the 27th October 2004 in Leeds, we requested further clarification on numerous data that appeared on the FDA website. In particular, we were concerned by the high death rates observed in the two studies we identified by FDA study number. It was jointly agreed that this information (as well as other important data) would be provided to us when located by company staff. We did not hear from the company again until we published a short version of this review in a conference (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Sayeh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Sayeh 2006</LINK>). Thereafter, in May 2006, one author (H E-S) and editor (CEA) met with representatives of Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Limited. These representatives were most helpful in clarifying data on the FDA website specifically on death which, on further evaluation, do not suggest an increased risk of mortality as indicated in the conference review (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Sayeh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Sayeh 2006</LINK>). They also encouraged the reviewers to ask for more data. We have amended this version and hope to do so again in light of more data provided by industry, especially on those studies that await assessment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000-a" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000 a</LINK> reported continuous measures of global state (CGI) but no variances are reported. The same applies to their repeated measures of mental state (BPRS, BPRS-PANNS), general functioning (CGI) and adverse effects (Simpson-Angus scale, Barnes Akathisia scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement scale) and other outcome measures including changes in body weight, serum prolactin, and QTc interval changes. This poor reporting is by no means unique to <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000-a" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000 a</LINK> (see Included Studies table, Outcomes). Other problems have included the use of non-externally validated outcome scales such as the POMS (<LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK>). Participants in trials may be appalled to know how much of their data has been rendered useless. It is possible that there is a systematic bias in which data, such as the simple binary outcome of death, are not reported well.<B> <BR/>
</B>
<BR/>4.6.3 Missing outcomes<BR/>No usable outcomes were found for the following categories: death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment, economic outcomes and cognitive functioning. </P>
<P>4.6.4 Primary outcomes<BR/>Our primary outcome of relapse was only reported in <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK> which compares aripiprazole with placebo. All other outcomes in this review were of secondary importance to the reviewers but we do recognise that they may be of primary interest to others.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>All included studies were said to be randomised. None of the included studies, however, explicitly detailed the method of randomisation. No studies stated that those in charge of allocation were blind to the participant list. This concealment of allocation has repeatedly been shown to be of key importance in excluding selection biases (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jni 2001</LINK>). Therefore all trials were category B (moderate risk of bias - some doubt about the results - see Methods). This was confirmed by poor ratings on the Jadad Scale (see Included Studies table). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK>) randomised participants in a 4:1 ratio to aripiprazole and standard care. Participants who were randomised to standard care received a dose and type of medication which was determined by the investigator and hence were not being randomised to a particular medication.</P>
<P>2. Blindness<BR/>Ten studies were described as being double-blind (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2000-a" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2000 a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kujawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kujawa 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McQuade-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McQuade 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK>). Three trials were described as open-label (<LINK REF="STD-Kern-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stock 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Adson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Adson 2003</LINK> was described as double-blind, but people who showed no improvement or worsening of their symptoms by the third week were offered the option of open-label treatment with aripiprazole during the last three weeks of the study. In <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> the randomised double-blind treatment phase with aripiprazole was preceded by a 4-6 week open label atypical antipsychotic treatment phase to confirm treatment-resistance, and then by a 2-10 day single-blind placebo-washout phase. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Stock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stock 2005</LINK>) included patients in an open-label study who had previously undergone double-blind treatment. In none of the studies was testing of the blinding reported. If blinding is recognised to be of such importance for minimising observation bias, it could be expected that testing of this blinding would be a priority.</P>
<P>3. Loss to follow up<BR/>Several of the included studies reported data in terms of a last observation carried forwards (LOCF) analysis and an OC analysis (observed cases, defined as those completing the trial). Although LOCF analyses are commonly used to account for missing observations, this technique could introduce bias as considerable assumptions are made about people who did not stay in the study. We saw no reporting of attempts to validate assumptions by following up people who did drop out early. In some included studies, dropout rates were more than 40%. Using LOCF, 40% of the data on certain outcomes are assumed and we feel that this amount of fabricated data is too much. We have excluded these data. We tried to undertake an intention-to-treat analysis. Where no data were available for proportions of 40%, we have assumed a negative outcome (see Methods). </P>
<P>The reasons for loss to follow up are reasonably well reported and we have recorded these in the outcomes. </P>
<P>4. Data reporting <BR/>Overall much of the data we found could not be used because of poor reporting. Findings which are presented as graphs, in percentiles or just reported as p-values are often of little use to a reviewer. Many studies failed to provide standard deviations when reporting mean changes on a particular outcome measure. We are seeking further data from the first authors of relevant trials.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1. The search<BR/>The initial search resulted in over 400 citations. We were only able to include six of these in the review. On contacting the FDA, we were provided with references to a large number of potentially relevant studies both in English and Japanese. From these we were able to obtain enough information to include two more studies. We made direct contact with the relevant drug companies (Otsuka Pharmaceuticals and Bristol Myers-Squibb) in order to obtain information, and were provided with published as well as unpublished data from a limited selection of English language conference posters and papers. This allowed us to include two further studies. Many studies are multiply reported in different media. In the update search (September 2005) we identified a further five studies to include in this review.</P>
<P>2. COMPARISON 1: ARIPIPRAZOLE versus PLACEBO</P>
<P>2.1 Global state<BR/>2.1.1 Relapse <BR/>Relapse was the primary outcome for this review. Only the aripiprazole versus placebo comparison contained relevant data. <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK> provided usable data for short term (upto 12 weeks) relapse. There were significantly fewer relapses for people given aripiprazole compared with those in the placebo group (n=310, 1 RCT, RR 0.59 CI 0.6 to 0.8, NNT 5 CI 4 to 8). The same study provided usable data for medium term (13 to 26 weeks) relapse. Again the aripiprazole group had significantly less relapse compared with people given placebo (n=310, 1 RCT, RR 0.66 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 5 CI 4 to 8).</P>
<P>2.1.2 Poor compliance with study protocol due to lack of efficacy, deterioration or psychosis<BR/>Several reasons for the poor compliance with study protocol were given and several seemed to fall into a natural grouping reporting a poor global outcome. We have grouped these throughout the review. People allocated to aripiprazole encountered this outcome significantly less than those given placebo (n=2275, 8 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.5 to 0.97, NNT 26 CI 16 to 239).</P>
<P>2.1.3 Needing additional antipsychotic medication<BR/>There was significantly less need for additional antipsychotic medication in those randomised to aripiprazole compared to those given placebo (N=1062, 4 RCTs, RR 0.70 CI 0.6 to 0.9, NNT 17 CI 12 to 42). </P>
<P>2.1.4 Needing additional benzodiazepines<BR/>There was significantly less need for additional benzodiazepine treatment in those randomised to aripiprazole compared to those given placebo in the single study for which data was available (n=263, 1 RCT, RR 0.41 CI 0.2 to 0.8, NNT 6 CI 4 to 18).</P>
<P>2.2 Adverse effects<BR/>2.2.1 Clinically important specific adverse effects<BR/>People given aripiprazole were no less anxious than those on placebo (n=615, 2 RCTs, RR 0.86 CI 0.5 to 1.4).</P>
<P>There also appeared to be no significant difference between the two comparator groups in terms of reported general extrapyramidal symptoms (n=878, 3 RCTs, RR 0.86 CI 0.3 to 2.7). Neither was there a difference in terms of needing antiparkinson medication (n=623, 3 RCTs, RR 0.78 CI 0.6 to 1.1). Significantly more patients randomised to aripiprazole versus placebo experienced akathisia (N=1175, 4 RCTs, RR 1.64 CI 1.02 to 2.7, NNT 5 CI 2 to 145). </P>
<P>Headaches were commonly reported (~15%) in both those allocated to aripiprazole and those given placebo (n=1175, 4 RCTs, RR 1.11 CI 0.7 to 1.7).</P>
<P>Insomnia was also common (~26%) but not more so for the aripiprazole group (n=878, 3 RCTs, RR 1.04 CI 0.8 to 1.3).<BR/> <BR/>Nausea was experienced by about 6% of people in the studies but not more so for those given aripiprazole (n=1175, 3 RCTs, RR 1.23 CI 0.8 to 2.0). This was not statistically significant. There was also no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of vomiting (n=912, 3 RCTs, RR 1.66 CI 0.9 to 2.98)</P>
<P>Weight gain was defined as an increase of weight of equal to or greater than 7% of baseline weight. There appeared to be no significant difference between the two comparator groups in terms of significant weight gain (n=615, 2 RCTs, RR 2.64 CI 0.7 to 9.95) but 9% of people on aripiprazole gained weight to this extent compared with 3% of people given placebo.</P>
<P>2.2.2 Average change in specific adverse effects - QTc interval (ms) from baseline <BR/>There appeared to be no significant difference between 20 mg/day aripiprazole and placebo on this continuous outcome measure, although the standard deviations are very large and data could be skewed (n=204, 1 RCT, WMD 3.00 CI -3.2 to 9.2). The same applied for data for the higher dose of aripiprazole (30 mg/day) (n=204, 1 RCT, WMD -1.00 CI -7.2 to 5.2). </P>
<P>2.2.3 Physiological (serum) measures<BR/>Total fasting cholesterol (&gt;/=200 mg/dl) was similar between groups (n=310, 1 RCT, RR 1.04 CI 0.8 to 1.3) as were glucose levels (&gt;/=110mg/dl) (n=310, 1 RCT, RR 0.96 CI 0.7 to 1.3). Haemoglobin 1AC (incidence &gt;/=upper limit of normal) levels were also similar in the aripiprazole groups compared with people given placebo, as were levels of low density lipoprotein (&gt;/=130mg/dl). Aripiprazole appeared to produce significantly less rise in serum prolactin than placebo (n=305, 1 RCT, RR prolactin- increase to &gt;/= 23ng/ml<BR/>0.32 CI 0.1 to 0.8, NNT 14 CI 11 to 50). </P>
<P>2.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>Significantly less people left the aripiprazole group compared with those in the placebo group (n=2585, 9 RCTs, RR leaving for any reason 0.73 CI 0.6 to 0.9, NNT 12 CI 9 to 25). When the reason for leaving was recorded as being due to adverse effects, there was no difference between groups (n=2585, 9 RCTS, RR 0.75 CI 0.4 to 1.4).</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 2: ARIPIPRAZOLE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>3.1 Global state<BR/>3.1.1Poor compliance with study protocol due to lack of efficacy, deterioration or psychosis<BR/>Relapse data were not provided so we can only report one global outcome. There appeared to be no significant difference between aripiprazole and the typical antipsychotic drugs with regards to 'poor compliance with study protocol due to lack of efficacy, deterioration or psychosis' (n=2868, 7 RCTs, RR 1.15 CI 0.9 to 1.4).</P>
<P>3.1.2 Needing additional antipsychotic medication<BR/>Only one study provided usable data for this outcome and did not show any significant differences between aripiprazole and typical antipsychotic medications (n=360, 1 RCT, RR 0.92 CI 0.7 to 1.2). </P>
<P>3.1.3 Needing additional benzodiazepines<BR/>There was no significant difference in this outcome between the two comparators (n=360, 1 RCT, RR 0.67 CI 0.4 to 1.3) in the single study available.</P>
<P>3.2 Mental state<BR/>3.2.1 Response<BR/>Only one study reported usable data on mental state (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>). There appeared to be no significant difference in terms of 'treatment response as defined by PANSS or CGI' between aripiprazole and perphenazine (n=300, 1 RCT, RR 1.23 0.8 to 1.9). </P>
<P>3.3 Adverse effects<BR/>3.3.1 Clinically important specific adverse effects</P>
<P>Anxiety occurred in about 10% of both groups (RR 0.85 CI 0.5 to 1.6). </P>
<P>Dyspepsia was a little more common in those allocated to aripiprazole (~11%) but not significantly so (RR 1.79 CI 0.8 to 3.9).</P>
<P>The specific extrapyramidal symptoms of akathisia occurred in approximately 3% of participants randomised to aripiprazole and 7% in those randomised to typical antipsychotic medications. This was a significant difference (n=955 RR 0.31 CI 0.2 to 0.6, NNT 20 CI 17 to 32). In general for the outcome of 'extrapyramidal symptoms no differences between the old and the new drug were apparent (n=660 RR 0.27 CI 0.1 to 1.1). The proxy measure of 'needing additional antiparkinson medication' did suggest that use of aripiprazole did result in less extrapyramidal adverse effects (n=1854, 4 RCTs, RR 0.45 CI 0.3 to 0.6, NNT 4 CI 3 to 5).</P>
<P>Headaches were uncommon and no different between those given aripiprazole compared with those allocated to typical antipsychotics; heterogeneous data (n=955, 3 RCTs, RR 0.94 CI 0.6 to 1.5).</P>
<P>Insomnia was common (23%) but no more common for people allocated the new drug; heterogeneous data (n=660, 2 RCTs, RR 1.02 CI 0.2 to 5.1).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the propensity for the new drug to cause significantly more nausea (n=655, 2 RCTs, RR 1.65 CI 0.7 to 3.9).</P>
<P>3.4 Quality of life<BR/>There was no conclusive evidence that there was a significant difference in effects on the quality of life measure between aripiprazole and perphenazine (n=300, 1 RCT, RR 0.88 CI 0.8 to 1.0). </P>
<P>3.5 Leaving the study early<BR/>About 40% of the people in these studies left before study completion and there was no significant advantage to aripiprazole over typical antipsychotics (n=2868, 7 RCTs, RR leaving for any reason 0.86 CI 0.7 to 1.1). There was also no significant difference between the two groups in terms of those leaving the study early due to adverse effects (n=2868, 7 RCTs RR 0.77 CI 0.4 to 1.5, I-squared 66%). </P>
<P>4. COMPARISON 3: ARIPIPRAZOLE versus ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>4.1 Global state<BR/>4.1.1Poor compliance with study protocol due to lack of efficacy, deterioration or psychosis<BR/>Poor compliance with study protocol due to lack of efficacy, deterioration or psychosis is not an ideal global outcome measure, but it is all that we found to work with. Aripiprazole did not seem to hold a clear advantage over olanzapine or risperidone for this outcome (n=618, 2 RCTs, RR 1.76 CI 0.9 to 3.5). </P>
<P>4.2 Adverse effects<BR/>4.2.1 Clinically important specific adverse effects<BR/>Anxiety was more common for those given aripiprazole (17%) compared with people allocated olanzapine or risperidone (9%), but not significantly so (n=770, 3RCTs, RR 1.65 CI 0.8 to 3.5).</P>
<P>The specific extrapyramidal syndrome of akathisia was equally common for those given aripiprazole compared with people allocated to olanzapine or risperidone (n=770, 3 RCTs, RR 1.43 CI 0.9 to 2.2). This also applied to the more general rating of extrapyramidal syndrome (n=515, 2 RCTs, RR 1.54 CI 0.1 to 25.5).</P>
<P>Headache was experienced by a quarter of participants in these trials but not more or less so for those allocated to aripiprazole (n=770, 3 RCTs, RR 1.06 CI 0.8 to 1.4).</P>
<P>Insomnia was also surprisingly common, experienced by about 24% of people. There was no difference between aripiprazole and other compounds (n=770, 3 RCTs, RR 1.53 CI 0.8 to 2.8) but data are heterogeneous (I squared 78%).</P>
<P>Nausea was no more or less common for people allocated to aripiprazole (n=556, 2 RCTs, RR 1.43 CI 0.4 to 5.4) although again data were heterogeneous (I squared 85%). When combined, three trials failed to show any difference between aripiprazole and atypical antipsychotics for the outcome of weight gain of &gt;/= 7% over baseline (n=770, 3 RCTs, RR 0.46 CI 0.2 to 1.0) but data are heterogeneous (I squared 75.9%) and, taken alone, the <LINK REF="STD-Kern-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2001</LINK> study, comparing aripiprazole with olanzapine does implicate the latter in considerable weight gain (n=255, RR 0.24 CI 0.1 to 0.5).</P>
<P>4.2.2 Average change in specific adverse effects<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK>, comparing different doses of aripiprazole with risperidone, measured mean change in QTc interval (ms) from baseline (high change = poor outcome). Aripiprazole at a dose of 20 mg/day, resulted in significantly less change than risperidone (n=200, 1 RCT, WMD -6.0 CI -13.1 to 1.1). This finding held for higher doses of aripiprazole (30 mg/day) (n=200, 1 RCT, WMD -10.00 CI -16.99 to -3.0).</P>
<P>4.2.3 Physiological (serum) measures <BR/>Again only <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK> reported on the outcome of significant increase in prolactin (above 23 ng/ml). When compared with risperidone, aripiprazole produced significantly less increase in prolactin (n=301, RR 0.04 CI 0.02 to 0.1, NNT 2 CI 1 to 2.5). These are not intention to treat data, as baseline prolactin data was only provided on 91/99 of the participants given atypical antipsychotics and on 181/202 of those given aripiprazole. </P>
<P>4.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>Overall 49% of people allocated to aripiprazole left the studies before the end of the trial. This compares with 48% in the comparison groups (n=832, 3 RCTs, RR 1.08 CI 0.96 to 1.2). When adverse effects were cited as the reason for attrition no clear difference between aripiprazole and the other atypicals was apparent (n=618, 2 RCTs, RR 0.78 CI 0.4 to 1.4). The most common adverse effect leading to drop-out was reported as 'psychosis' and 'reactive schizophrenia' in <LINK REF="STD-McQuade-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McQuade 2003</LINK>. We also used these data within the outcome of 'Global state'.</P>
<P>5. COMPARISON 4: ARIPIPRAZOLE versus STANDARD CARE</P>
<P>5.1 Global state<BR/>5.1.1 Not responded <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK>, compared differences in response rates of aripiprazole with standard care. The proportion of people who did not respond was significantly higher in the standard care group (medication included zisprasidone, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, clozapine at varying doses) than those receiving aripiprazole (n=1599, RR 0.70 CI 0.7 to 0.8, NNT 5 CI 4 to 6).</P>
<P>5.2 Satisfaction with treatment - Not satisfied with care<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK> study, reported that the proportion of people not satisfied with care was significantly higher in the standard care group (n=1599, RR 0.62 CI 0.6 to 0.7, NNT 4 CI 4 to 5) compared with those receiving aripiprazole.</P>
<P>5.3 Leaving the study early - due to any reason<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK> reported that the number of people who left the study early, for any reason, was significantly lower in the aripiprazole group compared with those who received standard care (n=1599, 1 RCT, RR 0.81 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 13 CI 8 to 39).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. Applicability of findings<BR/>Five of the fifteen included studies occurred exclusively in North America and a further study took place in a North American and European setting. Although it could not be determined from the limited descriptions of the remaining nine studies, it is likely that the majority took place in a similar environment, or possibly within a Japanese setting. Clinicians should take this into consideration when thinking of using aripiprazole in very different settings of care. </P>
<P>The majority of trials involved inpatient participants with little in the way of physical and psychiatric co-morbidity and with well-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Such people are a minority in everyday care, where people who are not in hospital and suffer from less well defined illness combined with problems such as depression and substance abuse are the norm. The drugs of comparison used in the trials in this review further limit the applicability of its findings. These were of a nature, or used at such a dose, that they distance these trials from everyday practice even more. The reader is subsequently left with the difficult decision as to whether the findings of studies with such over-defined participants, interventions and outcomes and standardised highly developed inpatient settings can still inform practice.</P>
<P>2. Limited data, confusing data<BR/>The collection and quality of the data reported was very variable. </P>
<P>With the exception of a two trials, no studies reported outcomes over 26 weeks and most lasted less than 12 weeks. Aripiprazole is a relatively new compound, so it is not surprising that long term studies are rare at this point but it is to be hoped that they are planned. Even if an intervention works in the short term (by 12 weeks) there is no guarantee that this means that the compound has long term benefits. </P>
<P>Data were often not used because of high drop-out rates. The enormous degree of loss to follow up is common in similar studies of other compounds, but rare in everyday practice. This also casts doubt on the applicability of findings to routine care. The design of the studies is clearly encouraging loss to follow up. People leave for many reasons, often not specified, and their last observation is carried forward to the end. These data, sometimes with an assumption on over 50% of people are, nevertheless, acceptable to the regulatory authorities. Until this ends, pharmaceutical companies will see little reason to change their practices, as compounds such as aripiprazole will gain licenses for clinical use even if 40 to 60% of their data is unavailable. Often the trialists do not have an obligation to follow people up for longer than the period during which they took the medication. One possible consequence of this might be that an extreme adverse reaction to discontinuation of an intervention, such as death, would go unreported if it occurred a week after the treatment stopped. Data beyond the discontinuation of the medications used within the trial are collected but not reported. This data should be reported since it is not the individual compounds in a trial which are randomised but the intention to give those individual compounds.</P>
<P>Trialists tended to report mean figures without giving standard deviations. This renders averages meaningless and of no use to reviewers. </P>
<P>We found it disappointing that, despite considerable investment in clinical trials, no outcome data were available on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, economic outcomes and cognitive functioning. The primary outcome of this review was relapse and data were only available on this in the aripiprazole-placebo comparison. Other outcomes were of secondary importance to the reviewers, but we have reported what we can in order to present the most complete data set possible for the reader. </P>
<P>Several trials only reported adverse effects which occurred in at least 5 or 10% of participants which could exclude potentially serious less frequent outcomes. Randomised trials are limited in their ability to highlight important rare outcomes, so further restricting what is reported seems odd. We note that the design of the trials did not limit reporting of positive outcomes to only those that occurred at least 5-10% of the time. </P>
<P>Much of the data were obtained from conference proceedings and posters. This made extraction difficult as results were often summarised. Several studies were multiply reported. Without unique study identifiers this gives the impressions that there are more data than actually exist and facilitates erroneous double counting. </P>
<P>A large number of studies which may have been of use in the review, including a number of Japanese phase II and III studies, could not be included due to lack of data. These, along with some others, were only published on the FDA web site. Unfortunately, we cannot include data from these without the further help of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Otsuka Pharmaceuticals who own the material. We intend to make further attempts to obtain this and other vital information (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2002-b" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2002 b</LINK>).</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 1: ARIPIPRAZOLE versus PLACEBO</P>
<P>3.1 Global state<BR/>3.1.1 Relapse<BR/>Relapse, the primary outcome for this review, was only reported by <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK> and was defined in one of three ways i. a CGI rating of minimally worse or ii. PANSS rating of moderately severe on hostility or uncooperativeness on two successive days or iii. &gt;/= 20% increase in total PANSS score from randomisation. This implies that these measures of severity of illness are indeed markers of a relapse and secondly that the measures agree on the severity of illness needed to constitute a relapse. We are not sure that these scores on these measures really would constitute what clinicians or recipients of care would call relapse. We think that the ratings listed above would be moderate deterioration rather than an event that would be universally recognised as relapse. Nevertheless, it is genuinely heartening that aripiprazole helps avoid these degrees of deterioration and that the number needed to treat is not very large in either the short or medium term (NNT 5 CI 4 to 8). </P>
<P>3.1.2 Poor compliance with study protocol due to lack of efficacy, deterioration or psychosis<BR/>This category constituted patients dropping out of the study due to poor efficacy, those with a deterioration in their mental state and those who developed frank psychosis. There was a significant difference in favour of aripiprazole with regard to this outcome, although the number needed to treat is high (NNT 26 CI 16 to 239). </P>
<P>3.1.3 Needing additional antipsychotic medication<BR/>Perhaps it is a little odd that so few people needed 'rescue' antipsychotics in the placebo group and that, essentially the risk of needing such a rescue was similar for those in the active treatment group. Nevertheless it has to be seen as encouraging that this new type of drug does seem to have some antipsychotic activity within these studies. </P>
<P>3.1.4 Needing additional benzodiazepines<BR/>There did appear to be significantly less need for benzodiazepine medication in the single study that reported usable outcomes for this comparison for the aripiprazole group (NNT 6 CI 4 to 18). The study used intramuscular medication however and the outcomes were only reported over the short term outcomes of up to 24 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>3.2 Adverse effects<BR/>3.2.1 Clinically important specific adverse effects<BR/>Overall results from the included studies suggest that with the exception of akathisia which was more common in those treated with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in reported adverse effects in people taking placebo compared to those taking aripiprazole. No objective rating scales appeared to be used in measuring these symptoms, even though for certain symptoms such as anxiety and extrapyramidal side effects these are commonly used in research. <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK> did repeatedly find more adverse effects than <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK> and, although there is nothing in the methods of the papers to suggest this, it may be that the former study used more sensitive measures of adverse effects. <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK> did seem to suggest that aripiprazole may be associated with extrapyramidal symptoms, vomiting and weight gain. Although no different from placebo, about 17% of people given aripiprazole were also medicated with antiparkinson medication. It was unclear from all studies, both those in this comparison and those including an active control group, how the level of significant weight gain (7 percent) was decided upon. There was no mention of this figure in the methodology section of the included study reports and if it was decided on after the data were inspected, any results would be prone to bias.</P>
<P>3.2.2 Average change in QT interval (ms) from baseline (high=poor)<BR/>From these data it does not seem that 20 mg/day or 30 mg/day of aripiprazole affects the heart in this way.</P>
<P>3.2.3 Physiological (serum) measures<BR/>All data, mostly from <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK>, suggest little effect on measures of glucose and lipids. The direct clinical significance of these results is, however, unclear. There did appear to be a significant difference in favour of aripiprazole in terms of the numbers of people with a rise in serum prolactin to at least 23 ng/ml (NNT 14 CI 11 to 50). This may have clinical implications in terms of the problems caused by high prolactin, such as galactorrhoea. However data was missing for baseline mean serum prolactin levels in 8/103 people allocated to placebo and 21/202 people given aripiprazole. We have assumed that these people did not have raised prolactin, but if they did and we were incorrect in our assumption, there would be no clear finding in favour of aripiprazole.</P>
<P>3.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>Significantly less people left the aripiprazole group compared with placebo (NNT 12 CI 9 to 25) for any reason. These data are heterogeneous and if the two studies with the most extreme results are removed (<LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK>) data becomes more homogeneous and much less favourable for aripiprazole. We do not see obvious reasons for heterogeneity. However, nearly half of all trial participants chose to leave early. This reflects negatively on study design and means that much of the remaining data is uninformative. Adverse effects did not seem to be a reason for study attrition, although again data were heterogeneous. There is no evidence from these studies that aripiprazole is a major cause of unacceptable short term adverse effects. Results from the updated search provided more accurate data for the <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2002-b" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2002 b</LINK> study, however this did not significantly affect the overall results. </P>
<P>4. COMPARISON 2: ARIPIPRAZOLE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>4.1 Global state<BR/>4.1.1 Poor compliance with study protocol due to lack of efficacy, deterioration or psychosis<BR/>We could not identify any data on the outcome of relapse. However, participants who were given aripiprazole were no more likely to leave the study early due to a lack of efficacy or development of psychosis than those treated with a typical antipsychotic drug. In six out of seven included studies the typical drug was haloperidol, in the seventh study it was perphenazine (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>). These data are homogeneous and do suggest that aripiprazole is an effective agent. </P>
<P>4.1.2 Needing additional antipsychotic medication<BR/>There was no suggestion in this single, very short term study of intramuscular aripiprazole that more additional antipsychotic medication was required in those randomised to typical antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol). It was unclear why the dose of haloperidol chosen was 6.5 mg for his study, or how it was clinically decided that an additional dose should be offered.</P>
<P>4.1.3 Needing additional benzodiazepines<BR/>Patients randomised to aripiprazole did not require more benzodiazepine medication than those receiving intramuscular haloperidol. Up to 4 mg per 24 hours was permitted in this study.</P>
<P>4.2 Mental state<BR/>4.2.1 Treatment response (defined by PANSS or CGI)<BR/>In keeping with the global measures, there appeared to be no difference for mental state response when aripiprazole was compared with perphenazine. </P>
<P>4.3 Clinically important specific adverse effects<BR/>The adverse effects were those spontaneously reported in at least 5% of people, and, as stated earlier, this method of recording may exclude potentially serious, less frequent outcomes, including death. The comparator drugs used were haloperidol in five studies and perphenazine in one (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK>). There were no differences between aripiprazole and typical antipsychotics for all adverse effects with the exception of akathisia. Also, when compared with haloperidol (10-20 mg/day) less people allocated aripiprazole needed additional antiparkinson drugs (NNT 4 CI 3 to 5), although considering haloperidol's propensity to cause movement disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Joy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joy 2004</LINK>), this is unsurprising. Headache (3 RCTs) was an infrequent event and did not affect those receiving aripiprazole more than the typical group. However, only <LINK REF="STD-Kane-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 2003</LINK> was of adequate duration for this event to be meaningfully measured (six weeks), whilst <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK> were 24 hour studies. </P>
<P>Insomnia data were also equivocal and heterogeneous for the two pooled studies by <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK>. They both used depot aripiprazole and each study, again, lasting for only 24 hours. The only apparent difference was that <LINK REF="STD-Oren-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 2005</LINK> used a dose of 10 mg/day of aripiprazole whilst <LINK REF="STD-Daniel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Daniel 2004</LINK> gave different doses of between 1 and 15 mg/day.</P>
<P>It is usually claimed that new drugs are equally clinically effective as older drugs but have a different and more favourable adverse effect profile. Current data do not suggest that this is true for this new drug. </P>
<P>4.4 Quality of life<BR/>It is good to see quality of life ratings in the early studies of a new drug and even better that data are reported in a potentially meaningful way. Most people in both groups did not perceive a good change in their quality of life and no difference could be seen between those given aripiprazole and people allocated perphenazine.</P>
<P>4.5 Leaving the study early<BR/>Slightly less than half the people entering these short studies left before completion. Homogeneous data suggests that the older drugs are equally unacceptable to the new compound, aripiprazole, or put another way, the new drug confers no advantage in terms of attrition over the older compounds. When leaving early was attributed to adverse effects again no differences are found, although data are heterogeneous and less easy to interpret. </P>
<P>5. COMPARISON 3: ARIPIPRAZOLE versus OTHER ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS</P>
<P>5.1 Global state<BR/>5.1.1 Poor compliance with study protocol due to lack of efficacy, deterioration or psychosis<BR/>Again we could find no figures for relapse. Data on the global state outcome of 'poor compliance with study protocol due to lack of efficacy, deterioration or psychosis' suggest that there were no differences between aripiprazole and olanzapine or risperidone. Added together the data even begin to suggest a finding in favour of the 'older atypicals' (n=618, 2 RCTs, RR 1.76 CI 0.9 to 3.5).</P>
<P>5.2 Adverse effects<BR/>5.2.1 Clinically important specific adverse effects<BR/>Three studies provided usable data on adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Kern-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stock 2005</LINK> versus olanzapine, <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK> versus risperidone). No significant differences were found for any of the listed adverse effects. Current data do not show clear differences between aripiprazole and olanzapine or risperidone. With the exception of headaches, they do suggest that more investigation is necessary. Nausea and insomnia outcomes were equivocal with heterogeneous data, but inspection of the studies did not reveal any clear reason as to why such heterogeneity exists. Weight gain may be less frequent with aripiprazole than olanzapine, although data were heterogeneous. More well designed and reported studies would determine whether this was the case.</P>
<P>5.2.2 Average change in QTc interval (ms) from baseline (high=poor)<BR/>This appeared to suggest that both 20 mg and 30 mg of aripiprazole produced less change in QTc interval than 6 mg risperidone. There is currently no evidence that aripiprazole causes problems for this aspect of cardiac function. </P>
<P>5.2.3 Physiological (serum) measures<BR/>Aripiprazole, at least when compared with risperidone, does not raise levels of prolactin. It is unclear what clinical implications this may have, as problems secondary to elevated prolactin levels are not commonly reported with risperidone as compared to other antipsychotic medications.</P>
<P>5.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>Almost 50% of people in these studies did not complete the short trials. The fact that the studies were equally unacceptable to people allocated to aripiprazole and the comparison drugs is little consolation. Data from studies where huge levels of attrition are deemed acceptable are meaningless and clinicians and recipients of care are left with no information upon which to base decisions. The much lower attrition due to adverse effects was also essentially the same for both groups.</P>
<P>6. COMPARISON 4: ARIPIPRAZOLE versus STANDARD CARE</P>
<P>6.1 Global state<BR/>6.1.1 Not responded <BR/>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK>) provided data for the comparison of aripiprazole and standard care. Response rate, dichotomised to those who were considered not to have responded, did significantly favour aripiprazole NNT 5 CI 4 to 6 (54% versus 78% not responded for the standard care group). This result, although encouraging does leave unanswered questions on the accuracy of the result because the standard care group were given either typical or atypical antipsychotics (zisprasidone, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, clozapine at varying doses) and the study was open label. </P>
<P>6.2 Satisfaction with treatment - Not satisfied with care<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK>, also reported on satisfaction which we dichotomised to not satisfied with care. Results were significantly in favour of aripiprazole compared with the standard care group NNT 4 CI 4 to 5. However, again some doubt remains as this was open label with the control group receiving different medication and perhaps if the control group had all received the same drug the size affect may have been different.</P>
<P>6.3 Leaving the study early - due to any reason<BR/>Attrition rates from the <LINK REF="STD-Riera-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Riera 2004</LINK> study did significantly favour aripiprazole with 35% leaving early compared with 43% in the standard care group NNT 13 CI 8 to 39. Here again doubts remain given the lack of blinding and mixed comparator group which is a pity given these positive results for aripiprazole compared with standard care, especially as this study was by far the largest, randomising an impressive 1599 participants.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>Aripiprazole is not clearly different from typical antipsychotics or other atypical antipsychotics in terms of global outcomes or mental state ratings. It does appear to produce a similar degree of adverse effects including movement problems but does not seem to cause the excessive production of prolactin, which can cause unpleasant breast pain and secretion; an adverse effect commonly seen with the older drugs and even some of the new generation atypicals. Aripiprazole may not cause conductance problems in the heart. It may, however, cause less akathisia than typical antipsychotics, and less need for antiparkinson medication. There are far too few data to base any conclusions on, but it would appear that aripiprazole is a new but somewhat unremarkable antipsychotic. The overall findings of this update are unchanged from those found in the original review.</P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>Aripiprazole is as effective as typical and atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia, although data are far too few to allow any confident conclusions to be drawn. Aripiprazole does not offer significant advantages over these two classes of drugs in terms of outcomes with the exception of causing less hyperprolactinaemia and rises in QTc interval than risperidone. More studies are needed to replicate and validate these findings. Aripiprazole may be the first of a new generation of atypical drugs but its clinical effects do not seem to be very different from those of older drugs.</P>
<P>3. For managers/policy makers<BR/>Aripiprazole is yet another new antipsychotic drug and it does seem to have an effect on some people with serious mental illnesses. There is currently insufficient clinical evidence to support the claim that aripiprazole is superior to either typical or atypical antipsychotics in respect of treatment response, efficacy or tolerability. Despite the fact that thousands of people have been randomised in trials of aripiprazole, there are no data on service outcomes and few medium or long term data. In the context of finite resources, the lack of good quality data leaves managers and policy makers with difficult decisions to make.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>As with all similar studies, public registration of a study before anyone is randomised would ensure that participants could be confident that people would know that the study had at least taken place. Unique study numbers would help researchers to identify single studies from multiple publications and reduce the risk of duplicating the reporting of data. Compliance with CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>), both on the part of authors and editors, would help to clarify methodology and many outcomes. Failure to comply results in both loss of data and confusion in the results, neither of which help clinicians, patients or managers. </P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis should be performed on all outcomes and all trial data should be made easily accessible. A minimal requirement should be that all data should, at least, be presented as numbers. In addition, continuous data should be presented with means, standard deviations (or standard errors) and the number of participants. Data from graphs, 'p' values of differences and statements of significant or non-significant differences are of limited value. Unfortunately, in spite of the large numbers of participants randomised, we were unable to use most of the data in the trials included in this review due to the high drop-out rates observed as well as poor data reporting.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>As an antipsychotic agent with a novel mechanism of action, aripiprazole is an interesting compound, but pragmatic, real world, randomised controlled trials should be carried out to determine its value in standard clinical practice. Studies of medium and long-term risks, including mortality, behaviour, satisfaction with treatment and cost-effectiveness-in comparison to typical and atypical antipsychotics, are a priority. Pragmatic entry criteria and non-blinding with hard endpoints may be helpful in decreasing the study attrition (<LINK REF="REF-Roland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roland 1998</LINK>).</P>
