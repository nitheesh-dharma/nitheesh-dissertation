<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Alcoholism is a global problem with approximately 5-10% of the world's population demonstrating alcohol-related diseases. One of the most severe consequences of alcohol dependence is the withdrawal syndrome. This review assessed the effects of psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide (PAN) in treating alcohol withdrawal. All trials were conducted in in-patient settings although PAN is also administered in outpatient settings. The review found that PAN is as effective as sedatives for managing mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal states. Nonetheless, it does not provide strong evidence in favour of the benefits or harms of using PAN over sedatives in managing acute alcohol withdrawal. Further high quality trials should be done before these findings can be confirmed.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-03-27 10:57:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (all to May 2005). We scanned Internet web sites, reference lists of relevant articles and abstracts of the international Conferences on Alcoholism. We contacted researchers in the field and industry to identify unpublished trials. No language and publication restrictions.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials including voluntary participants dependent on alcohol. PAN was compared to oxygen and/or benzodiazepine regimens.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five studies, 212 participants, were included. PAN showed improvement of symptoms (RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.79), of the amount and duration of sedative medication and of psychomotor function (WMD -8.71; 95% CI -13.71 to -3.71). At one hour post intervention, no significant differences were found for depression (WMD -2.40; 95% CI -8.70 to 3.89) and anxiety (WMD -3.70; 95% CI -10.53 to 3.12). None of the included studies reported any significant adverse effects of any treatment. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Results indicate that PAN may be an effective treatment of the mild to moderate alcoholic withdrawal state. The rapidity of the therapeutic effect of PAN therapy coupled with the minimal sedative requirements, may enable patients to enter the psychological treatment phase more quickly than those on sedative regimens, accelerating the patients recovery. Our review does not provide strong evidence due to the small sample sizes of the included trials. Neither does the review indicate any causes for concern that PAN is more harmful than the benzodiazepines. Clinicians wishing to use PAN may initially wish to do so within trial settings. <BR/>Further high quality trials should be done to confirm these findings and to investigate whether the PAN therapy has fewer adverse effects than other treatments for the alcohol withdrawal states. Studies to investigate the possible cost-effectiveness of PAN by reducing costly hospital admissions and decreasing post administration supervision also need to be performed. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-03-27 10:58:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Alcoholism is a global problem with approximately 5-10% of the world's population demonstrating alcohol-related diseases. One of the most severe consequences of alcohol dependence is the withdrawal syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Desjarlais-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desjarlais 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1996</LINK>). The latter is a group of symptoms that occurs following absolute or relative withdrawal of alcohol, after repeated and prolonged use of alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-Desjarlais-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desjarlais 1995</LINK>). If the withdrawal state is associated with a serious medical complication it is a potentially lethal condition (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1996</LINK>). In most cases the treatment of alcohol dependence is triggered by the presence of an alcohol withdrawal state, which forces the patient to seek treatment. There are no figures available for the prevalence of alcohol withdrawal states and this is aggravated by the fact that many cases of withdrawal are so mild that they do not receive formal treatment and therefore do not come to medical attention (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most popular current treatment for the alcohol withdrawal phase is by prescription with benzodiazepines, usually given in tapering doses over a period of days or titrated to the patients' symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1996</LINK>). Benzodiazepines are relatively safe (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1996</LINK>) and, due to their widespread use, most health care professionals find them easy to administer. There are a number of disadvantages in using these agents. This includes excessive sedation, delays in entering the long-term treatment of alcohol dependence and most importantly the development of dependence on the benzodiazepines (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ross-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1993</LINK>). People dependent on alcohol are prone to secondary benzodiazepine abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1993</LINK>), although the exact extent or prevalence of such secondary addiction is not known.</P>
<P>An alternative method to benzodiazepine sedation has been conceptualised and pioneered in South Africa. This treatment employs psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide (PAN). It is used in various South African National Council for Alcohol and Drug Dependence (SANCA) facilities as well as in Finland at a number of private clinics. It is possible that it is used elsewhere in the world, but we have no confirmation of this or publications to confirm its use elsewhere.</P>
<P>PAN treatment involves administering low levels of nitrous oxide plus oxygen to the patient who remains conscious and coherent throughout gas administration. Nitrous oxide at low doses combined with a minimum of 30% oxygen differs from anaesthetic concentrations of nitrous oxide. Such analgesic concentrations of nitrous oxide are used largely for their psychotropic properties of anxiolysis, mood elevation and anti stress effects, hence the term PAN (<LINK REF="REF-Gillman--1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1998</LINK>). The dopaminergic system is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of substance abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Lichtigfeld-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtigfeld 1996</LINK>), mu opioids provoking the release of dopamine and kappa opioids decreasing the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Chiara-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Chiara 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dorris-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorris 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lichtigfeld-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtigfeld 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lichtigfeld-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtigfeld 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spanagel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spanagel 1992</LINK>). PAN is thought to modulate both mu and kappa opioid systems thus restoring the homeostatic balance which has been disturbed during the withdrawal state (<LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1986b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lichtigfeld-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtigfeld 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no fixed concentration of nitrous oxide (N<SUB>2</SUB>O) or oxygen (O<SUB>2</SUB>) because each patient receives a carefully titrated amount of N<SUB>2</SUB>O and O<SUB>2</SUB> sufficient only to ameliorate the patient's condition. These concentrations range between 15-70% N<SUB>2</SUB>O, although most patients respond at concentrations of N<SUB>2</SUB>O below 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1991</LINK>). The sequence of gases are O<SUB>2</SUB> followed by PAN and then O<SUB>2</SUB> washout. Each sequence lasts a total of 20 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1990</LINK>). The exact dose is determined by the relaxation of the patient without euphoria and without significant obtunding of the patient's consciousness. Other signs associated with the endpoint are a deepening of the patient's voice, decrease in blinking, obvious relaxation of facial and body musculature and the subjective experience that the withdrawal symptoms are being lifted from him/her (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtigfeld-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtigfeld 1982</LINK>). PAN requires a short hands-on training period because without it practitioners are unlikely to be able to correctly assess the critical clinical endpoint.</P>
<P>PAN has an excellent safety record (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1987</LINK>), but can cause minor side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and dizziness (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1999</LINK>). However, chronic exposure to PAN either as a pollutant in low concentrations (where scavenging is not employed) or in the rare cases of abuse can cause haematological (bone-marrow depression) and neurological sequelae similar to that found in subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. These changes are caused by interference of vitamin B12 metabolism which occurs following long-term exposure. The adverse effects of PAN as used for alcohol withdrawal are very limited and mild. Haematological and neurological toxicity has not occurred following the short-term exposure of less than 60 minutes used for treating alcohol withdrawal states (<LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1997</LINK>). The main adverse effects are oversedation or euphoria, both of which can be readily avoided by the correct application of the PAN technique (<LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1990</LINK>). The single absolute contraindication to the use of PAN is chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD) where the physical properties of nitrous oxide can cause expansion of bullae in the lungs and because the concurrent high oxygen concentrations can depress respiratory drive (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Administration requires specialised equipment to ensure safety and efficacy. This equipment is commercially available and is relatively inexpensive compared to most other routine medical equipment found in primary healthcare clinics and hospital outpatient departments. This equipment is usually serviceable, apart from routine maintenance, for 20 years or longer. The cost of gases per 30 minutes is less than ZAR10.00 (approximately US$1.50). It is important to note that, provided the correct technique and equipment are used, neurological and haematological changes should not occur in-patients treated with PAN, because of the brevity of exposure and low concentrations of nitrous oxide used (<LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>A Modified Gross Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Lichtigfeld-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtigfeld 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1990</LINK>) and other scales described in PAN trials are used to assess the efficacy of PAN against a benzodiazepine. In randomised controlled studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lichtigfeld-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtigfeld 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtigfeld-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtigfeld 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>), patients responding positively to PAN improved by 50% or more on an alcoholic withdrawal rating scale. More than 90% of patients that recovered within the first 60 minutes required no further gas exposure (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ojutkangas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ojutkangas 1994</LINK>). For this reason the PAN therapy would seem to offer an extremely rapid screening test to distinguish those patients requiring more intensive therapy, including in-patient therapy, when the rapid therapeutic response does not occur (<LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1990</LINK>). The treatment can be given by a registered nursing sister on the orders of a medical practitioner, who does not have to be present during gas administration (<LINK REF="REF-Christian-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christian 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, there is a considerable reduction in concurrent medication requirements particularly the benzodiazepines, which are only used in low doses for the first and possibly second night of withdrawal to ensure adequate sleep (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2002</LINK>). Thus the very real danger of secondary addiction to benzodiazepines (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2003</LINK>) is potentially reduced (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Disadvantages of PAN therapy include a once-off capital outlay of relatively inexpensive commercially available equipment for the safe administration of the gases. Staff must also attend a short hands-on training course to ensure that they use the correct technique for administering PAN.</P>
<P>To date no systematic review has been conducted to evaluate PAN to treat alcohol withdrawal. Given its potential to treat alcohol withdrawal and reduce the time required for detoxification, a systematic review of its efficacy was done. We hope that this review will provide useful information to clinicians, consumers and researchers working in the field.</P>
<P>Although all the included studies in the current review were on in-patients, at present the PAN therapy is now only used on outpatients. As far as we are aware, nobody in South Africa where it is a recognised treatment for substance abuse withdrawal states (<LINK REF="REF-Gillman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 2006</LINK>) currently use it for inpatients.<BR/>

<B>(1) Study Selection </B>
<BR/>The titles and abstracts and descriptive terms of all downloaded material from electronic searches were independently read by two authors and irrelevant reports were discarded. Where there was disagreement these studies were then checked by the contact editor to establish their relevance using the criteria given above. If there was uncertainty the full article was obtained.</P>
<P>
<B>(2) Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Data was extracted by two independent authors (Gillman and Young ). Any disagreements were resolved through discussion with the contact editor. The following characteristics were included in a standardised data extraction form:<BR/>(a) Administrative details: Identification; author(s); published or unpublished; year of publication; year in which study was conducted; details of other relevant papers cited;<BR/>(b) Details of study: location; date of enrolment; date of trial completion;<BR/>(c) Characteristics of participants: age; sex; socio-economic status; education level; employment status;<BR/>(d) Details of intervention: Type of treatment program; length of treatment program; detoxification regime;<BR/>(e) Details of outcomes: Number of patients improving 50% or more on an alcohol withdrawal rating scale; mean improvement in alcohol withdrawal rating scale; number of patients who completed treatment versus number who did not complete treatment; number of patients entering long-term rehabilitation programme post detoxification.</P>
<P>
<B>(3) Trial quality</B>
<BR/>The quality of trial methods was qualitatively captured by recording the method of generating the randomisation sequence, the adequacy of allocation concealment, the presence of blinding of the participants, providers and assessors, and the differential loss-to-follow-up in the comparison groups. We did not attempt to quantify trial quality, but described it in full.<BR/>Allocation concealment was assessed as adequate (A in Table of included studies) if there were centralized randomisation by telephone; randomisation schemes controlled by a pharmacy; numbered or coded containers in which treatment from identical bottles are administered sequentially; on-site computer systems which can be assessed after entering the characteristics of an enrolled participant, where allocations are in a locked unreadable file, and sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes; unclear (B in Table of included studies) if sealed envelopes used but not sequentially numbered or opaque; a trial in which the description suggests concealment, but other features are suspicious (i.e. noticeably unequal controls and trial groups, randomisation stated but no details available); inadequate (C in Table of included studies)if any allocation procedure was transparent before assignment (open list of random numbers, alternation, date of birth, day of week, case record number.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>(4) Analysis<BR/>
</B>Where trials were similar enough we conducted a meta-analysis. The weighted mean difference was calculated for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals and for dichotomous outcomes, the relative risk was calculated. Use was made of the random effects model to calculate the overall measure of effect, as significant heterogeneity was anticipated. Testing for between study heterogeneity was carried out using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> and I<SUP>2 </SUP>provided by the RevMan software. The Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity was computed with a P value of 0.10 to determine statistical significance. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was computed to quantify inconsistency across studies. No significant heterogeneity was found and therefore no subgroup analyses were performed. When trials did not allow for meta-analysis, we re-calculated the effects for each outcome and if there was insufficient data we report the results reported by the trialists.</P>

<BR/>In Gillman and Lichtigfeld's study (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>) 78 patients suffering from alcohol withdrawal entered the trial of which 11 in each arm were excluded from the analysis. The reason for these exclusions was that the sedative group did not receive placebo gas but instead received the first doses of benzodiazepine regimen. As a result, although requested not to discuss what they had received on admission, some patients inadvertently revealed this either to the staff or fellow patients. Patients were excluded from the analysis if there was any doubt that the code had been broken in this manner. As a result the loss to follow-up in this study was 28% in each arm. Loss to follow-up was 0% in the other four studies (<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fey 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>).</P>

<B>Primary outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>1. Improvement of scores as measured on a modified Gross Scale<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK> (N = 51) a positive response was considered to have occurred if the symptom scores on a modified Gross Scale were reduced by 50% or more (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>). PAN significantly favoured a positive response (RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.79). There was no difference in the severity of withdrawal when comparing the subgroups who did and did not receive oxazepam the night before (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Secondary outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>(1) Anxiety </B>
<BR/>Three trials (N = 83) reported anxiety as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fey 1993</LINK>). All the studies used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to measure the outcome. In <LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK> there was a general tendency for the anxiety scores of the control group to decrease at the three different testing occasions (pre intervention, at 1 hour and 24 hours post intervention) however the PAN group had no significant differences across the various testing occasions. At 1 hour after the intervention was administered (<LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fey 1993</LINK>), there was no significant difference between PAN and the control group (WMD -3.70; 95% CI -10.53 to 3.12) with no significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>0%; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 0.27 with P = 0.61) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Due to the lack of data necessary to include in the meta-analysis, De Rooster was excluded from the meta-analysis. In <LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK> the experimental group had significantly less anxiety as compared to the control group although this difference disappeared at day seven.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>(2) Depression</B>
<BR/>Three trials (N = 83) reported depression as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fey 1993</LINK>). Using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) <LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fey 1993</LINK> found no significant difference at 1 hour post intervention administration (WMD -2.40; 95% CI -8.70 to 3.89). There was no significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 14.1%; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>1.16 with P = 0.28) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Due to the lack of data necessary to include in the meta-analysis, De Rooster was excluded from the meta-analysis. Comparing the scores at the three different testing occasions in <LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK> (pre intervention, at 1 hour and 24 hours post intervention) there was a statistically significant positive effect of PAN on depression as measured by the BDI but not in the control group. The results of the ANOVA test on BDI were as follows: ANOVA Chi sq = 7.03 (df=2; p&lt;0.05) for the experimental group and ANOVA Chi sq=4.07 (df=2; p&gt;0.05) for the control group. The changes were greater one hour after gas administration than at 24 hours. These results were not conclusive because of the presence of an extremely high scorer in the PAN group, which could have been due to subject or measurement error as well as the fact that a quarter of the subjects in the experimental group received carbogen instead of PAN. <LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK> did not observe any differences in degree of depression at any time or on any of the scales he used to assess depression.</P>
<P>
<B>(3) Guilt<BR/>
</B>In <LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK> there was no significant difference between the two groups except in the middle phase (day 4 assessment), where the experimental group showed greater guilt than the control group. Those in the experimental group showed greater guilt at the middle phase as compared to basal condition as compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05) using an ANOVA analysis of variance (<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>(4) Psychomotor functioning</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Fey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fey 1993</LINK> (N = 31) compared the effect of PAN and sedatives on psychomotor functioning using the Quick Neurological Screening Test (QNST) and found that the PAN was significantly better than the sedative group (WMD -8.71; 95% CI -13.71 to -3.71) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK> used the Brief Outpatient Psychopathology Scale. There was no difference between the 2 groups except that the experimental group showed less psychomotor activation than the control group at the beginning phase.</P>
<P>
<B>(5) Craving</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK> (N = 16) used the University of Connecticut Health Centre Craving Scale which consists of a one item questionnaire and found that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that craving had changed across the testing points in either the PAN or the control group.</P>
<P>
<B>(6) Amount of sedative medication required<BR/>
</B>
<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK> recorded a range of the total night and sedation requirements for each group over the seven days of the trial which corresponds to the acute detoxification period at the facility where the trial was undertaken. The upper and lower dose for each group were provided. Averaging the lowest and highest doses in each group over 7 days and then summing these doses, the control group required an average of 777.5 mgs night sedation (pentobarbital, oxazepam, diazepam) in addition to the daily sedative requirements (pentobarbital, oxazepam, diazepam; average=230.5mgs) and the experimental group needed on average 120 mgs. The experimental group required no day sedation. Comparing the total sedative medication for the groups (using the average dose over the week), the control group required on average 1008 mgs (pentobarbital, oxazepam, diazepam), while the experimental group only required an average of 120mgs (oxazepam). In <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK> (N = 78), the mean dose for the control group was 1535.36mg compared to 361.79mg for the PAN group. The total additional medication requirements (i.e. in addition to the daily requirements of the sedative group) were decreased by 76.44% (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>). Gillman and Lichtigfeld (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>) also found that the night sedation requirements of the PAN group were markedly reduced in that sedation was only required on night one and two in the majority of cases, whereas in the control group, diazepam was given nightly during the patients stay in the detoxification centre (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>). We only have the means. No ranges or standard deviations were available in any of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>) and it was therefore not possible to undertake a meta-analysis.</P>

</B>
<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>
<B> </B>found that the period of sedation was 5 days in the PAN group compared to 7 days in the control group. <LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK> found that sedatives were only required for 3 days in the PAN group as compared to 7 days in the sedative group. Gillman and Lichtigfeld (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>) also found that the night sedation requirements of the PAN group were markedly reduced, since most subjects in the experimental group required night sedation for the first 2 nights of treatment only, whereas patients in the control group required night medication for 7 nights.<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-03-27 11:17:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five studies, of which three were unpublished, including a total of 212 participants met the criteria for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fey 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>). Due to the difference between measured outcomes in each trial, it was not possible to conduct meta-analyses for most outcomes and results presented from the small individual trials must be treated with caution. Currently there is not strong evidence that PAN is beneficial or, importantly, harmful and our review clearly demonstrates a need for further trials to be conducted on this intervention.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, there is some evidence that the PAN method leads to a more rapid amelioration of the withdrawal state than benzodiazepines (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>) when the effects are measured with a withdrawal instrument measuring a composite range of different signs and symptoms. The rapidity of the response observed (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>) support other work where the speed of the beneficial response of PAN after single exposure to the gas, within 60 minutes, with lasting effect was noted (<LINK REF="STD-Lichtigfeld-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtigfeld 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daynes-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Daynes 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three included studies (<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>) showed that there was a significant reduction in the sedative medication requirements, both in terms of duration and quantity, of those treated with PAN as compared to those treated with sedatives. Since other sedatives were seldom required after the fifth day of therapy, following a single 20 minute PAN exposure (on admission day only, in most cases) (<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>), it is possible that patients treated on an in-patient basis with PAN can be discharged earlier than those receiving benzodiazepines and other sedatives. The reduction in sedative requirements, in particular benzodiazepines, is advantageous because of the problems associated with secondary abuse of the benzodiazepines by alcoholic subjects (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ross-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, the side effects of the benzodiazepines can be troublesome. These include syncope, confusion, motor incoordination resulting in accidents and oversedation (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hobbs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobbs 1996</LINK>). Other relatively common side effects of the benzodiazepines include weakness, headache, blurred vision, vertigo, nausea, vomiting and incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Hobbs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobbs 1996</LINK>). In this review none of the included studies reported on side effects. The rapidity of the response to PAN and the limited reliance on sedative medications renders the patient more amenable to psychological manipulation, which has been shown to be of importance in the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal states (<LINK REF="REF-Madden-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madden 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitfield-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitfield 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtigfeld-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtigfeld 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ntais-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ntais 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of isolated parameters were also measured with contrasting results. <LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fey 1993</LINK> were unable to demonstrate a statistical difference in anxiety scores between the PAN group and the benzodiazepine group at the one hour assessment. This is of interest because it is well known that both agents have marked anxiolytic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Hobbs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobbs 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1999</LINK>) and indicates that the PAN group produced the expected anxiolysis but that it was less so than with benzodiazepines (<LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fey 1993</LINK>). Contamination may account for this finding seeing that two of the eight subjects who were supposed to receive PAN actually received carbogen (<LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK>), which is known to be anxiogenic (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 1986</LINK>). In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK> demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in anxiety in the PAN group as compared to the benzodiazepine group over all testing times. De Rooster's work (<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK>) also gives further support to the therapeutic effects of PAN in relieving anxiety in alcohol withdrawal states, which has been shown repeatedly in other stress provoking situations e.g. dentistry (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1999</LINK>). Mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal states usually peak at between 24-48 hours and tends to abate over the next day or so, even without therapy (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1982</LINK>) and thus one can expect the disappearance of effects at day seven.</P>
<P>No significant differences were found for depression at one hour post intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK> showed that there was a significant improvement of depression in the PAN group, as opposed to the sedative group, at all testing times i.e. pre-intervention at one and 24 hours for depression. These findings should be treated with caution because she mentions that her results might have been influenced by a single high scorer, which might have skewed her results (<LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK> observed that the sedative group showed more guilt at 96 hours than the PAN group. As mentioned above, this might indicate that the sedatives have a negative effect on recovery when given at the time that the withdrawal state would have been expected to normalise (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1982</LINK>). Further work is necessary to confirm the effects of PAN on depression as well as to exclude the possible negative effects of sedatives in mild to moderate withdrawal states from the fourth day onwards, particularly as benzodiazepines do not have antidepressant properties (<LINK REF="REF-Schatzberg-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schatzberg 1978</LINK>). It is possible that the benzodiazepines may have a negative effect on the recovery of mild to moderate withdrawal states (<LINK REF="REF-Ntais-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ntais 2006</LINK>) and it has been showed that the incidence of side effects following their use is greater than when other agents are used (<LINK REF="REF-Ntais-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ntais 2006</LINK>). The possible negative effects of sedatives requires further study, since there seems to be evidence that they might interfere with the subjects normal recuperative processes and unnecessarily prolong recovery times.</P>
<P>Fey (<LINK REF="STD-Fey-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fey 1993</LINK>) was able to demonstrate that PAN was significantly better than the sedative group as regards psychomotor function, however this was not confirmed in the other study measuring psychomotor function (<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK>). It is possible that the latter work was unable to show a difference because the second assessment was only done after 98 hours and by this stage the sedative group were receiving less than half the sedatives that they would have received on days 1-3 (<LINK REF="STD-De-Rooster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">De Rooster 1983</LINK>). That Fey's findings are probably closer to the actual effects of the two treatments appears to be supported by the evidence that the benzodiazepines have marked negative effects on motor function (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hobbs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobbs 1996</LINK>) and that the effects of PAN on motor function disappear within an hour after gas administration has ceased (<LINK REF="REF-Moyes-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyes 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herwig-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herwig 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Janks (<LINK REF="STD-Janks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Janks 1992</LINK>) measured the effects of the two treatment conditions on craving but concluded that there was no difference. However, she mentions that her results were probably inaccurate because of a possibly unreliable single-question craving measuring instrument, which she used. These finding are further complicated by the fact that two subjects in the PAN group received carbogen instead of PAN with the overall sample size being very small at 16.</P>
<P>The sample sizes of the included trials were small which limits our ability to draw robust conclusions. Only a single trial was methodologically sound (<LINK REF="STD-Gillman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 2004</LINK>) while the others had various methodological weaknesses. Further research into the effects of PAN for treating mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal states are needed. Careful clinical trials comparing PAN with benzodiazepine regimens would be useful to determine whether the rapid therapeutic effects of the PAN therapy can prevent the negative effects of the benzodiazepines, which have been highlighted by this review. However, any study in which the effects of PAN are tested should only be undertaken by those who have had hands-on training to use PAN correctly (<LINK REF="REF-Gillman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 2006</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>These results indicate that PAN may be a rapidly effective treatment of the mild to moderate alcoholic withdrawal state, with minimal sedative requirements. The rapidity of the<BR/>therapeutic effect of the PAN therapy coupled with the minimal sedative requirements and concomitant sedation, may enable patients to enter the psychological treatment phase more quickly than those on sedative regimens, thus accelerating the patients recovery Our review does not provide strong evidence in favour of the benefits of using PAN over sedatives in managing acute alcohol withdrawal due to the small sample sizes of the included trials. Neither does the review indicate any causes for concern that PAN is more harmful than the benzodiazepines. Clinicians wishing to use PAN may initially wish to do so within trial settings. <BR/> </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further high quality trials should be done to confirm these findings and to investigate whether the PAN therapy has fewer adverse effects than the BZs or other treatments for the acute mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal states. Studies to investigate the possible cost-effectiveness of PAN by reducing costly hospital admissions and decreasing post administration supervision also need to be performed. </P>

<CONTRIBUTIONS>
<P>Mark Gillman and Fred Lichtigfeld developed the protocol. Taryn Young assisted in finalising the protocol for publication. Mark Gillman and Taryn Young then selected studies for inclusion, located copies of study reports, extracted data, did the data entry and analysis, and contributed to the writing of the report.<BR/>Unfortunately Fred Lichtigfeld passed away during the writing of this review. Nonetheless we have decided to retain his name as co-author because it was he who originally suggested that this review should be written and was intimately involved in its development.</P>

<P>Alho 2002 titrated to a fixedtargetend tidal volume of 30% (inhaled 60%) nitrous oxide and used theverbal response of the patient to decrease the dose to avoid unconsciousness and anaesthesia.In contrast the PAN method requires slow titration until a clinical endpoint at which the patient is relaxed but isnowhere near preanaesthetic excitation, with a different concentration of nitrous oxide needed for each individual patient. The PAN method (i.e. conscious sedation with nitrous oxide/oxygen)thus never presupposes a &#8216;target&#8217; concentration of nitrous oxide.Rather, it aims for a clinical response (within Stage 1 of Anaesthesia), which for each patient is usually found at a different concentration of nitrous oxide (and which is unique for them).</P>
<P>Alho 2002 titrated to a predetermined concentration of nitrous oxide, close to or at pre-anaesthetic excitation (Stage II Anaesthesia). They reported evidence of at least Stage II Anaesthesia, in that the majority of their subjects manifested increased tension and not relaxation as would be found if PAN had been used. Data provided showed that most of their patients exhibited increased facial muscle tone as measured by facial muscle electromyographic activity (FEMG) levels. </P>
