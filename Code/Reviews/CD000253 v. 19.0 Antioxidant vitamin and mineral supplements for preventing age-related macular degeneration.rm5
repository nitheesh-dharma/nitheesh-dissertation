<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-13 15:49:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
<BR/>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether taking antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements prevents the development of AMD. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found five studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key messages</B>
<BR/>Taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements will not prevent the onset of AMD in people who do not have signs of the condition. The same probably applies to vitamin C and multivitamin tablets. There is no evidence for other supplements, such as lutein and zeaxanthin.</P>
<P>
<B>What was studied in the review? </B>
<BR/>AMD is a condition of the central area (macula) of the back of the eye (retina). The macula degenerates with age. In some people, this deterioration happens more quickly, and is associated with a particular appearance at the back of the eye. In its earliest stage (early AMD), yellow spots (drusen) can be seen under the retina by an eye health professional on examining the eye. The affected person will probably be unaware that they have a problem. As AMD progresses, it can lead to the loss of the cells in the back of the eye, which are needed for vision. This is known as geographic atrophy. Sometimes, new (harmful) blood vessels grow in the macula. These new blood vessels may bleed and cause scarring. This is known as neovascular or wet AMD. Any damage to the macula can affect vision, particularly central vision. Neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy are known as late AMD.</P>
<P>It is possible that antioxidant vitamins may help to protect the macula against this deterioration and loss of vision. Vitamin C, E, beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and zinc are examples of antioxidant vitamins commonly found in vitamin supplements.</P>
<P>The Cochrane researchers only looked at the effects of these supplements in healthy people in the general population who did not yet have AMD. There is another Cochrane Review on the effects of these supplements in people who already have AMD.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review? </B>
<BR/>The Cochrane researchers found five relevant studies. The studies were large and included a total of 76,756 people. They took place in Australia, Finland, and the USA. The studies compared vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and multivitamin supplements with placebo.</P>
<P>The review showed that, compared with taking a placebo:</P>
<P>&#8729; Taking vitamin E supplements made little or no difference to the chances of developing AMD (high-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8729; Taking vitamin E supplements made little difference, or slightly increased, the chances of developing late AMD (moderate-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8729; Taking beta-carotene made little or no difference to the chances of developing any AMD (high-certainty evidence) or late AMD (moderate-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8729; Taking vitamin C made little or no difference to the chances of developing any AMD (high-certainty evidence) or late AMD (moderate-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8729; Taking multivitamin tablets may slightly increase the chances of developing any AMD or late AMD (moderate-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8729; Adverse effects were not consistently reported in these eye studies, but there is evidence from other large studies that beta-carotene increases the risk of lung cancer in people who smoke, or who have been exposed to asbestos.</P>
<P>None of the studies reported quality of life or resource use and costs.</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is this review? </B>
<BR/>The Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 29 March 2017.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-16 20:59:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We included a total of five RCTs in this review with data available for 76,756 people. The trials were conducted in Australia, Finland, and the USA, and investigated vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and multivitamin supplements. All trials were judged to be at low risk of bias.</P>
<P>Four studies reported the comparison of vitamin E with placebo. Average treatment and follow-up duration ranged from 4 to 10 years. Data were available for a total of 55,614 participants. There was evidence that vitamin E supplements do not prevent the development of any AMD (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.06; high-certainty evidence), and may slightly increase the risk of late AMD (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67; moderate-certainty evidence) compared with placebo. Only one study (941 participants) reported data separately for neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy. There were 10 cases of neovascular AMD (RR 3.62, 95% CI 0.77 to 16.95; very low-certainty evidence), and four cases of geographic atrophy (RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 26.0; very low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported similar numbers of adverse events in the vitamin E and placebo groups. Another trial reported excess of haemorrhagic strokes in the vitamin E group (39 versus 23 events, hazard ratio 1.74, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.91, low-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>Two studies reported the comparison of beta-carotene with placebo. These studies took place in Finland and the USA. Both trials enrolled men only. Average treatment and follow-up duration was 6 years and 12 years. Data were available for a total of 22,083 participants. There was evidence that beta-carotene supplements did not prevent any AMD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.14; high-certainty evidence) nor have an important effect on late AMD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.24; moderate-certainty evidence). Only one study (941 participants) reported data separately for neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy. There were 10 cases of neovascular AMD (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.15; very low-certainty evidence) and 4 cases of geographic atrophy (RR 0.31 95% CI 0.03 to 2.93; very low-certainty evidence). Beta-carotene was associated with increased risk of lung cancer in people who smoked.</P>
<P>One study reported the comparison of vitamin C with placebo, and multivitamin (Centrum Silver) versus placebo. This was a study in men in the USA with average treatment duration and follow-up of 8 years for vitamin C and 11 years for multivitamin. Data were available for a total of 14,236 participants. AMD was assessed by self-report followed by medical record review. There was evidence that vitamin C supplementation did not prevent any AMD (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.18; high-certainty evidence) or late AMD (RR 0.94, 0.61 to 1.46; moderate-certainty evidence). There was a slight increased risk of any AMD (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43; moderate-certainty evidence) and late AMD (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.69; moderate-certainty evidence) in the multivitamin group. Neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy were not reported separately. Adverse effects were not reported but there was possible increased risk of skin rashes in the multivitamin group.</P>
<P>Adverse effects were not consistently reported in these eye studies, but there is evidence from other large studies that beta-carotene increases the risk of lung cancer in people who smoke or who have been exposed to asbestos.</P>
<P>None of the studies reported quality of life or resource use and costs.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-23 10:16:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements will not prevent or delay the onset of AMD. The same probably applies to vitamin C and the multivitamin (Centrum Silver) investigated in the one trial reported to date. There is no evidence with respect to other antioxidant supplements, such as lutein and zeaxanthin. Although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects, and clear evidence of benefit is needed before they can be recommended. People with AMD should see the related Cochrane Review on antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for slowing the progression of AMD, written by the same review team.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-30 08:08:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-15 22:46:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease affecting the central area of the retina (macula). In the early stages of the disease, lipid material accumulates in deposits underneath the retinal pigment epithelium. These deposits are known as drusen, and can be seen as pale yellow spots on the retina. The pigment of the retinal pigment epithelium may become disturbed, with areas of hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation. In the later stages of the disease, the retinal pigment epithelium may atrophy completely. This loss can occur in small focal areas or be widespread (geographic). In some cases, new blood vessels grow under the retinal pigment epithelium, and occasionally, into the subretinal space (exudative or neovascular AMD). Haemorrhage can occur, which often results in increased scarring of the retina.</P>
<P>The early stages of the disease are, in general, asymptomatic. In the later stages, there may be considerable distortion within the central visual field, leading to a complete loss of central visual function.</P>
<P>Population-based studies suggest that, in people 65 years and older, approximately 5% have advanced AMD (<LINK REF="REF-Owen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2012</LINK>). It is the most common cause of blindness and visual impairment in industrialised countries. In the UK, for example, over 30,000 people are registered as blind or partially sighted annually, half of whom have lost their vision due to macular degeneration (<LINK REF="REF-Bunce-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunce 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-15 22:50:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Photoreceptors in the retina are subject to oxidative stress throughout life, due to combined exposures to light and oxygen. It has been proposed that antioxidants may prevent cellular damage in the retina by reacting with free radicals produced in the process of light absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Christen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christen 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are a number of non-experimental studies that have examined the possible association between antioxidant micronutrients and AMD, although few studies have examined supplementation specifically (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2001</LINK>). Data on vitamin intake in observational studies should be considered cautiously, as people who have a diet rich in antioxidant vitamins and minerals, or who choose to take supplements regularly, are different in many ways from those who do not; these differences may not be adequately controlled by statistical analysis. The results of these observational studies have been inconclusive.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-15 22:51:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The underlying theory is that antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements will protect the retina against oxidative stress, and that this protection will delay the onset of AMD.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-07-30 08:08:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements are increasingly being marketed for use in age-related eye disease, including AMD. The aim of this review was to examine the evidence on whether taking vitamin or mineral supplements prevents the development of AMD. See also the related Cochrane Review on antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for slowing the progression of AMD, which considered whether supplementation for people with AMD slowed down the progression of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2017</LINK>).</P>

<P>The initial searches resulted in 3178 titles and abstracts. Of these, 208 were potentially eligible trials reports. From these reports, we identified seven primary prevention trials of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements (<LINK REF="REF-ATBC-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATBC 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CARET-1996" TYPE="STUDY">CARET 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Klerk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Klerk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LINXIAN-1993" TYPE="STUDY">LINXIAN 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nambour-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nambour 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PHS-I-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PHS I 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHS-2010" TYPE="STUDY">WHS 2010</LINK>). Investigators from three trials have confirmed that they did not collect data on AMD (<LINK REF="STD-CARET-1996" TYPE="STUDY">CARET 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Klerk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Klerk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nambour-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nambour 1995</LINK>). We excluded these trials from the review. We did not receive a response from one trial author; we excluded this trial (<LINK REF="STD-LINXIAN-1993" TYPE="STUDY">LINXIAN 1993</LINK>). Three trials had published data on AMD outcomes; we included them in this review (<LINK REF="REF-ATBC-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATBC 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PHS-I-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PHS I 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHS-2010" TYPE="STUDY">WHS 2010</LINK>). Search of the National Eye Institute Clinical Research register identified one further ongoing trial that was collecting information on AMD - the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study (<LINK REF="STD-WACS" TYPE="STUDY">WACS</LINK>). There are two trials that have recruited participants with and without AMD (<LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2002</LINK>). We included <LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2002</LINK> in this review because 82% of participants did not have signs of AMD. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-AREDS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS 2001</LINK> because it did not include AMD outcomes for people without AMD at baseline; it is included in the Cochrane Review examining the effect of supplementation on progression of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2017</LINK>).</P>
<P>In our original search strategy, we identified all trials of antioxidant interventions and asked trialists if they had collected data on AMD. We wrote to the authors of 60 trials of antioxidant interventions in people with diseases other than AMD. We received 15 responses, and none had collected any relevant data. We included all 60 trials in the excluded studies section of this review. As this proved to be an inefficient way of identifying relevant trials, we included terms for AMD in subsequent searches. We found 367 reports of trials in May 2002, 343 in May 2005, and 64 reports in January 2006, but we did not identify any further trials that were relevant for this review. The results of the PHS I study were published in 2007.</P>
<P>We repeated the searches in August 2007, at which time we identified a total of 129 reports of studies. The Trial Search Co-ordinator (TSC) scanned the search results and removed 84 references that were not relevant to the scope of the review. We screened the titles and abstracts of the remaining 45 references and obtained full-text copies of four reports to assess for potential inclusion in the review. We identified one new report from the <LINK REF="STD-PHS-I-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PHS I 2007</LINK> study to include in the review and excluded the three remaining studies. For reasons of exclusion, see the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table.</P>
<P>An update search was done in January 2012 which yielded 477 titles and abstracts. The TSC scanned the search results and removed 206 references which were not relevant to the scope of the review. We screened the title and abstracts of the remaining 271 references. We rejected 267 abstracts as not eligible for inclusion in the review. We obtained full-text copies of four reports for further examination. One new report from the <LINK REF="STD-WHS-2010" TYPE="STUDY">WHS 2010</LINK> study has been included in the review and three other studies were excluded. For reasons of exclusion, see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Update searches run in March 2017 yielded a further 872 records (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). After 157 duplicates were removed, the Cochrane Information Specialist (CIS; formerly the Trial Search Co-ordinator) screened the remaining 715 records and removed 562 references that were not relevant to the scope of the review. We screened the remaining 153 references and obtained one full-text report for further assessment, however, this study did not meet the inclusion criteria. We checked the status of the ongoing studies published in the previous version of this review. <LINK REF="STD-PHS-II-2012" TYPE="STUDY">PHS II 2012</LINK> was now completed and we included it in this update. <LINK REF="STD-AREDS2-2008" TYPE="STUDY">AREDS2 2008</LINK> was also completed, however, this study did not meet the inclusion criteria; see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> for details.</P>

These photographs were graded by one observer, masked to the participant's treatment group. The following grades of maculopathy were used: 0 = none; I = dry maculopathy with hard drusen, pigmentary changes, or both; II = soft macular drusen; III = disciform degeneration; IV = geographic atrophy.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-PHS-I-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PHS I 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PHS-II-2012" TYPE="STUDY">PHS II 2012</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-WHS-2010" TYPE="STUDY">WHS 2010</LINK>, AMD was ascertained by self report: "Have you ever had macular degeneration diagnosed in your right or left eye?". If the participant answered yes to this question, permission was gained to contact their ophthalmologist or optometrist, and further details were obtained from the medical records.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2002</LINK>, photographs were taken with a Nidek 3-DX fundus camera on Kodachrome 64 ASA colour film. The photographs were graded at baseline independently by two trained graders. Early AMD (the primary outcome) was defined as soft drusen (distinct or indistinct) or pigmentary changes (hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation) on photographic grading. On clinical grading, this was large, soft drusen or non-geographical retinal pigment epithelium atrophy. <LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2002</LINK> used Bailey-Lovie visual acuity charts #4 and #5 (National Vision Research Institute, Australia).</P>

<P>In general, the publications that reported eye outcomes did not report adverse effects. We also looked at the reports of the main study results for those trials where eye outcomes were collected as part of a larger trial.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2002</LINK>, it was noted that no serious adverse effects were seen. Similar numbers of people in the vitamin E and placebo groups withdrew due to adverse effects (four versus seven), reported any adverse effect (91 versus 83), or ocular adverse effect (105 versus 90).</P>
<P>The main <LINK REF="STD-ATBC-1998" TYPE="STUDY">ATBC 1998</LINK> trial found an increased risk of lung cancer associated with beta-carotene supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-ATBC-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATBC 1994</LINK>), a finding that was repeated in the large CARET trial (<LINK REF="REF-Omenn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omenn 1996</LINK>). Beta-carotene supplementation is contra-indicated in people who smoke or have been exposed to asbestos.</P>
<P>In the main <LINK REF="STD-WHS-2010" TYPE="STUDY">WHS 2010</LINK> trial, "We examined whether vitamin E increased adverse effects due to bleeding (gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, easy bruising, epistaxis) because of the potential for vitamin E to inhibit platelet function, gastrointestinal symptoms (gastric upset, nausea, diarrhea, constipation), or fatigue. There were no differences between reported adverse effects for any of these variables among women in the two groups, apart from a small, but significant, increase in the risk of epistaxis (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.11; P = 0.02)" (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-PHS-II-2012" TYPE="STUDY">PHS II 2012</LINK>, "An excess number of hemorrhagic strokes was observed among those assigned to vitamin E compared with placebo (39 versus 23 events; HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.91)" (<LINK REF="REF-Gaziano-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaziano 2009</LINK>), and<I> "</I>We observed no significant differences in adverse effects, including hematuria, easy bruising, and epistaxis, for active vitamin E or C compared with placebo"<I> (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Sesso-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sesso 2008</LINK>). For multivitamins "...no significant effects on gastrointestinal tract symptoms (peptic ulcer, constipation, diarrhea, gastritis, and nausea), fatigue, drowsiness, skin discoloration, and migraine (all P &gt; 0.05). Those taking the active versus placebo multivitamin were more likely to have skin rashes (2111 and 1973 men in corresponding active and placebo multivitamin groups; HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.15; P = 0.016). In addition, there were inconsistent findings for daily multivitamin use on minor bleeding, with a reduction in hematuria (998 and 1105 men in corresponding active and placebo multivitamin groups; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; P = 0.006), an increase in epistaxis (1216 and 1106 men in corresponding active and placebo multivitamin groups; HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20; P = 0.016), and no effect on easy bruising/other bleeding (1927 and 1902 men in corresponding active and placebo multivitamin groups; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; P = 0.59)" (<LINK REF="REF-Gaziano-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaziano 2012</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-07 13:15:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review provides evidence that people who take vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements do not reduce their risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). There is more limited evidence on vitamin C (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>), and one multivitamin (Centrum Silver, <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>), but at present, nothing to suggest that these supplements prevent AMD.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-05-17 10:23:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review includes five large, high-quality studies that randomised over 75,000 members of the population to antioxidant supplementation or placebo. Duration of supplementation in these studies ranged from 4 to 12 years.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="REF-ATBC-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATBC 1994</LINK>, there was no association with the treatment group and development of early stages of the disease. If anything, there was a tendency for more cases to be present in the treatment rather than the placebo group. This was not statistically significant. One drawback of adding a maculopathy study to a trial of primary prevention is that we have no information on maculopathy status before supplementation. Therefore, we have to assume that (1) maculopathy was equally distributed across study groups at the start of the study, and (2) most observed events occurred during the study period. It is likely that this was true for a reasonable proportion of the events, as the maculopathy study began eight years after recruitment for the main trial, and randomisation should have ensured equal distribution of maculopathy between the two groups.</P>
<P>Supplementation in this study began at age 50 to 69 years and lasted for five to eight years. Currently, we do not know at what age antioxidant protection may be important. It may be that this was too late or too short a period of supplementation to show an effect. This study was conducted in Finnish male smokers, and we have to be cautious in extrapolating the findings to other geographical areas, to people in other age groups, to women, and to non-smokers. However, the incidence of AMD, particularly neovascular disease, is likely to be higher in smokers, which means that they provide a good population to demonstrate any potential protective effects of antioxidant supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similarly, the results of <LINK REF="STD-VECAT-2002" TYPE="STUDY">VECAT 2002</LINK> do not provide evidence of a benefit of supplementation in people with no, mild, or borderline AMD, although again, these studies have been underpowered to examine late-stage disease.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-PHS-I-2007" TYPE="STUDY">PHS I 2007</LINK>, over 20,000 physicians received supplementation with beta-carotene over 12 years. There was little evidence of any benefit of beta-carotene supplementation. They used medical record review to ascertain AMD, and therefore may have been less accurate. However, there was no reason to suppose that the ascertainment would have been different in the treatment and control groups. The same method of ascertainment was used in <LINK REF="STD-PHS-II-2012" TYPE="STUDY">PHS II 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-WHS-2010" TYPE="STUDY">WHS 2010</LINK>. </P>
<P>This review does not provide evidence on the effects of other antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements on the development of AMD; in particular, it does not provide evidence on the effects of commonly marketed vitamin combinations.</P>
<P>There are additional ongoing studies, including the Women's antioxidant cardiovascular study (<LINK REF="STD-WACS" TYPE="STUDY">WACS</LINK>), and <LINK REF="STD-SELECT" TYPE="STUDY">SELECT</LINK> study that are collecting data on AMD outcomes.</P>
<P>Although generally regarded as safe, antioxidant supplements may have harmful effects. Our review does not provide a systematic review of all possible adverse effects of supplements, but does highlight the fact that beta-carotene increases the risk of lung cancer and overall, there was some evidence of a small, increased risk of mortality in people who took beta-carotene or vitamin E.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-04-22 14:08:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the certainty of the evidence was considered to be high for any AMD, moderate for late AMD (due to lower number of events), and very low for neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy, which were only reported disaggregated in one study.</P>
<P>Although the number of people randomised in these studies was large, there is still a degree of uncertainty in the pooled estimates. In the pooled analyses, the risk ratios were largely around the null value, or just above the null value.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-04-22 14:10:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not include the Age-related Eye Disease Study in this review. However, there were 2180 people recruited with no, mild, or borderline AMD (<LINK REF="REF-AREDS-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS 2001a</LINK>). The study reported no benefit of the study treatment for these people, however, the number of events was small.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-05-15 16:06:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A review of observational prospective studies in 2007 found little evidence of a protective effect of dietary antioxidants (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2007</LINK>). The only dietary antioxidant for which a reduction was seen was vitamin E, in contrast to the evidence from the trials included in this review. It is possible that natural vitamin E from dietary sources rather than artificial supplements has different effects, or alternatively, high levels of dietary vitamin E might be a marker for other nutrients.</P>
<P>There are many reviews focusing on the role of antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements in people with AMD, but we have only identified one that considered specifically their role in healthy people (<LINK REF="REF-Zampatti-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zampatti 2014</LINK>). The conclusions were similar to the current review that there is little evidence for any benefit in healthy people. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-04-22 14:01:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements will not prevent or delay the onset of AMD. The same probably applies to vitamin C and the multivitamin (Centrum Silver) investigated in the one trial reported to date. There is no evidence with respect to other antioxidant supplements, such as lutein and zeaxanthin.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-04-22 14:06:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are a number of unanswered questions in the prevention of AMD. The hypothesis that antioxidant micronutrients may protect against the disease is a reasonable one. We do not know at what stage the protective effect may be important, nor the potential interactions with genetic effects and other risk factors for the disease, such as smoking. The research to date suggests that vitamin supplements (at least those studied) do not prevent AMD. They do not provide conclusive evidence on safety. The small number of incident events in healthy people mean that any future trials need to be very large. Four large primary and secondary prevention trials in the field of cancer and cardiovascular disease have added an examination of eye disease. This would seem to be a cost-effective way forward in research in this area.</P>

<P>The original protocol was published in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1999</LINK>). Since that time, there have been methodological improvements within Cochrane, and the methods have been updated to include assessment of risk of bias, 'Summary of findings' tables, GRADE assessment, and better consideration of unit of analysis issues.</P>
<P>For the 2017 update, we modified the outcome measures to ensure they were in line with those being used as part of the macular degeneration guidelines being prepared by NICE (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2016</LINK>). In previous versions of this review the outcomes were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>number of participants developing AMD;</LI>
<LI>number of participants with visual loss due to AMD;</LI>
<LI>quality of life measures;</LI>
<LI>any adverse outcomes reported.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In previous versions of this review, we pooled all antioxidants into one analysis. This was not possible in the current version because of overlapping participants in two trials.</P>
