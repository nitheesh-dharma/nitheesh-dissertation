<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Probiotics for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a common condition resulting in inflammation of the colon. Current treatments for this condition result in side effects in a significant proportion of patients and consequently alternative treatments are being sought. Probiotics are live microorganisms which have been used to treat other inflammatory conditions such as gastroenteritis and pouchitis. This review investigated the evidence for the use of probiotics for the treatment of active UC. The current research suggests that conventional treatment combined with probiotic therapy does not provide any additional benefit over conventional treatment alone in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. There is limited evidence that probiotics may reduce disease activity. However there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of probiotics for the treatment of active UC. Larger, well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to determine whether probiotics are of benefit for the treatment of active UC. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an inflammatory condition affecting the colon with an incidence of approximately 10-20 per 100,000 per year. No existing intervention is effective in all patients with a proportion requiring colectomy. There are significant proportion of patients who experience adverse effects with current therapies. Consequently, new alternatives for the treatment of UC are constantly being sought. Probiotics are live microbial feed supplements that may beneficially affect the host by improving intestinal microbial balance, enhancing gut barrier function and improving local immune response. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of probiotics compared with placebo or standard medical treatment (5-aminosalicylates, sulfasalazine or corticosteroids) for the induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>A comprehensive search for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT's) was carried out using MEDLINE (1966-January 2006), EMBASE (January 1985- 2006) and CENTRAL. The Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group Specialised Trials Registrar was also searched. The Australasian Medical Index, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and the Japan Information Centre of Science and Technology File on Science, Technology and Medicine (JICST-E) were also used to identify abstracts. Conference proceedings from the Falk Symposium, Digestive Disease Week (DDW) and the United European Digestive Disease week were hand-searched. Authors of relevant studies and drug companies were contacted regarding ongoing or unpublished trials that may be relevant to the review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of probiotics compared to standard treatments in the induction of remission of active ulcerative colitis</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data for analysis. Data were analysed using RevMan 4.2.7. A formal meta-analysis was not preformed due to differences in probiotics, outcomes and trial methodology. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>None of the included studies reported any statistically significant differences in remission or clinical improvement rates between probiotic and placebo or active comparator groups. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Conventional therapy combined with a probiotic does not improve overall remission rates in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. However, there is limited evidence that probiotics added to standard therapy may provide modest benefits in terms of reduction of disease activity in patients with mild to moderately severe ulcerative colitis. Whether probiotics are as effective in patients with severe and more extensive disease and whether they can be used as an alternative to existing therapies is unknown. Further well designed, larger randomised controlled trials are needed to determine whether probiotics can be used as an alternative to current treatment modalities. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a common condition with an incidence of 10-20 per 100,000 per year. It has a peak incidence between the ages of 10 and 40 years. The disease is characterised by diffuse mucosal inflammation limited to the colon. Patients usually present with debilitating symptoms such as bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, urgency or tenesmus. Consequently, UC can have a severe impact on a patient's quality of life. Current medical management consists of aminosalicylates, steroids and immunosuppressant therapies such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and more recently tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody. A significant proportion of patients do not tolerate existing treatments due to their adverse effects. In addition, failure to induce remission occurs in 20-30% of patients on current treatments with a proportion of patients eventually requiring colectomy. Consequently, new alternatives for the treatment of UC are constantly being sought.</P>
<P>Probiotics are live microbial feed supplements that may beneficially affect the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance (<LINK REF="REF-Fuller-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuller 1989</LINK>), blocking adhesion sites on the colonocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Coconnier-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coconnier 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bernet-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernet 1994</LINK>) thus enhancing gut barrier function and improving local immune response (<LINK REF="REF-Perdigon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perdigon 1995</LINK>). Studies have shown beneficial effects in children with acute gastroenteritis (<LINK REF="REF-Isolauri-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isolauri 1991</LINK>) and in various models of experimental colitis such as interleukin-10 deficient mice (<LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madsen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madsen 1999</LINK>) and acetic acid-induced colitis in rats (<LINK REF="REF-Fabia-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fabia 1993</LINK>). There is some evidence that <I>Escherichia coli</I> Nissle 1917 may be as effective as 5-ASA for maintenance treatment of UC (<LINK REF="STD-Kruis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kruis 2004</LINK>). Uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bibiloni-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bibiloni 2005</LINK>) and some randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Furrie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furrie 2005</LINK>) have suggested that probiotics may be of some benefit for the treatment of active UC. This review summarizes the available data concerning the efficacy of probiotics for the induction of remission in active UC. </P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>A comprehensive search for relevant RCTs was carried out in an attempt to minimize bias. Sources and methods are listed below </P>
<P>Electronic databases:<BR/>Search engines MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), EMBASE (1985 to January 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group Specialised Trials Registrar, Australasian Medical Index, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and the Japan Information Centre of Science and Technology File on Science, Technology and Medicine (JICST-E) were used to identify abstracts. </P>
<P>Search strategies using the following medical subject headings (MeSH) listed below were used:</P>
<P>MeSH for ulcerative colitis:<BR/>Ulcerative colitis, proctosigmoiditis, rectocolitis, rectosigmoiditis, ulcerative rectocolitis, ulcerative proctocolitis, haemorrhagic ulcerative, haemorrhagic proctocolitis, proctitis. These terms were joined by a Boolean operator "OR".</P>
<P>MeSH for probiotic:<BR/>probiotic, commensal, complementary medicine, bacteria, lactobacillus, bifidiobacteria, E coli, Nissle, Yeast, Fungus, VSL#3, worms, ova. These terms were joined by a Boolean operator "OR".</P>
<P>MeSH for form of intervention:<BR/>Topical administration, suppository, rectal administration, oral administration, oral probiotic administration, probiotic administration. These terms were joined by the Boolean operator "OR".</P>
<P>The Boolean operator "AND" was used to combine these headings to maximize precision while maintaining high recall. The key words were searched for in the entire article including the title and abstract. There was no language or date restriction.</P>
<P>Handsearching<BR/>Conference proceedings from the Falk Symposium, Digestive Disease Week (DDW) and the United European Gastroenterology Week (UEGW) were hand-searched. Additional studies were identified by checking the references section of published trials and review articles on probiotics for treatment of UC.</P>
<P>Reviews<BR/>The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) were consulted for other similar reviews. MEDLINE was searched under the publication type terms META-ANALYSIS and REVIEW, ACADEMIC.</P>
<P>Ongoing or Unpublished Trials<BR/>Communication via e-mail, formal letter or telephone to lead authors of relevant studies was carried out. Relevant drug companies who supply probiotics were contacted. The correspondence inquired about their knowledge of any additional studies (published or unpublished) that might have been relevant. Included in the correspondence was a comprehensive list of relevant articles along with the inclusion criteria for the review. TrialsCentralTM and Current Controlled Trials which are electronic databases of ongoing trials was also searched.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study Selection:<BR/>Two authors (PM and DM) examined all citations and abstracts derived from the electronic search strategy and independently select trials to be included in the review. A standardized form was used to assess the eligibility of trials for inclusion in the study. The data form contained the following items:</P>
<P>1) sample characteristics: age, size, proven ulcerative colitis, disease extent and severity identified;<BR/>2) probiotics for at least one treatment arm;<BR/>3) randomised or quasi-randomised treatment allocation; and<BR/>4) symptom score as at least one measure of outcome.</P>
<P>Full reports of potentially relevant trials were retrieved. The authors were not blinded to the names of trials' authors, institutions or journals. Any disagreement about any trial inclusion was resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Assessment of methodological quality:<BR/>The methodological quality of eligible trials were assessed independently by two authors (PM and DM) in terms of quality of randomisation, allocation concealment, withdrawal and dropout rate, whether data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, and whether the participants and the outcome assessors were blind to the treatment provided. Where the methodology was not clearly reported the authors were contacted for clarification.</P>
<P>Data extraction:<BR/>A data extraction form was used to extract and record information on results of included studies. Data were extracted independently by two authors (PM and DM). The results were compared and differences of opinion were settled by discussion. Where data was collected but not reported, further information was sought from the investigators.</P>
<P>Data analysis:<BR/>Data were analyzed using the RevMan Analyses statistical package in Review Manager (version 4.2.7). For dichotomous outcomes, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived for each study. The results of included studies were to be combined for each outcome if appropriate. However, a meta-analysis was not performed due to differences in probiotics used, outcomes and trial methodology. </P>

</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>One hundred and nineteen references were reviewed. Four randomised controlled trials satisfied the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Furrie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furrie 2005</LINK>). Two trials involving 32 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bibiloni-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bibiloni 2005</LINK>) and 24 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2003</LINK>) were excluded because they were not randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK> study was a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised trial that enrolled 116 patients with clinically active ulcerative colitis. At entry, patients were randomised by an independent pharmacy to receive Escherichia coli (Nissle 1917) at a dose of two capsules twice daily for 12 weeks (2.5 X 10<SUP>10 </SUP>viable bacteria per capsule; n = 57) or mesalazine (Asacol) 800 mg three times daily for 12 weeks (n = 59). All patients were given oral gentamicin (80 mg three times per day for 1 week) to suppress their active E coli flora. All patients also received steroid treatment for active ulcerative colitis. The type of steroid therapy was clearly defined and was dependent on the severity of disease. The primary outcome measures were time to relapse and rate of relapse after successful induction of remission. The secondary outcomes included the rate and time to remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis treated with topical or systemic steroids in addition to Nissle 1917 or mesalazine. Remission was defined as general well-being with the passage of no more than three formed stools a day, a rectal mucosa without erythema, granularity, or friability and histological confirmation of inactive disease. A total of 19 patients were withdrawn from the study. In the Nissle 1917 group six patients requested to be withdrawn, two patients violated the study protocol and one patient did not meet inclusion criteria (histology did not confirm active colitis). In the mesalazine group six patients requested to be withdrawn, two patients violated the study protocol and two patients were withdrawn due to serious adverse events (not thought to be related to study medication). </P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK> study enrolled 90 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis confirmed by endoscopic evaluation. Patients were randomised to one of three treatment groups. Thirty patients received 2.25 g Balasalazide daily plus 3 g VSL#3 daily for 8 weeks. VSL#3 contains 4 strains of <I>Lactobacillus</I> (<I>L. casei</I>, <I>L. plantarum</I>, <I>L. acidophilus</I> and <I>L. delbrueckii </I>subsp<I>. Bulgaricus</I>), 3 strains of <I>bifidiobacterium</I> (<I>B. longus</I>, <I>B. breve</I> and <I>B. infantis</I>) and one strain of <I>streptococcus salivarius</I> subsp. <I>thermophilus</I> strain. The VSL#3 was administered as 1 g bags containing 300 billion viable lyophized bacteria per gram. Thirty patients received 4.5 g Balsalazide daily and 22 patients received 2.4 g Mesalazine daily. Patients and physicians were not blinded to treatment assignment. All patients received treatment for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission based on clinical evaluation and diary card at 2, 4 and 8 weeks. Symptomatic remission was defined as patient functional assessment ratings of normal bowel movements and absence of rectal bleeding. Secondary outcomes included time to remission, improvement in endoscopic score and histologic score, change in CAI from baseline at eight weeks, well being status and bowel frequency score. A total of 14 patients were withdrawn from the study. In the balsalazide/VSL#3 group one patient was withdrawn for protocol violation and another was withdrawn for protocol ineffectiveness. In the balsalazide group one patient was withdrawn for protocol violation and three for protocol ineffectiveness. In the mesalazine group two patients were withdrawn for protocol violation, four for protocol ineffectiveness and two for adverse events.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Furrie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furrie 2005</LINK> study was a double-blind randomised trial that enrolled 18 patients with active ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomised using a table of random digits to receive synbiotic therapy (n = 9) or placebo (n = 9). A synbiotic treatment is probiotic plus a prebiotic which is a food substance intended to promote the growth of certain bacteria. One patient was excluded from each group after entry because they received antibiotics leaving eight patients in each group. Eight patients received 4 2 x 10<SUP>11</SUP> bifidobacterium longum plus the prebiotic Synergy (6 g fructo-oligosaccharide/inulin mix) twice daily for 4 weeks in addition to their existing medical therapy. Eight patients received an identical placebo twice daily for 4 weeks in addition to their current medical therapy. Two placebo patients withdrew at week two due to deterioration of condition. Although <LINK REF="STD-Furrie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furrie 2005</LINK> stated that patients on standard therapy were using either steroids, 5-ASA's or immunosuppressants the specific details (e.g. dosage, administration route) were not mentioned. Outcome measures were clinical activity index (CAI), bowel habit index (BHI), sigmoidoscopy score (SS), histology score(0-4), colonic cytokine concentration (TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#945;) , serum C reactive protein (CRP) and human beta defensins. Human beta defensins (hBD) are antimicrobial peptides expressed uniquely by epithelial cells and are significantly upregulated in active ulcerative colitis.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Kato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2004</LINK> study enrolled 20 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomised to receive bifidobacteria-fermented milk which contains 1x10<SUP>10</SUP> Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophillus (n = 10) or placebo milk (n = 10) for 12 weeks. All patients were treated with sulphasalazine (3 to 4 g/day) or 5-ASA (2.25 to 3 g/day). Steroid treatment was not allowed during the trial. One member of the placebo group withdrew because of worsening symptoms 2 days after entry. Outcome measures were remission rate and clinical activity index (CAI).</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in demographic and baseline variables of patients across the trials apart from the proportion of patients who smoked. A higher proportion of patients were smokers (25%) in the <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK> trial compared to <LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK> (2.6%). There was no difference in the incidence of smoking between the treatment groups in each of the trials. The number of smokers were not recorded in the <LINK REF="STD-Furrie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furrie 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2004</LINK> trials.</P>

<P>All 4 studies randomised patients to treatment groups with <LINK REF="STD-Furrie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furrie 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2004</LINK> using random number tables. <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK> did not indicate the technique of randomisation. The authors were contacted to clarify but no response was received. Allocation concealment was adequate in the <LINK REF="STD-Furrie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furrie 2005</LINK> study using coded identical containers which were administered to each patient. Allocation concealment was unclear in the other 3 studies. The authors were contacted for clarification but no response was received. Overall withdrawal rates were 8.9% for <LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK>, 15% for <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK>, 5% for <LINK REF="STD-Kato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2004</LINK> and 12.5% for <LINK REF="STD-Furrie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furrie 2005</LINK>; adequate explanations were provided for all withdrawals. The statistical analysis was clearly described and appropriately used in each study. <LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK> analysed the data on an intention to treat basis.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Primary Outcome</P>
<P>Three studies measured proportion of patients achieving remission (<LINK REF="STD-Kato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK>). The data were analysed on an intention to treat basis. <LINK REF="STD-Kato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2004</LINK> reported that probiotics (bifidobacteria) + 5-ASA had similar effectiveness to placebo + 5-ASA for induction of remission: probiotic 40%, placebo 30%, OR 0.64 (95% CI 0.10 to 4.10) . In the <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK> study probiotics (VSL#3) + balsalazide had similar effectiveness to placebo + balsalazide for induction of remission: probiotic 80%, placebo 70%, OR 0.58 (95% CI 0.18 to 1.91). The <LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK> study reported that probiotics (E.coli Nissle 1917) + steroids had similar effectiveness to Mesalazine + steroids for induction of remission: probiotic 68.4%, Mesalazine 74.6%, OR 1.35 (95% CI 0.6 to 3.04).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Kato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2004</LINK> trial also used clinical improvement (defined as a decrease in CAI score of at least 3 points) as an outcome measure. Clinical improvement occurred in 7 out of the 10 patients who received probiotics compared to 3 out of the 10 patients in the placebo group. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the percentage of patients achieving improved CAI scores, OR 0.18 (95% CI 0.03 to 1.24). <LINK REF="STD-Kato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2004</LINK> reported that the mean CAI score was lower in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group after 12 weeks of treatment (3.7 +/- 0.4 vs 5.8 +/- 0.8, P &lt; 0.05). The mean CAI scores at entry were similar for both groups (7.9 +/- 0.8 [probiotic] vs 7.9 +/- 0.6 [placebo]). The mean endoscopic activity index score was reduced from 5.1 +/- 0.4 to 3.0 +/- 0.5 in the probiotic group (p&lt;0.01) after 12 weeks treatment. There was no significant reduction in the placebo group (4.9 +/- 0.4 to 3.6 +/- 0.7 ). There was a statistically significant reduction in the mean histologic score in the probiotic group (4.4 +/- 0.3 to 3.1 +/- 0.3, P &lt; 0.01). There was no significant reduction in histologic score reported in the placebo group (3.6 +/- 0.3 to 3.0 +/- 0.4). </P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Furrie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furrie 2005</LINK> trial an improvement in CAI was noted in 5 of 8 patients on synbiotics combined with standard therapy compared to 3 of 8 patients in the placebo group (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.05 to 2.73). Other outcome measure in the <LINK REF="STD-Furrie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furrie 2005</LINK> study included bowel habit index (BHI), sigmoidoscopy score (SS), histology score(0-4), pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#945; and IL-1&#945; , serum CRP and colonic mucosal human beta defensins levels. Human beta defensins (hBD) are antimicrobial peptides expressed uniquely by epithelial cells and are significantly upregulated in active ulcerative colitis. Synbiotic treatment in conjunction with standard therapy caused a significant reduction in TNF-&#945; and IL-1 &#945; compared to the standard therapy with placebo group. TNF-&#945; and IL-1&#945; were lower in the probiotic compared to the placebo group after 4 weeks of treatment (P = 0.0177 and P = 0.0051 respectively), hBD levels post treatment were not significantly different between the groups. Sigmoidoscopy scores did not differ significantly between the groups before (4.5 +/- 1.4[probiotic], 2.6 +/- 2.1[placebo]) and after treatment (3.1 +/- 2.5 [probiotic], 3.2 +/- 2.2 [placebo]). Mean BHI was reduced by 20.4% in the probiotic group compared to a 70.4% increase in the placebo group. Mean histology scores were reduced from 1.7 +/- 1.4 to 1.1 +/- 1.2 in the probiotic group but was not significant. There was an increase in the histology scores in the placebo group from 0.9 +/- 0.9 to 1.9 +/- 1.1 but again this was not statistically significant. There was no statistically significant reduction in the mean CAI in both groups post treatment. No statistically significant differences in CRP were observed between the probiotic and placebo groups.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK> trial reported that mean time to remission in the probiotic group was 4 days compared to 7 days in the standard therapy group (P &lt; 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences in endoscopic, histologic, well being status and bowel frequency scores between the two groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK> investigated the mean time to remission, relapse rate and duration of remission. The mean time to remission (42 days probiotic vs 44 days mesalazine) and mean duration of remission (221 days for Nissle 1917 versus 206 days for mesalazine) were similar in both groups however relapse rate was higher in the mesalazine group compared to the Nissle 1917 group (73% vs 67% P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>Adverse events</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK> study adverse events occurred in 15.8% of patients receiving E coli compared to 11.9% of patients in the mesalazine group. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the incidence of adverse events, RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.88). Adverse events in the E coli group included abdominal pain or bloating (72.3%), headache (9.1%), nausea (9.1%) and mouth ulcer (9.1%). Adverse events in the mesalazine group included abdominal pain or bloating (75%), headache (12.5%) and nausea (12.5%). No adverse events were reported in the other three trials. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Probiotics are live microbial feed supplements that may beneficially affect the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance, blocking adhesion sites on the colonocytes thus enhancing gut barrier function and improving local immune response. Probiotics may be effective in the treatment of a variety of conditions such as pouchitis (<LINK REF="STD-Gionchetti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gionchetti 2000</LINK>), gastroenteritis (<LINK REF="REF-Isolauri-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isolauri 1991</LINK>) and radiation induced diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Delia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delia 2002</LINK>). In inflammatory bowel disease there is some evidence to show that <I>Escherichia coli</I> Nissle 1917 may be as effective as 5-ASA for maintenance treatment in ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="STD-Kruis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kruis 2004</LINK>). This systematic review assesses the evidence for probiotic use in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis.</P>
<P>Four randomised controlled trials which investigated the efficacy of probiotics for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis were identified. Despite significant variations in design between the trials the analyses in this review showed that probiotics used in conjunction with standard treatments provide no additional benefit for induction of remission or clinical improvement compared to patients receiving standard treatments only. The included studies have several methodological limitations. Two of the included studies did not provide adequate information on how the random allocation was generated (<LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK>). Allocation concealment was unclear in three of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK>). Two of the included studies did not use double blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Tursi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tursi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Furrie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Furrie 2005</LINK> reported the use of double-blinding but did not adequately describe the procedures used for blinding. Most of the included studies were small in size and may have lacked power to detect a statistically significant difference between the groups should one exist. All patients in the <LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK> trial were treated with steroids. Neither probiotics (Nissle 1917) or 5-ASA added to the efficacy of steroids in these patients. The use of steroids and gentamicin in both groups may have masked the potential benefit of E coli over mesalazine. </P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Rembacken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rembacken 1999</LINK> trial described adverse events in the probiotic group. It is difficult to conclude that the adverse events were solely due to the probiotic since other treatments such as gentamicin and steroids were also being used. No adverse events were reported in the other trials with the use of probiotics suggesting that probiotics are a safe and well tolerated treatment.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Currently there is no evidence to suggest that probiotics are superior to placebo or aminosalicylates for the induction of remission in UC. The use of probiotics as induction therapy for UC cannot be recommended at this time.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further well designed randomised controlled trials with higher patient numbers may be justified to determine whether probiotics are of benefit for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.</P>
