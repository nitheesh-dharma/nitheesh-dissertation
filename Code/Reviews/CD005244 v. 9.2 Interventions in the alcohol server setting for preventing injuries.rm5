<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-04-11 16:54:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">Are interventions that are implemented in alcohol server settings (e.g. bars and pubs) effective for preventing injuries?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-07-08 16:11:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>Injuries are a significant public health burden and alcohol intoxication (i.e. drunkenness) is recognised as a risk factor for injuries; indeed the effects of alcohol lead to a considerable proportion of all injuries. Alcohol-associated injuries are a problem in both high- and low-income countries.</P>
<P>Many interventions to reduce alcohol-related injuries have a demand-side focus and aim to reduce individuals' demand and consequently consumption of alcohol. However, there is increasing attention on supply-side interventions, which attempt to alter the environment and context within which alcohol is supplied and consumed; the aim being to modify the drinking and/or the drinking environment so that potential harm is minimised.</P>
<P>This systematic review was conducted to examine the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions implemented in the alcohol server setting for reducing injuries. The authors of this systematic review examined all studies that compared server settings which received an intervention aimed at facilitating sensible alcohol consumption and/or preventing injuries, to server settings which did not receive such an intervention.</P>
<P>The authors found 23 studies; only five of these measured the effect on injury, the remaining 18 measured the effect on behaviour (by the patrons and/or the servers of the alcohol within the premises). The studies investigated a range of interventions involving server training, health promotion initiatives, a drink driving service, a policy intervention and interventions that targeted the server setting environment.</P>
<P>The authors concluded that there is insufficient high quality evidence that interventions in the alcohol server setting are effective in preventing injuries. The evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions on patron alcohol consumption was found to be inconclusive. There is conflicting evidence as to whether server behaviour is improved and it is difficult to predict what effect this might have on actual injury risk.</P>
<P>Lack of compliance with interventions seems to be a particular problem; hence mandated interventions or those with associated incentives for compliance, may be more likely to show an effect. The methodology of future evaluations needs to be improved. The focus of research should be broadened to investigate the effectiveness of interventions other than server training, where previous research dominates. When the collection of injury outcome data is not feasible, research is needed to identify the most useful proxy indicators.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-07-08 14:49:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases to November 2008; Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PsycEXTRA, ISI Web of Science, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, TRANSPORT and ETOH. We also searched reference lists of articles and contacted experts in the field.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-07-08 14:58:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (NRTs) and controlled before and after studies (CBAs) of the effects of interventions administered in the server setting that attempted to modify the conditions under which alcohol is served and consumed, to facilitate sensible alcohol consumption and reduce the occurrence of alcohol-related harm.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-07-08 16:51:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Two authors independently screened search results and assessed the full texts of potentially relevant studies for inclusion. Data were extracted and methodological quality was examined. Due to variability in the types of interventions investigated, a pooled analysis was not appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-12 09:16:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall methodological quality was poor. Five studies used an injury outcome measure; one of these studies was randomised, the remaining four where CBA studies.</P>
<P>The RCT targeting the alcohol server setting environment with an injury outcome compared the introduction of toughened glassware (experimental) to annealed glassware (control) on the number of bar staff injuries; a greater number of injuries were detected in the experimental group (relative risk 1.72, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.59).</P>
<P>One CBA study investigated server training and estimated a reduction of 23% in single-vehicle, night-time crashes in the experimental area (controlled for crashes in the control area). Another CBA study examined the impact of a drink driving service, and reported a reduction in injury road crashes of 15% in the experimental area, with no change in the control; no difference was found for fatal crashes. In a CBA study investigating the impact of an intervention aiming to reduce crime in drinking premises, the study authors found a lower rate of all crime in the experimental premises (rate ratio 4.6, 95% CI 1.7 to 12, P = 0.01); no difference was found for injury (rate ratio 1.1 95% CI 0.1 to 10, P = 0.093). A CBA study investigating the impact of a policy intervention reported that pre-intervention the serious assault rate in the experimental area was 52% higher than the rate in the control area. After intervention, the serious assault rate in the experimental area was 37% lower than in the control area.</P>
<P>The effects of such interventions on patron alcohol consumption is inconclusive. One randomised trial found a statistically significant reduction in observed severe aggression exhibited by patrons. There is some indication of improved server behaviour but it is difficult to predict what effect this might have on injury risk.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-07-08 16:09:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials and well conducted controlled before and after studies to determine the effect of interventions administered in the alcohol server setting on injuries. Compliance with interventions appears to be a problem; hence mandated interventions may be more likely to show an effect. Randomised controlled trials, with adequate allocation concealment and blinding are required to improve the evidence base. Further well-conducted, non-randomised trials are also needed when random allocation is not feasible.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-08 17:27:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-12-29 12:02:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Injuries are a significant global public health burden. During the year 2000, it is estimated that five million people worldwide died from injuries. Globally they account for 9% of deaths and 12% of the burden of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2002a</LINK>). This burden is predicted to worsen; by 2020 it is estimated that deaths from injuries will increase to 8.4 million per year (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997a</LINK>). Injuries rank among the leading causes of mortality and burden of disease in all regions, affecting people of all ages and income groups (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Injuries can be caused by a number of factors, alcohol being just one. Hence, when considering the public health burden, it is useful to refer to the proportion of all injuries that can be attributed to alcohol. The 'attributable fraction' represents the extent to which injury rates would fall if alcohol use was eliminated. By conducting a meta-analysis of epidemiological research (primarily case-control and case-series studies) English et al (<LINK REF="REF-English-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">English 1996</LINK>) estimated the alcohol-attributable fractions for a range of disorders. <LINK REF="REF-Britton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 2001</LINK> used the figures from <LINK REF="REF-English-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">English 1996</LINK> and estimated that for England &amp; Wales in 1996, alcohol was responsible for: approximately 75,000 of premature life years lost, 99 of 210 (47%) deaths from assaults, 66 of 174 (38%) deaths from accidental drowning, 1176 of 3616 (33%) deaths from accidental falls, 178 of 405 (44%) deaths from fire-related injuries, 758 of 2948 (26%) deaths from motor vehicle crashes, and 997 of 3442 (29%) suicides. However, it should be noted that all estimates of attributable fractions assume causality and can only be as accurate as the studies upon which they are based. The influence of bias, such as confounding, may lead to less accurate estimates and should be considered. Nevertheless, alcohol can be considered to cause a considerable proportion of all injuries.</P>
<P>Evidence that alcohol consumption has some beneficial health effects complicates public health policy in this area. Research has indicated that alcohol, consumed in moderation, is protective against coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischaemic stroke, particularly in the middle-aged and elderly population (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 2001</LINK>). Injuries resulting from alcohol tend to affect drinkers at younger ages, especially in the 15 to 29 years age group, which results in greater years of potential life lost and disability over the proposed life span (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). CHD is rare in those younger than 50 years; hence most of the averted deaths are amongst the older ages. Thus, in terms of years of life lost, the adverse effects of drinking may outweigh any protection alcohol offers against CHD (<LINK REF="REF-Jernigan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jernigan 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The problems of alcohol and injury are not confined to developed countries. Indeed, the situation is particularly alarming in lower and middle-income countries, where alcohol consumption is increasing, injury rates are high, and appropriate public health policies have not been implemented (<LINK REF="REF-Poznyak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poznyak 2001</LINK>). Most of the increase in global alcohol consumption has occurred in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). In sub-Saharan Africa, where ischaemic heart disease is rare, the protective effects of alcohol are only of marginal public health importance while alcohol is a major cause of death and disability from injury (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997b</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-07-08 17:27:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Traditionally, injuries were perceived as random, unavoidable 'accidents', but in recent decades perceptions have altered and injuries are increasingly considered as preventable, non-random events (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the past, many interventions and much of the intervention research focused on individuals, targeting those considered at highest risk of alcohol-related problems. However, it has been suggested that such a focus on 'problem drinkers' is unlikely to result in a sustained decrease in problems at the population level, because the majority of alcohol-related problems are attributable to the substantial number of moderate drinkers who occasionally drink to intoxication (<LINK REF="REF-Babor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Babor 2003</LINK>). It is alcohol intoxication (i.e. drunkenness) that is recognised as a strong risk factor for injury, as opposed to long-term exposure to alcohol; thus preventing alcohol intoxication is a potentially effective approach for reducing the harm arising from alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-Babor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Babor 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Interventions that target all drinkers often have a demand-side focus, aiming to reduce individuals' demands and consequently consumption of alcohol, mainly through educational interventions. An alternative is to take a 'supply-side' approach. The principle of a supply-side approach is to implement interventions that modify the environment within which alcohol is supplied, and the drinking context. Observational research has suggested that the environment of alcohol serving premises can impact on the risk of injury. Specifically relating to violence, factors such as a lack of seating, loud music, overcrowding, lack of available food are considered risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Homel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Homel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rehm-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rehm 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Implementation of interventions in the server setting (e.g. bars, pubs, retailers) has the potential to maximise exposure; every alcohol consumer has contact with the industry in one form or another, while only a small proportion of these consumers come into contact with government services because of their alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Strategy-Unit-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strategy Unit 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 1985</LINK> estimated that approximately 50% of alcohol-related traffic crashes involve the prior consumption of alcohol on licensed premises, and a strong association between public violence and drinking on licensed premises is documented (<LINK REF="REF-Stockwell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockwell 2001</LINK>). Hence, when such risky consumption occurs in server settings, it makes them a logical focus for prevention efforts.</P>
<P>Efforts applied to the server setting imply a level of acceptance that alcohol consumption will occur but aim to modify the drinking and/or the drinking environment so that potential harm is prevented. Interventions within server settings can range from the way alcohol is packaged, promoted and sold, to the overall management and policy of the establishment within which it is consumed. Such interventions include server training, use of alternatives to standard drinking glassware (for example, toughened glass, plastic containers), discontinuation of alcoholic drink promotions (for example, 'happy hours'), using server settings as sites for health promotion initiatives amongst others, which may be implemented individually or in combination.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-04-11 16:57:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Reviews of research are essential tools for health care workers, researchers, consumers and policy-makers who want to keep up to date with evidence in their field. Systematic reviews enable a more objective appraisal of the evidence than traditional narrative reviews, and are important in demonstrating areas where the available evidence is insufficient and where further good quality trials are required (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is important that the effectiveness of interventions in the server setting is evaluated to aid policy decision-making and priority setting. <LINK REF="REF-Graham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2000</LINK> published a comprehensive narrative literature review of preventive approaches for on-premise drinking, and <LINK REF="REF-Shults-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shults 2001</LINK> conducted a systematic review to examine the effectiveness of server education specifically for preventing drink driving. However, no other systematic review attempting to quantify the effectiveness of all interventions delivered in the server setting on reducing all forms of injury has been identified. The purpose of this systematic review is to critically review the current evidence for the use of interventions delivered in the server setting for preventing injury.</P>

<P>The Health Technology Assessment report, 'Evaluating non-randomised intervention studies' (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2003</LINK>), contains a systematic review of quality assessment tools used for non-randomised studies and identifies six judged to be potentially useful for use in systematic reviews. For the present review, from these six, we selected a tool developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2003</LINK>) to assess methodological quality of all the study designs. A modified framework of the <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2003</LINK> quality tool was used to describe each of the included studies against the following criteria as available from the report;<BR/>

<LI>Allocation bias (for example, was allocation to the experimental and control groups random and adequately concealed?)</LI>
<LI>Confounders (for example, did the groups under study differ in terms of distribution of potential confounders?)</LI>

We completed a risk of bias table for each study, incorporating a description of the study's performance against each of the above domains and our overall judgment of the risk of bias for each entry, as follows: 'Yes' indicates low risk of bias, 'Unclear' indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias, 'No' indicates high risk of bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allocation bias</HEADING>
<P>In intervention studies, allocation should ideally be random and concealed. Allocation that is not random is likely to lead to unbalanced prognostic factors between the experimental and control groups, which will result in a biased estimate of the intervention effect. Nine studies reported using random allocation but the method used was only described in three of them; drawing lots was used in two (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnsson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsson 2003</LINK>), and a table of random numbers was used in two (<LINK REF="STD-McLean-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toomey-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Toomey 2008</LINK>). In none of the studies was concealment adequate.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Casteel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Casteel 2004</LINK>) allocated the bars that agreed to participate in the study to the experimental group and those that refused to the control group. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boots-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Boots 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Felson 1997</LINK>) allocated the intervention to an area previously identified as having a particularly high rate of alcohol-related problems; regression-to-the-mean should be considered in such instances and is described further in the 'Discussion' section.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparability of experimental and control groups at baseline</HEADING>
<P>Baseline differences in alcohol-related problems and/or average alcohol consumption between the experimental and control groups were reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boots-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Boots 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casteel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Casteel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Felson 1997</LINK>). Ten studies attempted to match participants prior to allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Gliksman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gliksman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard_x002d_Pitney-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Howard-Pitney 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krass-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Krass 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKnight-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McKnight 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltzer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peltzer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saltz-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Saltz 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saltz-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Saltz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toomey-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Toomey 2001</LINK>), although the number and type of factors matched for varied with each study. Two studies reported that the experimental and control groups had similar characteristics (<LINK REF="STD-Buka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Buka 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1998</LINK>). One noted the presence of some differences (<LINK REF="STD-Wallin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wallin 2002</LINK>). The remaining five studies did not report the presence (or absence) of baseline differences between the groups (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Holder 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnsson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLean-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russ-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Russ 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toomey-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Toomey 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warburton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warburton 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>To minimise observer bias, outcome assessors should ideally be blinded to the allocation status of participants, as they may be biased towards one group (consciously or not). Blinding of outcome assessment was used in 12 studies that used observers/interviewers to gather outcome data. The randomised controlled trial of toughened glassware (<LINK REF="STD-Warburton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warburton 2000</LINK>) also blinded the participants to their own allocation status. Such a double-blind design is not feasible in the other studies, due to the nature of the interventions under investigation; for example, participants cannot be blind to whether they received training or not.</P>
<P>Injury data (traffic crashes and violence) was collected from official records in four trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection method</HEADING>
<P>Methods by which outcome data are collected may be associated with their own biases. For example, self-reported measures of behaviour are likely to be more prone to bias than observed behaviour.</P>
<P>In the seven studies with a knowledge outcome, six of these measured this in the trained servers only. All trials used a self-completed test or questionnaire method. Response rates were high in the studies measuring knowledge immediately after the training and were lower in those with a longer follow-up.</P>
<P>Behaviour was measured in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boots-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Boots 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Buka 1999</LINK>) using self-reported data as the source of outcome data. Response rate to questionnaires tended to be low. Data on behaviour was gathered through observations by investigators in ten studies. Three (<LINK REF="STD-Johnsson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krass-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Krass 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLean-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 1994</LINK>) out of the four studies undertaking patron interviews used a breath test to assess intoxication whilst one (<LINK REF="STD-Saltz-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Saltz 1987</LINK>) collected self-reported data on alcohol consumption. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Johnsson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsson 2003</LINK>, which achieved an extremely high response rate for patron interview (&gt;95%), the remaining studies response rates were lower (range of 40 to 65%). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 1997</LINK>), in which the intervention was the promotion of the use of publicly available breathalysers, used data from these devices to determine the level of usage.</P>
<P>All but one of the studies gathering injury outcome data used official records as the source, the exception being <LINK REF="STD-Warburton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warburton 2000</LINK> which used a self-completed questionnaire.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Withdrawals and dropouts</HEADING>
<P>Withdrawals and dropouts need to be minimised in any intervention study. Participants choosing to withdraw from the study are likely to be those with the worst prognosis. It is also important that participants who do not receive or complete their assigned intervention, remain in the analysis (that is, analysis is on an intention-to-treat basis).</P>
<P>Seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boots-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Boots 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Buka 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Felson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Felson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Holder 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacey-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lacey 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saltz-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Saltz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wallin 2002</LINK>) allocated the intervention to areas of alcohol serving premises, and received a 'n/a' rating for this criterion. As the design was directed as a geographical area the percentage of participants completing, withdrawing or dropping out is not applicable.</P>
<P>Eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Casteel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Casteel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gliksman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gliksman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard_x002d_Pitney-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Howard-Pitney 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnsson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKnight-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McKnight 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russ-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Russ 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saltz-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Saltz 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toomey-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Toomey 2008</LINK>) using individual bar/premises as the unit of allocation, did not report any withdrawals, drop-outs or loss to follow-up.</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Krass-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Krass 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLean-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 1994</LINK>) reported bars refusing to participate in the patron surveys.</P>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Graham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltzer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peltzer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toomey-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Toomey 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warburton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warburton 2000</LINK>) reported bars withdrawing and/or lost to follow-up; none of these studies presented outcome data for the affected bars. The information available on one study (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 1997</LINK>) is unclear as regards withdrawals or drop-outs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intervention integrity and compliance</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies examining server training reported the number of participants trained as a proportion of total servers; three reported training all staff, one trained 84% while the remaining five trained 50 to 60% of staff. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Toomey-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Toomey 2008</LINK>) 85% of intervention establishments completed their comprehensive training course but only 28% of controls completed the reduced version of the training course that had been planned for them. One of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Holder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Holder 1994</LINK>) was of a mandated training policy, so it is assumed that compliance was high.</P>
<P>Two studies examining health promotion interventions both reported that the extent of compliance with the intervention varied between premises for example, varying from displaying the information to actively distributing it, no further details are reported. The report of the study promoting breathalyser (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 1997</LINK>) use does not make clear whether promotion activities were completed in all premises.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Warburton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warburton 2000</LINK> study involved replacing the bars' whole glassware supply; hence it is assumed compliance was high. The <LINK REF="STD-Casteel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Casteel 2004</LINK> study involved making recommendations to managers to implement environmental changes to the bar, again it was reported that compliance was variable.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Follow-up duration</HEADING>
<P>In the studies assessing the change in knowledge (<LINK REF="STD-Boots-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Boots 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gliksman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gliksman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard_x002d_Pitney-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Howard-Pitney 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krass-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Krass 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKnight-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McKnight 1991</LINK>), measurements were made immediately before and after training in two studies, three months after in two, with the remaining three not specifying length of data collection periods in the report.</P>
<P>The timing of post observations of server behaviour to pseudo-drunk patrons occurred within six months of administration of the intervention, with the exception of one (<LINK REF="STD-Wallin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wallin 2002</LINK>), in which observations were made three years after. In the same study (<LINK REF="STD-Wallin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wallin 2002</LINK>), post observations of server behaviour to patrons who appeared to be under-age were made two and five years after. In the study in which use of breathalysers was promoted (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 1997</LINK>), the duration of follow-up is unclear.</P>
<P>The timings of the patron interviews/surveys ranged from less than one week to three months after intervention implementation.</P>
<P>The length of data collection periods of injury data in the controlled before-and-after studies ranged from nine months to 11 years before and from three months to 15 years after. The <LINK REF="STD-Warburton-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warburton 2000</LINK> randomised trial collected injury data for six months after.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-07-08 17:08:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Due to variability in the intervention types investigated by the included studies, the results have been reviewed qualitatively. The interventions have been grouped into five broad categories; server training, health promotion initiatives, drink driving service, interventions targeting the server setting environment, and policy interventions. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Graham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2004</LINK>, studies in the server training category were investigating a sufficiently similar intervention to enable the studies to be presented together, with the results grouped by outcome. The focus of the training in <LINK REF="STD-Graham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2004</LINK> differed from the others thus has been reported separately. The results of the remaining studies in the other categories have been presented by study due to the variability of the interventions under investigation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Server training</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen studies investigated the effectiveness of server training; duration of the training interventions ranged from one to two hours to two days. All but one study involved training focusing on the responsible service of alcohol. Common training themes included raising awareness of alcohol service laws, recognition of early signs of alcohol intoxication, and tactics for dealing with intoxicated customers. Five of these reported a specific focus and/or specific training for the managers/owners in responsible alcohol service policies. In <LINK REF="STD-Graham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2004</LINK>, the training was not targeted at responsible service, but on the prevention and management of aggression in bars.</P>

<P>In the randomised study by <LINK REF="STD-Johnsson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Johnsson 2003</LINK> the post-intervention mean BAC levels were lower in the experimental bars (0.082%) than the control bars (0.087) (MD = -0.01 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.00). The study authors compared the change in BAC from pre to post intervention for both groups; the mean BAC in the experimental bars reduced to a greater extent than in the control bars, mean difference = -0.011% (95% CI 0.022 to 0.000). The odds ratio indicates a modest effect on the percentage of patrons with a BAC &gt; 0.1 (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.26), although this is compatible with the play of chance.</P>
<P>The randomised trial by <LINK REF="STD-Krass-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Krass 1994</LINK> reported that a statistically significant difference was not found between experimental and control bars in mean patron BAC or total consumption, with values increasing for both outcomes in both groups.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-08 16:06:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from high quality intervention studies that interventions in the alcohol server setting are effective in preventing injuries. Only one randomised trial with an injury outcome was identified and this did not detect a beneficial intervention effect. Three randomised controlled trials measured patron alcohol consumption, none of which found a confident estimate of effect. One randomised trial found a statistically significant reduction in observed severe aggression exhibited by patrons. There is conflicting evidence as to whether there is an improvement in server behaviour and the extent to which this might translate into a reduction in injury risk is unknown. Interpretation of this outcome is, therefore, of limited value.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-06-08 17:20:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The validity of the inferences based on a systematic review is dependent on the quality of the included studies. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies included in this review was judged to be weak.</P>
<P>Only eight studies used random allocation, and none of these were found to have adequate allocation concealment. Three of these studies used a cluster design and randomly allocated a very small number of clusters (<LINK REF="STD-Buka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Buka 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gliksman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gliksman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krass-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Krass 1994</LINK>). The benefits of randomisation are unlikely to be achieved with very small numbers. These studies have been classified as randomised trials in this systematic review however, they are likely to be as susceptible to allocation bias as the non-randomised trials.</P>
<P>Attempts were made in nine of the non-randomised designs to minimise confounding through matching of the experimental and control groups, but residual confounding remains a problem.</P>
<P>Ineffective and poorly concealed randomisation in the included studies, means confounding and bias are likely to have influenced the results.</P>
<P>Two studies allocated the intervention to an area previously identified as having a particularly high rate of alcohol-related problems. With such an approach, regression-to-the-mean should be considered. Regression-to-the-mean describes the tendency for an abnormally high (or low) number of events (e.g. injuries) to return to values closer to the long term mean. Any observed abnormally high (or low) number of events is thus a result of random fluctuation. It is a particular threat to controlled-before-and-after studies and has important implications when the study interest is a change in outcome. In such cases an apparent intervention effect may actually be a result of the number of events returning to the average rate after a random fluctuation. Consequently, these studies should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Blind outcome assessment was widely used in the included studies. It was reported as being used in 11 studies during the collection of behaviour data (important when collecting data on such a subjective outcome). Additionally, the studies measuring injury outcome extracted data from official records (e.g. crash data from government statistics, crime data from police records). When using data from such external, objective sources it is reasonable to assume that outcome assessment is blind.</P>
<P>Questionnaires and interviews were often used to examine behaviour; the response rates were low in a number of studies. This is a source of potential bias as the non-responders are likely to have the worst prognosis or be at most risk. Such a bias leads to an overestimation of an intervention effect. A number of studies attempted to minimise this bias in the patron interviews, by judging the intoxication level of non-responders. Similarly, participants who withdraw from the study or are lost to follow-up are likely to have a poorer prognosis. However, details of such withdrawals and drop-outs were often not reported; of the few studies that did, it seemed that analysis was not on an intention-to-treat basis, nor was outcome data for such non-participants presented. Cautious interpretation of such studies is needed, as it is likely that their findings over-estimate any intervention effect.</P>
<P>Intervention compliance was also a problem for many of the studies. In the server training studies, the number of servers actually receiving training in the experimental groups was relatively low, often 50 to 60%. Hence, follow-up observations of server behaviour had a good chance of being based on a number of untrained servers. In the health promotion studies, compliance was reported as 'variable'. Such a low or variable compliance is a problem for the assessment of intervention efficacy, but does indicate the effectiveness of such interventions, which is arguably of greater interest to public health intervention research.</P>
<P>It is difficult to quantify a sufficient length for a data collection period, but it should be long enough to account for short-term fluctuations to provide a reliable estimate of outcome. Due to the relatively short length of follow-up in most studies it is difficult to be confident that a change in outcome is a result of random fluctuation or if any real intervention effect lessens (or increases) over time.</P>
<P>A number of the included studies used a cluster design. A problem posed by cluster data arises from the fact that individuals within a cluster tend to be more similar to each other than to other members of other clusters. Failure to account for this can cause a type of 'unit of analysis error', which results in the P-values being too small and the confidence intervals too narrow (<LINK REF="REF-Wears-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wears 2002</LINK>), and can spuriously overestimate the significance of difference (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2002</LINK>). Eight studies reported using appropriate statistical techniques to adjust for this cluster error in their analyses.</P>
<P>Of the variety of interventions that have the potential to be implemented in the server setting, much of the existing literature and intervention research focuses on just one: server training. Such an approach places the emphasis on the supply-side of alcohol consumption and aims to enable servers to facilitate responsible drinking in their patrons. The approach assumes that an improvement in knowledge leads to an improvement in behaviour, which in turn will reduce the occurrence of injury. However, the appropriateness of this assumption might be questioned; behaviour is a complex concept and subject to multiple influences, knowledge being just one. For example, it is recognised that educational interventions are not effective in reducing alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Hope-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 2004</LINK>), hence to assume that such an approach can change the behaviour of servers may be inappropriate.</P>
<P>The required large sample size is likely to be a main reason for the lack of injury outcome data in the included studies, with proxy measures such as behaviour used instead. However, it is unclear how observed behaviour is related to the occurrence of injury. Even if a causal relationship between behaviour and injury is assumed, there is no reliable effect estimates which would enable the prediction of the extent to which a given behaviour change reduces the rate of injury. For example, two of the studies of server training used server behaviour as the main outcome, reported as a behaviour score. It is difficult, however, to translate the practical implications of such a measure to injury risk and/or alcohol consumption. A previously published systematic review of primary prevention interventions for alcohol misuse in young people, by <LINK REF="REF-Foxcroft-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foxcroft 2002</LINK>, described the difficulty in judging relative effectiveness of different interventions, when the evaluations report different outcomes and the public health relevance of these different outcomes is unknown. <LINK REF="REF-Foxcroft-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foxcroft 2002</LINK> highlighted the need for a systematic review of the evidence for subsequent alcohol-related problems provided by such indicators, which should lead to greater clarity over the type of measures to be used in future evaluations.</P>
<P>The low rating of methodological quality of the included studies is undoubtedly a reflection of the numerous challenges posed by conducting research in this area; is it expected that many public health studies will never meet all of the criteria for quality (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2004</LINK>). The nature of the interventions, participants and outcomes under investigation can prohibit elements of study design, such as blinding and randomisation, which are important elements for study validity. Thus our overall 'weak' rating may be unsurprising. However, it is important that researchers attempt to maximise their studies' validity, when it is feasible. For example, of the seven randomised trials included in this review, none reported using adequate allocation concealment; yet allocation concealment is always possible, irrespective of topic (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>This systematic review addresses a focused research question using predefined inclusion criteria and methodology to select and appraise eligible studies.</P>
<P>As with all systematic reviews, the possibility of publication bias should be considered as a potential threat to validity. Identification of research for systematic reviews of public health interventions tends to require more complex searching than for reviews of medical interventions. The multi-disciplinary nature of the research means that it is more widely scattered, with much published in the grey literature (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2005</LINK>). In recognition of this, the search strategy for this systematic review involved searching multiple electronic databases from a range of disciplines (including two specifically of grey literature), checking of reference lists and contact with experts in the field, to identify all potentially eligible studies, published and unpublished. With such a comprehensive search strategy, the likelihood of having missed an important, relevant study is remote, thus the influence of publication bias on the findings of this systematic review can be discounted with reasonable confidence.</P>
<P>The included studies often used a number of outcome measures to examine intervention effectiveness; it was not possible for us to anticipate all of these when defining the inclusion criteria at the protocol stage. Therefore, for a small number of studies, we selected to report only the measures which we judge to be the most reliable and meaningful in contributing to the objectives of the review. Although these decisions were not made in reference to the results data, they are post hoc decisions and thus a potential weakness of this review.</P>
<P>The findings of this systematic review are limited by the overall poor methodological quality of the included studies; poorly designed and executed studies are susceptible to bias and can lead to either an over or under estimate of effect.</P>
<P>Several studies were conducted over a decade ago, so their relevance and generalisability to the present situation is questionable. An additional limitation is that no studies conducted in low and middle income countries were identified.</P>

<P>A previous systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Shults-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shults 2001</LINK> examined the effectiveness of server training in reducing drink driving. Five controlled studies were included (<LINK REF="STD-Gliksman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gliksman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Holder 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russ-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Russ 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saltz-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Saltz 1987</LINK>), three of which were non-randomised designs with patron alcohol consumption as an outcome. The review concluded that 'there is sufficient evidence that face-to-face server training, when accompanied by strong and active management support, is effective in reducing the level of intoxication in patrons' and is 'likely to have a desirable effect on alcohol impaired driving if the affected patrons cease drinking or continue drinking in relatively safe environments after leaving the drinking establishment'. In addition to the five articles previously identified by <LINK REF="REF-Shults-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shults 2001</LINK>, this present systematic review includes a further ten studies of server training, two of which were randomised trials measuring patron alcohol consumption as an outcome. The additional studies provide no good evidence that the intervention is effective in preventing injury or reducing patron alcohol consumption. Therefore the existence of 'sufficient evidence' for the effectiveness of server training in reducing alcohol intoxication might now be considered tentative.</P>
<P>Shults' review focused on trials of server training in reducing drink driving, no other systematic reviews of server setting interventions have been located to enable comparison.</P>
<P>Interventions such as server training, which effectively place responsibility of sensible alcohol consumption on the server, may be limited as an effective strategy due to the nature of the alcohol industry and server work. There are potential difficulties associated with interventions for which implementation is controlled by the alcohol industry; if interventions compromise profit margins, it is reasonable to suggest that the alcohol industry will resist their implementation, without the presence of incentives and/or legislation. Additionally, it should be considered that bar work is generally low paid, and is a profession with a high turnover of staff. Such a highly mobile workforce makes the process of training difficult, unless training was mandated and completion of training was a prerequisite for employment. Effective implementation amongst servers may also be resisted without financial reward for the additional responsibility placed upon them, in an already low paid and often stressful environment.</P>
<P>The relatively poor compliance with the interventions, particularly the server training interventions, may suggest a feeling of ambivalence or lack of belief in the benefits of intervention. Future studies should consider ways to improve uptake and intervention compliance, such as by involvement of relevant parties in the study design. Compliance with the assigned intervention is important. Non-compliance reduces the statistical power of a trial to detect any true effect of the study intervention. In such cases it is not certain that an observed non-significant effect is due to an ineffective intervention or to its incomplete implementation. This information also indicates the feasibility of delivering the intervention in the real life setting; if integrity of implementation in a study situation is low it is likely to be poor in practice (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2005</LINK>). This apparent compliance problem may have implications for the effectiveness of policies outlined in the UK Government's 'Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England' (<LINK REF="REF-Strategy-Unit-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strategy Unit 2004</LINK>), in which there is a focus on voluntary agreements with the alcohol industry in preference to a mandated approach. The findings of this systematic review suggests that it is likely that the UK Government will be required to take a firmer stance with the alcohol industry in the adoption of harm prevention policy, if any discernible effect is to be seen. However, the challenge is that usually an intervention is only likely to be made mandatory once evidence for effectiveness has been established. The Government's preference for a voluntary approach with the alcohol industry has lead to concern in regard to the lobbying influence of the industry on public policy (<LINK REF="REF-MacQueen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacQueen 2004</LINK>), which worryingly might be likened to that exhibited by the tobacco industry on anti-smoking policy.</P>
<P>It is not the aim of this systematic review to make policy recommendations; policy making is a complex process in which examination of the evidence base, whilst crucial, is just one component. This review has been prepared recognising that different people interpret evidence differently; therefore the included studies have been reviewed and presented in a systematic and explicit way, so that readers are able to examine the evidence and reach their own conclusions, applicable to their own setting. A lack of evidence for effect of an approach should not necessarily prohibit its adoption; interventions in the server setting should be considered in relation to the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative alcohol harm prevention interventions, in the context of the particular setting of interest.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-07-08 17:12:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-07-08 17:12:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials and well conducted non-randomised studies to determine the effect of interventions in the alcohol server setting on injuries. Lack of compliance with the interventions seems to be a particular problem; hence mandated interventions or other incentives to improve compliance may be more likely to show an effect.</P>
<P>The apparent compliance problem is likely to have implications for the success of proposed strategies outlined in the Alcohol Harm Strategy for England, in which there is a preference for voluntary agreements with the alcohol industry in regard to intervention implementation. It is probable that such voluntary interventions will suffer limited uptake and thus have limited effect.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The methodology of future evaluations needs to be improved. Randomised controlled trials, with adequate allocation concealment and blinding, are needed to improve the evidence base. Further well conducted non-randomised trials are also needed, when random allocation is not feasible. </P>
<P>The focus of research should be broadened to investigate the effectiveness of interventions other than server training, where previous research dominates.</P>
<P>When the collection of injury outcome data is not feasible, research is needed to identify the most useful proxy indicators. </P>
<P>Finally, future studies should be designed with the aim of contributing to the evidence base, not simply as stand alone evaluations.</P>

<P>Server training<BR/>CAAIPP alcohol server training. Twenty-four training courses were held, each lasting five hours, with 5-15 servers attending each course. The training curriculum was developed from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The training emphasised training by peer servers; each session was co-facilitated by a server and an alcohol treatment/prevention professional from the community. The purpose of the training was to provide servers with the knowledge and skills required to prevent patrons from becoming intoxicated, prevent service of alcohol to minors, identify and stop service to intoxicated patrons and help prevent injuries to those individuals as well as informing servers of their legal liability if they fail to obey dram shop laws.</P>

Basic elements included keeping a minimal amount of cash in the till, ensuring good visibility into and out of premises, bright interior and exterior lighting, escape routes and training of employees in how to respond to robbery and shoplifting events. From a baseline assessment, an individualised safety plan was designed. Stores also received manuals, copy of the plan and other educational materials.

<P>Server training The 'Safer Bars' intervention, aim to reduce aggression in bars. Two main components; <BR/>1) risk assessment workbook (alerting environmental factors); this was drawn directly from published research on alcohol-related aggression; alerted the bar owner to environmental factors e.g. potential problems relating to the floor plan of the bar and the role of environmental expectations.<BR/>2) three hour training programme also drawn from bar-room research, to identify common types of incidents of aggression and staff behaviours contributing to aggression as well as staff behaviours that are effective in avoiding and defusing aggression. The training covered; i) recognising the early signs of aggression and intervening early ii) assessing the situation and planning a response iii) techniques for preventing loss of control due to anger iv) body language and non-verbal techniques v) responding to problem situations vi) legal issues relating to managing aggression and problem behaviour Staff were paid for participation in the study.<BR/>

<P>Server training<BR/>Training for Intervention Procedures by Servers of Alcohol (TIPS), approximately six hours in length. During the training, servers are given information on the physiological effects of alcohol that can help them identify specific earning signs indicating when a customer is about to overindulge.

<P>Server training<BR/>Community intervention, five components: <BR/>1) community mobilisation; <BR/>2) responsible beverage service; <BR/>3) drinking and driving (law enforcement); <BR/>4) underage drinking (reducing availability); <BR/>5) alcohol access component.<BR/>The primary goal of the responsible beverage service component was to reduce the likelihood of customer intoxication at licensed on-premise establishments through responsible beverage service practices. A second goal was for licensees to prevent already intoxicated patrons from driving or engaging in other risky behaviour when impaired. Emphasis was placed on the managers' responsibility.<BR/>Training; four hour programme for servers, five hours for managers. The underlying philosophy was that of prevention (of intoxication and problems) rather than intervention (after a customer has become intoxicated or is causing problems).</P>

<P>BEHAVIOUR OF PATRONS<BR/>1) Drink driving offences<BR/>No quantitative data presented. The authors report that 'the downward trend in drink driving offences from intervention premises leading up to the project was continued during the evaluation period, while the figure for the control sites remained relatively unchanged. However, the number of drink driving cases from both intervention and control premises were too few to permit any meaningful evaluation'.<BR/>2) Percentage of tested patrons with a BAL(mg%)&gt; 0.15<BR/>This reduced over the study period, with the decline greater for experimental sites (17.4% to 5.3%) than control (10.1 to 3.7%), this is not significant (P=0.389).<BR/>3) Percentage of tested patrons with a BAL&gt;0.08<BR/>This decreased from 52% to 26.9% in experimental sites and decreased from 34.8% to 24%, this rate of decline is significantly greater (P&lt;0.029) for the experimental than for the control group.<BR/>
<BR/>SELF-REPORTED SERVER BEHAVIOUR<BR/>Changes in the average ratings in mean score of the adoption of responsible service policies over the pre and post periods were reported as not statistically significant (full results of significance test is not presented). Total score increased from -0.7 to 0.9 in intervention sites and remained unchanged at -1.8 in control sites (maximum possible score=+2, minimum possible score= -2).<BR/>
<BR/>OBSERVED SERVER BEHAVIOUR<BR/>Reported that there was no difference between experimental and control in terms of refusal of service to intoxicated pseudos.<BR/>In the experimental group, 1 out of 11 visits and 3 out of 14 visits were refused service in the pre and post period respectively. In the control group, 1 out of 14 visits were refused service in both the pre and post period. Authors report that 'no further analyses were undertaken'.<BR/>
