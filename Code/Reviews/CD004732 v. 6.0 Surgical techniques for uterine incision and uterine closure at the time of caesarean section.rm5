<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-23 09:51:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caesarean section is a common abdominal operation for surgical delivery of a baby and the placenta. Techniques vary depending on the clinical situation and surgeon preferences. Safe delivery is important for mother and infant. Any potential reduction of birth trauma to the infant has to be balanced against increased ill-health for the mother. Factors include not only the duration of the surgical procedure and maternal blood loss but also maternal postoperative pain, continuing blood loss and development of anaemia, fever and wound infection. Additional complications can include problems with breastfeeding, passing urine, longer-term fertility problems, and complications in future pregnancies (uterine rupture) or increased risks associated with future surgery.</P>
<P>The review authors searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials to inform the most appropriate surgical techniques to use. Twenty-seven trials involving 17,808 women from a number of different countries contributed to the review. None of these trials assessed the type of uterine incision (side to side (transverse) lower uterine segment incision versus other types of uterine incision). Results from 18 randomised trials contributed to reports that single layer closure of the uterine incision was associated with a reduction in blood loss, and duration of the procedure. In these studies the surgical procedure for entering the abdominal cavity also differed and could have contributed to blood loss and duration of surgery.</P>
<P>Five trials compared blunt with sharp dissection at the time of the uterine incision (2141 women) and a further two trials auto-suture devices with standard hysterotomy (300 women). Blunt surgery was associated with a reduction in mean blood loss at the time of the procedure. The use of an auto-suture instrument did not clearly reduce procedural blood loss but increased the duration of the procedure. Overall, trials focused on blood loss and duration of the operative procedure rather than clinical outcomes for the women. The methodological quality of the trials was variable.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-15 12:45:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Our search strategy identified 60 studies for consideration, of which 27 randomised trials involving 17,808 women undergoing caesarean section were included in the review. Overall, the methodological quality of the trials was variable, with 12 of the 27 included trials adequately describing the randomisation sequence, with less than half describing adequately methods of allocation concealment, and only six trials indicating blinding of outcome assessors.</P>
<P>Two trials compared auto-suture devices with traditional hysterotomy involving 300 women. No statistically significant difference in febrile morbidity between the stapler and conventional incision groups was apparent (risk ratio (RR) 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 2.20).</P>
<P>Five studies were included in the review that compared blunt versus sharp dissection when performing the uterine incision involving 2141 women. There were no statistically significant differences identified for the primary outcome febrile morbidity following blunt or sharp extension of the uterine incision (four studies; 1941 women; RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.05). Mean blood loss (two studies; 1145 women; average mean difference (MD) -55.00 mL; 95% CI -79.48 to -30.52), and the need for blood transfusion (two studies; 1345 women; RR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.62) were significantly lower following blunt extension.</P>
<P>A single trial compared transverse with cephalad-caudad blunt extension of the uterine incision, involving 811 women, and while mean blood loss was reported to be lower following transverse extension (one study; 811 women; MD 42.00 mL; 95% CI 1.31 to 82.69), the clinical significance of such a small volume difference is of uncertain clinical relevance. There were no other statistically significant differences identified for the limited outcomes reported.</P>
<P>A single trial comparing chromic catgut with polygactin-910, involving 9544 women reported that catgut closure versus closure with polygactin was associated with a significant reduction in the need for blood transfusion (one study, 9544 women, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.76) and a significant reduction in complications requiring re-laparotomy (one study, 9544 women, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.89).</P>
<P>Nineteen studies were identified comparing single layer with double layer closure of the uterus, with data contributed to the meta-analyses from 14 studies. There were no statistically significant differences identified for the primary outcome, febrile morbidity (nine studies; 13,890 women; RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12). Although the meta-analysis suggested single layer closure was associated with a reduction in mean blood loss, heterogeneity is high and this limits the clinical applicability of the result. There were no differences identified in risk of blood transfusion (four studies; 13,571 women; average RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.15; I² = 49%), or other reported clinical outcomes.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-07-08 14:00:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Caesarean section is a common major operation performed on women in the world. Essentially, the operation involves exposing the uterus by entering the abdominal cavity through the abdominal wall. The peritoneal lining of the abdomen is opened and the peritoneum covering the uterus is usually also entered. The bladder is reflected away from the uterus to reduce the chance of damage to it during the operation. The uterus is then incised and the baby and placenta delivered. Adequate haemostasis (control of bleeding) is achieved by closure of the uterine muscle, followed by closure of the abdominal wall.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-07-09 22:06:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There are many possible ways of performing a caesarean section operation, and operative techniques vary widely. The techniques used may depend on many factors, including the clinical situation and the preferences of the operator. Another Cochrane review providing an overview of the techniques, indications for caesarean section and postoperative complications, has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our review specifically assessed surgical techniques involving the uterus at the time at caesarean section, and included:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the type of uterine incision (lower transverse uterine incision versus other types of uterine incision);</LI>
<LI>methods of performing the uterine incision ('sharp' uterine entry versus 'blunt' uterine entry);</LI>
<LI>suturing materials and techniques for the uterus at caesarean section; and</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Part one: type of uterine incision at caesarean section</HEADING>
<P>Part one of this review compares the outcomes of caesarean sections performed using a transverse lower segment uterine incision with other types of uterine incision (low vertical, 'classical', T-shaped or J-shaped incision).</P>
<P>The transverse (side-to-side) lower segment uterine incision is widely used in obstetric practice today. This incision has been favoured because the lower uterine segment is less vascular than the body of the uterus, and the incision is easier to repair. This leads to a reduction in operative complications, especially haemorrhage, and also a reduction in morbidity. Lower segment incisions are also associated with a lower incidence of uterine dehiscence or rupture in subsequent pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Tahilramaney-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tahilramaney 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of a low vertical uterine incision has been recommended in certain clinical situations, particularly in delivery of the preterm infant, where the lower uterine segment may be poorly formed and the longitudinal incision may facilitate delivery and reduce birth trauma by improved surgical access.</P>
<P>A 'classical' uterine incision involves a vertical (up and down cut) in the upper body of the uterus, and is used more rarely. It may be used when the baby is in a transverse lie (that is, lying across the mother's uterus), when the infant is preterm, or if there is an anterior placenta praevia (the placenta lies in the lower segment and on the front wall of the uterus where the lower transverse uterine incision is usually made), but in practice, this incision is rarely used. Haemorrhage is potentially more severe when an upper uterine segment incision is used, and the repair often requires closure in three layers as the myometrium (uterine muscle) is thicker in this part of the uterus.</P>
<P>Occasionally, a transverse lower segment incision is made, and during the operation, the incision needs to be extended in order to obtain better surgical access, or to facilitate delivery of the infant. In these situations, the incision may be extended vertically in the midline, into the upper segment of the uterus forming an inverted (upside-down) T-shaped incision. Alternatively, the incision may be extended vertically from the end of the transverse incision to form a J-shaped incision.</P>
<P>Potential injuries that may occur for the infant during a traumatic caesarean birth include fractures, peripheral nerve damage, spinal cord injury and subdural haematoma. Any potential reduction of birth trauma to the infant has to be balanced against potential increased morbidity to the mother such as operative blood loss and postoperative complications. In particular, consideration needs to be given to mode of birth in any subsequent pregnancy. Uterine rupture is a significant risk in a subsequent pregnancy or labour, with estimates of occurrence being 4% to 9% for classical (uterine body, midline) caesarean incision; 4% to 9% for inverted T-shaped incisions; 1% to 7% for lower uterine segment vertical incisions; and 0.2% to 1.5% for lower uterine segment transverse incisions (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 1999</LINK>). Current ACOG guidelines limit trial of vaginal birth after caesarean section to women with a lower uterine segment transverse incision, and recommend repeat caesarean birth for women with a prior classical or inverted T-shaped uterine scar (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 1999</LINK>). Any consideration of the benefits associated with a particular uterine incision must also consider the longer-term risks associated with repeat caesarean.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Part two: methods of performing the uterine incision</HEADING>
<P>Part two of this review compares the outcomes of caesarean sections performed using different methods of incising the uterus (including autostapling and sharp and blunt uterine entry).</P>
<P>When the uterus is incised at the time of caesarean section, the incision may be made in the centre of the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and then extended laterally with scissors ('sharp' uterine entry) or by digital extension (using the fingers) ('blunt' uterine entry). There has been ongoing debate about which of these forms of entry results in better maternal and infant outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 1994</LINK>). Theoretical benefits of sharp uterine entry include more rapid delivery of the baby, and a more controlled entry, with less likelihood of the incision extending into the broad ligament or uterine vessels. The 'clean' incision may also be easier to repair. Proponents of blunt uterine entry argue that following the tissue planes reduces blood loss and improves healing, and that dispensing with an instrument improves control over the entry.</P>
<P>Autostapling techniques involve the insertion of staples as the surgical incision is made in order to keep the operating field as bloodless as possible (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 2006</LINK>). The Auto Suture Poly CS 57 Stapler was developed in the early 1990s. Its aim was to achieve haemostasis through the placement of a double layer of absorbable sutures before the uterine incision was made. The technique may be useful in particular circumstances, for example, where the woman is infected with HIV, reducing contamination with maternal blood and potentially reducing viral transmission to the infant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Part three: suturing materials and techniques for the uterus</HEADING>
<P>Part three of this review compares the outcomes of caesarean sections performed using different materials and techniques for closure of the uterine incision.</P>
<P>There are a range of suture materials and techniques used in surgical procedures, with the choice often resting with the preference of the operator. For example, some advocate a single continuous suture to close the uterus, which can be locked or not locked. Others advocate multiple or interrupted sutures. Depending on local resources and preference, different types of suture including monofilament and polyfilament/multifilament may be used to close the uterus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Part four: single versus double layer suturing for closing the uterine incision</HEADING>
<P>Part four of this review compares the outcomes of caesarean sections performed using single layer closure of the uterine incision with those using double layer closure.</P>
<P>One specific question about the technique used for uterine closure is whether it should be closed with one layer of sutures or two. Traditionally, the transverse lower segment uterine incision is closed in two layers (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2006</LINK>). Those who advocate double closure of the uterus cite improved haemostasis and wound healing, and possibly a reduced risk of uterine rupture in a subsequent pregnancy. Single layer closure may be associated with reduced operating time, less tissue disruption, and less introduction of foreign suture material into the wound. These potential advantages may translate into reduced operative and postoperative morbidity for women. However, a recent observational study from Canada has suggested that single layer closure of the lower uterine segment at caesarean section is associated with a four-fold increase in the risk of uterine rupture in a subsequent pregnancy when compared with double layer uterine closure (odds ratio 3.95, 95% confidence interval 1.35 to 11.49) (<LINK REF="REF-Bujold-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bujold 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>We planned to include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. No cluster-randomised trials were identified for this update. In future updates, if identified and analysed, we will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> [Section 16.3.4] using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We planned to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-07-09 22:09:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of  Tau² and I².</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-15 12:47:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>While caesarean section is a common procedure performed on women worldwide, there is limited information available to inform the most appropriate surgical technique to adopt. Our review did not identify any randomised controlled trials assessing the type of uterine incision to be used (transverse lower uterine segment incision versus other types of uterine incision), the materials used to suture the uterus, or techniques of suture closure (continuous suture versus interrupted suture; locking versus unlocked suture).</P>
<P>While blunt dissection of the uterine incision was associated with a reduction in the mean blood loss at the procedure and the need for blood transfusion, there were no other differences identified in clinical outcomes. The use of an auto-suture device was associated with a reduction in the mean blood loss at the procedure, but an increase in the duration of the procedure when compared with performing a traditional hysterotomy. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences identified in the clinical outcomes reported.</P>
<P>Closure of the uterus with chromic catgut was associated with a reduction in blood transfusion and complications requiring re-laparotomy, however, there was no significant difference in any other clinical outcomes. The only trial making this comparison allowed surgeons to use any suture technique, i.e. continuous, continuous locking and interrupted sutures and this is an important potential confounder for these outcomes.</P>
<P>Although single layer closure of the uterine incision was associated with a reduction in mean blood loss, and duration of the operative procedure, there were no statistically significant differences identified in the risk of febrile morbidity and other clinically relevant outcomes. Most of the studies involved in this comparison were assessing different methods of performing the whole caesarean section operation (for example, a "whole procedure" technique, which includes as one aspect the single layer closure versus another "whole procedure technique" that includes a double layer closure). Different components of these procedures involve variation in the methods used to enter the abdominal cavity, which in turn may influence the extent of blood loss, and duration of the procedure.</P>

<P>Overall, reporting of the prespecified review outcomes was poor, with the majority of trials focusing on estimates of mean blood loss and duration of the operative procedure, rather than measures reflecting health outcomes.

<P>Despite caesarean section being a common operation, for many aspects of the procedure, there is limited high quality information available to suggest that one surgical technique is superior to another. There is no information available to inform the most appropriate uterine incision. There is little information to support the most appropriate method of performing the uterine incision (blunt versus sharp dissection) or to support the use of an auto-suture device. There is limited information available to inform the optimal suture technique for the uterine incision. Consideration should be given to suture material for uterine closure, as closure with chromic catgut was associated with a lower risk of blood transfusion, when compared with polygactin-910, with no difference in other clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>Caesarean section is a common procedure performed on women worldwide. There is increasing evidence that for many techniques, short-term maternal outcomes are equivalent. Until long-term health effects are known, surgeons should continue to use the techniques they prefer and currently use.</P>

<P>Two authors evaluated trials under consideration for appropriateness for inclusion and methodological quality without consideration of their results according to the prestated eligibility criteria.</P>
<P>We assessed trials that met the eligibility criteria for quality using the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>generation of random allocation sequence: adequate, inadequate, unclear;</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment: A = adequate, B = unclear, C = inadequate;</LI>
<LI>blinding of participants: yes, no, inadequate, no information;</LI>
<LI>blinding of caregivers: yes, no, inadequate, no information;</LI>
<LI>blinding of outcome assessment: yes, no, inadequate, no information;</LI>
<LI>completeness of follow-up data (including any differential loss of participants from each group): (a) less than 3% of participants excluded; (b) 3% to 9.9% of participants excluded; (c) 10% to 19.9% of participants excluded; (d) 20% or more excluded; and (e) unclear;</LI>
<LI>analysis of participants in randomised groups.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Two authors extracted data independently. We resolved differences of opinion by discussion or referral to the primary editor. We included in the 'Studies awaiting classification' category studies reported only in abstract form that contained insufficient detail to allow assessment of their eligibility or methods. They will be included in the analyses when published as full reports.</P>
<P>We combined data from different trials if they were sufficiently similar for this to be reasonable in the judgement of the authors. We performed meta-analyses using risk ratios as the measure of effect size for binary outcomes, and mean differences for continuous outcome measures.</P>
<P>We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining study data where the trials were judged to be sufficiently similar. We investigated heterogeneity by calculating statistics (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>), and if this indicated a high level of heterogeneity among the trials included in an analysis, we used random-effects meta-analysis for an overall summary. We explored high levels of heterogeneity, where found, by the prespecified subgroup analyses and by sensitivity analyses excluding trials most susceptible to bias based on the quality assessment: those with inadequate allocation concealment; high levels of postrandomisation losses or exclusions; or unblinded outcome assessment, or blinding of outcome assessment uncertain. However, this was not conducted due to the number of trials included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Planned subgroup analyses were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>first versus repeat caesarean versus mixed/undefined;</LI>
<LI>prelabour versus intrapartum caesarean versus mixed/undefined;</LI>
<LI>preterm versus term caesarean versus mixed/undefined;</LI>
<LI>general versus regional anaesthesia versus mixed/undefined.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We investigated heterogeneity to assess the differences between the subgroups using the methods described by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>.</P>
