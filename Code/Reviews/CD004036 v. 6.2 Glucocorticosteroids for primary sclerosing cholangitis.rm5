<TITLE>Insufficient evidence to support or refute glucocorticosteroids for primary sclerosing cholangitis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-29 14:34:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic disease of intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts, characterised by chronic periductal inflammation and sclerosis of the ducts, which results in segmental stenoses of bile ducts, cholestasis, fibrosis, and, ultimately, liver cirrhosis. Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis are at higher risk of cholangiocarcinoma as well as of colonic neoplasia, since primary sclerosing cholangitis is associated with inflammatory bowel disease in more than 80% of patients. Several therapeutic modalities have been proposed for primary sclerosing cholangitis, like ursodeoxycholic acid, glucocorticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents, but none has been successful in reversing the process of the disease. To date, liver transplantation is the only definite therapeutic solution for patients with advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis with liver cirrhosis.</P>
<P>Two trials on glucocorticosteroids for primary sclerosing cholangitis were identified. One trial compared biliary lavage with hydrocortisone versus saline. This trial was stopped due to adverse events. The other trial compared oral administration of budesonide versus prednisone. No statistically significant effects were found on mortality, serum activity of alkaline phosphatases, serum bilirubin, and adverse events for any of the evaluated intervention regimens.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-10-07 11:49:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Authors extracted data independently and assessed the methodological quality by the generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, double blinding, follow-up, incomplete outcome data reporting, selective reporting, baseline imbalance, and early stopping. The results of the meta-analyses were presented as relative risks (RR) or mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-10-07 11:51:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two randomised clinical trials were eligible for inclusion. One trial compared biliary lavage with hydrocortisone versus saline in 17 patients. Hydrocortisone tended to increase adverse events (pancreatitis, cholangitis with septicaemia, paranoid ideas, fluid retention) (RR 3.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 22.9) and had no cholangiographic improvement, which led to termination of the trial. The other trial compared budesonide versus prednisone in 18 patients. Patients had statistically significant higher serum bilirubin concentration after treatment with prednisone compared with budesonide (MD 10.4 µmol/litre, 95% CI 1.16 to 19.64 µmol/litre). No other statistically significant effects on clinical or biochemical outcomes were reported on any of the evaluated interventions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-11 10:38:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a slowly progressive chronic cholestatic disease of unknown etiology characterised by progressive segmental obliterative fibrosis of the biliary tree (<LINK REF="REF-LaRusso-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaRusso 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chapman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cullen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silveira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silveira 2008</LINK>). The disease may lead to liver fibrosis, portal hypertension, and premature death from liver failure (<LINK REF="REF-Wee-1985a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wee 1985a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silveira-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silveira 2008a</LINK>). The risk of liver-related mortality and morbidity depends on genetic or immune factors, portal bacteraemia (associated with inflammatory bowel disease), viral infections, toxins, and ischaemic injury (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wee-1985b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wee 1985b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olerup-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olerup 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LaRusso-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaRusso 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poupon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poupon 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Primary sclerosing cholangitis can be classified as a large-duct or a small-duct variant (<LINK REF="REF-Ludwig-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludwig 1981</LINK>). The large-duct variant involves the extrahepatic bile ducts and parts of the intrahepatic ductal system, which can be visualised cholangiographically and sometimes through histological findings. The small-duct variant involves the intrahepatic bile ducts and can only be visualised through histological findings (<LINK REF="REF-Ludwig-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludwig 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ludwig-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludwig 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Charatcharoenwitthaya-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charatcharoenwitthaya 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2008</LINK>). Primary sclerosing cholangitis is diagnosed using biochemical, radiological, and hepatic histological criteria. The diagnostic criteria include elevated alkaline phosphatases (<LINK REF="REF-Lindor-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindor 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grijm-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Grijm 1986</LINK>) and cholangiographic demonstration of diffusely distributed and irregular multifocal strictures of the bile ducts (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1984</LINK>). The severity of the histological findings (<LINK REF="REF-Wiesner-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiesner 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ludwig-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludwig 1986</LINK>) are categorised as stage 1 (cholangitis or portal hepatitis), stage 2 (periportal fibrosis and hepatitis), stage 3 (septal fibrosis or necrosis), or stage 4 (biliary cirrhosis).</P>
<P>Both surgical and medical interventions have been suggested for treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis (<LINK REF="REF-Lindor-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindor 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grijm-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Grijm 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vacca-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vacca 2007</LINK>). The suggested surgical interventions include balloon dilatation of dominant strictures, biliary tract reconstructive procedures, liver transplantation, and proctocolectomy in patients with concomitant ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Lindor-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindor 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindor-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindor 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stiehl--1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehl 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LaRusso-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaRusso 1999</LINK>). Based on cohort studies, liver transplantation is regarded to prolong survival. None of the surgical interventions have been evaluated in randomised clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Ahrendt--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahrendt 1998</LINK>). The suggested medical interventions include various immunosuppressive agents, colchicine, D- penicillamine, and ursodeoxycholic acid (<LINK REF="REF-LaRusso-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaRusso 1999</LINK>). The immunosuppressive agents include glucocorticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus (FK 506), and methotrexate. Following evaluations in four small cohort studies (<LINK REF="REF-Burgert-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgert 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindor-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindor 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolfhagen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfhagen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fracchia-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fracchia 2000</LINK>) and one randomised clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-van-Hoogstraten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Hoogstraten 2000</LINK>), glucocorticosteroids may be used both topically and systemically. The studies suggest that glucocorticosteroids may improve the clinical course. On the other hand, long-term use of glucocorticosteroids is also associated with adverse events including osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Long-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 1978</LINK>). We have been unable to identify systematic reviews or meta-analyses on glucocorticosteroids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.</P>

<P>All authors independently identified trials and extracted data, evaluated whether trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria, and listed excluded trials with the reasons for exclusion. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. From each randomised clinical trial we extracted the following data: primary author, number of patients randomised, patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, methodological quality, sample-size calculation, use of intention-to-treat analysis, intervention regimens, mean age, proportion of men, proportion of patients with cirrhosis, proportion of patients with large-duct and small-duct cholangitis, proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, duration of follow-up, whether cost-effectiveness analyses were performed, and all outcome measures. We wrote to the authors of included trials for additional information when we were unable to extract data from the original reports.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality</B>
<BR/>Methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials was assessed using eight components (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>).

<BR/>The analyses were performed in <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-5" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 5</LINK>. When possible, all patients were included in the analyses irrespective of compliance or follow-up (intention-to-treat). For patients with missing data, we used 'carry forward' of the last observed response. Binary outcome measures were presented as relative risks (RR) and continuous outcome measures as mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Since we have made comparisons where only one trial was included, we have checked the RevMan 5 results with the more correct analyses with Fisher's exact test, chi-square test, and t-test and have in all instances found identical or very similar results. We did not perform subgroup or sensitivity analyses because only two trials were included.</P>

<P>Six-hundred and thirty-eight trials were identified through the initial searches. We excluded 614 duplicates or clearly irrelevant studies by reading abstracts. The remaining 24 references were 17 review articles, which were included in <LINK TAG="ADDITIONAL_REFERENCES" TYPE="SECTION">Additional references</LINK> section, and five non randomised case series that were excluded (<LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>). Two trials met our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Allison-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Allison 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Hoogstraten-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Hoogstraten 2000</LINK>), and those were the two trials included in the previous version of this review by <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2004</LINK>. There were no new trials that met the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Allison-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Allison 1986</LINK>) compared biliary lavage with hydrocortisone plus saline versus saline. Biliary lavage was continued for two weeks via a nasobiliary tube. The dose of hydrocortisone was 100 mg per day in one litre or saline per day, and the dose of saline was one litre per day. The trial included 17 patients, but only 11 were randomised. Four patients were excluded because the nasobiliary tubes could not be inserted in the biliary tree. Another two patients were excluded because the nasobiliary tubes fell out of the biliary tree. Ten of the patients had strictures in the extrahepatic biliary tree. Eight of the patients had ulcerative colitis. Eleven patients were followed for ten weeks after the end of treatment. The evaluated outcomes were mortality, serum activity of alkaline phosphatases, serum bilirubin, and adverse events.</P>
<P>The other trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-Hoogstraten-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Hoogstraten 2000</LINK>) compared oral administration of budesonide versus prednisone for eight weeks. Included patients were randomised to budesonide 3 mg/day, budesonide 9 mg/day, or prednisone 10 mg/day. Patients in the two budesonide groups were combined in all analyses. Patients in the budesonide group received prednisone placebo tablets and patients in the prednisone group received budesonide placebo tablets. The trial included 18 patients with characteristic radiographic and histological findings in combination with elevated serum alkaline phosphatases. All patients had inflammatory bowel disease and received ursodeoxycholic acid for at least five months before entering the trial. All patients were followed until the end of treatment. The evaluated outcomes were pruritus, fatigue, serum bilirubin, serum alkaline phosphatases, and adverse events at the end of treatment.</P>

<P>Both trials were considered to have low risk of bias.<BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-Allison-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Allison 1986</LINK> trial had adequate generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, and incomplete data addressed. The trial was unblinded. Sample-size calculations and intention-to-treat analysis were not performed. These caveats may be considered as risk factors for bias (systematic error overestimating beneficial effects and underestimating harmful effects). However, when we look at the results of the trial, this bias seems remote.<BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-van-Hoogstraten-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Hoogstraten 2000</LINK> trial had adequate generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, follow-up, incomplete data addressed, it was free of selective reporting, and reported intention-to-treat analyses (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-11-11 12:44:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>
<B>Biliary lavage with hydrocortisone plus saline versus saline (Analyses 1.1 to 1.4)</B>
<BR/>One of the seven patients randomised to hydrocortisone died due to variceal haemorrhage. None of the six patients in the control group died. Hydrocortisone had no significant effect on mortality (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.13 to 54.6) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). We found no significant effects of hydrocortisone on serum activity of alkaline phosphatases (MD -35 IU/litre, 95% CO -213 to 143) or serum bilirubin (MD 17.4 IU/litre, 95% CI -13.0 to 47.8) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). All patients (n = 11) in both intervention groups developed bacterial colonisation of the biliary tree. In two patients in the hydrocortisone group three episodes of cholangitis with septicaemia occurred. Another two hydrocortisone-treated patients developed fluid retention or paranoid ideas, respectively. One patient in the saline control group developed pancreatitis. Accordingly, hydrocortisone tended to increase the occurrence of adverse events, but not significantly (RR 3.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 22.9) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). In addition to the adverse events described above, two of the patients in whom insertion of nasobiliary tube failed developed pancreatitis. This make the proportion of patients with adverse events raise to 7/17 (41%).</P>
<P>
<B>Budesonide versus prednisone (Analyses 2.1 to 2.5)</B>
<BR/>Two of the 12 patients in the budesonide group and 3 out of the 6 patients in the prednisone group had pruritus. Six of 12 patients in the budesonide group and 2/6 patients in the prednisone group suffered from fatigue. The evaluated treatments had no significantly different effects on pruritus (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.49) or fatigue (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.32) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Serum bilirubin concentrations were significantly lower in the budesonide compared with the prednisone group (MD -10.4 µmol/litre, 95% CI -19.6 to -1.2 µmol/litre) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). The serum alkaline phosphatase activities were not significantly different in the two groups (MD 17 IU/litre, 95% CI -112 to 146) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). In the budesonide group, two patients developed autoimmune hepatitis, acne, and nausea. In the prednisone group, one patient developed impaired vision and itching eyes. The proportions of adverse events in two groups were not significantly different (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 11.54) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-11 12:44:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We found no evidence to support or refute glucocorticosteroids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Only two randomised clinical trials with small sample sizes and short treatment durations were available. The wide confidence intervals warrant caution when interpreting the results. Also, the administration route of corticosteroids in the two trials differed; therefore, this fact should be taken into account. Considering the nature of the disease treatment regimens of considerably longer duration seem warranted. Randomised clinical trials on glucocorticosteroids versus placebo are needed before glucocorticosteroids can be recommended for primary sclerosing cholangitis.</P>
<P>One of the identified trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allison-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Allison 1986</LINK>) evaluated the effect of biliary lavage with hydrocortisone. This treatment was associated with several severe adverse events including pancreatitis, bacterial cholangitis, and fluid retention. The other trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-Hoogstraten-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Hoogstraten 2000</LINK>) compared different types and doses of glucocorticosteroids. We found no significant differences between the evaluated interventions, but the primary analyses in the published trial report suggest that prednisone 10 mg/day may be associated with reduction in pruritus. A similar effect of glucocorticosteroids on pruritus has been found for primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchison-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchison 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Hoogstraten-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Hoogstraten 2000</LINK>). The effect may be related to induction of cytochrome P450-3A activity (<LINK REF="REF-Pichard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pichard 1992</LINK>) as it has been found for the antipruritic drug rifampicin. When comparing the serum bilirubin levels before and after treatment, serum bilirubin did not change significantly in the budesonide group, but was significantly increased in the prednisone group. Considering the small sample size of the trial, additional information is needed to estimate whether this difference is a chance finding. Ursodeoxycholic acid may improve biochemical variables in some patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003</LINK>). The lack of effects of glucocorticosteroids on biochemical variables may theoretically be related to the inclusion criteria because all patients had no response to previous ursodeoxycholic acid. On the other hand, the unresponsiveness of patients to ursodeoxycholic acid may have been an advantage for glucocorticosteroids to exhibit their effect, but that effect did not take place. Theoretically, following this assumption, the evidence for no significant effect of glucocorticosteroids in primary sclerosing cholangitis may stand even firmer ground.</P>
<P>Long-term treatment with glucocorticosteroids may aggravate bone calcium loss. Previous studies suggest that the bone density in patients who receive prednisone is lower than patients who are not treated (<LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Charatcharoenwitthaya-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charatcharoenwitthaya 2006</LINK> ). Calcium loss seems to occur in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (<LINK REF="STD-Angulo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Angulo 2000</LINK>) as well as in primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchison-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchison 1989</LINK>). Long-term treatment with glucocorticosteroids must be carefully monitored.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence either to support or refute glucocorticosteroids for primary sclerosing cholangitis. Therefore, we cannot recommend the use of glucocorticosteroids outside randomised clinical trials. Biliary lavage in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis seems to be associated with prevalent and serious adverse events. Adverse events in such studies must be very closely monitored.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-10-07 12:38:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We need randomised clinical trials comparing oral administration of glucocorticosteroids versus placebo for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Because the disease is rare, multicentre trials will be necessary. Future trials should have sufficient statistical power, low risk of bias, adequate follow-up, intensive monitoring of adverse events, and should be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org).</P>
