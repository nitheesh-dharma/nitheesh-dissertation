Treatment can be broadly divided into medical and surgical options, with a variety of surgical techniques being available, including the use of adjustable or non-adjustable sutures for the extraocular muscles. There exists an uncertainty as to which of these techniques produces a better surgical outcome, and an opinion that the adjustable suture technique may be of greater benefit in certain situations.</P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-02-01 13:12:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><P>To determine if either an adjustable suture or non-adjustable suture technique is associated with a more accurate long-term ocular alignment and to identify specific situations in which it would be of benefit to use a particular method.</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2018-02-21 14:11:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; LILACS; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the ICTRP. The date of the search was 13 June 2017. We contacted experts in the field for further information.</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-02-01 13:13:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><P>We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing adjustable to non-adjustable sutures for strabismus surgery.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2018-02-15 17:33:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>We used standard procedures recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened search results and extracted data. We graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-03-05 10:22:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shha"><P>We identified one RCT comparing adjustable and non-adjustable sutures in primary horizontal strabismus surgeries in 60 children aged less than 12 years in Egypt. The study was not masked and we judged it at high risk of detection bias. Ocular alignment was defined as orthophoria or a horizontal tropia of 8 prism dioptres (PD) or less at near and far distances. At six months, there may be a small increased chance of ocular alignment with adjustable sutures compared with non-adjustable sutures clinically, however, the confidence intervals (CIs) were wide and were compatible with an increased chance of ocular alignment in the non-adjustable sutures group, so there was no statistical difference (risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.53). We judged this to be low-certainty evidence, downgrading for imprecision and risk of bias. At six months, 730 per 1000 children in the non-adjustable sutures group had ocular alignment. The study authors reported that there were no complications during surgery. The trials did not assess patient satisfaction and resource use and costs.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-15 16:31:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>We could reach no reliable conclusions regarding which technique (adjustable or non-adjustable sutures) produced a more accurate long-term ocular alignment following strabismus surgery or in which specific situations one technique is of greater benefit than the other, given the low-certainty and chance with just the one study. More high-quality RCTs are needed to obtain clinically valid results and to clarify these issues. Such trials should ideally 1. recruit participants with any type of strabismus or specify the subgroup of participants to be studied, for example, thyroid, paralytic, non-paralytic, paediatric; 2. randomise all consenting participants to have either adjustable or non-adjustable surgery prospectively; 3. have at least six months of follow-up data; and 4. include reoperation rates as an outcome measure.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-03-05 10:17:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shha"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-02-18 13:40:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-02-15 17:11:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Strabismus, or squint, can be defined as a deviation from perfect ocular alignment. Normally, under binocular viewing conditions, the image of an object of regard falls simultaneously on the fovea of each eye. In strabismus misalignment may be in any direction, with the image falling on an extrafoveal area in the deviating eye.</P><P>The classification of strabismus is potentially exhaustive. Examples include manifest versus latent strabismus depending on the conditions under which the strabismus is present (latent strabismus is present only after binocular vision has been interrupted), and paralytic versus non-paralytic (with the former occurring as a result of damage to extraocular muscles or the nerves supplying them). There are also numerous ways of identifying the type and severity of strabismus. Methods to help identify the type of strabismus include the cover/uncover test and alternate cover tests, with prism testing giving a more objective measure of the degree of deviation.</P><P>Strabismus is present in approximately 4% of children (<LINK REF="REF-Vaughan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaughan 1998</LINK>), and ideally treatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made to develop binocular visual function and ensure visual acuity. However, there are cases that for various reasons are not treated in childhood or develop in adulthood (especially paralytic types).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-02-15 17:15:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Current methods of treating strabismus can be separated into non-surgical and surgical options. Non-surgical options include the use of optical devices (e.g. spectacles, prisms), pharmacological therapies (e.g. miotic agents and botulinum toxin) and occlusion (patch) therapy.</P><P>Surgical procedures for strabismus are usually performed with the intention of restoring binocular single vision or improving cosmetic appearance. Various surgical techniques are available for correcting strabismus, with perhaps the simplest procedures being resection and recession of the eye muscles. Here, the eye muscles are strengthened by shortening them or weakened by lengthening them. Other important variables in strabismus surgery include the:</P><OL><LI>eye muscle to be adjusted;</LI><LI>amount of muscle adjustment;</LI><LI>suture material; and</LI><LI>suture technique.</LI></OL><P>For suture technique, the choice lies between adjustable and non-adjustable sutures. When using adjustable sutures, the eye muscle is reattached to the sclera with a knot that can then be adjusted so that the eye position can be altered as indicated by cover testing. This adjustment is usually carried out under topical anaesthesia after the person has recovered sufficiently from the general anaesthesia. This method is not usually performed in children under the age of 12 years due to difficulties with co-operation. With non-adjustable sutures, any adjustment is made while the person is still under general anaesthesia and ocular adjustment is dependent solely on examination of the corneal light reflexes (after preoperative calculations).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-02-15 17:16:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>The primary purpose of using adjustable sutures is to obtain a more accurate ocular alignment therefore decreasing the need for reoperation (which would be needed if an error in correction occurred using non-adjustable sutures). Another difficulty with using non-adjustable sutures is that the resting position of the eyes is affected by general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Apt-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apt 1977</LINK>).</P><P>The advantages of an adjustable technique are thought to be most apparent when the results of conventional surgery are unpredictable. Specific situations include reoperations, large-angle squints, thyroid eye disease, blow-out fractures, diplopia following retinal detachment surgery and paralytic squints (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1992</LINK>). This may be due to extra scarring, tethering or contracture of extraocular muscles in these cases. Combined horizontal and vertical muscle procedures are also thought to benefit from the adjustable suture technique. A possible drawback of the adjustable suture method is that there is evidence for a poor correlation between the results of realignment at one day and at one month (<LINK REF="REF-van-Noorden-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Noorden 1980</LINK>). This is possibly due to alterations in the motor drive to the muscles following realignment.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-02-18 13:40:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>There is uncertainty as to whether the use of an adjustable or non-adjustable suture technique produces a more accurate long-term ocular alignment and in which specific situation(s) one of the methods may be of greater benefit. A systematic review is needed to assess and clarify these issues.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-02-01 13:10:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><P>To determine if either an adjustable suture or non-adjustable suture technique is associated with a more accurate long-term ocular alignment and to identify specific situations in which it would be of benefit to use a particular method.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-02-21 14:08:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-02-21 13:38:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2018-02-15 17:17:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P></CRIT_STUDIES><CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2018-02-15 17:17:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>We included trials in participants of any age.

Also, the younger participants who generally do not tolerate adjustment, fell into the conventional (fixed suture) group. This distribution of participants between groups seems unlikely if there was true randomisation. For this reason, we excluded this trial from the review but will reassess if further information regarding randomisation becomes available.

The study was not masked and we judged it at high risk of detection bias. Ocular alignment was defined as orthophoria or a horizontal tropia of 8 PD or less at near and far distances. At six months, there may be a small increased chance of ocular alignment with adjustable sutures compared with non-adjustable sutures clinically however, the CIs were wide and were compatible with an increased chance of ocular alignment in the non-adjustable sutures group, so there was no statistical difference (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.53). We judged this low-certainty evidence, downgrading for imprecision and risk of bias. At six months, 730 per 1000 children in the non-adjustable sutures group had ocular alignment in this study. The study did not report adverse effects and participant satisfaction.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-02-15 19:01:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Overall, the review was not complete as there was only one small study (60 children) in Egypt. However, the review is applicable clinically given the study population was as expected in practice and the procedures used were clinically relevant, despite not reaching a statistically significant result between adjustable and non-adjustable sutures.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Certainty of the evidence</HEADING><P>Despite the study being an RCT, we assessed the certainty as low. The reasons for this were because the study was at risk of bias given masking was not performed, and, as the study was small, the effect estimate was imprecise.</P></SUBSECTION></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-02-15 19:01:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>We attempted to minimise errors and biases in the review processes by performing duplicate screening and data extraction.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-02-18 13:49:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>There were very few studies that directly compared the two techniques. These were retrospective non-randomised trials, generally limited by small participant numbers.</P><P>We found one large, prospective, controlled clinical trial with non-random allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Tripathi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathi 2003</LINK>). The study reported 443 operations on adolescents and adults with any type and amount of strabismus who had surgery with either adjustable sutures (141 participants) or non-adjustable sutures (302 participants). The authors studied three outcome measures (reoperation rates, participant satisfaction with regard to final cosmetic appearance or relief of diplopia, and percentage change in angle of deviation). The study demonstrated a better result in the group who had adjustable sutures on all three outcome measures (reoperation rates were 8.51% in the adjustable group compared to 27.15% in the non-adjustable group). In addition, the trial authors reported that age, sex, number of previous surgeries, previous treatments such as botulinum toxin, type or amount of deviation, had no influence on the final outcome in their participants. The authors suggested that adjustable sutures need not be reserved for the more unpredictable or complex cases of strabismus (i.e. situations in which the use of adjustable sutures is commonly thought to be advantageous). However, participants were not randomised and the method of allocation to treatment was unclear (in particular, the reasons for the majority of participants declining the adjustable suture technique were not given). Methods used (if any) to reduce detection bias, were also not reported. In addition, information regarding the profile of the two participant groups was not available; for example, whether people with thyroid ophthalmopathy were present in either group. All reoperations in the adjustable suture group were for undercorrections; however, it was unclear whether any of these participants originally underwent inferior rectus recessions. This is relevant as we know from the literature that this adjustable suture subgroup of participants tended to develop overcorrection following inferior rectus recession.</P><P>In terms of accuracy of long-term ocular alignment, we found studies supporting the benefit of the adjustable technique over the non-adjustable technique (<LINK REF="STD-Awadein-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Awadein 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Broniarczyk-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Broniarczyk 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tripathi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathi 2003</LINK>), with others suggesting the non-adjustable method was more advantageous (<LINK REF="STD-Correa-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Correa 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vazquez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vazquez 1999</LINK>), and some studies reporting the techniques to be equally effective (<LINK REF="STD-Altintas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Altintas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kono-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kono 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Park-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yanovitch-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yanovitch 2009</LINK>).</P><P>In terms of whether one technique was superior in specific situations, we found very few studies that directly compared the two techniques. Two articles looked at people with thyroid disease and vertical squints (<LINK REF="STD-Kono-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kono 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1993</LINK>), but neither of these studies individually showed a significant benefit of using a particular technique. Although when pooling their results with those of others, there was a significant improvement in outcome with adjustable sutures (<LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1993</LINK>). The adjustable suture technique is commonly thought to be of benefit in producing more accurate alignment in unpredictable cases. However, the largest study identified in this review, <LINK REF="STD-Tripathi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathi 2003</LINK>, also argued that there is a role for adjustable sutures in more conventional cases. In contrast to this, one retrospective case-matched study of people with non-thyroid eye disease reported no significant differences in success rates between either technique, and concluded that there was insufficient evidence that people without thyroid eye disease benefited from the longer and potentially uncomfortable procedure of adjustable suture surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Bishop-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bishop 2004</LINK>). One large study looked at the use of the adjustable technique in children under 10 years of age with a variety of squints (<LINK REF="STD-Awadein-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Awadein 2008</LINK>). The authors performed adjustments under topical anaesthesia or intravenous propofol and found the adjustable technique to be superior in terms of early (three months) postoperative alignment. This challenges the conventional view that adjustable suture surgery should be reserved for older people who are likely to be more co-operative.</P><P>Patient satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-Tripathi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathi 2003</LINK>) and relief from diplopia (<LINK REF="STD-Broniarczyk-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Broniarczyk 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tripathi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathi 2003</LINK>) were outcome measures and there were better results with the adjustable technique. No trials formally studied economics of either method.</P><P>It is noteworthy that many reports used reoperation rates as an outcome measure and the review authors acknowledge this should subsequently be used as the primary outcome measure should further studies become available for inclusion in this review. This is particularly important as accurate ocular alignment does not necessarily correlate with the optimal result as far as the patient is concerned and, therefore, will not necessarily correlate with reoperation rates.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-18 11:43:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-02-18 11:36:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>There was only one randomised controlled trial comparing adjustable and non-adjustable sutures. This study showed a small increased chance of improvement with adjustable sutures, but the evidence was low certainty due to risk of bias (study was not masked) and imprecision (confidence intervals included no effect).</P><P>Other studies that directly compare adjustable and non-adjustable suture techniques are available; however, these are non-randomised, few in number, mainly retrospective, and difficult to compare as a result of marked clinical heterogeneity.</P><P>Therefore, reliable conclusions cannot be drawn concerning which technique produces a better long-term ocular alignment or in which conditions one technique is more appropriate than the other.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-02-18 11:43:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>High-quality randomised controlled clinical trials are certainly feasible in this area and this review has demonstrated a need for them in order to produce clinically valid results. In such a study, participants with any type of strabismus may be recruited and those participants agreeable to having either the adjustable or non-adjustable suture technique could then be randomised using acceptable methods to either technique. We suggest that trials should have a minimum of six months' follow-up and should include important outcome measures such as reoperation rates, accuracy of ocular alignment, complications, economics and participant satisfaction. The researchers measuring outcomes should be masked as to which type of suture technique was used. Masking of surgeons would not be possible and masking participants would be extremely difficult. It is clear from these results that well-planned clinical trials could greatly improve the evidence base in this area, potentially producing a change in the conventional surgical management of strabismus.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-02-01 14:16:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><P>We are grateful to Jennifer Evans and Anupa Shah (Cochrane Eyes and Vision (CEV) for their comments and help with the 2018 review update.
