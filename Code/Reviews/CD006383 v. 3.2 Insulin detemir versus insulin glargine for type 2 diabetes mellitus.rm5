<P>The two long-acting insulin analogues (artificial insulins), insulin detemir or insulin glargine differ in their mechanism of attaining protracted action, leading to possible differences in glycaemic control and safety outcomes. Several studies have compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH (Neutral Protamin Hagedorn) insulin. Research directly comparing both long-acting insulin analogues is limited.</P>
<P>Our aim was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir and insulin glargine in head-to-head studies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>
<P>Four studies investigated a total of 2250 people. Trials lasted between 24 and 52 weeks. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. Our analysis of these intermediate term trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine showed that these two insulins were equally effective in achieving and maintaining glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)). There were no differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia when comparing insulin detemir to insulin glargine. Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain (one study showing a difference of 0.9 kg). Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions (1.8% of patients treated with insulin detemir compared to 0.4% of patients treated with insulin glargine had injection side reactions).</P>
<P>There was no difference in the variability of fasting glucose levels or the variability of glucose values of 24-hour profiles between the two treatment groups.</P>
<P>From the retrieved trials it was not possible to draw conclusions on the effects of these two insulins on quality of life, their costs or on the number of fatalities. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups.</P>
<P>Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in the efficacy or the safety between the use of insulin detemir and insulin glargine for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was only injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-04-20 16:14:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-04-20 13:00:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous and progressive disorder caused by a combination of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Initially, the reduced sensitivity to insulin of tissues, particularly the liver and skeletal muscle, is compensated for by an increased insulin production by the pancreatic ß-cells. The resulting hyperinsulinaemia maintains the blood glucose within the normal range. Eventually, however, relative insulin deficiency, and thus hyperglycaemia, will develop. Chronic hyperglycaemia is associated with microvascular complications like retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Lowering blood glucose levels by means of intensive therapy has been shown to reduce these vascular complications in type 2 diabetes patients (<LINK REF="REF-Holman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-33-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 33 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-34-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 34 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-04-20 13:04:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) / European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus algorithm for the management of type 2 diabetes &#8220;an HbA1c level of &#8805; 7% should serve as a call to action to initiate or change therapy with the goal of achieving an HbA1c level of &lt; 7%&#8221;. The authors also advise that initial therapy should consist of lifestyle intervention and the oral glucose-lowering drug metformin. As the disease progresses treatment is usually intensified by the addition of one or more oral agents. However, when lifestyle interventions and oral therapy no longer achieve the currently recommended glycaemic goal of an HbA1c level of less than 7%, the introduction of a basal insulin preparation is advocated (<LINK REF="REF-Nathan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 2009</LINK>). Traditionally, the intermediate-acting Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin has been used, but this agent has pharmacodynamic limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Heinemann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinemann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plank-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plank 2005</LINK>), predisposing to both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Holleman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holleman 2007</LINK>). In order to reach glycaemic targets more effectively and safely, insulin analogues with a modified structure compared to the human insulin molecule were developed. Two long-acting insulin analogues are currently available: insulin detemir and insulin glargine.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-04-20 16:14:52 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>The two long-acting insulin analogues differ in molecular structure and method of protraction. Insulin detemir is produced by removal of the amino acid threonine from position B30 and acylation of lysine at position B29 with myristic acid. These modifications result in an increased self-association and reversible binding to albumin in the interstitial fluid and plasma, which are responsible for the preparation&#8217;s prolonged duration of action (<LINK REF="REF-Havelund-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Havelund 2004</LINK>). In the insulin glargine molecule, glycine has been substituted for asparagine at position A21 and two arginine molecules have been added at position B30, leading to a shift of the isoelectric point. As a result, following injection at physiological pH, insulin glargine forms microprecipitates, which slowly dissolve from the subcutaneous space (<LINK REF="REF-Bolli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolli 1999</LINK>).<BR/>Euglycaemic clamp studies demonstrated that insulin detemir has a dose-dependent duration of action (<LINK REF="REF-Plank-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plank 2005</LINK>) and a mean time-action profile somewhat intermediate between the profiles of NPH insulin and insulin glargine (<LINK REF="REF-Heise-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heise 2004</LINK>). The time-action profile of insulin glargine lacks a pronounced peak in effect and its activity may persist up to 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-DeVries-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeVries 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swinnen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swinnen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In clinical trials in type 2 diabetes mellitus, both insulin detemir and insulin glargine have been found to reduce the risks of overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared with NPH insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Hermansen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermansen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horvath-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horvath 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riddle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riddle 2003</LINK>). Additionally, insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Hermansen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermansen 2006</LINK>). These advantages of the long-acting insulin analogues over NPH insulin may improve patient treatment satisfaction and health-related quality of life.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Hypoglycaemia is an intrinsic adverse effect of insulin treatment and thus insulin detemir and insulin glargine carry the risk of causing hypoglycaemic events. Additionally, insulin therapy is associated with weight gain and injection site reactions.<BR/>Concern has been raised regarding potential mitogenic effects of insulin analogues, but distinct evidence is lacking. As relatively short term clinical studies will not reliably show a difference in mitogenic potency between insulin detemir and insulin glargine, we will not review these potential adverse effects of the two long-acting insulin analogues.</P>

<P>The prevalence of diabetes is increasing rapidly worldwide. A few years ago the total number of people with diabetes was projected to rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-Wild-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wild 2004</LINK>). Chronically elevated blood glucose levels are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and many patients will eventually require insulin treatment to maintain good glycaemic control. There are still many uncertainties about the optimal insulin treatment regimens for type 2 diabetes, but the long-acting insulin analogues seem promising. Several reviews have analysed studies which compared either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to NPH insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horvath-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horvath 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mullins-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullins 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenstock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstock 2005</LINK>), but research directly comparing both long-acting insulin analogues is limited.</P>

<P>Our initial search of EMBASE, MEDLINE and <I>The Cochrane Library</I> yielded 1615 citations, and an updated search yielded an additional 595 citations. Of these two searches, seven studies comparing treatment with insulin detemir versus treatment with insulin glargine in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus were examined as full text. Common reasons for exclusion of citations were non-randomised controlled trial (mostly review articles) and investigation of a non-relevant question. Hand searching of the American Diabetes Association's and European Association for the Study of Diabetes' abstract books yielded eight potentially relevant publications, seven (including duplicates) of which we had already identified by our electronic search, resulting in one additional potentially relevant article. We identified five more relevant studies by searching online registries of ongoing trials. Of the thirteen potentially relevant trials, five were excluded because their duration was shorter than 12 weeks (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Four were excluded because they were ongoing or unpublished (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Altogether 2250 people were randomised and exposed to trial drugs in the included studies.</P>
<P>All four studies recruited people who had type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least one year. No study specified diagnostic criteria. Three studies included patients from the age of 18 and one study included people aged 40 to 75 years (<LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK>). Mean duration of diabetes ranged from 9 to 14 years and mean age from 56 to 58 years. Around 80% of participants were Caucasian. The studies&#8217; inclusion ranges for glycaemic control were a glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of &#8805; 7.0% or &#8805; 7.5% to &#8804; 10.0% or &#8804; 11.0%. Mean HbA1c level at baseline ranged from 8.4% to 8.7%.</P>
<P>Two studies included insulin-naive people only, that is patients who had not been treated with insulin prior to study participation (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK>). The other two trials included both patients who had previously used oral glucose-lowering drugs and those who had used insulin with or without oral glucose-lowering drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raskin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 2009</LINK>). In the first two studies almost all patients used metformin and most (approx. 75%) used a combination of metformin and an insulin secretagogue. The types of oral glucose-lowering drugs used at baseline were not reported in the latter two studies but around 20% of participants were treated with oral agents only, one third with insulin only and about 45% with insulin and oral agents.</P>
<P>All studies listed proliferative diabetic retinopathy as an exclusion criterion. Three studies excluded patients with known hypoglycaemia unawareness or with recurrent major hypoglycaemic episodes (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raskin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2008</LINK> also excluded patients treated with thiazolidinediones and <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK> excluded those using glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The two studies that solely included insulin-naive people investigated basal insulin-only therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK>), the other two compared the long-acting insulin analogues when used in a basal-bolus insulin regimen. In both studies insulin aspart was used as the bolus or mealtime insulin (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raskin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>All four trials had a so-called treat-to-target design. This means that the basal insulin dose, in this case the dose of insulin detemir or insulin glargine, was systematically titrated according to pre-defined plasma glucose criteria. Insulin glargine was dosed once-daily in the evening and systematically titrated to achieve a certain pre-defined fasting plasma glucose target in all studies. Insulin detemir was initiated once-daily in the evening in three trials, but the titration algorithm allowed an additional dose in the morning if the pre-dinner plasma glucose value was above target while the fasting plasma glucose target had been achieved. The percentages of patients using insulin detemir twice-daily at the end of the trial were 57.2% (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2008</LINK>), 13.6% (<LINK REF="STD-Raskin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 2009</LINK>) and 55% (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2008</LINK>). In the fourth study insulin detemir was initiated twice-daily (<LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK>). </P>
<P>In one of the studies investigating basal insulin-only therapy in insulin-naive patients all previous oral glucose-lowering drugs were continued unchanged (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2008</LINK>). In the other basal insulin-only trial thiazolidinediones were stopped at randomisation, insulin secretagogues were stopped at randomisation or maintained at stable dose throughout the study and all other oral agents were continued unchanged (<LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK>). In the two trials investigating basal-bolus therapy, insulin secretagogues and &#945;-glucosidase inhibitors were discontinued prior to the initiation of trial drug and other oral glucose-lowering agents were continued (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raskin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment duration ranged from 24 (<LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK>) to 52 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2008</LINK>).

<P>Three studies used HbA1c levels at study endpoint as the primary outcome measure.

<P>In three trials an additional daily insulin detemir injection could be added by the study personnel and in the fourth study all participants randomised to treatment with insulin detemir used it twice-daily. In contrast, insulin glargine was dosed once-daily in all trials. This once- versus twice-daily dosing also affected the number of home-glucose measurements that study participants had to perform. People treated with insulin detemir twice-daily were instructed to not only measure their glucose before breakfast but also before dinner. Finally, part of the patients treated with insulin glargine (namely those in Canada and the United States) used syringes and vials while all detemir-treated patients used a pen-injector. The latter is probably more patient-friendly. All these differences between the insulin detemir and insulin glargine treatment groups may have affected outcome measurements and participants behaviour and compliance.</P>

<P>We could not perform the two planned subgroup analyses due to lack of data.<BR/>The robustness of the results was also tested by repeating the analysis using different measures of effects size (relative risk, odds ratio, etc.) and different statistical models (fixed-effect model and random-effects model).</P>
<P>The substantial statistical heterogeneity in the pooled effect of endpoint HbA1c, fasting glucose at study endpoint and variability of fasting plasma glucose at study endpoint were caused by the <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK> study.</P>
<P>The substantial statistical heterogeneity in the pooled effect of the percentage of participants achieving good glycaemic control without hypoglycaemia was caused by the <LINK REF="STD-Raskin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 2009</LINK> study.</P>
<P>The substantial statistical heterogeneity in the pooled effect of event rate of overall hypoglycaemia was caused by two outlying studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no explanation for the substantial level of statistical heterogeneity in the pooled effect of variability in daily basal insulin dose in units per kg.</P>
<P>After exclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK> study, the level of statistical heterogeneity in the pooled effect of endpoint HbA1c level decreased from I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 73% to I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 24%. The mean difference in endpoint HbA1c level between the two insulin analogues changed from a not statistically significant 0.08% (95% CI -0.10 to 0.27) including the <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK> study to a statistically significant 0.16% (95% CI 0.01 to 0.32) in favour of insulin glargine, when excluding this study.</P>
<P>Similarly, after exclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK> study the level of statistical heterogeneity in the pooled effect of fasting glucose at study endpoint decreased from I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 50% to I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%. When excluding the Swinnen 2010 study, the statistically significant difference in endpoint fasting glucose of 0.34 mmol/L (95% CI 0.01 to 0.67) in favour of insulin glargine, was no longer significant (mean difference of 0.15 mmol/L [95% CI -0.20 to 0.49]).</P>
<P>Exclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK> study also decreased the level of statistical heterogeneity in the pooled effect of variability of plasma glucose profiles at study endpoint from I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 70% to I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 38%. However, excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK> study did not affect the outcome of the pooled effect.</P>
<P>After exclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Raskin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 2009</LINK> study, the level of statistical heterogeneity in the percentage of participants achieving good glycaemic control without hypoglycaemia, decreased from I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 66% to I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%. However excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Raskin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 2009</LINK> study did not affect the outcome of the pooled effect.</P>
<P>After exclusion of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK>) the level of statistical heterogeneity in the pooled effect of event rate of overall hypoglycaemia decreased from I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 83% to I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0% However, we can not report a meta-analytically pooled effect estimate based on two remaining studies (<LINK REF="STD-Raskin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 2009</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2008</LINK>) .</P>
<P>As there is no explanation for the substantial level of statistical heterogeneity in the pooled effect of variability in daily basal insulin dose in units per kg, we cannot report a meta-analytically pooled effect estimate without statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>In conclusion, for two outcome measures, namely HbA1c at study endpoint and fasting plasma glucose at study endpoint, decreasing the level of statistical heterogeneity by excluding studies created a significant difference in the outcome (HbA1c at study endpoint) or eliminated the significant difference in the outcome (fasting plasma glucose at study endpoint) between the two insulin analogues. However, for both outcome measures the significance was of borderline magnitude. In addition, the pooled effect of two related outcome measures, namely change in HbA1c and change in fasting plasma glucose, resulted in a not statistically significant mean difference between the two insulins without statistical heterogeneity. Overall there seems to be no difference in glycaemic control between the two insulins.</P>
<P>For the event rate for overall hypoglycaemia per patient-year we cannot report a meta-analytically pooled effect estimate. However, the pooled effect of a related outcome measure, namely the percentage of participants having at least one hypoglycaemic event, showed a non statistically significant difference between the two insulins. In conclusion, there seems to be no statistically significant difference in overall hypoglycaemia when comparing insulin detemir to insulin glargine.</P>
<P>Similarly, for the daily basal insulin dose in units per kg, the meta-analytically pooled effect estimate is hampered by substantial statistical heterogeneity. However, when taking into account the subtotals, the mean differences of three out of four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK>) are statistically significantly in favour of insulin glargine. Also, there is a pharmacological explanation for a larger insulin need with insulin detemir (<LINK REF="REF-Swinnen-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swinnen 2010b</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We found no unpublished studies, the risk of bias of the included studies was comparable among trials, no study used explicit diagnostic criteria to define diabetes mellitus type 2, and all were industry-sponsored and published in English-language journals. Therefore, we could only perform the pre-specified sensitivity analysis excluding a very large study (<LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK>). Exclusion of this study resulted in changes of the following outcome measures: endpoint HbA1c level, endpoint fasting glucose level, the percentage of participants achieving good glycaemic control without hypoglycaemia, and the occurrence of injection site reactions. We already addressed the change in mean difference in endpoint HbA1c and fasting glucose at study endpoint between the two insulin analogues after excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK> study (<LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition the non statistically significant difference in favour of insulin glargine in the percentage of participants achieving good glycaemic control without hypoglycaemia becomes statistically significant when excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK> study, with a risk ratio of 0.83 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.98), (P = 0.33, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 9%). However, the significance is of borderline magnitude. Finally, after exclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK> study the difference in the percentage of participants having at least one injection site reaction was no longer statistically significant (estimated risk ratio of 2.94 [95% CI 0.68 to 12.71], P = 0.24, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 30%).</P>
<P>A possible explanation for the change in results after exclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Swinnen-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Swinnen 2010a</LINK> is the distinctive study design of this study in which insulin detemir was initiated twice daily.</P>
<P>Repeating the analyses using different measures of effects size and different statistical models did not change the results materially.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-15 11:14:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>This systematic review and meta-analysis included four studies comparing the effects of insulin detemir to insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Overall, pooling all four studies resulted in a not statistically significant difference in HbA1c between the two treatment groups, although glargine was associated with a slightly lower fasting plasma glucose.</P>
<P>The results show a not statistically significant difference in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia when comparing insulin detemir to insulin glargine.</P>
<P>Insulin detemir was associated with statistically significant relatively small reduction of weight gain. Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions.</P>
<P>There was no difference in the variability of fasting glucose levels and glucose values of 24-hour profiles between the two treatment groups.</P>
<P>No evidence for differences in patient-oriented outcomes like health-related quality of life, costs or mortality could be obtained. It may however well be that the difference in required insulin dose translates in different costs for the two insulins.</P>
<P>Insulin glargine was dosed once-daily in the evening. Insulin detemir was initiated once-daily in the evening with the option of an additional dose in the morning in three studies and initiated twice-daily in the fourth study.</P>
<P>In the three studies, patients randomised to receive insulin detemir could be switched to a second dose given in the morning based on failure to achieve a prespecified pre dinner plasma glucose target. In all probability, a sufficient number of patients randomised to insulin glargine would also have failed to achieve predinner plasma glucose goals and thus would have met the plasma glucose criterion for a switch from once- to twice-daily dosing. This was not done as this would have been off-label use, although there are reports in literature supporting twice-daily dosing of glargine (<LINK REF="REF-Albright-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albright 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ashwell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashwell 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The differences between the two basal insulin analogues should be defined on the basis of a similar insulin administration regimen; from a patient perspective this should preferably be once-daily for both insulins.</P>

<P>Although this meta-analysis included only four RCTs, almost all outcomes could be investigated using additional information provided by the authors.</P>
<P>The studies were conducted in 25 different countries. Participants included both male and female adults with a mean age of 55 years, hence the external validity of the results seems high.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-12-08 22:56:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All four RCTs used appropriate randomisation methods and were adequately powered. In total this review is based on the data of 2250 study participants. Attrition rates were acceptable and most of the pre-specified outcomes have been reported. However, the risk of bias of the included studies was considered as high. The main limitations were lack of blinding. This source of bias should be considered when interpreting the results of the various meta-analyses in this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-12-08 22:57:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in the efficacy or the safety between insulin detemir and insulin glargine for targeting hyperglycaemia. However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was only injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-04-20 13:29:37 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>RCTs comparing insulin detemir and insulin glargine using the treat-to-target approach and an identical, preferably once-daily, dosing regimen are needed. Equal dosing frequencies also abolish the need for an open-label study design. In addition, outcome measures should include health-related quality of life, treatment satisfaction and costs. Finally, studies with a duration longer than one year are desirable.</P>

<P>Airin Simon was added as an author.</P>
<P>We did not assess long-term outcome measurements as none of the included RCTs had a duration of more than 52 weeks. Since the two 52-week studies did not report interim data we selected the longest follow-up from each trial (24, 26 and 52 weeks) and used study endpoint data only.</P>
<P>We did not quantify interrater agreement for risk of bias assessments by means of the kappa statistic, as this is no longer routinely done in Cochrane reviews. Also, the two authors who independently assessed the risk of bias of the included RCTs differed in opinion about only one item of one study.</P>
<P>Dichotomous data were expressed as risk ratios rather than odds ratios because risks and risk ratios are less difficult to interpret than odds and odds ratios. Continuous data are expressed as mean differences as the historically used term weighted mean difference (WMD) is no longer used in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.</P>
<P>We did not perform the planned subgroup analyses because the studies did not report data on separate patient groups (such as males and females) and we did not have individual patient data.</P>
<P>The number of pre-specified sensitivity analyses that we could perform was very limited as we did not identify any unpublished relevant study, the risk of bias of the included studies was comparable, no study used diagnostic criteria, all were sponsored by a pharmaceutical company and all reports were in English.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Quote: "Insulin glargine was administered at dinner or bedtime" and "Insulin detemir was administered at breakfast and dinner" and "Patients randomised to insulin glargine were instructed to perform daily fasting home glucose measurements and to increase their insulin dose by 2 units every 2 days until they reached the titration target of fasting PG &lt; 5.6 mmol/L. Patients randomised to insulin detemir were instructed to measure their glucose before breakfast and before dinner. The goal was to obtain both fasting and pre-dinner PG &lt; 5.6 mmol/L. The systematic titration of insulin detemir followed three steps. First, both doses were increased by 1 unit every 2 days until FPG and pre-dinner PG &#8804; 6.9 mmol/L. Subsequently, patients were instructed to achieve fasting PG &lt; 5.6 mmol/L by increasing their dinner dose by 2 units every 2 days. Finally, the breakfast dose was increased by 2 units every 2 days until pre-dinner PG &lt; 5.6 mmol/".</P>
<P>Comment: The study has a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used, i.e. insulin detemir was dosed twice-daily (and insulin glargine once-daily), patients in the insulin detemir group measured their glucose level twice-daily (insulin glargine-treated patients once-daily) and the titration scheme for insulin detemir may have been more complicated than that for insulin glargine.</P>
