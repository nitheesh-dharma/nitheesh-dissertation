<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-06 12:47:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute pain is often felt soon after injury. Most people who have surgery have moderate or severe pain afterwards. Painkillers are tested in people with pain, often following a painful condition such as the removal of wisdom teeth. This pain is usually treated with painkillers taken by mouth. We believe these results can be applied to other acute painful conditions.</P>
<P>A series of Cochrane reviews looks at how good painkillers are. We know that in some circumstances, fast-dissolving and absorbed painkillers provide better pain relief than those that are absorbed slowly. This review examined how good different formulations of diclofenac were in relieving moderate or severe pain after surgery.</P>
<P>This is an update of a review published in 2009. New searches in March 2015 identified three new studies, making 18 studies with 3714 participants altogether, 1902 of whom were treated with diclofenac and 1007 with placebo. Diclofenac potassium is a rapidly absorbed formulation, and the 50 mg dose provided the largest amount on information. With this dose of this formulation, more than 6 in 10 (64%) participants had effective pain relief, compared with fewer than 2 in 10 (17%) with placebo (high quality evidence).</P>
<P>Adverse events occurred at similar rates with diclofenac and placebo in these single dose studies (moderate quality evidence). There were few serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events.</P>
<P>Diclofenac potassium represents a useful option in controlling acute pain.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently considered studies for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used the area under the pain relief versus time curve to derive the proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief over six hours prescribed either diclofenac or placebo. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT). We used information on the use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use. We also collected information on adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-06 12:56:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update included three new studies, providing a 26% increase in participants in comparisons between diclofenac and placebo. We included 18 studies involving 3714 participants, 1902 treated with diclofenac and 1007 with placebo. This update has also changed the focus of the review, examining the effects of formulation in more detail than previously. This is a result of increased understanding of the importance of speed of onset in determining analgesic efficacy in acute pain.</P>
<P>The largest body of information, for diclofenac potassium 50 mg, in seven studies, produced an NNT for at least 50% of maximum pain relief compared with placebo of 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9 to 2.5) (high quality evidence). There was a graded improvement in efficacy as doses rose from 25 mg to 100 mg, both for participants achieving at least 50% maximum pain relief, and for remedication within 6 to 8 hours. Fast-acting formulations (dispersible products, solutions, and softgel formulations) had a similar efficacy for a 50 mg dose, with an NNT of 2.4 (2.0 to 3.0). Diclofenac sodium in a small number of studies produced a lesser effect, with an NNT of 6.6 (4.1 to 17) for the 50 mg dose.</P>
<P>Adverse event rates were low in these single dose studies, with no difference between diclofenac and placebo (moderate quality evidence).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-02 13:10:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review updates an earlier review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 2, 2009) entitled 'Single dose oral diclofenac for acute postoperative pain in adults' (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009a</LINK>). We carried out additional searches in 2011 that identified no new studies, and therefore planned a full update for 2015.</P>
<P>This is one of a series of reviews whose aim is to increase awareness of the range of analgesics that are potentially available, and to present evidence for relative analgesic efficacy through indirect comparisons with placebo, in very similar trials performed in a standard manner, with very similar outcomes, and over the same duration. Such relative analgesic efficacy does not in itself determine choice of drug for any situation or patient, but guides policy making at the local level. The series covers all analgesics licensed for acute postoperative pain in Europe and North America, and dipyrone, which is commonly used in Spain, Portugal, and Latin American countries. The results have been examined in an overview (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>), and important individual reviews include ibuprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009b</LINK>), codeine (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2010</LINK>), paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>), and etoricoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2012</LINK>), and combinations of ibuprofen with paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2013a</LINK>), codeine (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2013b</LINK>), and oxycodone (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2013c</LINK>). Knowing the relative efficacy of different analgesic drugs at various doses can be helpful.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-09 09:41:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage either accidentally due to an injury or as a result of surgery. Acute postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury or nerve injury, or both. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation is a critical component of patient care.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Acute pain trials</HEADING>
<P>Single dose trials in acute pain are commonly short in duration, rarely lasting longer than 12 hours. The numbers of participants are small, allowing no reliable conclusions to be drawn about safety. To show that the analgesic is working, it is necessary to use placebo (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2005</LINK>). There are clear ethical considerations in doing this. These ethical considerations are answered by using acute pain situations where the pain is expected to go away, and by providing additional analgesia, commonly called rescue analgesia, if the pain has not diminished after about an hour. This is reasonable, because not all participants given an analgesic will have significant pain relief. Approximately 18% of participants given placebo will have significant pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>), and up to 50% may have inadequate analgesia with active medicines. The use of additional or rescue analgesia is hence important for all participants in the trials.</P>
<P>Clinical trials measuring the efficacy of analgesics in acute pain have been standardised over many years (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2012</LINK>). Trials have to be randomised and double-blind. Typically, in the first few hours or days after an operation, patients develop pain that is moderate to severe in intensity, and will then be given the test analgesic or placebo. Pain is measured using standard pain intensity scales immediately before the intervention, and then using pain intensity and pain relief scales over the following 4 to 6 hours for shorter-acting drugs, and up to 12 or 24 hours for longer-acting drugs. Pain relief of half the maximum possible pain relief or better (at least 50% pain relief) is typically regarded as a clinically useful outcome. For patients given rescue medication, it is usual for no additional pain measurements to be made, and for all subsequent measures to be recorded as initial pain intensity or baseline (zero) pain relief (baseline observation carried forward). This process ensures that analgesia from the rescue medication is not wrongly ascribed to the test intervention. In some trials the last observation is carried forward, which gives an inflated response for the test intervention compared to placebo, but the effect has been shown to be negligible over four to six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>). Patients usually remain in the hospital or clinic for at least the first six hours following the intervention, with measurements supervised, although they may then be allowed home to make their own measurements in trials of longer duration.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Diclofenac</HEADING>
<P>Diclofenac is a benzene acetic acid derivative used to treat the pain and swelling associated with rheumatic disorders since 1974 (<LINK REF="REF-Fineschi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fineschi 1997</LINK>). It is one of the most widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the world, especially outside the USA. The most common daily doses are 75 mg and 150 mg, given as divided doses.</P>
<P>Diclofenac is available in two different salts in a number of different formulations. Diclofenac sodium is usually distributed in enteric-coated tablets, which resist dissolution in low pH gastric environments and release contents in the duodenum (<LINK REF="STD-Olson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 1997</LINK>); this tends to produce slow absorption into blood. Diclofenac potassium is formulated to be released and absorbed in the stomach, and references to pharmaceutical company data indicate that peak plasma concentrations occur by about 45 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Bakshi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bakshi 1992</LINK>). Fast-acting formulations may involve diclofenac sodium or potassium, but are designed to dissolve diclofenac in the stomach contents and promote rapid uptake, with peak plasma concentrations at 30 minutes or so. We could not find a systematic review of diclofenac absorption kinetics with these different formulations.</P>
<P>Of the two salts, diclofenac potassium and diclofenac sodium, the sodium salt is used much more frequently (98% of the 2.3 million prescriptions in England in 2013 were of the sodium salt; <LINK REF="REF-PCA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">PCA 2014</LINK>). Diclofenac potassium is the formulation usually available at lower doses without prescription.</P>
<P>Fast-acting formulations not only produce more rapid plasma concentrations and pain relief, but better overall results and a longer duration of action, at least for ibuprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2015a</LINK>). There is no similar comprehensive review of effects of formulation for diclofenac, but the evidence is now strong that fast-acting formulations are likely to have different effects from standard formulations. Taking drugs with food reduces and delays absorption of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, and may impair analgesic efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2015b</LINK>). Where drugs are taken for a short time, adverse events in single dose studies are not generally different from placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diclofenac potassium formulations were recently withdrawn from non-prescription sale in the UK due to concerns over potential cardiovascular risk.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-07-02 13:10:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinicians prescribe NSAIDs on a routine basis for a range of mild to moderate pain. NSAIDs are the most commonly prescribed analgesic medications worldwide, and their efficacy for treating acute pain has been well demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2003</LINK>). They reversibly inhibit cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase), the enzyme mediating production of prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 (<LINK REF="REF-FitzGerald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">FitzGerald 2001</LINK>). Prostaglandins mediate a variety of physiological functions such as maintenance of the gastric mucosal barrier, regulation of renal blood flow, and regulation of endothelial tone. They also play an important role in inflammatory and nociceptive processes. However, relatively little is known about the mechanism of action of this class of compounds aside from their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase-dependent prostanoid formation (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 1999</LINK>). Since NSAIDs do not depress respiration and do not impair gastrointestinal motility as opioids do, they are clinically useful for treating pain after minor surgery and day surgery, and have an opioid-sparing effect after more major surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Grahame_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grahame-Smith 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A major concern regarding the use of conventional NSAIDs postoperatively is the possibility of bleeding from both the operative site (because of the inhibition of platelet aggregation) (<LINK REF="REF-Forrest-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forrest 2002</LINK>), and from the upper gastrointestinal tract (especially in patients stressed by surgery, the elderly, frail, or dehydrated). Other potentially serious adverse events include acute liver injury, acute renal injury, heart failure, and adverse reproductive outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Hern_x00e1_ndez_x002d_D_x00ed_az-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hernández-Díaz 2001</LINK>). Research has also implicated diclofenac in haematological abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 2015</LINK>). However, such complications are more likely to occur with chronic use, and NSAIDs generally present fewer risks with short term use, as in the treatment of postoperative pain (<LINK REF="REF-Rapoport-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapoport 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>The original version of this review included both ibuprofen and diclofenac, and was an update of a previous non-Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1998</LINK>). A 2004 update of diclofenac included only included seven studies in which 581 participants were treated with diclofenac and 364 with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004</LINK>). A further updated review included 15 studies, with 1512 participants treated with diclofenac and 793 with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since 2011, new clinical trials have been published, and the importance of formulation has been recognised. Taken together these factors meant that results of the previous reviews needed to be revisited.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-07-02 10:28:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the Oxford Quality Score as the basis for study inclusion, limiting inclusion to studies that were randomised and double-blind as a minimum (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996b</LINK>).</P>
<P>We also completed a 'Risk of bias' table using methods adapted from those described by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, </I>resolving any disagreements by discussion (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed the following for each study.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). We assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: low risk of bias (any truly random process: random number table; computer random number generator); unclear risk of bias (method used to generate sequence not clearly stated). We excluded studies using a non-random process (odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number), which were therefore at high risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). The method used to conceal allocation to interventions before assignment determines whether the intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); unclear risk of bias (method not clearly stated). We excluded studies that did not conceal allocation (open list), which were therefore at high risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). We assessed the methods used to blind study participants and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (study stated that it was blinded and described the method used to achieve blinding: identical tablets; matched in appearance and smell); unclear risk of bias (study stated that it was blinded but did not provide an adequate description of how blinding was achieved). We excluded studies that were not double-blind and therefore at high risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Size (checking for possible biases confounded by small size). Small studies have been shown to overestimate treatment effects, probably because the conduct of small studies is more likely to be less rigorous, allowing critical criteria to be compromised (<LINK REF="REF-Dechartres-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dechartres 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-N_x00fc_esch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nüesch 2010</LINK>). We considered studies to be at low risk of bias if they had 200 participants or more, at unclear risk if they had 50 to 200 participants, and at high risk of bias if they had fewer than 50 participants.</LI>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-07-02 14:00:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For efficacy analyses we used the number of participants in each treatment group who were randomised, received medication, and provided at least one post-baseline assessment. For safety analyses we used the number of participants randomised to each treatment group who took the study medication. We analysed results for different doses separately.</P>
<P>For each study we converted the mean total pain relief (TOTPAR), summed pain intensity difference (SPID), VAS TOTPAR, or VAS SPID values for the active and placebo groups to %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID by division into the calculated maximum value (see <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1991</LINK>). We then calculated the proportion of participants in each treatment group who achieved at least 50%maxTOTPAR using verified equations (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>; Moore 1997b). We converted these proportions into the number of participants achieving at least 50%maxTOTPAR by multiplying by the total number of participants in the treatment group. We used this information on the number of participants with at least 50%maxTOTPAR for active and placebo groups to calculate RR and NNT.</P>
<P>We accepted the following pain measures for the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID (in order of priority; see <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Five-point categorical pain relief scales with comparable wording to 'none, slight, moderate, good, or complete'.</LI>

<LI>VAS for pain relief.</LI>
<LI>VAS for pain intensity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If none of these measures was available, we used the number of participants reporting 'very good or excellent' on a five-point categorical global scale with the wording 'poor, fair, good, very good, excellent' for the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>For each treatment group we extracted the number of participants reporting treatment-emergent adverse effects and calculated relative benefit and risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1995</LINK>). We calculated NNT and NNH with 95% CIs from the pooled number of events using the method of Cook and Sackett (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>). We assumed a statistically significant difference from control when the 95% CI of the RR did not include the number one.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-07-06 12:55:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original version of this review included seven studies, in which 581 participants were treated with diclofenac and 364 with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004</LINK>). An updated review included 15 studies, with 1512 participants treated with diclofenac and 793 with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009a</LINK>). This further update included 18 studies, with 1902 participants treated with diclofenac and 1007 with placebo, representing a 26% increase in participants in comparisons between diclofenac and placebo.</P>
<P>In addition to including more studies and participants, this update also changed the focus of the review, examining the effects of formulation in more detail than previously. This is a result of increased understanding of the importance of speed of onset in determining analgesic efficacy in acute pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2015a</LINK>). Fast-acting diclofenac formulations, fast-acting gelatin capsules, or nanoparticles produce maximum plasma concentrations at about 15 to 40 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manvelian-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manvelian 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scallion-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scallion 2009</LINK>), similar to diclofenac potassium, at around 30 to 40 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2015</LINK>), but much faster than diclofenac sodium, where maximum plasma concentrations are reported to be longer than 2 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Willis-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willis 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>These results relate to absorption in the fasted state. Taking drugs with food can have very significant effects on the absorption of drugs. For rapidly absorbed analgesics, maximum plasma concentrations are typically delayed and reduced in extent in the fed compared with the fasting state (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2015b</LINK>). This may not always be the case, as with some formulations of diclofenac (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manvelian-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manvelian 2012b</LINK>). The complexity of taking analgesics in the fed state does not impinge on the analgesic results in this (and other) acute pain reviews, as participants are almost universally fasted when taking the analgesics.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-03 14:50:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The formulation with results from the largest number of studies and participants was diclofenac potassium. It demonstrated a graded improvement in efficacy as doses rose from 25 mg to 100 mg, both for participants achieving at least 50% maximum pain relief (which is what patients say they want from treatment; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013</LINK>), and for remedication within 6 to 8 hours (see 'Summary of results A' below). The largest body of information, for diclofenac potassium 50 mg, in seven studies, produced a NNT for at least 50% of maximum pain relief compared with placebo of 2.1 (1.9 to 2.5), which is amongst the better results found in acute pain studies (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fast-acting diclofenac preparations, of which there were various forms, were less frequently studied. A 50 mg dose, in four studies, produced a similar NNT to diclofenac potassium, of 2.4 (2.0 to 3.0). The results for the 100 mg dose derive from only 168 participants and therefore should be interpreted with caution. We have included this analysis, despite having fewer than 200 participants, for indicative purposes only.</P>
<P>We found few data for diclofenac sodium, and the NNT compared with placebo was high, at 6.6 (4.1 to 17). This probably reflects its much slower absorption than diclofenac potassium or fast-acting formulations.</P>
<P>Adverse events rates for all formulations were very similar to those with placebo. Serious adverse events were not reported, or did not occur.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-07-02 11:52:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main limitation of the review was the small number of studies and participants for most analyses. The limited number of studies and participants did not allow for any sensible assessment of common or rare adverse events, although diclofenac is widely studied in other conditions, particularly chronic musculoskeletal pain, such as occurs with osteoarthritis.</P>
<P>Some important outcomes, such as those concerning duration of pain relief, were very poorly reported. Some results were available, but studies frequently did not report median time to duration, or percentages of participants who needed additional analgesia by particular times, or by the end of the study.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-07-02 11:52:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies themselves were of high quality, but sample sizes were somewhat limited. The biggest problem was that studies did not report key methodological information about randomisation and blinding, though our experience is that these studies are usually done impeccably. This lack of methodological detail was true even for the most recent studies, and reflects a lack of awareness by authors, journals, and sponsors, about how clinical trials should be reported.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-07-02 11:53:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out extensive searches to identify relevant studies, but there always remains the possibility of unidentified studies. For the largest data set, diclofenac potassium 50 mg, a very large amount of null effect data would be required to reduce the analgesic effect to a clinically irrelevant value of 8 (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2008</LINK>); over 2100 participants would be needed in null effect studies to do this. It is unlikely that such a body of evidence exists. That would not be the case for fast-acting formulations, where the amount of data for any one formulation is small, and particularly for diclofenac sodium, where analgesic efficacy is modest and the data available very few.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-07-02 11:53:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Previous versions of this review, and other reviews, have not reported results according to formulation, as done here, making comparison difficult. The overall estimate of efficacy for 50 mg diclofenac for at least 50% maximum pain relief in the previous version of this review was 2.7 (2.4 to 3.0). This compares with a NNT of 2.1 (1.9 to 2.5) for 50 mg diclofenac potassium in this review, a significantly better result (z = 2.28, P = 0.023). Including slower-acting formulations like diclofenac sodium in previous reviews probably erroneously underestimated analgesic efficacy possible with some forms of the drug.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">General</HEADING>
<P>This review confirms other research indicating that rapidly dispersible and absorbed analgesics provide good pain relief, and that slow absorption results in poor pain relief in acute pain. Formulation is therefore of major consequence, and while the evidence on this is growing, there remain considerable gaps in our knowledge. These include direct linking of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in acute pain, something readily amenable to test in relatively inexpensive clinical trials.</P>
<P>Research could, and probably should, include effects of fasting and fed states for acute pain and headache, especially in situations where many over-the-counter drugs are taken. The effects of food on drug absorption and analgesics efficacy are not well understood, but they are significant.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison between active treatments</HEADING>
<P>The standardised nature of the study design means that indirect comparisons with placebo are valid, as evidenced by independent research on the topic. There is, however, a very large body of information amenable to network meta-analysis. While unlikely to provide much in the way of new insights, it could prove an invaluable tool for testing network meta-analytical methods.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Categorical rating scale:</HEADING>
<P>The most common is the five-category scale (none, slight, moderate, good or lots, and complete). For analysis numbers are given to the verbal categories (for pain intensity, none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and severe = 3, and for relief, none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, good or lots = 3, and complete = 4). Data from different subjects are then combined to produce means (rarely medians) and measures of dispersion (usually standard errors of means). The validity of converting categories into numerical scores was checked by comparison with concurrent visual analogue scale measurements. Good correlation was found, especially between pain relief scales using cross-modality matching techniques. Results are usually reported as continuous data, mean, or median pain relief or intensity. Few studies present results as discrete data, giving the number of participants who report a certain level of pain intensity or relief at any given assessment point. The main advantages of the categorical scales are that they are quick and simple. The small number of descriptors may force the scorer to choose a particular category when none describes the pain satisfactorily.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Visual analogue scale (VAS):</HEADING>
<P>Lines with left end labelled "no relief of pain" and right end labelled "complete relief of pain" seem to overcome this limitation imposed by discrete categories. Participants mark the line at the point that corresponds to their pain. The scores are obtained by measuring the distance between the no relief end and the participant's mark, usually in millimetres. The main advantages of VAS are that they are simple and quick to score, avoid imprecise descriptive terms, and provide many points from which to choose. More concentration and co-ordination are needed, which can be difficult postoperatively or with neurological disorders.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Total pain relief (TOTPAR):</HEADING>
<P>TOTPAR is calculated as the sum of pain relief scores over a period of time. If a participant had complete pain relief immediately after taking an analgesic, and maintained that level of pain relief for 6 hours, they would have a 6-hour TOTPAR of the maximum of 24. Differences between pain relief values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the composite trapezoidal rule. This is a simple method that approximately calculates the definite integral of the area under the pain relief curve by calculating the sum of the areas of several trapezoids that together closely approximate to the area under the curve.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summed pain intensity difference (SPID):</HEADING>
<P>SPID is calculated as the sum of the differences between the pain scores over a period of time. Differences between pain intensity values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the trapezoidal rule.</P>
<P>VAS TOTPAR and VAS SPID are visual analogue versions of TOTPAR and SPID.</P>
