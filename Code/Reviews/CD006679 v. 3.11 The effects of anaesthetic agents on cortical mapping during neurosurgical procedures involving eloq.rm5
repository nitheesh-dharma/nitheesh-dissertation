<COVER_SHEET MODIFIED="2011-10-05 11:09:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rachael Kelly" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall comments from subject expert:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting and useful review specifically for neuroanaesthesiolgists commonly involved in these type of surgeries. Futher research will be necessary due to the increase in procedures done under general anesthesia. As previously mentioned, it is important to have better definition of &amp;#8220;around&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;near&amp;#8221; eloquent areas. It is also important to explain that what we called mapping have the objective of deliniate the bounders and identify specific components of the eloquent area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Response from review authors:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have modified the entire review based on this valid comment. We have modified 'around' and 'near' as 'lesions involving or adjacent to' eloquent areas. The other objective of delineating these boundaries is explained in the background of the abstract as given below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eloquent areas that the surgeons are concerned are the primary motor, premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex and speech areas. If the lesions are within these regions the surgeons could either take a biopsy or do a intracapsular decompression without damaging the mentioned areas to avoid postoperative dysfunction. If the lessions are adjacent to the above mentioned areas the normal anatomy would get distorted. However, proper identification of the above mentioned areas would enable the surgeon to radically remove the tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall comments from statistician:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased to see a good knowledge of statistics and subject matter.&amp;#160; Make sure, however, that you do not over-complicate the medical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a shame that there were no studies suitable for a meta-analysis.&amp;#160; Perhaps you should get a grant to run a relevant RCT or (more realistically!) amend the protocol to include other study designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Response from review authors:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is a good suggestion. We would work on it in the future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall comments from consumer:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst I did find this review interesting in parts as previously stated I did also find the review equally difficult to comprehend having to &amp;#160;re-read this a number of occasions to gain more of what this was all about. &amp;#160;It has without a doubt been one of the more difficult reviews to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Response from review authors:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have tried to remodify the whole review in a simple manner. Specifically we have modified the plain language summary and the research implications and conclusion.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2011-10-05 11:09:12 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Rachael Kelly">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-13 13:55:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There are discrete areas in the brain that are responsible for sensation (sensory), control of movement (motor) and language functions. In patients with surgically removable lesions involving, or adjacent to, these areas, it is important to achieve a near complete resection without damaging the functional areas (normal brain tissue). Electrical properties of the brain cells are often monitored during these surgical procedures to accurately identify the functional areas. This technique is called electrophysiological mapping. Anaesthetic agents are known to affect the mapping techniques. The authors of this review aimed to identify and evaluate randomised controlled trials (RCTS) assessing the effect of anaesthetic agents on electrophysiological mapping of these functional areas of the brain. We were not able to find any RCTs. Good quality evidence is lacking and hence there is a need for well-designed RCTs to determine the effects of anaesthetic agents on electrophysiological mapping in this specific surgical population.</P>

I will like the authors to define what they mean by &amp;#8220;near&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;around&amp;#8221; eloquent areas. The idea is to identify the eloquent area but the actual mapping is always done inside eloquent areas in order to identify specific components of this area (speech, motor, memory etc). Mapping areas outside is not a common procedure because there is almost no information you can get from the neuromonitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also considered that complete or near complete resection without damaging the healthy surrounding tissues is always an objective of any surgical procedure not only for the types of surgeries the authors want to study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Response from review authors:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have modified the entire review based on this valid comment. We have modified 'around' and 'near' as 'lesions involving or adjacent to' eloquent areas. The other objective of delineating these boundaries is explained in the background of the abstract as given below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eloquent areas that the surgeons are concerned are the primary motor, premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex and speech areas. If the lesions are within these regions the surgeons could either take a biopsy or do a intracapsular decompression without damaging the mentioned areas to avoid postoperative dysfunction. If the lesiosns are adjacent to the above mentioned areas the normal anatomy would get distorted. However, proper identification of the above mentioned areas would enable the surgeon to radically remove the tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We agree that near complete resection of the tumour is always the goal for any neurosurgical procedure. We just wanted to emphasise its importance considering the vital areas involved.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2011-09-13 13:54:26 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In patients presenting for surgical resection of lesions involving, or adjacent to, the functionally important eloquent cortical areas, it is vital to achieve complete or near complete resection of the pathology without damaging the healthy surrounding tissues.The eloquent areas that the surgeons are concerned with are the primary motor, premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex and speech areas. If the lesions are within these regions surgeons could either take a biopsy or do a intracapsular decompression without damaging the mentioned areas to avoid postoperative dysfunction. If the lesions are adjacent to the above mentioned areas, the normal anatomy would get distorted. However, proper identification of the above mentioned areas would enable the surgeon to radically remove the tumours. Intraoperative mapping of the cortex with stimulating and recording electrodes is termed as electrophysiological (EP) mapping.The EP mapping of motor, sensory and language cortex is widely employed in the resection of lesions involving or adjacent to the eloquent areas. Both intravenous and inhalational agents are known to affect these EP mapping techniques.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-16 08:19:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comment 5 (subject expert):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first 3 lines, again is not clear when the authors mention lesions &amp;quot;around&amp;quot; functionally important areas. The lesion should be adjacent or inside the eloquent area to justify electrophysiology mapping. In any single neurosurgical case, it is always important to achieve accurate delineation of the pathology from functionally normal cortex. I think that what the authors need to express is that is crucial delineate the surroundings of the eloquent area and properly map the inside of it to avoid damage of this area while resecting the pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Response from review authors:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have modified the first paragraph accordingly. We have almost used the same sentence with minor modification from the subject expert. Many Thanks for letting us use the same sentence.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with lesions involving or adjacent to the functionally important areas of the brain such as the sensory, motor and speech areas (eloquent areas) present for neurosurgical procedures involving tumour resection and surgical treatment of epilepsy. Accurate identification of the diseased region from functionally normal region of the brain is crucial to achieve complete or near complete resection of the lesion and hence to preserve cognitive function. Functional cortical mapping is often performed in the perioperative setting in these patients in an attempt to avoid postoperative deficits (Skirboll 1996). It is crucial to delineate the surroundings of the eloquent area and properly map the inside of it to avoid damage to this area while the pathology is excised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comment 6 (statistician):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is very complex and the aim(s) of the review would benefit from being expanded further.&amp;#160; Technical terms need to be better defined and there should be a better explanation of why the question needing to be answered is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Response from review authors:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The background is explained further.

I am sure this would be difficult for other consumers also.&amp;#160; Possibly much easier for another doctor to understand what is being said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Response from review authors:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The background is explained further.

<P>Patients with lesions involving or adjacent to the functionally important areas of the brain such as the sensory, motor and speech areas (eloquent areas) present for neurosurgical procedures involving tumour resection and surgical treatment of epilepsy. Accurate identification of the diseased region from the functionally normal region of the brain is crucial to achieve complete or near complete resection of the lesion and hence to preserve cognitive function. Functional cortical mapping is often performed in the perioperative setting in these patients in an attempt to avoid postoperative deficits (<LINK REF="REF-Skirboll-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skirboll 1996</LINK>). It is crucial to delineate the surroundings of the eloquent area and properly map it to avoid damage to this area while the pathology is excised. Various modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetic encephalography (MEG), Wada testing, surgical navigation systems and intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used for this purpose. (<LINK REF="REF-Kawaguchi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawaguchi 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makela-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makela 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pechstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pechstein 1998</LINK>). Intra-operative EP mapping of the functional cortex provides many benefits over other techniques and has the potential to predict and prevent severe and permanent post-operative deficits (<LINK REF="REF-Szel_x00e9_nyi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szelényi 2005</LINK>). Advantages include real time assessment of cerebral function with constant feedback to the surgeon, allowing subcortical mapping (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2010</LINK>). However, pre-existing neurological deficits may impede identification of responses during cortical mapping, adding to the problems posed by neuro-anaesthesia in obtaining reliable cortical localisation (<LINK REF="REF-Legatt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legatt 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Conventionally, functional areas are localized in conscious patients (awake craniotomies) by recording muscle motor-evoked potentials (mMEPs) triggered by direct cortical stimulation (DCS) of the motor cortex, as first described by Sir Victor Horsley (<LINK REF="REF-Vilensky-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilensky 2002</LINK>). The method of eliciting movements by applying electrical stimulation during surgery still remains the gold standard for identifying the functional cortex (<LINK REF="REF-Woolsey-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolsey 1979</LINK>). However, cortical stimulation in conscious patients has limited application in children (<LINK REF="REF-Goldring-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldring 1984</LINK>) and uncooperative patients. DCS can also be performed under general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Black-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1987</LINK>). Jasper et al (<LINK REF="REF-Jasper-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jasper 1960</LINK>) compared the results of direct cortical stimulation (DCS), and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs).They reported accurate localization of the primary sensori-motor areas could be based on SSEP. Sensorimotor cortical mapping involves three steps which include localisation of the central sulcus, motor function mapping and sensory mapping. Contralateral median nerve stimulation and eliciting somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs phase reversal technique) is the widely employed and most reliable tool for localising the central sulcus (<LINK REF="REF-Korvenoja-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korvenoja 2006</LINK>).<B> </B>When the median nerve contralateral to the cerebral hemisphere operated on is stimulated, the majority of nerve fibres arise from the skin (cutaneous fibres). These project to area 3b (sensory gyrus) in the sulcus of the cortex. The cells in the sulcus are oriented horizontally. Hence they generate a field. This field will be negative on one side and positive  on the other side. The negative field is recorded from the  primary parietal sensory cortex and the positive field is recorded from the motor cortex (precentral frontal cortex). This creates a dipole directed perpendicular to the  central sulcus from posterior to anterior region. This change in the polarity recorded by the subdural contact strip is termed as phase reversal. It is one of the most reliable methods to identify the central sulcus even superior than visual inspection (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2010</LINK>). The gyrus anterior and adjacent to where the negative response is obtained is the motor gyrus. Motor and sensory function mapping involves both DCS and localisation of central sulcus via the phase reversal technique (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suess-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suess 2006</LINK>). Sensory function mapping is usually done in awake patients. Hence, the current practice of functional cortex mapping involves both DCS triggered mMEPs and SSEPs (<LINK REF="REF-Cedzich-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cedzich 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sala-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sala 2003</LINK>).  </P>
<P>The depth of anaesthesia plays an important role in the successful localization of the primary motor cortex (<LINK REF="REF-Lotto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lotto 2004</LINK>). High levels of muscle relaxation with neuromuscular blocking medications can interfere with the monitoring of muscle movements during mapping of the motor cortex (<LINK REF="REF-Kalkman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalkman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lotto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lotto 2004</LINK>). Alterations in SSEP waveforms due to particular anaesthetic agents or regimens make these agents or regimens unsuitable for successful mapping (<LINK REF="REF-Banoub-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banoub 2003</LINK>). Hence, the anaesthetic regimen must be able to address the requirements of SSEPs, DCS responses and the patient being kept under a surgical plane of anaesthesia during mapping of the functional/eloquent areas. Three main types of anaesthetic effects can impact functional cortical mapping (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2010</LINK>). These include (a) changes in the SSEPs, where there could be a drop in amplitudes and an increase in latency depending on the depth of anaesthesia thus resulting in difficulty in identifying the central sulcus, (b) impact on the generation of mMEPS and (c) the impact on cortical excitability which is judged by electrocorticogram analysis (ECoG).</P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate different general anaesthetic agents and regimens that allow satisfactory functional cortical mapping during neurosurgery involving eloquent areas of the brain using SSEPs and mMEPs triggered by DCS.</P>

<B>
<BR/>
</B>(1) Binary data<BR/>
</I>We would have calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) based on a random-effects model. The number needed to treat to benefit or number needed to harm statistic (NNTB, NNTH) would have been calculated in case of statistically significant results. We would have inspected data to see if an analysis using a fixed-effect model would have made any substantive difference in outcomes that were not statistically significantly heterogeneous. We would have performed all analyses on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis.</P>
<P>
<I>(2) Continuous data<BR/>
</I>(a) For continuous outcomes (such as amplitude and latency of evoked potentials), a mean difference between groups would have been estimated using a random-effects model. We would have excluded continuous data in trials with more than 20% of the participants missing from the data synthesis.</P>
<P>(b) Skewed data: To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we would have applied  the following standards to all endpoint data before inclusion: (i) standard deviations, means and individual patient data were as reported in the paper or as obtained from the authors; (ii) A rough check list to identify skewed data. The checklist is valid for end point data outcomes where a lowest to highest possible value for an outcome is known to exist such as weight, volume and blood concentrations, which have lowest possible values of zero, or for scale outcomes with maximum or minimum scores. This check list is not applicable for change from baseline measures. The check involves calculating the observed mean minus the lowest possible value (or the highest possible value minus the observed mean), and dividing this by the standard deviation. A ratio less than two suggests skew and if it is less than one, there is strong evidence of a skewed distribution.</P>
<P>(c) Endpoint versus change data: endpoint scale-derived data would have been finite, ranging from one score to another. Change data would have been more problematic and we would not have been able to apply the above rule. Although most change scores were likely to be skewed and this being difficult to prove, we would have presented in Meta View. If both endpoint and change scores were available for the same outcome, we would have presented endpoint data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We would have used the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, as well as visual inspection of graphs, to investigate the possibility of heterogeneity. We would have interpreted a significance level &lt; 0.10 as evidence of heterogeneity. If heterogeneity was found, we would have inspected the  outlier studies to determine the cause. If clear reasons for the heterogeneity were found, we would not have added the responsible studies to the main body of homogeneous trials, but would have summated and presented them separately and indicated the reasons for heterogeneity. Additionally, we would have used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to quantify the extent of heterogeneity. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. If the I<SUP>2</SUP> estimate was 75% to 100%, we would have interpreted this as indicating the presence of considerable levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>The literature search of the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (7 March 2011), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL issue 1 of 4, <I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2011), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1948 to February week 4, 2011),PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 7 March 2011), National Research Register (Archive) and UK Clinical Research Network (7 March 2011) did not identify any relevant RCT studies. We identified three potentially relevant studies after scrutinising the titles and abstracts from the available databases. We identified two more studies through handsearching from the relevant references (see Flow chart, <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-09-13 13:58:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We found no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of anaesthetic agents on cortical mapping during neurosurgical procedures involving eloquent areas of the brain. Therefore, no studies could be included in this review. Few RCTs have reported the effects of anaesthetic agents on electrophysiological monitoring in terms of SSEps and transcranial derived MEPs in neurosurgical patients. None of these studies assessed these effects in relation to direct cortical stimulation (DCS) triggered mMEPS in the specific patient population presenting for lesions around the eloquent areas. As more patients present for surgical removal of pathological lesions around the functional cortex, there is an unmet need for well-designed RCTs to determine the effects of anaesthetic agents on cortical mapping.</P>

<P>The depth and type of anaesthesia can affect both somatosensory and motor evoked responses. Choice of anaesthetic agents could play a role in successfully identifying eloquent areas and hence the outcome. No information is available from RCTs on the effect of anaesthetic agents on cortical mapping in neurosurgical procedures involving eloquent areas. The current knowledge in this mapping approach is based on studies performed in generalised neurosurgical procedures involving all areas of the brain. At present these data are applied to monitor and map the functional cortex during procedures around the eloquent areas in the absence of good quality evidence. At this juncture it is not clear whether there would be any difference observed between all other areas and areas involving, and adjacent to, the eloquent areas. There might be a difference with areas inside the eloquent territory. It is technically possible to map all the areas in the brain. However, for the purpose of surgery it is not practical. Surgeons would be more concerned about areas such as the primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex and speech areas. Any damage to these areas contribute to postoperative morbidity. Hence, it is important to delineate these areas from the tumours. Based on identification of these areas, a decision would be taken on partial or radical removal or just obtaining a biopsy from the lesion.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-09-16 07:48:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The impact of anaesthetic agents on cortical mapping can be reliably determined only through well-performed RCTs. Although a few RCTs have addressed this issue in neurosurgical patients, none of them are specific in relation to eloquent areas. More patients are likely to present for surgeries involving and adjacent to the eloquent areas in the near future anticipating a near normal postoperative cognitive function. Because of this, there is a definite need to perform well-designed RCTs to assess the effect of anaesthetic agents on cortical mapping in these patients. Apart from appropriate sample size with adequate power to detect the clinically significant differences, future studies should focus on the definition and selection of the target population clearly excluding surgeries on non-eloquent territory. In addition, studies should concentrate on different anaesthetic agents quantifying the successful identification of functional cortex in terms of the stimulus strength and elicited response.</P>
