<TITLE MODIFIED="2016-11-02 22:12:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Local anaesthesia (numbing medicine) that is directly applied to the skin can provide pain control for repair of skin lacerations</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-02-14 01:36:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<U>Background</U>: Pain control during suturing of torn skin is generally achieved by injecting medication into the skin (infiltration) to numb the area. This injection itself may cause pain, but topical anaesthetics are applied directly to the skin and are painless to administer. Cocaine was one of the first anaesthetics to be successfully applied topically. Concerns over adverse effects of cocaine, its potential misuse and the administrative burden of dispensing a controlled substance led to the development of cocaine-free topical anaesthetics. Multiple cocaine-free topical anaesthetics have been found to provide effective anaesthesia for repair of dermal lacerations.</P>
<P>
<U>Study characteristics</U>: The evidence is current to December 2016. We included in this review 25 randomized controlled trials involving 3278 participants. Studies included both adults and children. Fifteen of the included trials used self-reporting of pain intensity by trial participants to determine the effectiveness of local anaesthetics.</P>
<P>
<U>Key results</U>: Study results suggest that directly applying local anaesthetics to the skin is an effective, non-invasive way of providing pain control during suturing or stapling of skin lacerations. Study findings on the efficacy of individual topical anaesthetics were limited by study design, and data on the efficacy of each topical agent were obtained mostly from single trials. Researchers reported no serious side effects following the use of cocaine-containing or cocaine-free topical anaesthetics. The overall broadly comparable effectiveness of cocaine-free topical anaesthetics for skin laceration repair brings into question the necessity to include cocaine as a component of local anaesthetic solutions. The small number of trials in each comparison group and the range of outcome measures assessed prevented pooling and quantitative analysis of data for all but the single outcome of pain intensity.</P>
<P>Additional studies are necessary to directly compare the effectiveness of different formulations of topical anaesthetics. Our review was limited to pain control for repair of superficial lacerations, and our results might not be generalizable to deeper lacerations or more complex procedures performed on intact skin. Further research is needed to strengthen the evidence and to overcome the weakness of the included studies.</P>
<P>
<U>Quality of the evidence</U>: The overall quality of the evidence was low owing to limitations in study design, ways that studies were carried out (implementation), imprecision of results and high probability of selective data reporting. Most of the trials that compared infiltrated and topical anaesthetics were at high risk of bias, and this was likely to influence measured effects.</P>

<P>Topical local anaesthetics provide effective analgesia for patients undergoing numerous superficial procedures, including repair of dermal lacerations. The need for cocaine in topical anaesthetic formulations has been questioned because of concern about adverse effects, thus novel preparations of cocaine-free anaesthetics have been developed.

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-02-16 10:33:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>To assess whether benefits of non-invasive topical anaesthetic application occur at the expense of decreased analgesic efficacy.

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-02-14 01:31:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this updated review, we searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 11), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 2010 to December 2016), Embase (2010 to December 2016) and MEDLINE (2010 to December 2016). We did not limit this search by language or format of publication. We contacted manufacturers, international scientific societies and researchers in the field. Weemailed selected journalsand reviewed meta-registers of ongoing trials. For the previous version of this review, we searched these databases to November 2010.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-01-06 13:03:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of topical anaesthetics for repair of dermal laceration in adult and paediatric participants.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-14 01:33:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present updated review included 25 RCTs involving 3278 participants. The small number of trials in each comparison group and the heterogeneity of outcome measures precluded quantitative analysis of data for all but one outcome: pain intensity. In two pooled studies, the mean self-reported visual analogue scale (VAS; 0 to 100 mm) score for topical prilocaine-phenylephrine (PP) was higher than the mean self-reported VAS (0 to 100 mm) score for topical tetracaine-epinephrine-cocaine (TAC) by 5.59 points (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.16 to 13.35). Most trials that compared infiltrated and topical anaesthetics were at high risk of bias, which is likely to have affected their results. Researchers found that several cocaine-free topical anaesthetics provided effective analgesic efficacy. However, data regarding the efficacy of each topical agent are based mostly on single comparisons in trials with unclear or high risk of bias. Mild, self-limited erythematous skin induration occurred in one of 1042 participants who had undergone application of TAC. Investigators reported no serious complications among any of the participants treated with cocaine-based or cocaine-free topical anaesthetics. The overall quality of the evidence according to the GRADE system is low owing to limitations in design and implementation, imprecision of results and high probability of publication bias (selective reporting of data). Additional well-designed RCTs with low risk of bias are necessary before definitive conclusions can be reached.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-14 01:33:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have found two new studies published since the last version of this review was prepared. We have added these studies to those previously included and have conducted an updated analysis, which resulted in the same review conclusions as were presented previously.</P>
<P>Mostly descriptive analysis indicates that topical anaesthetics may offer an efficacious, non-invasive means of providing analgesia before suturing of dermal lacerations. Use of cocaine-based topical anaesthetics might be hard to justify, given the availability of other effective topical anaesthetics without cocaine. However, the overall quality of the evidence according to the GRADE system is low owing to limitations in design and implementation, imprecision of results and high probability of publication bias (selective reporting of data). Additional well-designed RCTs with low risk of bias are necessary before definitive conclusions can be reached.</P>

<P>Local anaesthetic efficacy (capacity for producing desired anaesthetic effect) during procedures such as wound repair is assessed by the patient's self-report of pain intensity during the intervention. Acceptable tools for quantifying pain intensity include the visual analogue scale (VAS), the numerical rating scale, the verbal rating scale, the Faces scale and other validated descriptors of pain intensity or relief. Studies have shown non-concordance between participants' and practitioners' assessments of procedure-related pain intensity (<LINK REF="REF-Benzon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benzon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Castarlenas-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castarlenas 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Choiniere-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choiniere 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hjermstad-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hjermstad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>Pain caused by repair of torn skin may be an unpleasant experience for patients. Analgesia or pain control is conventionally achieved through local anaesthetic infiltration. Local anaesthetics make up a class of drugs that interrupt the transmission of electrical impulses along sensory nerves by inactivating sodium channels (<LINK REF="REF-Stoelting-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoelting 1999</LINK>). However, infiltration of local anaesthetics, which involves injecting medication into the skin, may itself cause significant pain (<LINK REF="REF-Kundu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kundu 2002</LINK>). Many patients, especially children, fear or dislike needles. Topical anaesthetics are not injected. Rather, agents are directly applied to a local area of the skin. Therefore, topical anaesthesia may be preferable to infiltration anaesthesia for pain control during skin laceration repair. Topical anaesthetics are available in several forms, including solutions, gels, creams, ointments and skin patches. Adverse reactions to topical local anaesthetics include local responses (rash, stinging) and systemic allergic reactions (diffuse swelling, difficulty breathing, anaphylaxis) (<LINK REF="REF-Drug-Facts-and-Comparisons-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drug Facts and Comparisons 2015</LINK>). An overdose of topical local anaesthetics may adversely affect the cardiovascular or central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Drug-Facts-and-Comparisons-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drug Facts and Comparisons 2015</LINK>). Untoward effects resulting from high systemic levels of local anaesthetics include hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias (bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole), light-headedness, double vision, a metallic taste, drowsiness and seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Stoelting-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoelting 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>In 1980, Pryor et al published the first report on successful use of topical anaesthesia for repair of torn skin (<LINK REF="STD-Pryor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 1980</LINK>). The initial formulation, tetracaine-adrenaline-cocaine (TAC), gained widespread acceptance in North America and has largely supplanted infiltration anaesthesia for this purpose (the term 'epinephrine' rather than 'adrenaline' is used in the USA) (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1992</LINK>). However, the necessity to include cocaine in topical anaesthetic formulations has been questioned owing to concern over possible adverse effects (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.library.tufts.edu/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005364.pub2/full#CD005364-bbs2-0050">Bush 2002</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Grant-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1992</LINK>). Although application of TAC to skin lacerations results in undetectable or low systemic cocaine levels (<LINK REF="REF-Terndrup-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terndrup 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinci-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinci 1999</LINK>), inadvertent mucosal application or overdose may cause significant cocaine absorption, resulting in serious consequences such as seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Dailey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dailey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daya-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daya 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tipton-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tipton 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wehner-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wehner 1984</LINK>).

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-14 01:38:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Repair of superficial dermal laceration is usually a minor procedure that is done in an outpatient setting. Wound repair could be done with surgical sutures or by non-invasive approaches such as skin adhesive or glue; in any case, pain control is required. Traditionally, this is accomplished by infiltrating the wound with local anaesthetics, possibly supplemented with systemic analgesia or sedation.</P>
<P>Local anaesthetics constitute a class of drugs that interrupt the transmission of electrical impulses along nerves by inactivating sodium channels (<LINK REF="REF-Brunton-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoelting-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoelting 1999</LINK>). Adverse reactions to topical local anaesthetics include local responses (rash, stinging) and systemic allergic reactions (diffuse swelling, difficulty breathing, anaphylaxis) (<LINK REF="REF-Dickerson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickerson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drug-Facts-and-Comparisons-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drug Facts and Comparisons 2015</LINK>). An overdose of topical local anaesthetics may adversely affect the cardiovascular or central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Drug-Facts-and-Comparisons-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drug Facts and Comparisons 2015</LINK>). Untoward effects from high systemic levels of local anaesthetics include hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias (bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole), light-headedness, double vision, a metallic taste, drowsiness and seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Brunton-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoelting-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoelting 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tradiltionally, local anaesthetics were injected locally, but recently, newer preparations have allowed local anaesthetics to be applied topically without the discomfort or anxiety that frequently accompanies needle injections. We aimed to compare the application of topical anaesthetics versus traditional infiltration for pain control during wound repair.</P>
<P>We included in this review only trials that evaluated the efficacy of topical local anaesthetics for repair of dermal (skin) lacerations. We included comparisons between:</P>
<P>1. infiltrated local anaesthetic agents and topically applied local anaesthetic agents; and</P>
<P>2. various topical local anaesthetic formulations versus a control formulation.</P>

</OL>
<P>We defined topical anaesthetics as agents that are directly applied to the skin to produce numbness. We included both amide and ester local anaesthetics. We accepted topical preparations that contain more than one local anaesthetic. We also included multi-component topical anaesthetics that contain vasoconstrictors (i.e. cocaine, adrenaline). Acceptable formulations of topical local anaesthetics have included solution, gel, cream, ointment, lotion, jelly, balm, and aerosol spray. We excluded studies that administered local anaesthetics via iontophoresis (a mild electrical current).<BR/>
<BR/>We excluded studies in which investigators applied topical anaesthetics to mucous membranes (moist linings of the mouth, nose and eyes). To ensure that procedures evaluated involved approximately equivalent intensity and quality of pain, we limited the technique of skin closure to instrumentation involving suture placement or stapling. We excluded studies that examined less invasive approaches to repair of lacerations, such as application of tape or tissue adhesives. We included only studies in which participants had superficial injuries involving the epidermis or dermal layers. We did not consider deeper wounds involving the fascia or non-skin structures. We set no limitations on the dimensions of the laceration, but we excluded procedures on infected wounds. We excluded studies in which study personnel administered systemic analgesics or sedatives that may influence the participants' perceived or reported pain intensity.</P>

<P>We included 25 RCTs involving 3278 participants. The small number of trials in each comparison group and the heterogeneity of outcome measures precluded quantitative analysis of data for all but one outcome: pain intensity assessed on a visual analogue scale. Most trials that compared infiltrated and topical anaesthetics were at high risk of blinding, allocation concealment and/or sample size bias, which is likely to affect interpretation of results. Several cocaine-free topical anaesthetics were found to provide effective analgesic efficacy. However, data regarding the efficacy of each topical agent are based mostly on single comparisons in trials with unclear or high risk of bias. Mild, self-limited erythematous skin induration occurred in one case out of a total of 1042 participants who underwent application of topical TAC. Researchers reported no serious complications for any of the participants treated with cocaine-based or cocaine-free topical anaesthetics.</P>

<P>The 25 included RCTs studied different topical anaesthetics (listed in <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>). Four studies included multiple arms that compared more than two different anaesthetic agents (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK> included six different groups, including five different topical anaesthetics and an infiltrated local anaesthetic arm. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997a</LINK> evaluated two topical anaesthetics and infiltrated local anaesthetic. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997b</LINK> compared four different topical anaesthetics, and <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998a</LINK> studied three different topical agents.</P>
<P>Seventeen of the 25 studies compared different forms of topical anaesthetics, and only a minority of trials contained arms with infiltrated local anaesthetic groups. Therefore, the main comparison involved different topical preparations.</P>
<P>We performed no subgroup analysis (or meta-regression) owing to the small number of trials in each comparison group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Our primary outcome measure was analgesic efficacy, as reflected in participants' self-reports of pain intensity during repair of the wound. Fifteen of the included trials determined anaesthetic efficacy through the participants' self-reports of pain intensity (<LINK REF="STD-Blackburn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Blackburn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ernst-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Ernst 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ernst-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Ernst 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ernst-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ernst 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaufberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gaufberg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendall-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kendall 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krief-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Krief 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1986" TYPE="STUDY">White 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zempsky-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zempsky 1997</LINK>).

<P>We first present the evidence regarding cocaine-containing topical anaesthetics. We included comparisons between cocaine-based topical anaesthetics and each of the following: (1) infiltrated local anaesthetics; and (2) different formulations of cocaine-based topical agents. Next, we summarize the evidence evaluating cocaine-free topical anaesthetics. We compared cocaine-free topical agents with each of the following: (1) infiltrated local anaesthetics; (2) formulations of cocaine-containing topical agents; and (3) different formulations of cocaine-free topical anaesthetics; both of the newly included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>) belong to category &#8220;2a&#8221;.</P>
<P>We also report the data on acute anaesthetic-related adverse effects. We have provided a detailed and inclusive description of each of the 25 trials in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>

<P>Six studies compared a topical cocaine-based agent versus infiltrated local anaesthetic (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for detailed study information). Five studies compared topical TAC versus infiltrated local anaesthetic. We could not mathematically combine outcomes because of the diversity of measures used to assess anaesthetic efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hegenbarth-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hegenbarth 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pryor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997a</LINK>); these five studies enrolled a total of 1194 participants.</P>

However, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997a</LINK> found that fewer participants in the TAC group than in the Mepivanor group needed supplemental lidocaine rescue owing to inadequate anaesthesia as assessed by suture technicians (2, or 8.3%, vs 9, or 37.5%, respectively; P = 0.04).</LI>
<LI>Participant compliance during suturing: <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1990</LINK> found that participant compliance during suturing for TAC was significantly better than for lidocaine or placebo (P &lt; 0.002).</LI>
<LI>Participant preference: <LINK REF="STD-Hegenbarth-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hegenbarth 1990</LINK> reported that 92% of parents of participants who received TAC for facial or scalp laceration repair preferred it for the future compared with 57% of parents whose children received lidocaine (P &lt; 0.0001). The difference in parent preference was not statistically significant for other body areas. <LINK REF="STD-Pryor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 1980</LINK> reported that parents of children between one and five years of age preferred topically applied TAC over infiltrated lidocaine (P &lt; 0.005), and that participants five to 17 years old self-reported an even more significant preference for TAC (P &lt; 0.0001).</LI>
<LI>Duration of procedure: <LINK REF="STD-Pryor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 1980</LINK> found that the duration of the suturing procedure was significantly shorter for topical TAC than for infiltrated lidocaine in the one- to five-year-old age group (P &lt; 0.005). For participants 11 to 17 years old, results similarly suggested that the procedure for the TAC group had a shorter duration, but this finding was not statistically significant. Data showed no duration difference between other age groups studied. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK> reported no difference in the duration of suturing between TAC and lidocaine infiltration in all age groups studied (two to 17 years old; P = 0.15).</LI>
<LI>Observer VAS ratings: <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK> found that VAS ratings by observers (suture technicians and research assistants) and participants showed that, compared with lidocaine infiltration, Bupivanor had a small but statistically significantly superior performance for face and scalp lacerations. In the same study, Bupivanor outperformed TAC for repair of face and scalp lacerations, but this finding did not reach statistical significance. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997a</LINK> showed statistically significantly higher VAS scores (i.e. poorer pain control), as observed by research assistants or technicians, with topical Mepivanor solution than with TAC or lidocaine.</LI>

A total of five RCTs that used cocaine-free topical agents reported data on anaesthetic-related toxicity or side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Blackburn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Blackburn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ernst-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Ernst 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Resch 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaffer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schaffer 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schilling-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schilling 1995</LINK>). None of the 358 participants in these five RCTs experienced any acute adverse reactions. <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK> reported wound complications as a secondary outcome. Participants assigned to receive LAT gel developed infection (five participants), dehiscence (one participant) and missing sutures (one participant). Corresponding outcomes in the lidocaine infiltration group included infection in two of 14 participants, dehiscence in none and lost sutures in none. Again, studies found that LAT and infiltrated lidocaine have comparable side effect profiles. <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2014</LINK> reported wound infection (four cases in the infiltration group vs two in the topical anaesthetic putty group); wound dehiscence (two cases in the topical anaesthetic putty group); and adverse effects (one inflamed wound in the topical anaesthetic putty group and one wound requiring resuturing in both groups).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-02-16 10:33:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The topic of the present review is limited to repair of dermal lacerations. Therefore, the results may not be generalizable to repair of wounds located on mucosal surfaces. Also, the dermis provides a barrier to penetration of topical anaesthetic, and so our findings may not be applicable to instrumentation of intact skin.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-14 01:59:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present review consists of a descriptive analysis. Two predominant limitations precluded meta-analysis. First, most of the comparisons between specific anaesthetic agents were accomplished in single trials. Only in a few instances were agents compared across multiple studies. Moreover, trials employed numerous measures of anaesthetic efficacy. In fact, only 15 of the 25 included studies used a validated pain scale. The primary outcome measure was analgesic efficacy, reflected in the participant's self-report of pain intensity during repair of the wound. We extracted surrogate pain scores provided by observers; however, participants' and practitioners' assessments of procedure-related pain reveal non-concordance (<LINK REF="REF-Choiniere-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choiniere 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1994</LINK>). Therefore, during analysis, we considered surrogate pain scores only when participant-reported pain scales were not available.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-02-14 02:00:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our systematic review addressed four principal questions regarding topically applied local anaesthetics for dermal laceration repair.</P>
<P>First, we assessed whether benefits of non-invasive, topical anaesthetic application occur at the expense of decreased analgesic efficacy. We obtained data from a single study that had unclear risk of blinding bias(<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997a</LINK>); the remainder of the trials were at high risk of blinding bias (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ernst-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ernst 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaufberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gaufberg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hegenbarth-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hegenbarth 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendall-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kendall 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pryor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997a</LINK> did not use participant self-reported pain scores to determine anaesthetic efficacy but instead used observer-estimated pain scores. Therefore, we found a paucity of high-quality studies with low risk of bias on which we could base definitive conclusions regarding efficacy of topical anaesthetics versus infiltrated local anaesthesia.</P>
<P>Our second objective was to compare the efficacy of various single-component or multi-component topical anaesthetic agents for repair of dermal lacerations. We obtained data from studies that had unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Ernst-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ernst 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schilling-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schilling 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998a</LINK>) or high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Blackburn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Blackburn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bonadio-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bonadio 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ernst-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Ernst 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ernst-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Ernst 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaffer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schaffer 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinci-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vinci 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2004" TYPE="STUDY">White 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zempsky-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zempsky 1997</LINK>). We have summarized the findings of individual trials in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. However, the evidence reflects bias that may cause some doubt about the findings, or may even significantly weaken the results.</P>
<P>The third objective was to determine the clinical necessity for topical application of the ester anaesthetic, cocaine. We included in the review 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which assessed the effectiveness of cocaine-free topical anaesthetics. None of these studies were at low risk of bias. We mathematically combined data from two studies and found that topical prilocaine-phenylephrine (PP) provided effective analgesia (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998a</LINK>). However, both of these studies had unclear risk of bias for each key domain, leading to some uncertainty about the results. A single RCT assessed each of the additional formulations of topical cocaine-free anaesthetics. Results from studies with unclear risk of bias show that the following agents may provide effective topical analgesia: lidocaine-adrenaline-tetracaine (LAT) (<LINK REF="STD-Schilling-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schilling 1995</LINK>), bupivacaine-noradrenaline (BN) (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>), prilocaine-noradrenaline (PN) (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>), tetracaine-lidocaine-phenylephrine (TLP) (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997b</LINK>), tetracaine-phenylephrine (TP) (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997b</LINK>) and lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) (<LINK REF="STD-Krief-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Krief 2002</LINK>). Topical LAT, which exploits the rapid onset of lidocaine and the long duration of tetracaine (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1985</LINK>), has been the most widely studied cocaine-free formulation. However, before definitive conclusions can be reached, additional investigation is warranted through trials that are well designed and are conducted to assess anaesthetic efficacy by using validated patient self-reported pain scoring scales.</P>
<P>Finally, we evaluated the safety of both cocaine-containing and cocaine-free topical anaesthetics. Many of the included trials (14 of 25) reported data regarding the incidence of anaesthetic-related acute adverse effects. Only one study reported a topical local anaesthetic-related side effect (<LINK REF="STD-Vinci-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vinci 1996</LINK>). The reaction consisted of a large indurated, erythematous reaction that occurred after topical application of tetracaine-epinephrine-cocaine (TAC). No trials reported serious complications, such as seizures or anaphylactic reactions. Although reported data are insufficient to reveal the exact incidence of complications, if topical anaesthetics are applied as directed and appropriately dosed, serious adverse effects are probably infrequent. Combined observations from 10 trials that administered cocaine-based agents and explicitly reported data on side effects revealed one adverse reaction among 1042 total participants (incidence 0.096%). Ten studies that administered cocaine-free anaesthetic agents reported data on toxicity, and none of the participants in these groups experienced acute adverse reactions.</P>

<P>In conclusion, although the trials mentioned were RCTs, we downgraded the overall GRADE score for each measured outcome to low owing to limitations in design and implementation, imprecision of results and high probability of publication bias (selective reporting of data) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-02-16 10:33:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Cochrane support staff conducted the search for this review to ensure comprehensiveness and inclusion of all possible studies. We have assessed all types of bias required by the 2011 version of the Higgins <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I>s (version 5.1.0). Two independent review authors judged inclusion or exclusion of articles to strengthen the decision-making process. We included all reported participants without exclusion due to gender, age or comorbid health issues. We included all types of RCTs and quasi-randomized trials without exclusion due to language, sample size, local aesthetics used or treatment setting. A potential weakness of our review is the exclusion of studies including participants with deep traumatic wounds or therapeutic incisions, or comparisons with other non-invasive treatments such as glue, but our focus was intended to decrease heterogeneity in the review population.</P>
<P>Two independent review authors extracted and entered data, which were sent to all participating review authors for confirmation. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis and we reported most data descriptively, which is a weakness of our review.</P>
<P>The present review has other sources of potential bias as well. The primary outcome was participants' self-report of pain intensity during repair of the wound via validated pain scales. However, a significant number of included trials used observer-reported pain scores or other surrogate outcomes to determine anaesthetic efficacy. Results show non-concordance between participants' pain scores and ratings by physician, parents and other proxies (<LINK REF="REF-Choiniere-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choiniere 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1994</LINK>). Moreover, 21 of the 25 included RCTs enrolled paediatric participants, and evaluation of pain in children can be challenging. Researchers have used several pain scales, including the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Faces scale, in a reliable and validated manner among children as young as five years (<LINK REF="REF-Berde-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berde 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lander-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lander 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeltzer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeltzer 1991</LINK>). Also, evidence supports the validity of tools for measuring acute pain in children as young as three years old (<LINK REF="REF-Tyler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyler 1993</LINK>). However, the youngest age at which children can credibly quantify pain intensity is controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Tyler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyler 1993</LINK>), and behavioural pain scales for early verbal and preverbal children remain to be validated (<LINK REF="REF-Crellin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crellin 2007</LINK>). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that pain assessment in younger paediatric participants may not be accurate. Eight studies were not blinded, and four used unclear blinding strategies.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-02-14 02:01:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no disagreement in final study results between any of the included studies, nor with other previously published studies or review articles, with the exception of conflicting conclusions about efficacy from two studies of topical mepivacaine-noradrenaline (MN) (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1997a</LINK>). We could not combine these two trials because investigators used different pain intensity scales to determine anaesthetic efficacy, and <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK> did not report the standard deviations of outcomes. However, all other trials concluded that topical local anaesthetics are at least as effective as infiltrated ones in laceration repair and provide the advantage of decreasing the pain of application. An earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1992</LINK>) found that TAC is as effective as lidocaine infiltration in dermal laceration repair; however, the minimum effective dose remains to be established to avoid side effects. Throughout subsequent years, multiple RCTs have reported the same results (see <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> section). With the development of new local anaesthetics, the use of cocaine has been questioned and might be nowadays unjustifiable by many, as has been found in the included studies (see <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> section).</P>
<P>Our updated version of this review confirms the results of the previous version (<LINK REF="REF-Eidelman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eidelman 2011</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-14 02:01:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-02-14 02:01:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Injection of anaesthetics per se induces discomfort and may worsen 'needle anxiety' among paediatric participants while distorting the wound site (<LINK REF="REF-Kundu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kundu 2002</LINK>). Therefore, topical anaesthetics are preferable if they do in fact provide similar analgesia to injected local anaesthetics. Individual studies have suggested that some topical formulations may have similar efficacy to conventional local anaesthetics. However, because of methodological heterogeneity and lack of high-quality trials, definitive conclusions for clinical practice cannot be reached at this time.</P>
<P>If cocaine-free topical anaesthetics have similar effectiveness as cocaine-containing agents, then the latter can no longer be justified in light of their high cost and potential adverse effects. Topical lidocaine-adrenaline-tetracaine (LAT), which exploits the rapid onset of lidocaine and the long duration of tetracaine, has been the most widely studied cocaine-free formulation. However, additional studies with sound methodological design are necessary before definitive conclusions for clinical practice can be drawn.</P>
<P>Researchers have reported no serious complications among any participants treated with cocaine-based or cocaine-free topical anaesthetics. One mild, self-limiting skin reaction did occur in one case after application of topical TAC. Nevertheless, clinicians should exhibit caution and apply topical formulations only as directed, while avoiding mucous membrane contact and following appropriate dosing regimens.</P>
<P>We have found two new studies published since the time of the last version of this review. We have added these studies to those previously included and have updated the analysis. This new analysis yielded the same conclusions as were previously presented.</P>
<P>In conclusion, based mostly on descriptive analysis, we believe that topical anaesthetics may in fact be an efficacious, non-invasive means of providing analgesia before suturing of dermal lacerations. However, data regarding the efficacy of each topical anaesthetic are based mostly on single comparisons in trials that have unclear or high risk of bias. Before definitive conclusions can be drawn, additional methodologically well-designed studies with low risk of bias are necessary. Future research should focus on the efficacy of cocaine-free anaesthetics in light of the burden of dispensing cocaine - a controlled substance that is widely abused.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-02-14 02:01:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More investigation is warranted to compare topical lidocaine-adrenaline-tetracaine (LAT) versus other potentially efficacious, cocaine-free topical anaesthetics such as bupivacaine-noradrenaline (BN), prilocaine-phenylephrine (PP) and tetracaine-lidocaine-phenylephrine (TLP). Also, future research could evaluate additional clinically useful topical local anaesthetics or combinations. Recent clinical application of novel formulations of existing local anaesthetics such as microsomal encapsulated bupivacaine (<LINK REF="REF-Chahar-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chahar 2012</LINK>) or those with an intrinsically long duration of action such as saxotoxin (<LINK REF="REF-Lobo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobo 2015</LINK>) may expand the range of available topical local anaesthetics.</P>
<P>Furthermore, additional methodologically sound studies that are less likely to be flawed by bias or confounding variables are needed. Many of the included trials did not determine analgesic efficacy by using validated, participant self-reported pain scales but instead used observer-reported pain scores or other elementary surrogate measures. Future trials should adopt uniform outcomes that reflect participants' own assessments of procedure-related pain intensity. Young children and developmentally impaired adults may benefit most from non-invasive, effective topical anaesthesia before laceration repair. Therefore, validated behavioural pain and distress scales for preverbal or early verbal children, and for cognitively impaired adults, will facilitate determination of the efficacy and safety of topical anaesthetics for these patient subgroups.</P>

<P>1. The physician rated anaesthetic effectiveness (complete, partial or inadequate) according to the ability of the participant to tolerate manipulation of the wound during repair. The anaesthesia was 'complete' if the participant did not cry, complain or wince during suturing. The anaesthesia was 'partial' if the participant had some discomfort but did have an avoidance reaction. 'Inadequate' anaesthesia was defined as obvious discomfort with minimal manipulation of the wound.<BR/>2. Rescue lidocaine infiltration was required.<BR/>3. The study reported any acute adverse reactions to the anaesthetic.</P>
<P>Results include the following.<BR/>1. Physician rating (complete, partial or inadequate) of anaesthetic effectiveness (complete anaesthesia: topical TA = 47.1% vs topical TAC = 75%; P &lt; 0.05)<BR/>2. Requirement of rescue lidocaine infiltration (topical TA = 27.5% vs topical TAC = 8.9%; P = 0.01)<BR/>3. No acute anaesthetic-related adverse effects. However, after returning home from the emergency department, 10.7% of children treated with TAC and 7.8% who received topical AC became drowsy or excitable. No evidence suggested that symptoms were causally related to the topical anaesthetic, and the study author concluded that these were not anaesthetic-induced adverse effects.<BR/>
