<P>20 new studies (2925 additional participants) were identified, providing information on 3907 participants in total, nearly all treated with rofecoxib 50 mg. The overall NNT for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours was unchanged, but dental studies gave a significantly lower (better) NNT than studies in other types of surgery. The median time to use of rescue medication was unchanged for dental studies and slightly shorter when other types of surgery were included. The new outcome of NNT to prevent use of rescue medication is provided. Adverse events did not differ from placebo.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-31 14:12:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A high level of pain relief is experienced by about 60% of those with moderate to severe postoperative pain after a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg, compared to about 10% with placebo. Based mainly on dental pain studies, one in every two participants treated with rofecoxib 50 mg had their pain levels halved, who would not have done so with placebo. Fewer people needed rescue medication with rofecoxib, and the time to use was relatively long, at 14 hours. Its efficacy and duration of action are better than that of many commonly used analgesics at standard doses. Efficacy was better in dental surgery than in other types of surgery. Adverse events did not differ from placebo in these single dose studies.<BR/>

<P>Rofecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor previously licensed for treating acute and chronic pain; it was associated with fewer gastrointestinal adverse events than conventional NSAIDs. An earlier Cochrane review (<A HREF="Barden 2005">Barden 2005</A>) showed that rofecoxib is at least as effective as conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for postoperative pain.</P>

<BR/>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1,<B> </B>2005) on 'Single dose oral rofecoxib for postoperative pain' (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2005</LINK>). The title now states that the review is limited to acute postoperative pain in adults.</P>
<P>Rofecoxib was withdrawn by the original manufacturer in September 2004. It continues to be available in some parts of the world through different manufacturers. How much rofecoxib is used in not known. However, the original review demonstrated that it was a good analgesic, based on a large body of high quality trials. Other trials have subsequently been published, making an updated review necessary to ensure that previous results are robust.</P>
<P>Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage either accidentally due to an injury or as a result of surgery. Acute postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation is a critical component of patient care. This review is one of a series of reviews whose aim is to increase awareness of the range of analgesics that are potentially available, and present evidence for relative analgesic efficacy through indirect comparisons with placebo, in very similar trials performed in a standard manner, with very similar outcomes, and over the same duration. Such relative analgesic efficacy does not in itself determine choice of drug for any situation or patient, but guides policy-making at the local level.</P>
<P>Recent reviews include well established analgesics such as paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>), naproxen (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009a</LINK>), diclofenac (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-P-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry P 2009</LINK>), and ibuprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009b</LINK>), and newer cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective analgesics, such as lumiracoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Roy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2007</LINK>), celecoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2008</LINK>), etoricoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2009</LINK>), and parecoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Lloyd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lloyd 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Single dose trials in acute pain are commonly short in duration, rarely lasting longer than 12 hours. The numbers of participants is small, allowing no reliable conclusions to be drawn about safety. To show that the analgesic is working it is necessary to use placebo (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2005</LINK>). There are clear ethical considerations in doing this. These ethical considerations are answered by using acute pain situations where the pain is expected to go away, and by providing additional analgesia, commonly called rescue analgesia, if the pain has not diminished after about an hour. This is reasonable, because not all participants given an analgesic will have significant pain relief. Approximately 18% of participants given placebo will have significant pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>), and up to 50% may have inadequate analgesia with active medicines. The use of additional or rescue analgesia is hence important for all participants in the trials.</P>
<P>Clinical trials measuring the efficacy of analgesics in acute pain have been standardised over many years. Trials have to be randomised and double blind. Typically, in the first few hours or days after an operation, patients develop pain that is moderate to severe in intensity, and will then be given the test analgesic or placebo. Pain is measured using standard pain intensity scales immediately before the intervention, and then using pain intensity and pain relief scales over the following 4 to 6 hours for shorter acting drugs, and up to 12 or 24 hours for longer acting drugs. Pain relief of half the maximum possible pain relief or better (at least 50% pain relief) is typically regarded as a clinically useful outcome. For patients given rescue medication it is usual for no additional pain measurements to be made, and for all subsequent measures to be recorded as initial pain intensity or baseline (zero) pain relief (baseline observation carried forward). This process ensures that analgesia from the rescue medication is not wrongly ascribed to the test intervention. In some trials the last observation is carried forward, which gives an inflated response for the test intervention compared to placebo, but the effect has been shown to be negligible over four to 6 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005a</LINK>). Patients usually remain in the hospital or clinic for at least the first 6 hours following the intervention, with measurements supervised, although they may then be allowed home to make their own measurements in trials of longer duration.</P>
<P>NSAIDs have pain-relieving, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties, are proven to be effective following day surgery and minor surgery, and have an opiate-sparing effect after more major surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Grahame_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grahame-Smith 2002</LINK>). However, a major concern regarding the use of conventional NSAIDs postoperatively is the possibility of bleeding from both the operative site (because of the inhibition of platelet aggregation) (<LINK REF="REF-Forrest-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forrest 2002</LINK>) and from the upper gastrointestinal tract, (especially in patients stressed by surgery, the elderly, frail, or dehydrated). Drug treatments that combine the pain-relieving properties of NSAIDs without these adverse effects are likely to have a place in clinical practice.</P>
<P>Selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors or 'coxibs' were developed to address the problem of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 2001</LINK>). NSAIDs are thought to relieve pain by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenases and thus the production of prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 1999</LINK>). Prostaglandins occur throughout body tissues and fluids and act to stimulate pain nerve endings and promote/inhibit the aggregation of blood platelets. Cyclo-oxygenase has at least two isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is constitutive while COX-2 is induced at sites of inflammation and produces the prostaglandins involved in inflammatory responses and pain mediation (<LINK REF="REF-Grahame_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grahame-Smith 2002</LINK>). Unlike traditional NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and ketoprofen, the 'coxibs' are selective inhibitors, blocking primarily the action of COX-2 and causing fewer gastrointestinal effects (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005b</LINK>). In common with other NSAIDS, COX-2 inhibitors can give rise to fluid retention and renal damage (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2002</LINK>), so particular caution is needed in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 2001</LINK>). They have also been associated with increased cardiovascular problems, which led to the withdrawal of one coxib (<LINK REF="REF-Kearney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearney 2006</LINK>). Use of coxibs and non-selective NSAIDs in patients with bowel problems such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease is complicated (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>COX-2 inhibitors, like non-selective NSAIDs, are also useful for the relief of acute pain, especially in patients with a high risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding or those with a history of peptic ulcer. They should not precipitate bleeding events through inhibition of platelet aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Straube-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2005</LINK>). In addition to the potential for a reduction in the number of adverse events, they may provide greater and more prolonged pain relief in the postoperative setting than traditional NSAIDs.</P>
<P>Rofecoxib (trade names Vioxx, Ceoxx, Ceeoxx) was the first COX-2-specific inhibitor approved for the treatment of acute pain in the USA. The recommended dose for acute pain treatment was 50 mg daily, which was two to four times the recommended daily dose for chronic arthritis pain.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rofecoxib for the relief of acute postoperative pain.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>QUOROM guidelines were followed (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>). For efficacy analyses we used the number of participants in each treatment group who were randomised, received medication, and provided at least one post-baseline assessment. For safety analyses we used number of participants who received study medication in each treatment group. Analyses were planned for different doses. Sensitivity analyses were planned to investigate any effect of pain model (dental versus other postoperative pain), trial size (39 or fewer versus 40 or more per treatment arm), and quality score (two versus three or more) on the primary outcome. A minimum of two studies and 200 participants were required for any analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief</HEADING>
<P>For each study, mean TOTPAR (total pain relief) or SPID (summed pain intensity difference) for active and placebo groups were converted to %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID by division into the calculated maximum value (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1991</LINK>). The proportion of participants in each treatment group who achieved at least 50%maxTOTPAR was calculated using verified equations (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>). These proportions were then converted into the number of participants achieving at least 50%maxTOTPAR by multiplying by the total number of participants in the treatment group. Information on the number of participants with at least 50%maxTOTPAR for active treatment and placebo was then used to calculate relative benefit (RB) and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT).<BR/>Pain measures accepted for the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>five-point categorical pain relief (PR) scales with comparable wording to "none, slight, moderate, good or complete";</LI>
<LI>four-point categorical pain intensity (PI) scales with comparable wording to "none, mild, moderate, severe";</LI>
<LI>VAS for pain relief;</LI>
<LI>VAS for pain intensity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If none of these measures were available, numbers of participants reporting "very good or excellent" on a five-point categorical global scale with the wording "poor, fair, good, very good, excellent" were taken as those achieving at least 50% pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Use of rescue medication</HEADING>
<P>Numbers of participants requiring rescue medication were used to calculate relative risk (RR) and numbers needed to treat to prevent (NNTp) use of rescue medication for treatment and placebo groups. Median (or mean) time to use of rescue medication was used to calculate the weighted mean of the median (or mean) for the outcome. Weighting was by number of participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Numbers of participants reporting adverse events for each treatment group were used to calculate RR and numbers needed to treat to harm (NNH) estimates for:</P>

<LI>withdrawal due to an adverse event.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Withdrawals</HEADING>
<P>Withdrawals for reasons other than lack of efficacy (participants using rescue medication - see above) and adverse events were noted, as were exclusions from analysis where data were presented.</P>
<P>Relative benefit or risk estimates were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1995</LINK>). NNT, NNTp and NNH with 95% CI were calculated using the pooled number of events by the method of Cook and Sackett (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>). A statistically significant difference from control was assumed when the 95% CI of the relative benefit did not include the number one.</P>
<P>Homogeneity of studies was assessed visually (<LINK REF="REF-L_x0027_Abbe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">L'Abbe 1987</LINK>). The z test (<LINK REF="REF-Tramer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tramer 1997</LINK>) was used to determine if there was a significant difference between NNTs for different groups in the sensitivity analyses.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-25 16:31:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review includes 20 additional studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chelly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chelly 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Desjardins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Desjardins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Desjardins-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Desjardins 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haglund-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Haglund 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kellstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kellstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korn-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Korn 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michael_x002d_Hill-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Michael-Hill 2006</LINK>) and increases the amount of information available in comparisons with placebo from 982 to 3907 participants. All new studies used rofecoxib 50 mg. Studies were all of sufficiently high reporting quality to minimise reporting bias, and the amount of information such as to minimise any possible effect of publication bias. This updated review provides a more robust estimate of the primary outcome of at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, considers differences in efficacy for different types of surgery, and analyses in greater detail the use of rescue analgesia, in terms of both numbers of participants using it and time to use.</P>
<P>The new information does not change the result for the primary outcome; the NNT for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours with rofecoxib 50 mg compared to placebo was 2.2 (2.0 to 2.3). That is, one of every two participants treated with rofecoxib 50 mg will achieve at least 50% pain relief who would not have done so had they received placebo.</P>
<P>For studies in dental surgery only, the NNT for rofecoxib 50 mg compared to placebo was 1.9 (1.8 to 2.0), and for studies in other types of surgery the NNT was 6.8 (4.6 to 13). This difference is statistically significant (P &lt; 0.00001). It has previously been difficult to demonstrate a difference in efficacy between dental and other types of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004</LINK>), although a recent review of ibuprofen 400 mg with a very large data set did demonstrate superiority of analgesia in dental surgery compared with other types of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009b</LINK>), as did a recent review of diclofenac (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-P-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry P 2009</LINK>). It may be that there is indeed a difference, but previously other data sets have been too small to show statistical significance. In this review non-dental surgery comprised major orthopaedic surgery, knee arthroscopy, and first metatarsal bunionectomy. Both the extent of the surgery and the context may influence the perception of pain and make this a highly heterogeneous group. Efficacy in bunionectomy in particular appears to be poor. There has never been sufficient data for any one type of non-dental surgery to be compared with dental surgery, or indeed with other types of non-dental surgery.</P>
<P>Indirect comparisons of NNTs for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours in reviews of other analgesics using identical methods indicate that rofecoxib 50 mg has equivalent efficacy to acetaminophen and codeine 1000/60 mg (2.2 (1.8 to 2.9)) (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2009</LINK>). Rofecoxib 50 mg has superior efficacy to acetaminophen 1000 mg alone (3.6 (3.2 to 4.1)) (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>), ibuprofen 400 mg (2.5 (2.4 to 2.6)) (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009b</LINK>), naproxen 200 mg (3.4 (2.4 to 5.8)) (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009a</LINK>), and celecoxib 200 mg (3.2 (2.7 to 3.9)) (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2008</LINK>). Rofecoxib 50 mg appears inferior to etoricoxib 120 mg (1.9 (1.7 to 2.1)) (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2009</LINK>) although the confidence intervals (CIs) overlap and the difference is very small. A current listing of reviews of analgesics in the single dose postoperative pain model can be found at <A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/index.html">www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/index.html</A>.</P>
<P>When prescribed to treat chronic osteoarthritis pain, rofecoxib was given at a dose of 12.5 mg daily, and increased if necessary to a maximum of 25 mg (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2001</LINK>). All of the studies included in this review of postoperative pain relief administered rofecoxib as a single dose of 50 mg, which is between two and four times the standard daily dose for regular chronic pain treatment. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ehrich-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrich 1999</LINK>) also included 20 participants who received rofecoxib 500 mg: this gave an NNT of 1.5 (1.1 to 2.2), based on extremely limited data. However, rofecoxib 500 mg is an experimental dose being 20 to 40 times the standard daily dose, and was never used in a clinical setting. As this was the only study to use a dose other than 50 mg, a dose-response analysis could not be performed.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that data on use of rescue medication, whether as a proportion of participants requiring it, or the median time to use of it, might be helpful in assessing the usefulness of an analgesic (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005a</LINK>). Data on remedication was inconsistently reported in the trials reviewed, but such analysis as was possible demonstrated that the weighted mean of the median time to use of rescue medication was 13.7 hours and 1.9 hours for rofecoxib 50 mg and placebo respectively for all studies combined, and 16.2 hours and 1.7 hours for dental studies only. This is the same as was found in the earlier review, which included only dental studies. For dental studies only, the weighted mean proportion of participants taking rescue medication within 6 to 8 hours was 20% with rofecoxib 50 mg, and 79% with placebo, giving a NNTp of 1.7 (1.5 to 1.9). This outcome measured at 24 hours was 52% with rofecoxib 50 mg and 87% with placebo, giving a NNTp of 2.8 (2.5 to 3.3).</P>
<P>Rofecoxib compares favourably with commonly used analgesics, such as paracetamol 1000 mg (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>; median time to rescue medication 3.8 hours, NNTp at 4 to 6 hours 5.2), ibuprofen 400 mg (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009b</LINK>; 5.6 hours, NNTp at 6 hours 2.7) and naproxen 500 mg (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009a</LINK>; 8.9 hours, NNTp at 12 hours 6.9), but is shorter than with etoricoxib 120 mg (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2009</LINK>; &gt; 20 hours, NNTp at 24 hours 2.4). In a postoperative setting, where patients may feel nauseated, a longer time before remedication is required, may be of benefit to the patient, and may also reduce time demands on nursing staff. Whether duration of action is a useful outcome by which to compare different analgesics awaits the completion of other reviews to allow examination of a more substantial body of evidence. It has also been suggested that rescue medication data might be useful in distinguishing between different doses of an analgesic (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005a</LINK>), and indeed such differences have been found with ibuprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009b</LINK>). Only one study included in this review used a dose of rofecoxib other than 50 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Ehrich-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrich 1999</LINK>), however, and provided no data on the use of rescue medication.</P>
<P>Reporting of adverse events was more complete in these studies than for many older single dose analgesic studies. Adverse events were collected using various methods such as spontaneous reports, patient diaries or questionnaires, and monitoring of vital signs over different periods of time. This may have included periods after the use of rescue medication, which may have caused its own adverse events. Problems with analysis of reports of adverse events in acute pain trials have been noted before (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK>). The usefulness of single dose studies for assessing adverse events is questionable, but it is non-the-less reassuring that no increase in adverse events was demonstrated with rofecoxib 50 mg relative to placebo. Serious adverse events and adverse event withdrawals were rare, and generally not thought to be related to the test drug. The asthma flare leading to withdrawal reported by <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002</LINK> occurred in a patient randomised to placebo. Long term multiple dose studies should be used for meaningful analysis of adverse events since, even in acute pain settings, analgesics are likely to be used in multiple doses. The difficulty in the postoperative setting is that there are many sequelae of surgery and anaesthesia that manifest as adverse events, such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort, while others, like headache, can be caused by events such as acute caffeine withdrawal over the postoperative period. The main issue is that of rare but serious adverse events, and these are more likely to be found in large observational studies.<BR/>
<BR/>Loss of information from withdrawals or exclusions was small, and is unlikely to have led to an overestimate of efficacy because it is as likely to be related to poor reporting as poor methods. In single dose studies most exclusions occur for protocol violations such as failing to meet baseline pain requirements, or failing to return for post-treatment visits after the acute pain results are concluded (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 1982</LINK>). For missing data it has been shown that over the 4 to 6 hour period, there is no difference between the baseline observation carried forward, which gives the more conservative estimate, and last observation carried forward (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005a</LINK>).</P>

<P>Rofecoxib 50 mg is an effective single dose oral analgesic in acute, moderate to severe, postoperative pain. It provides at least 50% pain relief to over half of participants treated. The NNT of 2.2 for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours compares favourably with other analgesics commonly used for postoperative pain. It also has a long duration of action compared with other analgesics, the median time to remedication for rofecoxib 50 mg being 14 hours. Rofecoxib 50 mg is associated with a low rate of adverse events in single dose, similar to that with placebo. There is a large, high quality data set available for rofecoxib 50 mg in acute postoperative pain, suggesting that these conclusions should be robust.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-07-31 16:11:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no obvious requirement for further research in classical acute pain trials for two reasons. There is already a large body of data providing results unlikely to change with more trials. In addition, the licensed status of rofecoxib in many parts of the world make it unlikely to be used, making new research in the acute pain model unnecessary.</P>

<P>
<B>Editor's note: The anti-inflammatory drug rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from the market at the end of September 2004 after it was shown that long-term use (greater than 18 months) could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke in a study of secondary prevention of adenoma recurrence. Further information is available at www.vioxx.com.</B>
</P>
<P>The authors declare that there is unlikely to be any further studies to be included in this review and so it should be published as a 'stable review'.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Categorical rating scale:</HEADING>
<P>The commonest is the five category scale (none, slight, moderate, good or lots, and complete). For analysis numbers are given to the verbal categories (for pain intensity, none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2 and severe = 3, and for relief none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, good or lots = 3 and complete = 4). Data from different subjects is then combined to produce means (rarely medians) and measures of dispersion (usually standard errors of means). The validity of converting categories into numerical scores was checked by comparison with concurrent visual analogue scale measurements. Good correlation was found, especially between pain relief scales using cross-modality matching techniques. Results are usually reported as continuous data, mean or median pain relief or intensity. Few studies present results as discrete data, giving the number of participants who report a certain level of pain intensity or relief at any given assessment point. The main advantages of the categorical scales are that they are quick and simple. The small number of descriptors may force the scorer to choose a particular category when none describes the pain satisfactorily.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Rescue medication:</HEADING>
<P>Participants who either fail to achieve adequate pain relief, or who have only transient pain relief, require additional analgesic interventions to cover their pain. This is called "rescue medication". From this point, conventionally their pain intensity score returns to its initial value, and pain relief score to zero.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">SPID:</HEADING>
<P>Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) is calculated as the sum of the differences between the pain scores over a period of time. Differences between pain intensity values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the trapezoidal rule.</P>
<P>VAS TOTPAR and VAS SPID are visual analogue versions of TOTPAR and SPID.</P>
<P>See "Measuring pain" in Bandolier's Little Book of Pain, Oxford University Press, Oxford. 2003; pp 7-13 (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">TOTPAR:</HEADING>
<P>Total pain relief (TOTPAR) is calculated as the sum of pain relief scores over a period of time. If a patient had complete pain relief immediately after taking an analgesic, and maintained that level of pain relief for six hours, they would have a six-hour TOTPAR of the maximum of 24. Differences between pain relief values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the composite trapezoidal rule. This is a simple method that approximately calculates the definite integral of the area under the pain relief curve by calculating the sum of the areas of several trapezoids that together closely approximate to the area under the curve.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">VAS:</HEADING>
<P>Visual analogue scale: lines with left end labelled "no relief of pain" and right end labelled "complete relief of pain", seem to overcome this limitation. Patients mark the line at the point which corresponds to their pain. The scores are obtained by measuring the distance between the no relief end and the patient's mark, usually in millimetres. The main advantages of VAS are that they are simple and quick to score, avoid imprecise descriptive terms and provide many points from which to choose. More concentration and coordination are needed, which can be difficult post-operatively or with neurological disorders.</P>
