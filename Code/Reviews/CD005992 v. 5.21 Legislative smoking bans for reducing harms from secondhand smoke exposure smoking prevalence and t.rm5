<TITLE MODIFIED="2010-03-17 10:00:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">Does legislation to ban smoking reduce exposure to secondhand smoke and smoking behaviour?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-01-05 23:09:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the first national legislation banning indoor smoking in all public places was introduced in 2004, there has been an increase in the number of countries, states and regions adopting similar smoke-free legislation banning smoking in public places and work places since this review was first published. The main reason is to protect nonsmokers from the harmful health effects of exposure to secondhand smoke. Another reason is to provide a supportive environment for people who want to quit smoking.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for studies that investigated the effect of introducing a ban on any measures of health, or on smoking behaviour (up to February 2015). Since the previous version of this review had shown clear evidence that introducing legislation to ban smoking in public places does reduce exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) in those places, we did not include studies that only reported exposure to SHS. We included 77 studies from 21 countries in this updated review. Studies of health outcomes typically used data from hospitals to look for changes in rates of admissions, discharges or deaths. Most studies looked at illnesses related to the cardiovascular system (heart or blood vessels), such as heart attacks and strokes. Studies also looked at effects on respiratory health, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g. bronchitis), asthma and lung function. Seven studies looked at the health of newborn children. Eleven studies reported death rates. The best-quality studies collected data at multiple time points before and after the introduction of a ban in order to adjust for existing time trends. Some studies could compare events rates in areas with and without bans, or where bans were introduced at different times.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There is evidence that countries and their populations benefit from improved health after introducing smoking bans, importantly to do with the heart and blood vessels. We found evidence of reduced deaths. The impact of bans on respiratory health, on the health of newborn children, and on reducing the number of smokers and their cigarette use is not as clear, with some studies not detecting any reduction.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Legislative bans have not been evaluated by randomized trials, and the quality of the evidence from the types of studies contributing to this review is lower. Changes in health outcomes could be due to other things, such as change in healthcare practices. However, many of the studies used methods of analysis that could control for underlying trends, and increase our confidence that any changes are caused by the introduction of bans.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-12-09 09:48:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Smoking bans have been implemented in a variety of settings, as well as being part of policy in many jurisdictions to protect the public and employees from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke (SHS). They also offer the potential to influence social norms and the smoking behaviour of those populations they affect. Since the first version of this review in 2010, more countries have introduced national smoking legislation banning indoor smoking.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-12-09 09:48:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of legislative smoking bans on (1) morbidity and mortality from exposure to secondhand smoke, and (2) smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-12-09 09:53:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and reference lists of included studies. We also checked websites of various organisations. Date of most recent search; February 2015.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-12-14 09:33:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered studies that reported legislative smoking bans affecting populations. The minimum standard was having an indoor smoking ban explicitly in the study and a minimum of six months follow-up for measures of smoking behaviour. Our search included a broad range of research designs including: randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies (i.e. non-randomized controlled studies), controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series as defined by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group, and uncontrolled pre- and post-ban data.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-12-09 09:55:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One author extracted characteristics and content of the interventions, participants, outcomes and methods of the included studies and a second author checked the details. We extracted health and smoking behaviour outcomes. We did not attempt a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity in design and content of the studies included. We evaluated the studies using qualitative narrative synthesis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-07 15:14:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Frazer " NOTES="&lt;p&gt;LIndsay I have removed the line of text Professor Kelleher queried. KF &lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-01-07 15:14:01 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Kate Frazer ">
<P>There are 77 studies included in this updated review. We retained 12 studies from the original review and identified 65 new studies. Evidence from 21 countries is provided in this update, an increase of eight countries from the original review. The nature of the intervention precludes randomized controlled trials. Thirty-six studies used an interrupted time series study design, 23 studies use a controlled before-and-after design and 18 studies are before-and-after studies with no control group; six of these studies use a cohort design. Seventy-two studies reported health outcomes, including cardiovascular (44), respiratory (21), and perinatal outcomes (7). Eleven studies reported national mortality rates for smoking-related diseases. A number of the studies report multiple health outcomes. There is consistent evidence of a positive impact of national smoking bans on improving cardiovascular health outcomes, and reducing mortality for associated smoking-related illnesses. Effects on respiratory and perinatal health were less consistent. We found 24 studies evaluating the impact of national smoke-free legislation on smoking behaviour. Evidence of an impact of legislative bans on smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption is inconsistent, with some studies not detecting additional long-term change in existing trends in prevalence.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-12-09 10:00:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the first version of this review was published, the current evidence provides more robust support for the previous conclusions that the introduction of a legislative smoking ban does lead to improved health outcomes through reduction in SHS for countries and their populations. The clearest evidence is observed in reduced admissions for acute coronary syndrome. There is evidence of reduced mortality from smoking-related illnesses at a national level. There is inconsistent evidence of an impact on respiratory and perinatal health outcomes, and on smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-01-06 00:23:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tobacco is the second major cause of mortality in the world, and currently responsible for the death of about one in ten adults worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>). Measures to control the demand for and supply of tobacco products, as well as to protect public health, have been demanded through Article 8 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The epidemic of cigarette smoking is identified as one the greatest public health disasters of the 20th century, with over 20 million attributable deaths (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2014</LINK>). Over the past 50 years of reports by the Surgeon General, international evidence has emerged that smoking affects most organs and that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2014</LINK>). The World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>) estimates that six million people die annually from tobacco-related diseases; 600,000 from the effects of secondhand smoke exposure.</P>
<P>Secondhand smoke, also known as environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) or passive smoke, is the combination of side-stream smoke, i.e. smoke that is emitted between puffs of burning tobacco (cigarettes, pipes or cigars), and mainstream smoke, i.e. smoke that is exhaled by the smoker (<LINK REF="REF-NCI-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI 1999</LINK>). Secondhand smoke is a complex mixture of thousands of gases and particulate matter emitted by the combustion of tobacco products and from smoke exhaled by those smoking (<LINK REF="REF-NRC-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">NRC 1986</LINK>). Secondhand smoke was declared to be carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (<LINK REF="REF-IARC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IARC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IARC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Negative health effects associated with exposure to SHS have been well documented and include major conditions such as lung cancer, as well as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and asthma, and other significant health outcomes such as eye and nasal irritation and low birth weight in babies of nonsmokers (<LINK REF="REF-Allwright-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allwright 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hackshaw-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackshaw 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCI-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI 1999</LINK>; ANHMRC 1997; <LINK REF="REF-SCOTH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">SCOTH 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IARC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>There has been an increase in the number of countries introducing comprehensive national indoor smoking policies banning smoking in indoor public places and work places since 2005 and the number of research papers has risen exponentially since this review was first published (<LINK REF="REF-Callinan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callinan 2010</LINK>). The primary outcome is to protect nonsmokers from the harmful health effects of exposure to secondhand smoke and additionally to provide a supportive environment for people who want to quit smoking.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-12-14 10:07:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The efforts of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control to reduce tobacco consumption worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>) include a demand for smoke-free legislation, and the MPOWER provisions include protecting people from tobacco use (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>). Legislating for smoke-free environments is a fundamental component of these actions.</P>
<P>Introducing national smoking legislation is a public policy issue. The underpinning decision-making process is multifactorial, including epidemiological evidence of the toxicity of smoke and the associated link to a pathological endpoint, international policy evidence of acceptability and compliance and evidence of improved health outcomes. Legislative smoking bans vary in their comprehensiveness in different settings, i.e. the extent to which they allow smoking or restrict it to designated areas and where those smoking restrictions occur. Legislation prohibiting smoking indoors, including in bars and restaurants, we classify in this review as a comprehensive smoking ban, even though exemptions may occur in different settings, e.g. psychiatric units, prisons, and residential homes, including nursing homes. Less comprehensive smoking bans, such as those which allow smoking in designated rooms or areas, we classify in this review as partial bans. The primary outcome is to protect nonsmokers from the harmful health effects of exposure to secondhand smoke, and additionally to provide a supportive environment for people who want to quit smoking. Evidence from the previous review identified the impact of national smoking bans on improved respiratory and sensory symptoms, improved lung function, reduced tobacco consumption and reduced SHS exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Callinan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callinan 2010</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-12-14 10:09:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One potential outcome of smoking bans and restrictions is to reduce or eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers to the dangers of SHS. Another is to reduce tobacco consumption among smokers in specified areas including work places or general public places. While SHS in the work place increases the risk of lung cancer among nonsmokers, the elevation in risk is modest in comparison with the risk of active smoking. International evidence is emphatic, that smoking is responsible for increased mortality for smokers, and for nonsmokers through SHS exposure (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>). Ethical questions also arise in relation to individual civil liberty, and policy makers prefer not to interfere with such rights for those who smoke, except for minors. It is the harmful effect of passive smoking in nonsmokers that justifies the policy action, especially for workers. This means that the endpoint is often more likely to be an exposure measure to passive smoke than either active smoking rates or a health gain of reduced smoking-related morbidity or mortality. Evidence from this review previously demonstrated that a smoking ban does lead to a reduction in exposure to passive smoking, specifically for the population employed in the hospitality sector. It also reported evidence of improved health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Callinan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callinan 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-01-06 11:54:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>This is a major public health issue affecting an estimated billion active smokers worldwide and the larger population of nonsmokers. The impact of introducing smoking legislation is to cut exposure to passive smoke. For every person who dies as a result of smoking, it is estimated that 30 or more people will live with smoking-related illnesses (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2014</LINK>). Banning smoking is a public policy issue. The decision-making process underpinning it is ultimately a political action which rests on a combination of evidence sources, including:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Mechanistic evidence of toxicity of smoke</LI>
<LI>Epidemiological evidence that either smoking or SHS is linked to a pathological endpoint</LI>
<LI>Policy evidence that imposing a restriction will be socially acceptable and achieve high compliance</LI>
<LI>Action research evidence that it can be successfully implemented.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Bans and policies can be implemented through public health policies or legislation affecting populations at a national, state or community level.</P>
<P>In setting the parameters for the original review, we adopted a strict methodological approach in keeping with the Cochrane process but with consideration for the nature of health promotion interventions in setting those parameters. Evaluation of health promotion interventions continues to generate debate in the scientific literature. <LINK REF="REF-Davey-Smith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey Smith 2000</LINK> argues that the randomized control trial is the standard for assessing health promotion interventions. Opponents of this view (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green--2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2015</LINK>) acknowledge that rigorous evaluation of studies is important, but that randomized controlled trials may not be the best approach given the complexities, processes and scope of health promotion programmes.</P>
<P>During the intervening period since this review was first published, there have been sustained developments to reduce exposure to tobacco and reduce consumption, with more countries signing up to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and enacting national smoke-free legislation. There have been extensions of smoking bans to reduce exempted population groups. This has resulted in fewer partial smoking bans and more inclusive comprehensive bans in a wider range of settings. The evidence of health outcomes on reduced exposure, morbidity and mortality arising from the enactment of smoking bans can take time to emerge. In this review we include robust studies strengthening this evidence base and its impact at a population level.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2015-12-14 10:25:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>Primary objective:</I>
</P>
<P>Measures of health outcomes including any measure of morbidity or mortality, e.g. cardiac admissions, respiratory health, and pulmonary function. In studies with longer follow-up, measures of the incidence of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease may also be available. If health outcomes were reported for population subgroups defined by smoking status or by levels of or changes in SHS exposure, we extracted data for these subgroups.</P>
<P>
<I>Secondary objective:</I>
</P>
<P>Measures of smoking behaviour including prevalence of tobacco use, tobacco consumption, cessation rates. For these outcomes we required data from large population-based studies. We also required baseline data (pre-legislation) and a follow-up period of a minimum of six months after introduction of a ban, to assess a sustained impact.</P>
<P>For this update, we have not included studies only reporting the impact of smoking bans on passive smoke exposure using self-reported data or only measuring cotinine. An impact of bans on passive smoke exposure and a reduction in cotinine measures following reduced exposure was unequivocal from the first version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Callinan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callinan 2010</LINK>). We now require measured health outcomes data for studies reporting passive smoke exposure.</P>
<P>We required biochemical verification of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke over self-reported perceptions. In order to assess sustained impact, we included studies which reported outcomes such as smoking behaviour at least six months after the start of the smoking ban. In the first version of the review, we excluded studies which reported environmental measures of air quality (e.g. particulate matter (PM&#8322;.&#8325;), respirable particles (RSP), vapour phase nicotine) as their sole measure of exposure to SHS, and we do not include these studies in this update.</P>
<P>Where possible, we stratified smoking behavioural outcomes by age, gender and socioeconomic status.</P>

<P>For this update, JC prescreened titles and abstracts between 2009 and 2012. One author (KF) prescreened titles and abstracts (2009 to 2015) to identify studies that may be relevant or useful. Three authors (JC, AC, KD) independently screened the reduced number of titles and abstracts to assess relevance for inclusion. KF obtained the full text of potentially relevant studies. Two authors (KF, CK) independently assessed the papers to see if they met the inclusion criteria. No discrepancies emerged. At this time, we limited studies reporting passive exposure to include those also reporting specific health outcome measures. We noted all decisions. One author (KF) independently extracted the data for the individual studies, and a second author (SvB) checked the results.</P>
<P>Two authors (KF, JMcH) independently reviewed studies reporting active smoking measures. We held discussions with a third independent author (CK) and made a decision to limit active smoking studies to those reporting outcomes from a population level.</P>

<P>The settings in this update vary considerably from the original review. For this update we identified studies reporting the impact of national smoking bans in the following settings:</P>
<UL>
<LI>42 studies used hospital registers for admissions or discharge data on specific population cohorts</LI>
<LI>20 studies used registries for national health outcomes, death rates, pregnancy and perinatal health</LI>

<LI>4 studies are work place-based, reporting primarily passive exposure and measured health outcomes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We found 43 studies which reported smoking data either as a primary outcome, a descriptive variable reporting national prevalence without comparing rates before or after smoking legislation, or used as a covariate in analysis.

<P>In this update, we exclude uncontrolled before-and-after studies reporting unverified health outcomes or those which only reported cotinine biomarkers and no other additional health outcome data, as the focus for this update is on including studies reporting reduced passive exposure that also measured health outcomes. The evidence from the first version clearly established that reduced passive smoke exposure results in reduced cotinine measures. We exclude from this update studies reporting the impact of smoking bans on smoking prevalence, tobacco cessation or quit rates which are not representative population-level measures.

<P>We made explicit judgements of bias according to the criteria in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (Cochrane Handbook, <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We provide a summary of the assessments in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. The study designs used in this review for evaluating a policy-level health promotion outcome do not fulfil the criteria used to confirm a low risk of bias, and as such we consider the evidence to be at high risk of bias for many of the studies included. However, we acknowledge that the majority of study designs included in this update used data from large hospital and national data registries, and for 23 studies include a control reference area.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sequence generation and allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>The non-randomized studies used in this review did not facilitate random sequence generation, allocation concealment or blinding of participants, as smoking is a visible and active process. A number of studies used large representative population surveys which employed stratified or random sampling nationally (<LINK REF="STD-Bajoga-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bajoga 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Federico-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Federico 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gualano-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gualano 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lippert-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lippert 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackay-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mackay 2011</LINK>). Volunteer samples were reported in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Durham-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Durham 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goodman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rajkumar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Rajkumar 2014</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>It was not possible to blind participants in the studies included in this review, as the intervention was a national public policy and smoking is visible. The use of large data sets also negated blinding. However the large data sets obtained from hospitals used the Internation Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding to confirm principal diagnoses. Studies reporting mortality data similarly used data sets from large national registries.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>A number of studies did not report total sample sizes. <LINK REF="STD-Durham-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Durham 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 2008</LINK> reported high attrition rates, with consequent reporting bias for outcomes. Two studies reported the use of imputed scores (<LINK REF="STD-Aguero-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Aguero 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2014</LINK> reported that records were excluded from the data set when smoking status or other key descriptive variables including gestational age or data on duration of pregnancy were missing. This led to the exclusion of 6.3% of cases, amounting to over 30,000 records.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selective reporting</HEADING>
<P>Within this review a large number of studies used existing data sets, and individual-level data were not available. Whilst the outcomes associated were reported, the data sets were pre-existing and may have given rise to bias associated with misclassification of data, i.e. residual confounding. Prevalence studies used different data sets for each survey and this can introduce bias when combining data (<LINK REF="STD-Bajoga-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bajoga 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Federico-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Federico 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallus-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gallus 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gualano-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gualano 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lippert-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lippert 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackay-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mackay 2011</LINK>). There is a reliance on self-reported, unverified smoking status in studies included in this update. Verified smoking status (confirming either smoker or nonsmoker status) was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Goodman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pell 2009</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Pell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pell 2009</LINK> primarily analysed data for nonsmoker outcomes, but provided a comparison for current smokers, with limited data reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other bias</HEADING>
<P>Other bias identified in the included studies is the lack of adjusting for confounders, as data were not available within the accessed data sets. Smoking status was self-reported for the majority of studies covering active and passive smoke exposure. <LINK REF="STD-Cesaroni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cesaroni 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cox-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferrante-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrante 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Head-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Head 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jan 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kabir-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kabir 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mackay 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naiman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Naiman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stallings_x002d_Smith-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stallings-Smith 2013</LINK> report smoking prevalence data from other data or from national surveys, and not from their main data sources. A number of these studies only provided a single smoking prevalence result, and we have not included this information in further statistical analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Head-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Head 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kabir-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kabir 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mackay 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naiman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Naiman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stallings_x002d_Smith-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stallings-Smith 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kabir-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kabir 2013</LINK> included maternal smoking prevalence data for analyses reported from an earlier paper (<LINK REF="STD-Kabir-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kabir 2009</LINK>). Verified smoking status was measured in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goodman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pell 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of the studies using data from large hospital or population registries did not provide information on individual smoking status or other individual confounders. However, these data sets used statistical modelling (both linear and non-linear) and adjustments to account for confounding of included variables. A number of studies adjusted for air quality, pollution, influenza rates and seasonality, using national data sets in an effort to reduce confounding and influence on health outcomes.</P>
<P>Other factors that could have led to bias include: changed prescribing practices for statins during the period of data collection (<LINK REF="STD-Cesaroni-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cesaroni 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2014</LINK>); legislation banning trans-fatty acids in foods, resulting in dietary changes which could influence cardiovascular outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2014</LINK>). Legislative changes during the period of data collection, including an increase in the price of cigarettes, was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Federico-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Federico 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jan 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2014</LINK>. This may have influenced their study outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Bharadwaj-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bharadwaj 2012</LINK> reported changed occupational status for pregnant women during the period of the study, and this was identified as a factor which reduced the power of the study. <LINK REF="STD-Page-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Page 2012</LINK> reported significant differences in demographic data between the control area and the intervention area at baseline, and the influence of this on their outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 2008</LINK> reported that the study was predominantly in women, as only 30% of the study participants were men. <LINK REF="STD-Schmucker-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Schmucker 2014</LINK> included ex-smokers in the group of nonsmokers, due to a small sample size of less than 6%, and inconsistent documentation. <LINK REF="STD-Di-Valentino-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Di Valentino 2015</LINK> detected a significant reduction in the control area which did not have a ban in place. Other new legislation, including laws banning advertising and sales of cigarettes to minors, may have influenced these outcomes.</P>

While they noted a dose effect, the authors suggest a biological plausibility, as the results were not transient and the reduction in STEMI admissions in the older age group may include more nonsmokers. Smoking status was not recorded in this study. While the authors observed reductions in men aged 65 years or older in the control canton area (no ban), they did not observe reductions in older women.

<LINK REF="STD-Amaral-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Amaral 2009</LINK> noted that local ordinances were associated with a decrease in very low and low birth weights and an increased gestation period of 0.03 days. A dose-response effect for a more restrictive statewide smoking ban resulted in an increased gestation period for white and higher-educated mothers, and a significant decrease in very low birth weights. For Hispanic mothers in this study, there was a reduction in birth weights of 7.2 grams following the introduction of statewide bans. This is an inverse dose-response effect; the authors suggest the implementation of more restrictive work place smoking bans may have led to increased smoking in the home or greater exposure to secondhand smoke in the home.</P>

Prescribing of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was significantly higher prior to the legislation, with increased quit attempts. Similarly, the associations were not sustained in the post-legislation period. <LINK REF="STD-Lemstra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lemstra 2008</LINK> detected reduced smoking and increased quit attempts in Saskatoon after the smoking ban was introduced.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-01-06 00:09:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Legislation restricting or prohibiting smoking in work places and public places is a public health measure at the population level. There were no randomized controlled trials where the intervention was a smoking ban. The predominant study designs evaluating the effectiveness of smoking bans were interrupted time series studies, quasi-experimental before-and-after studies with a control area for comparison, and before-and-after studies with no control area for reference. Three studies used matched areas for comparison of controls (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khuder-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khuder 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Seo 2007</LINK>). While the before-and-after studies with no controls were often unable to control for possible confounders and changes in secular trends over time, the interrupted time series studies used statistical modelling in an attempt to adjust for these effects in analyses. However, because of uncertainty about the underlying trends, some study authors noted that their results were sensitive to the choice of model.</P>
<P>The evidence supports a temporal association between the introduction of national smoke-free bans and subsequent reductions in smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Evidence for smoking bans in improving cardiovascular, respiratory and perinatal health outcomes for both smokers and nonsmokers is persuasive. The evidence in this update identified a dose-response association, with sustained and improved health outcomes over time, specifically cardiovascular. As the period since bans were enacted has lengthened, improvements in health outcomes have increased or have been maintained. Evidence in this review identified improved health outcomes for nonsmokers in relation to cardiovascular and asthma health outcomes and to reduced mortality rates. Evidence of a biologically plausible effect emerged in studies examining STEMI admissions. <LINK REF="STD-Schmucker-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Schmucker 2014</LINK> detected reduced STEMI rates for nonsmokers compared to smokers, with identified divergent trends in the incidence of disease observed. <LINK REF="STD-Di-Valentino-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Di Valentino 2015</LINK> also suggests a biological plausibility, with reduced STEMI admissions in those aged 65 or older; however, smoking status was not reported in this study.</P>
<P>Perinatal outcomes provide evidence of reduced maternal smoking and acknowledged impact on foetal health. Inconsistent evidence emerged for other outcomes, including birth weights. The benefits identified in some studies are consistent with those reported in <LINK REF="REF-Been-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Been 2014</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Kelleher-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelleher 2014</LINK>; however, the studies in this review do not provide compelling evidence of a clear association between smoke-free legislation and improved perinatal outcomes; we need more evidence to confirm or refute such associations.</P>
<P>Consistent evidence of reduced mortality is reported, with an observed temporal dose-response effect. Statistically significant reductions and downward trends were noted for cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. Evidence of a reduction in mortality in lower socioeconomic groups is persuasive, especially in <LINK REF="REF-Stallings_x002d_Smith-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stallings-Smith 2014</LINK>, given the duration of the study period (81 months).</P>
<P>As in the previous version of this review, inconsistent evidence emerged of the impact of smoking bans on reducing smoking prevalence rates and tobacco consumption.</P>
<P>The studies in this review are heterogeneous in their design, populations and interventions, and we were unable to perform statistical comparisons or meta-analyses. Despite the different study designs, this update provides more methodologically robust studies than those reported in the first version, incorporating large data sets facilitating modelling and regression analyses and adjusting for non-linear trends and confounders. The majority of studies have evaluated comprehensive smoking bans; only 18 studies investigated partial bans. Significant improvements in health outcomes were reported in countries where comprehensive bans were in place and compared to areas with either no ban or partial bans. Since the first version of this review (2010), there has been an increase in countries worldwide implementing national smoke-free bans. The FCTC (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014</LINK>) identified an 84% increase in countries implementing smoking policies, and a 61% increase in countries implementing complete smoking bans.</P>
<P>The 2008 MPOWER evidence-based measures include protection from tobacco smoke to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>). The results from the original review indicated that introducing legislative smoking bans leads to a reduction in exposure to passive smoke. Key population groups benefiting from the enactment of legislative smoking bans reported in this review include pregnant women and their babies, children and nonsmokers. There is also evidence of improved cardiovascular outcomes for smokers in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruintjes-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bruintjes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cronin-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cronin 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pell 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Socioeconomic gradients indicate that men in lower socioeconomic groups are benefiting from the effect of smoke-free legislation. In the original version of the review, the evidence of the impact for active smoking was unclear but indicated a downward trend. The studies included in this update provide some evidence of reductions in smoking prevalence. However, a number of studies did not detect evidence of a change in prevalence, or change in rate of decline in prevalence, associated with the introduction of bans, irrespective of the population studies. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bharadwaj-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bharadwaj 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kabir-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kabir 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackay-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mackay 2012</LINK>) identified declining smoking rates in pregnant women, but this was not borne out for all studies.</P>
<P>Limitations in studies included in this review are the absence of randomised trials. The inevitable reliance on observational data means that we can only identify correlations between the introduction of smoking restrictions, and the health and behavioural outcomes of interest. The studies using national population surveys employed random sampling or stratified sampling techniques. The data sets used in many studies were relatively large and allowed for statistical modelling and adjustment for possible confounders. Small sample sizes are reported in a number of the studies which used volunteer samples recruited within the hospitality sector. A number of studies did not report sample sizes, and individual-level data were not available within large registry data sets, which limited analyses for confounders, e.g. smoking status and comorbidities. Other confounders included increased pricing of cigarettes during study periods, removal of trans-fatty acids in foods, and suspension of bans. These and other factors may have led to changes in health outcomes over the study periods which could not be controlled for in analyses. These may have influenced the reported results. It is possible that some studies that did not detect changes in health outcomes have not been published and are unavailable for inclusion in this review. However, this update includes some studies that did not identify a positive impact of smoking bans. We excluded from this review studies reporting only cotinine biomarkers; studies reporting passive smoke exposure had to include a measured health outcome. This provided a wider body of literature, but there are few studies which verified smoker status. Smoker status was reported in 24 studies in this review, and verified in only four.</P>
<P>From a public health perspective the impact of smoking legislation is to reduce passive smoke exposure and to reduce active smoking. Since first publication of this review in 2010, the evidence is mounting and the concentration of studies clearly identifies reduced passive smoke exposure with associated reductions in morbidity and mortality post-smoking bans. Smoking policies usually comprise multicomponent efforts to tackle smoking cessation as well as the public health objective of reducing exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Populations exposed to smoking restrictions are likely to be exposed to other interventions. The implementation of comprehensive legislation on smoking will necessitate other tobacco control measures to prepare for its successful implementation, such as increased media awareness, telephone smoking cessation helplines, and smoking cessation support services to ensure awareness, comprehension and support for those affected by it (<LINK REF="REF-Callinan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callinan 2010</LINK>). The effectiveness of legislative efforts will also depend on successful enforcement of smoking bans and compliance with the legislation. Other tobacco control measures, such as taxation on tobacco products, limits on advertising and sponsorship, and limits on the sale of tobacco products, may vary between jurisdictions. A comprehensive approach to tobacco control will utilize both individual and population-based intervention strategies, causing difficulties in evaluating the effect of a single intervention such as the smoking ban legislation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-01-05 23:30:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review identified moderate-quality evidence that countries and their populations benefit from enacting national legislative smoking bans with improved health outcomes from reduced exposures to passive smoke, specifically cardiovascular disease. There was also low-quality evidence of reduced mortality for smoking-related illnesses. The evidence on perinatal and respiratory health outcomes is not consistent, nor is the evidence on potential reductions in tobacco consumption.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-01-05 23:30:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We need research on the continued longer-term impact of smoking bans on the health outcomes of specific subgroups of the population, such as young children, disadvantaged and minority groups. More robust research on the impact of smoking bans is warranted, especially in relation to respiratory and perinatal health outcomes. Documenting of active smoking in studies should be more consistent and should use validation methods. Documentation of ex-smokers should include information on previous smoking history and duration of quit times. Robust study designs (including those with a control for comparison) reporting passive smoke exposures and health-related outcomes need to include biological coherence criteria.</P>

<P>Results: 21.8% and 27.4% of Hong Kong daily smokers aged 15 years or older were considered hardcore in 2005 and 2008 respectively. The prevalence of hardcore smokers increased from 23.8% to 29.4% in men and from 10.6% to 16.3% in women, and also increased in all the 5 age groups from 2005 to 2008. The hardcore smoking prevalence increased with age, reaching the highest in the 50 - 59-year age group, and then dropped in the 60+ age group in both cohorts</P>
