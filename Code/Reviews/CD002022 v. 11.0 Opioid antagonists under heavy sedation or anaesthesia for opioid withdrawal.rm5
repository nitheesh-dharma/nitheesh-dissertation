<TITLE>The potential risks and high cost of using opioid blocking drugs during heavy sedation or anaesthesia to bring on withdrawal outweigh the benefits</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-31 03:36:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>Drugs that block opioids are sometimes given to opioid dependent people while they are under heavy sedation or anaesthesia to speed up withdrawal. The review of trials shows that this sort of withdrawal treatment is quicker than withdrawal managed with reducing doses of methadone or clonidine plus symptomatic medications. The intensity of withdrawal experienced with anaesthesia-based approaches is similar to that experienced with approaches using only minimal sedation, but there is a significantly increased risk of serious adverse events with anaesthesia-assisted approaches. The lack of additional benefit, and increased risk of harm, suggest that this form of treatment should not be pursued.</P>

<P>Nine studies (eight randomised controlled trials) involving 1109 participants met the inclusion criteria for the review.</P>
<P>Antagonist-induced withdrawal is more intense but less prolonged than withdrawal managed with reducing doses of methadone, and doses of naltrexone sufficient for blockade of opioid effects can be established significantly more quickly with antagonist-induced withdrawal than withdrawal managed with clonidine and symptomatic medications. The level of sedation does not affect the intensity and duration of withdrawal, although the duration of anaesthesia may influence withdrawal severity. There is a significantly greater risk of adverse events with heavy, compared to light, sedation (RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.13 to 9.12, <I>P</I> = 0.03) and probably with this approach compared to other forms of detoxification.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Heavy sedation compared to light sedation does not confer additional benefits in terms of less severe withdrawal or increased rates of commencement on naltrexone maintenance treatment. Given that the adverse events are potentially life-threatening, the value of antagonist-induced withdrawal under heavy sedation or anaesthesia is not supported. The high cost of anaesthesia-based approaches, both in monetary terms and use of scarce intensive care resources, suggest that this form of treatment should not be pursued.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-05 09:25:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-10-05 09:25:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The signs and symptoms of the opioid withdrawal syndrome include irritability, anxiety, apprehension, muscular and abdominal pains, chills, nausea, diarrhoea, yawning, lacrimation, sweating, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, general weakness and insomnia. Symptoms of the opioid withdrawal syndrome usually begin two to three half-lives after the last opioid use, i.e. 6 to 12 hours for short half-life opioids such as heroin and morphine, and 36 to 48 hours for long half-life opioids such as methadone. Following cessation of a short half-life opioid, symptoms reach peak intensity within two to four days, with most of the obvious physical withdrawal signs no longer observable after seven to 14 days (<LINK REF="REF-Jaffe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaffe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>). The opioid withdrawal syndrome is rarely life-threatening (<LINK REF="REF-Jaffe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaffe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>) or associated with significant aberrations of mental state (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>). However, completion of withdrawal is difficult for most people (<LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first, or acute, phase of withdrawal is followed by a period of six months or so of a secondary or protracted withdrawal syndrome. This protracted syndrome is characterised by a general feeling of reduced well-being which is reflected in measurable abnormal physiological functioning. During this period, strong cravings for opioids may be experienced periodically. The malaise associated with protracted abstinence is thought to be a major factor in relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Satel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satel 1993</LINK>). The protracted nature of withdrawal makes the period of recovery from dependence typically lengthy and influenced by a range of factors, both social and treatment related. The types of intervention offered following the acute phase of withdrawal to promote recovery and prevent relapse are substantially different to those offered in the management of acute withdrawal and may include psychological and lifestyle counselling, support groups, and pharmacological and medical treatment. This long-term aspect of treatment of opioid dependence was excluded from this review because of its substantially different nature.</P>
<P>This review is one of a series of Cochrane reviews relating to the management of opioid withdrawal. Other reviews consider the use of opioid antagonists with minimal sedation (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2009b</LINK>); alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2009</LINK>); buprenorphine (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2009a</LINK>); reducing doses of methadone (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2005</LINK>); inpatient versus other settings (<LINK REF="REF-Day-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 2005</LINK>), and psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for opoid detoxification (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-07-31 03:45:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>For many years routine procedures involved suppression of withdrawal with methadone and gradual reduction of the methadone dose (<LINK REF="REF-Kleber-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleber 1982</LINK>). This approach derived from observations that the withdrawal syndrome from methadone was milder, although of longer duration, than that from morphine. Methadone's high oral bioavailability, efficacy and long duration of withdrawal relief (24 to 36 hours) were additional factors that have contributed to it being the main medication used in specialist withdrawal programs for most of the past three decades.</P>
<P>Ambivalence to the use of a drug of dependence to treat opioid dependence, government restrictions on the prescription of methadone, and consumer dislike of the protracted nature of methadone withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>) have, to some extent, limited the use of methadone in this way. Discovery of the capacity of the alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist, clonidine, to ameliorate some signs and symptoms of withdrawal led to widespread use of this drug as a non-opioid alternative for managing withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1988</LINK>). However, the use of clonidine has been hampered by side effects of sedation and hypotension. Alternative pharmacotherapies that have been explored recently for the management of opioid withdrawal include lofexidine, an analogue of clonidine that has less effect on blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2009</LINK>) and buprenorphine (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2009a</LINK>)</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-17 03:10:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>The rationale underlying antagonist-induced withdrawal is that a more rapid transition from dependence to abstinence might increase rates of completion of withdrawal. Initial experiments with the use of opioid antagonists to induce withdrawal date back to the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Bearn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bearn 1999</LINK>). While initial studies showed that the objective signs of withdrawal reduce rapidly with successive injections of naloxone (the only opioid antagonist available at that time), there was little further interest in the approach until clonidine became available. It seems likely that the use of antagonists alone was limited by poor acceptability to opioid users. Experience with the capacity of clonidine to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal led to studies to investigate clonidine (and subsequently other alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists as well as other medications) in combination with opioid antagonists to manage opioid withdrawal.</P>
<P>The approach that is the focus of this review is the use of opioid antagonists (naloxone, naltrexone or nalmefene) to induce withdrawal with concomitant heavy sedation or anaesthesia that is intended to both reduce the severity of some withdrawal symptoms and reduce the subjective experience of acute signs and symptoms of withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Bearn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bearn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brewer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1997</LINK>). The approach of administering opioid antagonists to induce withdrawal, in combination with medication to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms but with minimal sedation, is the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2009b</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-07-31 03:51:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>Dependence on opioid drugs is a major health and social issue in most societies. Although the prevalence of opioid use is low - the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (<LINK REF="REF-World-Drug-Report-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Drug Report 2007</LINK>) estimates that 0.4% of the global population abuses opioid drugs - the burden of disease is substantial. The burden to the individual user and the community of opioid dependence arises from mortality (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1997</LINK>), which is most marked in the 15 to 34 year age group (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1998</LINK>), transmission of HIV and hepatitis C, health care costs, crime and law enforcement costs as well as the less tangible costs of family disruption and lost productivity (<LINK REF="REF-Mark-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mark 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment is central to the reduction of the harms incurred by individuals and the community from opioid dependence. Managed withdrawal, or detoxification, by itself is not an effective treatment for dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Lipton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipton 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mattick-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 1996</LINK>). Rates of completion of withdrawal tend to be low, and rates of relapse to opioid use following detoxification are high (<LINK REF="REF-Broers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broers 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaillant-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaillant 1988</LINK>), but withdrawal remains a required first step for many forms of longer-term treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kleber-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleber 1982</LINK>). It may also represent the end point of an extensive period of substitution treatment such as methadone maintenance. As such, the availability of managed withdrawal is essential to an effective and comprehensive treatment system.</P>
<P>There has been considerable controversy surrounding the administration of opioid antagonists under anaesthesia or heavy sedation for the purposes of inducing opioid withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Dyer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayor 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1997</LINK>). The controversy relates in part to the commercialisation of the technique without its efficacy having been accepted as proven according to standard scientific conventions. However, controversy regarding the technique also relates to the exposure of patients to potentially life-threatening risks that are not normally associated with opioid withdrawal, including aspiration pneumonia and seizures. Because of this controversy, attention is given in this review to adverse events that could potentially compromise patient safety. These adverse events comprise aspects of withdrawal that place the patient at risk of harm, particularly vomiting during sedation, as well as incidents that are not typically part of the opioid withdrawal syndrome.</P>
<P>There is a complex range of variables that can potentially influence the course and subjective severity (or intensity) of withdrawal, including the type of opioid used, dose taken, duration of use, general physical health, and psychological factors, such as the reasons for undertaking withdrawal and fear of withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preston-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preston 1985</LINK>). Outcomes of a withdrawal episode may also be influenced by a prior period of maintenance treatment, since such treatment is likely to result in a degree of stabilisation in health and social functioning that may facilitate successful withdrawal. Where information is available, the influence of these variables is considered.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the administration of opioid antagonists to induce opioid withdrawal with concomitant heavy sedation or anaesthesia, relative to other approaches to detoxification (reducing doses of methadone, adrenergic agonists, buprenorphine, antagonist-induced withdrawal with minimal sedation, symptomatic medications) or placebo, or with comparison of different regimes of antagonist-induced withdrawal under heavy sedation or anaesthesia. Outcomes include the intensity and duration of withdrawal signs and symptoms, duration of withdrawal treatment, completion of treatment, and occurrence of adverse events.</P>

<P>Experimental interventions involved the administration of an opioid antagonist (naloxone, naltrexone, nalmefene), with the aim of inducing withdrawal, in conjunction with heavy sedation or anaesthesia.</P>
<P>Sedation is distinguished from anaesthesia by the patient continuing to be able to be roused. In addition, the pharmacological agent used to induce sedation will generally differ from anaesthetising agents. To be considered for inclusion, interventions were required to use a level of sedation that substantially limits the patient's awareness and memory of withdrawal. Interventions where light sedation is administered as an aid to sleep or to reduce anxiety, as adjuncts to treatment, were excluded. Interventions involving the use of opioid antagonists with minimal sedation are reviewed separately (<LINK REF="REF-Gowing-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowing 2009b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Comparison interventions involved the use of reducing doses of methadone, an alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonist, buprenorphine, symptomatic medications, opioid antagonists with minimal sedation, or placebo to manage withdrawal, or a different regime of antagonist-induced withdrawal with concomitant heavy sedation or anaesthesia. For the purpose of this review, symptomatic medications are defined as benzodiazepines, anti-emetics, anti-diarrhoeals, anti-psychotics, anti-spasmodic, muscle relaxants or non-opioid analgesics, administered in combination as needed, or according to a defined regime.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-07-31 04:42:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>In this version of the review, the approach to assessing methodological quality of included studies has been changed in line with the approach recommended in the Cochrane Handbook 2008, the requirements of RevMan 5, and criteria developed by the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Review Group for the assessment of prospective observational studies (<LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane Reviews is based on the evaluation of six specific methodological domains (namely, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and "other issues"). For each study the six domains are analysed, described as reported in the study and a final judgement on the likelihood of bias is provided. This is achieved by answering a pre-specified question about the adequacy of the study in relation to each domain, such that a judgement of "yes" indicated low risk of bias, "no" indicates high risk of bias, and "unclear" indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias. To make these judgements we used the criteria indicated by the <LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook 2008</LINK>, as adapted by the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group for applicability to the addiction field and incorporating criteria for observational studies.</P>
<P>We considered blinding separately for subjective and objective outcomes. Lack of blinding is a source of serious risk of bias for subjective outcomes, but is less significant with objective outcomes, such as completion of treatment and duration of treatment. Incomplete outcome data is considered only for intensity of withdrawal and nature and incidence of adverse effects. Retention in treatment (duration of treatment) and completion of treatment are frequently primary outcome measures in addiction research. </P>

<P>Where all arms in a multi-arm trial were to be included in the meta-analysis, and one treatment arm was to be included in more than one of the treatment comparisons, we used subcategories to allow presentation of information from each arm of the trial.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-08-17 03:14:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>Statistical analyses were undertaken using Review Manager 5.0.15. For dichotomous data (eg. number completing treatment), we calculated risk ratios, and for continuous data (eg. withdrawal scores), we calculated standardised mean differences. Where significant statistical heterogeneity was detected (based on the Chi square statistic and associated P-value), we applied a random-effects model. This review included eight randomised controlled trials and one quasi-randomised study. The calculation of overall effects was suppressed where it would have involved combination of results from the cohort study and randomised controlled trials as the differing level of risk associated with quasi-randomised studies raises questions about the validity of calculating overall effects in this way.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2009-07-31 04:50:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>This review also aimed to consider the following potential sources of heterogeneity through subgroup analyses: (1) drug of dependence and severity of dependence (as indicated by duration and level of use), (2) poly-drug use, (3) concurrent physical and psychiatric illness, (4) precipitants to the withdrawal episode, (5) the nature of the treatment setting and (6) the nature of adjunct treatment, including other medications to manage symptoms. Insufficient studies met the inclusion criteria to support such analyses.</P>

<P>Methodological quality was not used as a criterion for inclusion in the review. We had intended to judge the impact of methodological quality through sensitivity analysis. This would have involved considering the overall estimate of effect with studies with a high risk of bias included or excluded, but there were insufficient studies judged to have low or uncertain risk of bias for such analyses to be undertaken.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Treatment regimes</HEADING>
<P>The dose and type of opioid antagonist used to induce withdrawal in the studies included in this review varied. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-de-Jong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">de Jong 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Favrat-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Favrat 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krabbe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Krabbe 2003</LINK>) used naltrexone; two (<LINK REF="STD-Kienbaum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kienbaum 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 2002</LINK>) used naloxone; three (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jovaisa-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jovaisa 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seoane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seoane 1997</LINK>) used both naloxone and naltrexone; and one (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK>) used nalmefene followed by naltrexone.</P>
<P>In seven studies anaesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol, although <LINK REF="STD-Seoane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seoane 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK> also used midazolam. <LINK REF="STD-Jovaisa-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jovaisa 2006</LINK> used isoflurane, and <LINK REF="STD-Kienbaum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kienbaum 2000</LINK> compared propofol and methohexital as anaesthetic agents in the context of antagonist-induced withdrawal. The duration of anaesthesia was at least three hours in all studies.</P>
<P>All nine studies reported using a range of adjunct medications.</P>
<P>The diversity of treatment regimes is a reflection of the general area of antagonist-induced withdrawal, with different clinical and research teams developing different approaches based on clinical experience and knowledge of the pathophysiology of dependence and withdrawal. Regimes of antagonist-induced withdrawal, with concomitant heavy sedation or anaesthesia, that have been reported in the literature, are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The nine studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review are listed first.</P>
<P>For 12 of the 31 studies listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, the primary antagonist administered under sedation or anaesthesia was naloxone (with six of these studies being undertaken by Loimer and colleagues); six studies used both naltrexone and naloxone; nine studies primarily used naltrexone; and four studies used nalmefene alone or in combination with naltrexone and/or naloxone.</P>
<P>Doses of naloxone administered during the period of sedation or anaesthesia ranged from 4 to 15mg (i.v.), naltrexone from 50 to 350mg (oral), and nalmefene from 2 to 12mg (i.v.). In the studies where more than one opioid antagonist was administered, the effective dose range was even greater. One of the lowest dose regimes was used by <LINK REF="STD-Lorenzi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenzi 1999</LINK>: 4mg naloxone under anaesthesia, followed the next day by a challenge test with 0.8mg naloxone prior to 10mg naltrexone. <LINK REF="STD-Loimer-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Loimer 1991a</LINK> also used a low dose regime for patients withdrawing from methadone: 4mg naloxone under anaesthesia followed by 50mg naltrexone post-anaesthesia. At the other end of the range, <LINK REF="STD-Pfab-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pfab 1999</LINK> administered 0.2mg/kg naloxone (equating to 14mg for a 70kg person) plus 100 to 150mg naltrexone during anaesthesia; <LINK REF="STD-Elman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Elman 2001</LINK> administered 2mg nalmefene followed 30 minutes later by 200mg naltrexone; and <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2003</LINK> administered naltrexone, nalmefene and naloxone.</P>
<P>Loimer and colleagues used barbiturate (methohexitone or thiopentone) or benzodiazepine (midazolam) anaesthetic agents while later studies tended to use propofol (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In these later studies there also appears to be a trend towards longer duration of anaesthesia - Loimer and colleagues reported durations of 30 to 60 minutes, compared to more than four hours in studies published after 1998, with the longest period of anaesthesia (11 to 22 hours) reported by <LINK REF="STD-Pfab-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pfab 1999</LINK>.</P>
<P>Loimer and colleagues generally do not report using adjunct medications, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Loimer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Loimer 1993</LINK> in which clonidine and ondansetron were used. However, later studies report the use of up to five adjunct medications including alpha2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine, guanfacine); anti-emetic agents (ondansetron, loperamide, metoclopramide); muscle relaxants and anti-spasmodic (butylscopolamine, baclofen); antidepressants (trimipramine, trazodone); non-opioid analgesics (diclofenac, ketorolac, paracetamol); agents to reduce stomach acidity or secretions (omeprazole, famotidine, glycopyrrolate, octreotide, atropine, ranitidine); anxiolytics or sedatives (diazepam, midazolam, flunitrazepam); an antipsychotic (perazine); antibiotics (cephalosporine, ceftriaxone); an anticoagulant (heparin); and a vasodilator (nitroglycerine).</P>
<P>It is clear from general literature (eg. <LINK REF="REF-Brewer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brewer-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewer 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bulthuis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bulthuis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chanmugam-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chanmugam 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foster-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Foster 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gooberman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gooberman 1998</LINK>) that some practitioners providing rapid detoxification are using naltrexone implants or depot preparations to achieve a more sustained opioid antagonist effect in the immediate post-anaesthesia phase. However, none of the studies considered for this review used such formulations in their protocols.</P>

<P>Results are presented in three parts. The first part considers the comparison of antagonist-induced withdrawal, with heavy sedation or anaesthesia, and conventional approaches to opioid withdrawal (tapered methadone: <LINK REF="STD-Krabbe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Krabbe 2003</LINK>; clonidine plus symptomatic medications: <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Favrat-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Favrat 2006</LINK>; and buprenorphine: <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK>). The second part considers the comparison of regimes of antagonist-induced withdrawal with differing levels of sedation (<LINK REF="STD-Seoane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seoane 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Jong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">de Jong 2005</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(1) Comparison with conventional approaches</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Intensity and duration of withdrawal signs and symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Using the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS, which has a maximum score of 64), <LINK REF="STD-Krabbe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Krabbe 2003</LINK> reported a mean score of 11.5 before anaesthesia, 20 on the day after anaesthesia, declining to pre-treatment levels in four days. The pattern of scores from the Objective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (OOWS, which has a maximum score of 13) was similar: 1.9 on the day before anaesthesia, 3.9 on the day after anaesthesia, and declining to pre-treatment levels in three days. Withdrawal scores for the tapered methadone group were lower than the peak scores for the group receiving antagonist-induced withdrawal. In the tapered methadone group peak withdrawal occurred much later, on day 18, some six days after cessation of methadone and commencement of naltrexone. Based on SOWS and OOWS scores, the duration of withdrawal was four days in the antagonist-induced withdrawal group, and 20 days in the tapered methadone group.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK>, withdrawal was assessed by participants and observers using the SOWS and OOWS, and the Clinical Institute Narcotic Assessment. Withdrawal scores for the anaesthesia group were significantly higher prior to anaesthesia. The authors attributed this to anticipatory anxiety and less use of available clonazepam. There were no significant differences in withdrawal scores for the three groups on days two and three. Withdrawal was not assessed after discharge on day three.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McGregor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 2002</LINK> did not directly compare withdrawal scores for the groups receiving antagonist-induced withdrawal or standard inpatient treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Favrat-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Favrat 2006</LINK> did not assess withdrawal severity.</P>

<P>Duration of withdrawal treatment was not directly reported by any of the four studies. The closest data reported by <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 2002</LINK> was the mean (± SE) time to first dose of naltrexone to be 0.1 ± 0.3 days for antagonist-induced withdrawal, and 4.2 ± 0.6 days for standard inpatient withdrawal managed with clonidine and symptomatic medications.</P>
<P>Data from <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK> that was most relevant to duration was the mean (± SE) weeks in treatment, combining detoxification and naltrexone aftercare: 2.83 ± 0.47 weeks for the anaesthesia group, 3 ± 0.45 weeks for the buprenorphine group, and 2.47 ± 0.58 weeks for the clonidine group (difference not significant).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK> reported three potentially life-threatening adverse events, all in the anaesthesia group: pulmonary edema 14 hours after extubation; mixed bipolar state with suicidal ideation five days after anaesthesia; and diabetic ketoacidosis two days after discharge.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-10-05 09:26:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The nine studies that met the criteria for inclusion in this review are diverse in the nature of the comparison intervention, and the particular regime of antagonist-induced withdrawal used. The diversity and small number of studies limits the strength of conclusions that can be drawn, from these studies alone, as to the the effectiveness of anaesthesia-assisted, antagonist-induced withdrawal. This discussion section therefore considers relevant information from other studies, in addition to the results of the included studies, against each of the identified outcomes of interest: (a) intensity and duration of withdrawal signs and symptoms; (b) duration of withdrawal treatment; (c) adverse effects; and (d) completion of treatment and post-detoxification outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Intensity and duration of withdrawal signs and symptoms</HEADING>
<P>The results of <LINK REF="STD-Krabbe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Krabbe 2003</LINK> indicate that antagonist-induced withdrawal is more intense, but less prolonged than withdrawal managed with reducing doses of methadone. <LINK REF="STD-Favrat-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Favrat 2006</LINK> did not assess withdrawal severity, and <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 2002</LINK> did not directly compare withdrawal signs and symptoms in the group receiving antagonist-induced withdrawal and those treated with clonidine and symptomatic medications. <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK> found no significant difference in withdrawal severity following anaesthesia compared to withdrawal managed with either buprenorphine or clonidine.</P>
<P>The findings of <LINK REF="STD-Seoane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seoane 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-de-Jong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">de Jong 2005</LINK> indicate that the level of sedation does not affect the intensity and duration of withdrawal, although it remains possible that duration of anaesthesia may influence withdrawal severity.</P>
<P>The findings of <LINK REF="STD-Kienbaum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kienbaum 2000</LINK> indicate that withdrawal is affected by the anaesthetic agent, with more intense and more prolonged withdrawal associated with methohexital compared with propofol anaesthesia. <LINK REF="STD-Jovaisa-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jovaisa 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK> indicate that adjunct medications can significantly moderate the reaction to the initial administration of opioid antagonist, and the severity of withdrawal post-anaesthesia.</P>
<P>Early studies of anaesthesia-assisted, antagonist-induced withdrawal reported minimal withdrawal post-anaesthesia, or at least no significant change in severity compared to pre-anaesthesia (eg. <LINK REF="STD-Brewer-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Brewer 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Legarda-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Legarda 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loimer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Loimer 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loimer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Loimer 1990</LINK>). However, the studies included in this review indicate that while antagonist-induced withdrawal is less prolonged than withdrawal managed with conventional approaches, it is nonetheless associated with significant symptoms. Other more recent studies (eg. <LINK REF="STD-Cucchia-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cucchia 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Elman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfab-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pfab 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scherbaum-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scherbaum 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tretter-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tretter 1998</LINK>) support this conclusion, with the authors of these studies reporting that most participants experienced moderate withdrawal lasting at least a few days following the anaesthetic procedure.</P>
<P>A number of factors could be contributing to the divergence between early and later studies in terms of the reported severity of withdrawal.</P>
<P>Firstly, the means by which withdrawal is assessed may be important. This is highlighted by the study of <LINK REF="STD-Loimer-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Loimer 1991b</LINK>, in which no correlation was found between participant and observer ratings of withdrawal, with observer ratings significantly under-estimating withdrawal compared to participant ratings. Hence, studies that rely only on observer ratings, such as the CINA (<LINK REF="REF-Peachey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peachey 1988</LINK>) and Wang (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1974</LINK>) scales, may be biased towards lower ratings of withdrawal. Furthermore, these scales place an emphasis on physical signs, such as changes in heart rate and blood pressure, piloerection and rhinorrhea, which tend to resolve more quickly than other symptoms. Assessment methods that incorporate participant ratings and which include more subjective symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, body aches and sleep disturbances, can be expected to more accurately reflect participants' withdrawal experience. The Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Gossop-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gossop 1990</LINK>), or the combination of the Objective and Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scales (<LINK REF="REF-Handelsman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handelsman 1987</LINK>) provide for incorporation of participant ratings. Several of the studies considered for this review used these scales (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hensel-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Hensel 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kienbaum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kienbaum 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krabbe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Krabbe 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loimer-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Loimer 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfab-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pfab 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scherbaum-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scherbaum 1998</LINK>). The data reported for these studies indicate that subjective symptoms were significantly elevated for several days following detoxification.</P>
<P>A second factor that may be impacting on the severity of withdrawal reported is the nature of opioid used by participants prior to detoxification. <LINK REF="STD-Pfab-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pfab 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hensel-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Hensel 2000b</LINK> both report outcomes according to the type of opioid participants had been using. Data from these studies indicate that withdrawal from methadone is more severe and more prolonged than withdrawal from heroin. This finding is also supported by <LINK REF="STD-Bell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1999</LINK> for antagonist-induced withdrawal with minimal sedation. In this regard it is interesting to note that the treatment regimes used by Loimer's group, for which withdrawal was reported as minimal, generally involved participants being stabilised on morphine for two to three days prior to anaesthesia.</P>
<P>Data from <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 2002</LINK> also indicate that the severity of withdrawal is influenced by the length of time between last heroin use and induction of anaesthesia.</P>
<P>While some factors have been identified, insufficient data are available to determine the extent to which these factors may contribute to the intensity and duration of withdrawal signs and symptoms experienced by patients undergoing antagonist-induced withdrawal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(b) Duration of withdrawal treatment</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McGregor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 2002</LINK> reported a significantly shorter time between admission and first dose of naltrexone for participants receiving naloxone-induced withdrawal compared to those treated with clonidine and symptomatic medications. In <LINK REF="STD-Krabbe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Krabbe 2003</LINK>, participants receiving antagonist-induced withdrawal achieved maintenance doses of naltrexone in a significantly shorter period than those whose withdrawal was managed with reducing doses of methadone. The treatment regimes used for <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK> were designed with different time intervals to the first dose of naltrexone: on day 1 in the anaesthesia group, day 2 in the buprenorphine group, and day 7 in the clonidine group.</P>
<P>Hence, the studies included in this review support a conclusion that antagonist-induced withdrawal reduces the time period between opioid use and establishment of an antagonist blockade of opioid receptors. However, insufficient data are available to determine whether, and for how long, withdrawal symptoms continued after commencement of naltrexone maintenance.</P>

The findings of <LINK REF="STD-Seoane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seoane 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-de-Jong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">de Jong 2005</LINK> indicate significantly greater risk of adverse events with heavy, compared to light, sedation (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>: risk ratio 3.21; 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 9.12, <I>P</I>=0.03).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kienbaum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kienbaum 2000</LINK> noted high fluid requirements after administration of opioid antagonist, and reported one serious adverse event. <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jovaisa-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jovaisa 2006</LINK> reported there were no complications.</P>
<P>Other studies have reported significant adverse events associated with antagonist-induced withdrawal.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Elman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Elman 2001</LINK> reported episodes of irregularities in respiratory pattern during withdrawal induced by nalmefene and naltrexone under propofol anaesthesia, with one of seven participants having a self-limited episode of respiratory arrest during the acute post-anaesthetic phase.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cucchia-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cucchia 1998</LINK> reported vomiting in 67% of participants (the level of sedation was reported to be such that they were able to be woken when vomiting occurred). <LINK REF="STD-Tretter-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tretter 1998</LINK> reported vomiting in three of 14 during anaesthesia.</P>
<P>In 123 treatments, <LINK REF="STD-Albanese-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Albanese 2000</LINK> reported one transient psychotic episode.</P>
<P>In one of 22 participants treated by <LINK REF="STD-Scherbaum-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scherbaum 1998</LINK>, orotracheal intubation was maintained for 13 hours because of a prolonged recovery from anaesthesia. <LINK REF="STD-Scherbaum-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scherbaum 1998</LINK> also commented on the occurrence of bradycardia and/or hypokalaemia in most participants following the anaesthetic procedure.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pfab-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pfab 1999</LINK> decided to abandon anaesthesia-based detoxification after two of 12 patients had transient renal insufficiency and one suffered pulmonary dysfunction that required 35 days of mechanical ventilation and 51 days of hospitalisation before the patient recovered.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brewer-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Brewer 1998a</LINK>, reporting on a series of 510 cases, noted one instance of bradycardia and first degree heart block which resolved spontaneously within a few minutes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Allhoff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allhoff 1999</LINK> retrospectively reviewed ECG tracings for 22 patients undergoing anaesthetic-based withdrawal. They found the heart rate was significantly lowered and the cQT interval significantly lengthened after detoxification. Modest hypokalaemia was linked to cQT prolongation in 10 ECG tracings. Furthermore, 12 tracings from 10 patients showed T-wave inversion after detoxification, with sinus rhythm being turned into a rhythm arising from the AV node in two cases.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Albanese-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Albanese 2000</LINK> reported one case of ventricular bigeminy (premature beat following normal beat) in 123 treatments.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hensel-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Hensel 2000a</LINK> reported that of 30 participants treated with naltrexone under propofol anaesthesia, eight developed bradycardia and first degree AV block, and six experienced mild but persistent hypotension. Using a similar treatment protocol, <LINK REF="STD-Hensel-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Hensel 2000b</LINK> reported six cases of bradycardia and nine of persistent hypotension amongst 72 participants.</P>
<P>Vomiting during sedation or anaesthesia is significant because of the potential for aspiration of stomach contents if the airway is not adequately protected. This can result in aspiration pneumonia, as occurred in one of 150 participants in the heavy sedation group of <LINK REF="STD-Seoane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seoane 1997</LINK>. Approaches taken to minimise the risks of vomiting during anaesthesia include intubation to protect the airway (adopted by the majority of studies, but used for only a proportion of participants in <LINK REF="STD-Seoane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Seoane 1997</LINK>), administration of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection in the event of aspiration (<LINK REF="STD-Kienbaum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kienbaum 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tretter-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tretter 1998</LINK>), and the use of medications to reduce the amount and acidity of gastric secretions, thereby reducing the incidence of vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-Elman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Elman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gold-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hensel-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Hensel 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kienbaum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kienbaum 2000</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Tretter-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tretter 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data from <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 2002</LINK> support the value of medications to control gastric secretions, with 64% of participants not receiving octreotide as an adjunct medication, compared to 8% who did receive octreotide, experiencing vomiting and/or diarrhoea during withdrawal.</P>
<P>The basis of respiratory dysfunction is unclear, particularly given that antagonist-induced withdrawal is typically associated with increases in spontaneous ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1998</LINK>). Nonetheless, it points to the need for anaesthesia-assisted withdrawal to be limited to facilities with the capacity for adequate monitoring of patients undergoing withdrawal, and for provision of mechanical ventilation as necessary.</P>
<P>One death under anaesthesia has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Bearn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bearn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyer 1998</LINK>). In addition, there has been one death reported in the USA due to respiratory arrest within hours of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1997</LINK>) and another death in Australia of apparent cardiac arrest, less than 24 hours after anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Blake-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blake 1999</LINK>). Only one of the studies considered for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Gold-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 1999</LINK>) reported a death temporally proximate to anaesthetic-assisted withdrawal. In this case the cause of death remains uncertain as the family refused a post-mortem, although based on serum levels, a drug overdose was excluded.</P>
<P>There is evidence of cardiac irregularities associated with anaesthesia-assisted withdrawal which might underlie some of the life-threatening adverse events. Cardiovascular effects reported include bradycardia and first degree heart block (<LINK REF="STD-Brewer-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Brewer 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hensel-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Hensel 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scherbaum-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scherbaum 1998</LINK>), prolongation of the QT interval (<LINK REF="STD-Allhoff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allhoff 1999</LINK>) and other abnormalities of heart rhythm (<LINK REF="STD-Albanese-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Albanese 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Allhoff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allhoff 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Allhoff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Allhoff 1999</LINK> linked the cardiovascular effects to modest hypokalaemia. <LINK REF="STD-Scherbaum-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scherbaum 1998</LINK> also commented on the occurrence of hypokalaemia in participants after anaesthesia-assisted withdrawal. <LINK REF="REF-Kienbaum-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kienbaum 1998</LINK>, in a study of the pathophysiology of anaesthesia-assisted withdrawal, reported significant increases in plasma epinephrine and cardiac index associated with administration of naloxone (12.4mg) under methohexitone anaesthesia. This increase in circulating catecholamines and the likelihood of fluid and electrolyte loss during antagonist-induced withdrawal have been identified as creating the potential for significant arrhythmia (<LINK REF="REF-Whittington-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittington 2000</LINK>). The use of additional drugs, particularly alpha2 adrenergic agonists such as clonidine, has been identified as important to reduce the risk of hyperadrenergic crisis and pulmonary oedema arising from the surge in catecholamines (<LINK REF="REF-Gevirtz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gevirtz 1999</LINK>). The findings of <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jovaisa-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jovaisa 2006</LINK> suggest that tramadol and ketamine may also have some effectiveness in moderating increases in heart rate and blood pressure. The importance of monitoring cardiac function and electrolyte levels during and after anaesthesia-assisted withdrawal has also been stressed (<LINK REF="REF-Whittington-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittington 2000</LINK>). The use of medications to reduce vomiting and diarrhoea (eg. ondansetron, octreotide) might also be expected to be beneficial by reducing fluid loss associated with antagonist-induced withdrawal.</P>
<P>The diversity of the adverse effects indicates the basis of adverse effects is complex. As has been suggested by others (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kienbaum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kienbaum 2000</LINK>), it may be that the rapid precipitation of withdrawal that is possible under anaesthesia imposes a level of physiological stress that significantly increases the risk of adverse effects, with the nature of the adverse effect dependent on the physical and mental health status of the individual.</P>
<P>The discussion above identifies the nature of opioid drugs used prior to detoxification and the use of adjunct medications as factors that might influence the severity of anaesthesia-assisted withdrawal and the risk of adverse effects. Other possible factors include the anaesthetic agent used, the duration of anaesthesia, as well as the nature, dose and route of administration of the opioid antagonist used to induce withdrawal.</P>
<P>The findings of <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jovaisa-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jovaisa 2006</LINK> indicate that the potential influence of adjunct medications on outcome also needs to be considered. However, the adjunct medications used in the studies considered for this review are too diverse and too numerous to be able to identify specific effects at this time.</P>
<P>The three opioid antagonists used in the studies considered for this review - naloxone, naltrexone, and nalmefene - differ in their duration of action and also in the route of administration. Naloxone and nalmefene are typically administered by injection, usually intravenously, whereas naltrexone has been administered orally, usually as a slurry via a gastric tube for anaesthesia-assisted withdrawal. Again, because of the diversity of dose regimes it is not possible at this time to identify any effect on outcome arising from the nature, route of administration or dose of the opioid antagonist used to induce withdrawal. However, an indication of the potential effect is provided by a study in which plasma naltrexone was measured during withdrawal induced by naltrexone (given via gastric tube in repeated doses of 12.5, 25, 50 and 50mg) under propofol anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2000</LINK>). It was found that increases in plasma naltrexone were variable. Factors suggested as influencing absorption included positioning of the gastric tube, and attenuated blood flow to the stomach due to anaesthesia or sympathetic nervous system activation. This finding suggests that the choice of opioid antagonist may influence outcomes, and also that injected opioid antagonists may have an advantage over orally administered antagonists in terms of more predictable bioavailability, and hence better management of withdrawal severity and risk of adverse events.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(d) Completion of treatment and post-detoxification outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Data are limited, but it appears that antagonist-induced withdrawal under anaesthesia, compared to withdrawal managed with clonidine and possibly tapered methadone, is associated with increased rates of commencement of naltrexone maintenance treatment, and increased rates of retention in naltrexone maintenance treatment for up to three months. However, there are no significant differences in these outcomes for antagonist-induced withdrawal under anaesthesia compared to withdrawal managed with buprenorphine.</P>
<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Krabbe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Krabbe 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 2002</LINK> report higher rates of dropout, particularly early in treatment, from conventional compared to antagonist-induced withdrawal. Some of the early dropout may be attributable to participants' disappointment on being allocated to standard treatment rather than a novel approach. <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McGregor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 2002</LINK> report low rates of retention in naltrexone maintenance treatment following detoxification.</P>
<P>The level of sedation during withdrawal has no effect on completion of detoxification or abstinence at one month post-detoxification (<LINK REF="STD-de-Jong-2005" TYPE="STUDY">de Jong 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is clear from the above studies, and others considered for this review, that not all patients who undergo anaesthesia-assisted withdrawal continue with naltrexone maintenance treatment, and a significant proportion relapse to opioid use. However, the rates of engagement in naltrexone maintenance treatment and abstinence from opioid use in the post-detoxification period cannot be accurately quantified at this time.</P>
<P>There have been reports of deaths in participants subsequent to detoxification under anaesthesia or heavy sedation (<LINK REF="REF-Bearn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bearn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brewer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1997</LINK>). The point of highest risk is probably the time of relapse to opioid use post-detoxification. Not only will there be decreased tolerance to opioids at this time because of cessation of opioid use, but the response to opioids may be enhanced because of opioid receptor up regulation (<LINK REF="REF-White-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999</LINK>) resulting in a high risk of overdose.</P>

<P>The information on the effectiveness of antagonist-induced withdrawal under heavy sedation or anaesthesia is sparse. The studies that met the criteria for inclusion in this review varied considerably in treatment regimes, the nature of the comparison modality, and the nature of outcome data reported and this limited the nature and extent of the analyses that were able to be undertaken. </P>
<P>There is little information on the nature of withdrawal signs and symptoms experienced by patients, the duration of significant symptoms, the overall severity, or the acceptability to patients of this approach to the management of opioid withdrawal. It remains uncertain to what extent the nature of the opioid used prior to withdrawal, the length of time between last opioid use and administration of opioid antagonist, the anaesthetic agent used, the dose of opioid antagonist and the duration of anaesthesia may contribute to both withdrawal severity and adverse effects. The use of adjunct medications appears to be important, but the evidence on type and amount of adjunct medications remains limited.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-07-31 09:07:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>The treatment regimes for the administration of opioid antagonists under anaesthesia or heavy sedation vary in the opioid antagonist used, the dose and mode of administration, the anaesthetic agent, duration of anaesthesia, and other medications employed (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The dose and half-life of the opioid used prior to withdrawal also varied. It is not possible to identify "standard" treatment regimes for antagonist-induced withdrawal in conjunction with heavy sedation or anaesthesia.</P>
<P>Antagonist-induced withdrawal is more intense but less prolonged than withdrawal managed by tapered methadone or clonidine plus symptomatic medications, and is associated with significant reductions in the time between opioid use and commencement of naltrexone treatment.</P>
<P>The severity of antagonist-induced withdrawal is probably influenced by the nature of opioid used prior to withdrawal, the length of time between last opioid use and administration of opioid antagonist, the anaesthetic agent used, the dose of opioid antagonist and the duration of anaesthesia. However, the extent to which these factors influence outcomes is unclear.</P>
<P>The use of adjunct medications including alpha<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agonists (e.g. clonidine), anti-emetic and anti-diarrhoeal agents appears to be important in reducing vomiting and diarrhoea during anaesthesia as well as controlling the effects of a surge in catecholamines triggered by administration of opioid antagonists. Reducing vomiting and diarrhoea will help to control fluid loss which carries with it the risk of hypokalaemia, which in turn can trigger cardiac arrhythmias. Controlling vomiting and diarrhoea can be expected to also contribute significantly to patient comfort in the post-anaesthesia recovery period.</P>
<P>The reported occurrence of vomiting during sedation, respiratory depression and cardiac irregularities point to the approach being limited to facilities equipped for intubation, assisted ventilation and a high level of monitoring, and with the capacity to respond to the adverse events that might occur.</P>
<P>The increased risk of clinically significant adverse events associated with withdrawal under heavy sedation or anaesthesia make the value of anaesthesia-assisted antagonist-induced withdrawal questionable. Given that the intensity and duration of withdrawal, and rates of completion of withdrawal, are similar for antagonist-induced withdrawal with minimal sedation, or withdrawal managed with buprenorphine, these would appear to be preferable approaches to managing withdrawal in those wishing to transfer to naltrexone maintenance treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-07-31 09:03:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Linda R. Gowing">
<P>The lack of additional benefit, and increased risk of harm associated with antagonist-induced withdrawal under heavy sedation or anaesthesia, as compared to approaches with minimal sedation, suggests that this form of treatment should not be pursued. Research resources would be better directed towards assessment and development of minimal sedation approaches, or the use of buprenorphine to facilitate transition to naltrexone maintenance treatment.</P>
<P>However, if undertaken, any research should explore factors that might influence outcomes. These factors include the nature, dose and route of administration of opioid antagonist; the anaesthetic agent, depth and duration of anaesthesia; the type, dose and timing of adjunct medications; and the nature, dose and timing of last opioid use.</P>
<P>The signs and symptoms of withdrawal should be assessed across a time course, from prior to commencement of the intervention through to subsidence of signs and symptoms, which may be some weeks after cessation of opioid use. Assessments should incorporate both objective signs and subjective symptoms.</P>
<P>Consideration could also be given to participant characteristics, such as severity of dependence, psychological and health status, duration of use, previous treatment history, employment status and family support, and the extent to which these contribute to the outcome of withdrawal.</P>
