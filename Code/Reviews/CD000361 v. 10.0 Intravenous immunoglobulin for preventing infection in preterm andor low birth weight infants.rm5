<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This is an update of the review "Intravenous immunoglobulin for preventing infection in preterm and/or low birth weight infants" published in The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004 (Ohlsson 2004).<BR/>
<BR/>One potential new trial was identified for this update conducted in July 2007. However, the infants randomized were more than 38 weeks gestation or weighed more than 2,500 g and therefore the study did not meet the inclusion criteria of preterm or low birth weight infants.<BR/>
<BR/>Trials using species specific immunoglobulins (such as for staphylococcus aureus or epidermidis) were not included as they are reviewed separately by others within the Cochrane Collaboration.<BR/>
<BR/>There have been two previous updates of this review (2001, 2003).<BR/>
<BR/>In our 2001 update of this review, we identified 4 additional studies (2 single center studies from Turkey, one single center study from Taiwan and one multi-center study conducted in four centers in Sweden and Austria). These studies reported on a total of 298 infants. We are aware of one additional unpublished study that enrolled 40 infants in Estonia. To our knowledge, this study has not been published. We were not able to identify any additional studies in our literature search in September 2003.<BR/>
<BR/>In the 2001 update of this review, secondary analyses according to study quality were abolished as we found it exceedingly difficult to ascertain whether caregivers/researchers were blinded to the randomization process and/or the intervention or not.<BR/>
<BR/>In 2001, the addition to our previous systematic review of outcomes from 298 randomized infants did not overturn the main results from our previous review first published in 1998. IVIG administration results in a 3-4% reduction in sepsis and any serious infection but is not associated with reductions in mortality or other important morbidities. There is no need for further trials of currently available IVIG preparations to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections.<BR/>
<BR/>As we noted statistically significant heterogeneity for the two main outcomes of interest in this review (sepsis and any serious infection), we added the newly introduced "inconsistency test" (I squared). For both outcomes (sepsis and any serious infection), there was moderate "inconsistency" of 54% and 50% respectively.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-24 09:54:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews">
<P>Infants may acquire infections while in the womb or in the hospital after birth, especially if they require intensive care. Such infections may cause serious illness or death. Transport of immunoglobulin (substance in the blood that can fight infection) from the mother to the fetus mainly occurs after 32 weeks' gestation, and infants do not begin to produce immunoglobulin until several months after birth. Theoretically, the adverse effects of infection could be reduced by the preventive administration of intravenous immunoglobulin. To date, approximately 5000 infants have been enrolled in studies conducted to evaluate the effects of prophylactic use of intravenous immunoglobulin on neonatal outcomes. Intravenous administration of immunoglobulin results in a 3% reduction in blood-borne infection and a 4% reduction in serious infection. Intravenous administration of immunoglobulin is not associated with reductions in other important neonatal outcomes or in length of hospital stay. Most important, intravenous immunoglobulin administration does not have any important effect on mortality. Prophylactic use of IVIG is not associated with any short-term serious side effects. From a clinical perspective, a 3% to 4% reduction in nosocomial infection without a reduction in mortality or other important clinical outcomes is of marginal importance.</P>

<P>Nosocomial infections continue to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among preterm and/or low birth weight (LBW) infants. Preterm infants are deficient in immunoglobulin G (IgG); therefore, administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may have the potential of preventing or altering the course of nosocomial infections.<BR/>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-24 09:53:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nineteen studies enrolling approximately 5000 preterm and/or LBW infants met inclusion criteria. No new trials were identified in May 2013.</P>
<P>When all studies were combined, a significant reduction in sepsis was noted (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.98; typical risk difference (RD) -0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to -0.05; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 33, 95% CI 20 to infinity), and moderate between-study heterogeneity was reported (I<SUP>2</SUP> 54% for RR, 55% for RD). A significant reduction of one or more episodes was found for any serious infection when all studies were combined (typical RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.92; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.06; NNTB 25, 95% CI 17 to 50), and moderate between-study heterogeneity was observed (I<SUP>2</SUP> 50% for RR, 62% for RD). No statistically significant differences in mortality from all causes were noted (typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.05; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01), and no heterogeneity for RR (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 21%) or low heterogeneity for RD was documented (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 28%). No statistically significant difference was seen in mortality from infection; in incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) or in length of hospital stay. No major adverse effects of IVIG were reported in any of these studies.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-24 09:53:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>IVIG administration results in a 3% reduction in sepsis and a 4% reduction in one or more episodes of any serious infection but is not associated with reductions in other clinically important outcomes, including mortality. Prophylactic use of IVIG is not associated with any short-term serious side effects.</P>
<P>The decision to use prophylactic IVIG will depend on the costs and the values assigned to the clinical outcomes. There is no justification for conducting additional RCTs to test the efficacy of previously studied IVIG preparations in reducing nosocomial infections in preterm and/or LBW infants.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-06-24 09:54:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although survival has improved for preterm and/or low birth weight (LBW) infants, nosocomial infection continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. A 25% incidence of late-onset infection has been reported in a cohort of 6911 very LBW infants who were admitted to 12 US centres and who survived beyond three days (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996</LINK>). Neonates in whom late-onset sepsis developed were significantly more likely to die than those who were not infected (17% vs 7%; P &lt; 0.0001) (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-06-24 09:54:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains pooled immunoglobulin G (IgG) extracted from the plasma of more than 1000 blood donors. </P>
<P>IVIG is frequently given to immunodeficient patients who have decreased antibody production capabilities. In immunodeficient patients, IVIG is administered to maintain adequate antibody levels to prevent infection and to confer passive immunity.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-06-24 09:54:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Maternal transport of immunoglobulins to the fetus mainly occurs after 32 weeks' gestation, and endogenous synthesis does not begin until about 24 weeks after birth, so the preterm infant is especially vulnerable to infectious sources in the neonatal intensive care unit (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1990a</LINK>). Mean serum levels of IgG are 400 mg/dL in infants at less than 32 weeks' gestational age (GA) compared with 1000 mg/dL in term infants (<LINK REF="REF-Hobbs-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobbs 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stiehm-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehm 1966</LINK>). The idea of preventing nosocomial infection with IVIG is attractive, as administration of IVIG provides IgG that can bind to cell surface receptors, provide opsonic activity, activate complement, promote antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and improve neutrophilic chemo-luminescence (<LINK REF="REF-Baley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baley 1988</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-06-24 09:54:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Administration of IVIG to LBW infants has been studied extensively. Numerous descriptive review articles, commentaries and editorials on the use of IVIG in neonates have been published, often by the same researchers. These papers have included several randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the authors' personal experience with IVIG and/or information about the preparation or dosing regimen of IVIG (<LINK REF="REF-Weisman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bortolussi-1986a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bortolussi 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bortolussi-1986b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bortolussi 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stiehm-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehm 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baley 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischer-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kyllonen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kyllonen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stabile-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stabile 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noya-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noya 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischer-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischer-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischer-1990c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 1990c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baker-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baker-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bussel-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bussel 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hammarstrom-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammarstrom 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kliegman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kliegman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stiehm-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehm 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitelaw-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitelaw 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hill-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hill-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irani-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irani 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kliegman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kliegman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magny-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magny 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rondini-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rondini 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siber-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siber 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weisman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hill--1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weisman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weisman-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisman 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolach-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolach 1997</LINK>). Salzer (<LINK REF="REF-Salzer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzer 1991</LINK>) presented (in abstract form only) the results of a meta-analysis of seven studies and concluded that no significant reduction was seen in the incidence of sepsis in the treated group. In "Effective Care of the Newborn Infant", Baley and Fanaroff (<LINK REF="REF-Baley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baley 1992</LINK>) present overviews of RCTs that studied the administration of IVIG to neonates. They reviewed seven studies of the prophylactic use of IVIG that reported an outcome of sepsis and concluded, "The preliminary data generated in trials of IVIG are promising, but use of this treatment modality still needs to be considered experimental and [it] should only, as yet, be used under study conditions." Lacy and Ohlsson (<LINK REF="REF-Lacy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacy 1995</LINK>) included additional trials and concluded that routine administration of IVIG to preterm infants to prevent infection is not recommended. Jenson and Pollock (<LINK REF="REF-Jenson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenson 1997</LINK>) used slightly different inclusion criteria and, like Lacy and Ohlsson (<LINK REF="REF-Lacy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacy 1995</LINK>), noted heterogeneity among studies. They concluded, "this heterogeneity probably belies the minimal benefit, at most, of prophylactic IVIG". The results of a Canadian multidisciplinary consensus-building initiative (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus--1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 1997</LINK>) have been published, and the use of IVIG for prophylaxis of neonatal nosocomial infection was considered inappropriate. This review provides an update of our previous review, which was last updated with no changes in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2007</LINK>) and was first published in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Assessment of the quality of included studies (excluding abstracts) was performed independently by JBL and AO, using criteria developed by the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. These criteria included blinding of randomisation, blinding of the intervention, complete follow-up and blinding of outcome measurement. For each criterion, three possibilities were identified: yes, can't tell and no. The assignment was not done with the assessors blinded to author, institution, journal of publication or results, as both assessors were familiar with most of the studies and with the typographical layout of the journals and would have knowledge of these even when blinded. In addition, the results sections of articles often include methodological information. After independent evaluation was performed, the two assessors discussed the results of each study, and any discrepancies were resolved. </P>
<P>For the update in 2009, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the risk of bias table:</P>

In the remaining 15 studies, elements of bias could not be excluded. The lack of a placebo in 10 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Atici-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Atici 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chirico-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chirico 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Conway-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Didato-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Didato 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fanaroff-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fanaroff 1994</LINK> (phase II), <LINK REF="STD-Haque-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Haque 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ratrisawadi--1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ratrisawadi 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stabile-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stabile 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tanzer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tanzer 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Overmeire-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Overmeire 1993</LINK>) precluded blinding of the caregivers. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Fanaroff-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fanaroff 1994</LINK>) included two phases, with phase I providing a placebo but not phase II. In several studies, blinding of randomisation was not clearly described (<LINK REF="STD-Chirico-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chirico 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Magny-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Magny 1991b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ratrisawadi--1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ratrisawadi 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stabile-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stabile 1988</LINK>). In the study by Sandberg (<LINK REF="STD-Sandberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sandberg 2000</LINK>), an intention-to-treat analysis was not applied. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Spady-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Spady 1994</LINK>) has been published in abstract form only, and the quality therefore could not be fully assessed. The study by Bussel (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1990a</LINK>) represents an interim analysis, with data lacking from a large proportion of the infants randomly assigned.</P>

<BR/>Two studies (including 3000 infants) reported on IVH grade 3 or 4. The typical RR was 1.01 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.21), and the typical RD was 0.00 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.03). Statistically significant between-study heterogeneity was observed (RR, P = 0.09, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 65% (moderate); RD, P = 0.08, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68% (moderate)).</P>
<P>A rise in serum IgG in the treatment group was noted in all studies that measured serum levels of IgG.</P>
<P>No major adverse effects of IVIG were reported in any of the studies.</P>
<P>Results from excluded studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>) were similar to those from included studies.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-01 09:03:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of IVIG in preventing nosocomial infection in neonates has been well studied. To date, more than 5000 preterm and/or LBW neonates have been enrolled in trials from many different areas of the world. No new trial was identified for this update conducted in May 2013. One additional trial was identified for the update of the review conducted in July 2007 (<LINK REF="STD-Lelik-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lelik 2004</LINK>). However, the study included infants at &gt; 38 weeks' gestation and &gt; 2500 g birth weight. Therefore, the study was excluded.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the included trials varied. Five studies were of high quality, but elements of bias could not be excluded in the other studies, mainly because of the fact that the intervention and the assessment of outcomes were performed unblinded to group assignment, or there was lack of complete follow-up of all randomly assigned infants. IVIG caused increased levels of IgG in serum. No major side effects were noted.</P>
<P>A small but statistically significant reduction in the incidence of sepsis and of any serious infection was found. Statistically significant between-study heterogeneity was observed for these outcomes. The heterogeneity might be explained in part by variable rates of sepsis and any serious infection in the control groups; differences in preparation, dose and/or dose schedule for IVIG; differences in causative organisms for nosocomial infection; differences in attention to other preventive measures for nosocomial infection and differences in other co-interventions by place and over time. Some asymmetry was noted when funnel plots were performed for sepsis and any serious infection. For the two main outcomes&#65293;sepsis (one or more episodes) and any serious infection (one or more episodes)&#65293;moderate inconsistency between study results was noted (I<SUP>2</SUP> 54% and 50%, respectively).</P>
<P>No statistically significant differences were noted in mortality from all causes, mortality from infection, NEC, BPD or IVH. Results for these outcomes were centred around an RR of 1.0, with very narrow CIs indicating no trends in either direction. In none of the studies that provided data on IVH was there any assurance that all neonates were subjected to ascertainment of an IVH according to a preset schedule for ultrasonographic examination. A trend towards shortened duration of hospital stay was noted with IVIG treatment [weighted mean difference (WMD) -2.1 days, 95% CI -4.5 to 0.3 days]
. The outcome of hospital stay is highly dependent on the GA at birth of the neonate, the availability of institutions providing Level II care to which the neonate can be transferred and the social situation of the family.</P>
<P>It is possible that the IVIG preparations used in these studies did not contain the necessary antibodies to prevent infection and that the use of preparations with known specific antibodies against common pathogens in a specific neonatal intensive care unit might be more effective (<LINK REF="REF-Weisman-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisman 1994b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The benefits of 3.0% and 4.0% reduction in sepsis and in any serious infection, respectively, should be weighed against the costs and the values assigned to this outcome. No serious side effects have been reported from IVIG to date, but unknown long-term risks of administration of blood products and the pain associated with establishing an intravenous route for IVIG should be taken into account.</P>
<P>Units with high nosocomial infection rates may want to compare and adjust their infection control policies to those settings with low rates by using benchmarking techniques. If the rates remain high after such measures are taken, use of IVIG might be justified. Prophylactic use of IVIG should be based on a full economic evaluation and a clinical decision analysis that incorporates baseline risk for serious nosocomial infection, both clinical and economic outcomes following prophylactic IVIG and values attached to infections prevented. Such analyses have not been performed.</P>
<P>Although differences in inclusion criteria are seen, as well as differences in the number of studies published at the time of the reviews and the number of statistical analyses performed, the results of our systematic review are close to those of three previous meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Lacy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacy 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Jenson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenson 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1998</LINK>). The results of these meta-analyses should encourage basic scientists and clinicians to pursue other avenues to enhance the immune system of preterm and/or LBW infants and to prevent nosocomial infection.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-06-24 10:02:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews">
<P>IVIG administration results in a 3% to 4% reduction in sepsis/any serious infection but is not associated with reductions in mortality or other morbidities (NEC, IVH, length of hospital stay). Prophylactic use of IVIG is not associated with any short-term serious side effects. The decision to use prophylactic IVIG will depend on the costs and the values assigned to the clinical outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-24 10:02:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews">
<P>A full economic evaluation and a clinical decision analysis that incorporates baseline risk for confirmed nosocomial infection, clinical outcomes and economic outcomes after prophylactic IVIG, as well as values attached to infections prevented, is needed.</P>
<P>There is no justification for conducting additional RCTs to test the efficacy of previously studied IVIG preparations in reducing nosocomial infection in preterm and/or LBW infants. It is possible that the IVIG preparations used in published studies did not contain the necessary antibodies to prevent infection. The use of preparations with known specific antibodies against the common pathogens in a specific neonatal intensive care unit might be more effective, and RCTs to test the effectiveness of such preparations may be justified. The results of these meta-analyses should encourage basic scientists and clinicians to pursue other avenues to prevent nosocomial infection.</P>
