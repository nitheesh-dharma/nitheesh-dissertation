<P>This Cochrane Review summarises evidence from 14 randomised controlled studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of scopolamine for motion sickness. The results show that scopolamine is more effective than placebo and scopolamine-like derivatives in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness. However, scopolamine was not shown to be superior to antihistamines and combinations of scopolamine and ephedrine. Scopolamine was less likely to cause drowsiness, blurred vision or dizziness when compared to these other agents.</P>

<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 3, 2004 and previously updated in 2007 and 2009.</P>
<P>Motion sickness, the discomfort experienced when perceived motion disturbs the organs of balance, may include symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, pallor, cold sweats, hypersalivation, hyperventilation and headaches. The control and prevention of these symptoms has included pharmacological, behavioural and complementary therapies. Although scopolamine (hyoscine) has been used in the treatment and prevention of motion sickness for decades, there have been no systematic reviews of its effectiveness.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:09:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>All parallel-arm, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on scopolamine versus no therapy, placebo, other drugs, behavioural and complementary therapy or two or more of the above therapies in combination. We considered outcomes relating to the prevention of onset or treatment of clinically-defined motion sickness, task ability and psychological tests, changes in physiological parameters and adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:10:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data from the studies using standardised forms. We assessed study quality. We expressed dichotomous data as odds ratio (OR) and calculated a pooled OR using the random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:11:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Of 35 studies considered potentially relevant, 14 studies enrolling 1025 subjects met the entry criteria. Scopolamine was administered via transdermal patches, tablets or capsules, oral solutions or intravenously. Scopolamine was compared against placebo, calcium channel antagonists, antihistamine, methscopolamine or a combination of scopolamine and ephedrine. Studies were generally small in size and of varying quality.</P>
<P>Scopolamine was more effective than placebo in the prevention of symptoms. Comparisons between scopolamine and other agents were few and suggested that scopolamine was superior (versus methscopolamine) or equivalent (versus antihistamines) as a preventative agent. Evidence comparing scopolamine to cinnarizine or combinations of scopolamine and ephedrine is equivocal or minimal.</P>
<P>Although sample sizes were small, scopolamine was no more likely to induce drowsiness, blurring of vision or dizziness compared to other agents. Dry mouth was more likely with scopolamine than with methscopolamine or cinnarizine.</P>
<P>No studies were available relating to the therapeutic effectiveness of scopolamine in the management of established symptoms of motion sickness.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:11:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The use of scopolamine versus placebo in preventing motion sickness has been shown to be effective. No conclusions can be made on the comparative effectiveness of scopolamine and other agents such as antihistamines and calcium channel antagonists.

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-03 12:12:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-12 09:53:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 3, 2004 and previously updated in 2007.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:12:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Motion sickness (or travel sickness) describes the discomfort felt by individuals caused by repetitive angular and linear acceleration and deceleration. The symptoms associated with motion sickness include nausea, vomiting, pallor, cold sweats, hypersalivation, hyperventilation and headaches. These symptoms often occur during travel in vehicles (e.g. cars, trains, airplanes, ships) or when in motion (e.g. fairground rides, swings). Motion is not a requirement for the disorder to manifest. Thus, one can experience the symptoms of motion sickness even when motionless, as when viewing movies shot on a shaky camera or when taking part in 'virtual reality' rides in amusement parks. An important aspect of the disorder is the propensity for the symptoms to resolve with continued exposure to stimuli, a characteristic called adaptation or habituation.</P>
<P>Previous hypotheses about the development of motion sickness held that symptoms were due to either reduced cerebral blood flow or to motion of the viscera prompting stimulation of afferent nerves in abdominal organs (<LINK REF="REF-Oman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oman 1990</LINK>). The most widely held explanation for the cause of motion sickness is described by the sensory conflict hypothesis (<LINK REF="REF-Reason-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reason 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reason-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reason 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yardley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yardley 1992</LINK>). Briefly, the hypothesis postulates that each person has an internal representation of bodily movement. This internal picture is continuously updated by information from sensory receptors such as the eyes, the vestibular system, and mechanoceptors in joints and muscles. Motion sickness develops when repeated and sustained mismatches occur between the information received from the sensory receptors and the expected internal model. It is claimed that adaptation is evidence of the central nervous system's gradual recognition that conflicting sensory inputs are being received. This leads to appropriate reductions in symptoms.</P>
<P>The incidence of motion sickness has been examined in diverse populations (<LINK REF="REF-Antuano-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antuano 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawther-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawther 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ungs-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ungs 1988</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Ungs-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ungs 1988</LINK> found that 64.3% of 238 pilots undergoing flight simulator training reported at least one adverse symptom. Lawther's (1988) study on board passenger ferries also showed similar results with 7% of 20,029 individuals reporting bouts of vomiting. A positive diagnosis of motion sickness was further established for 64% of 45 military parachutists on their first jump by <LINK REF="REF-Antuano-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antuano 1989</LINK>. However, estimates should be understood in the context of the sensory conflict hypothesis. Theoretically, all individuals may suffer from motion sickness symptoms when subject to the necessary stimulus. In this general sense, the incidence and the prevalence of the disorder is dependent on each person's susceptibility and capacity to adapt to the stimulus as much as it is to the nature of the stimulus itself. Of equal importance is the disabling nature of the disorder when afflicted individuals are unable to perform work-related tasks, although this aspect of the disorder has been studied less.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:50:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The prevention and control of motion sickness symptoms has involved the use of pharmacological interventions, behavioural therapy and complementary medicine with varying success. Scopolamine (hyoscine), an anticholinergic, is one of the most commonly used pharmacological agents for motion sickness. Other commonly used drugs include other anticholinergics (e.g. zamifenicin), antihistamines (e.g. meclozine, flunarizine), sympathomimetics and opioids. Visualisation and biofeedback are two behavioural therapies that have been examined. Complementary medical therapies that have been used include acupressure, acupuncture and herbal remedies.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:13:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Scopolamine is an alkaloid drug which is derived from solanaceous plants, chiefly from henbane (<I>Hyoscyamus niger</I>). Its pharmacological properties arise through interference with the transmission of vestibular input to the central nervous system. This acts to inhibit the vomiting impulse normally activated by motion sickness. Scopolamine can be delivered through a variety of means, including intravenous injection, ingestion of tablets or liquid formulations, or topical application with adhesive transdermal patches. The duration of treatment effectiveness varies according to the method of administration. For example, transdermal patches may be effective for up to three days, whilst tablets may need to be taken every six hours for continued efficacy. Adult doses are typically 0.3 to 0.6 mg daily, whilst smaller doses of approximately 0.006 mg/kg are administered to children.</P>
<P>Adverse effects experienced are typical of parasympathetic system depression and include drowsiness, dilated pupils, rapid heartbeat, and dry skin, mouth and respiratory passages. Overdose of scopolamine may cause symptoms of delirium, delusions, memory disturbances, paralysis and stupor. Withdrawal symptoms have also been noted after discontinuation following prolonged use and include dizziness, nausea, headache and vomiting.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-10-26 17:44:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To date, there have been no known systematic reviews of the effectiveness of scopolamine in preventing and controlling motion sickness.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of scopolamine versus no therapy, placebo, other drugs, behavioural and complementary therapy, or two or more of the above therapies in combination, for motion sickness in persons (both adults and children) without known vestibular, visual or central nervous system pathology. The review focused on the two broad areas of prevention and treatment.</P>

<P>We used Review Manager 5.1 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) for data analysis and quantitative data synthesis. For dichotomous data, we calculated individual and pooled statistics as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We gave consideration to the appropriateness of meta-analysis in the presence of significant clinical or statistical heterogeneity. We tested for heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic and significant heterogeneity was assumed if the I<SUP>2</SUP> was greater than 40% (i.e. more than 40% of the variability in outcome between trials could not be explained by sampling variation) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).

<P>In our first update in 2007, 35 studies were considered potentially relevant. Of the 35 articles assessed in full-text format, nine were excluded because of non-randomisation to treatment groups or failure to report on the method of allocation, 10 were excluded because of design (e.g. cross-over trials), one lacked an appropriate control group, one involved scopolamine only, one examined peripheral vestibular vertigo rather than motion sickness and one was awaiting translation. Therefore, 14 randomised controlled trials formed the basis of that review.</P>
<P>For the 2009 update of the review, the searches were repeated in April 2009. From independent scrutiny of the titles and abstracts, 14 potentially relevant articles were retrieved and excluded from the review because of study design (e.g. cross-over trials, narrative reviews), leaving us with the same number of studies as in 2007. Further details can be found in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table.</P>

In 2011 we ran full searches again and retrieved 16 references. Following initial screening of titles and abstracts we considered three papers further for potential inclusion, however all were excluded (see '

<P>Fourteen randomised controlled trials, with a total of 1025 participants, compared preventative transdermal scopolamine with placebo, scopolamine derivatives, scopolamine combinations, antihistamines and calcium channel antagonists. Participants were predominantly young, healthy males, only three studies having recruited female participants (<LINK REF="STD-Dornhoffer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dornhoffer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Offenloch-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Offenloch 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1981</LINK>) and three studies not specifying gender (<LINK REF="STD-Brand-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Brand 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tokola-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Tokola 1984</LINK>). A large number of participants, with ages ranging from 16 to 55 years, were naval personnel on training or service exercises. Most studies specifically recruited participants with a history of motion sickness.</P>
<P>Scopolamine was administered to participants in several ways, the most common being transdermal patches (<LINK REF="STD-Attias-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Attias 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-How-1988" TYPE="STUDY">How 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Offenloch-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Offenloch 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Marion-1985" TYPE="STUDY">van Marion 1985</LINK>) and oral tablets or capsules (<LINK REF="STD-Brand-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Brand 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dornhoffer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dornhoffer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuotto-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nuotto 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pingree-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pingree 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tokola-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Tokola 1984</LINK>). Intravenous scopolamine was tested in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Nuotto-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nuotto 1983</LINK>) and an oral, water-based solution was used in another (<LINK REF="STD-Uijdehaage-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Uijdehaage 1993</LINK>).</P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Dornhoffer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dornhoffer 2004</LINK>) compared scopolamine to the benzodiazepine derivative, lorazepam, and the antihistamine, meclozine. No studies were found comparing scopolamine with behavioural or complementary therapies. Motion sickness was either purposely induced or occurred due to natural circumstances. Sailing was the most common method of inducing sickness, with trip lengths ranging from seven hours to two weeks. Two studies used simulators to induce sickness and one study tested treatment effectiveness during a one-hour flight.</P>

<P>Results of the risk of bias assessment are provided in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. The methodological quality of the trials was assessed independently by two authors and was described descriptively (AS and JW). The included studies were of varying methodological quality.</P>
<P>All studies were reported as randomised but only one (<LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 1981</LINK>) described generation of the allocation sequence. Allocation was reported as being adequately concealed in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuotto-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nuotto 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Offenloch-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Offenloch 1986</LINK>) and was unclear in the remaining 11 studies.

<P>Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Attias-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Attias 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tokola-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Tokola 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uijdehaage-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Uijdehaage 1993</LINK>) showed a superior effect of transdermal scopolamine over placebo for preventing sickness symptoms. The risk ratio (RR) was 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 0.73) (
<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>
). A further three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dornhoffer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dornhoffer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-How-1988" TYPE="STUDY">How 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Marion-1985" TYPE="STUDY">van Marion 1985</LINK>) also suggested a superior effect of scopolamine over placebo for preventing or delaying motion sickness symptoms, but these could not be pooled due to the absence of data and poor or significant variations in reporting.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Uijdehaage-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Uijdehaage 1993</LINK> found transdermal scopolamine was superior in preventing sickness when compared to methscopolamine (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.19). When compared to the antihistamine meclozine, scopolamine showed a decrease in the mean motion sickness score (motion sickness score: 89% with scopolamine versus 59% with meclozine) (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1984</LINK>), and delayed the onset of symptoms for longer than meclozine (mean time and percentage increase from baseline: 4.32 minutes (32.47%) with scopolamine versus 0.58 seconds (8.66%) with meclozine (<LINK REF="STD-Dornhoffer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dornhoffer 2004</LINK>)). Transdermal scopolamine was equivalent to other antihistamines such as promethazine (<LINK REF="STD-Dornhoffer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dornhoffer 2004</LINK>) and dimenhydrinate (<LINK REF="STD-Offenloch-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Offenloch 1986</LINK>) in preventing motion sickness.</P>
<P>Studies comparing the effectiveness of scopolamine with cinnarizine produced mixed results. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Pingree-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pingree 1994</LINK>) found scopolamine superior to cinnarizine in preventing seasickness symptoms amongst 179 participants serving on two warships for periods of up to 60 and 40 hours, respectively. A higher prevalence of seasickness was found in the cinnarizine group (range 10% to 60%) than in the scopolamine group (range 10% to 35%). A second trial enrolling 39 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1982</LINK>) showed scopolamine to be less likely to prevent symptoms of seasickness than cinnarizine. Eighty-one percent of participants administered scopolamine (n = 21) versus 89% of those administered cinnarizine (n = 18) reported that the treatment helped either "a little" or "very much" in preventing symptoms.</P>
<P>When scopolamine alone or in combination with ephedrine was studied (<LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tokola-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Tokola 1984</LINK>), the meta-analysis showed no statistically significant results, although fewer participants treated with scopolamine alone reported symptoms. The pooled RR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.26) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Scopolamine was more effective at delaying the onset of motion sickness than lorazepam which was found to hasten the onset of symptoms: mean time and percentage change from baseline: 4.32 minutes (32.47%) with scopolamine compared with -1.35 minutes (-1.65%) with lorazepam (<LINK REF="STD-Dornhoffer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dornhoffer 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tokola-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Tokola 1984</LINK>) compared the effectiveness of scopolamine with the combination of scopolamine and ephedrine. Only five cases of vomiting were reported overall. The pooled RR was 1.31 (95% CI 0.28 to 6.00) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). A third study by <LINK REF="STD-van-Marion-1985" TYPE="STUDY">van Marion 1985</LINK> found no significant difference in the prevention of vomiting between those taking scopolamine and placebo (reported as a percentage of subjects: 27% taking scopolamine versus 30% taking placebo) at day one.

<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brand-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Brand 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nuotto-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nuotto 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pingree-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pingree 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Marion-1985" TYPE="STUDY">van Marion 1985</LINK>) compared task ability and psychological testing. These studies could not be pooled due to the differences in outcomes. Participants administered either scopolamine or placebo during calculation and an audio-visual checking test showed no marked difference in performance (<LINK REF="STD-Brand-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Brand 1968</LINK>). This lack of effect was observed in a second study (<LINK REF="STD-Nuotto-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nuotto 1983</LINK>) in which no significant memory impairment was shown for both reverse order repetition tests and paired association learning tasks in participants administered scopolamine compared with those administered placebo. There were no differences between the performance in Tapping speed, Burdon Wiersma test or Digit Symbol Test.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pingree-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pingree 1994</LINK> assessed performance impairment in participants treated with either scopolamine or cinnarizine whilst serving on two separate warships. On the first ship, the two groups reported similar impairment levels of 10% to 20%. On the second ship, a higher level of performance impairment was reported by participants treated with scopolamine (up to 40%) compared with cinnarizine (less than 10%). In the last study, <LINK REF="STD-van-Marion-1985" TYPE="STUDY">van Marion 1985</LINK> assessed the processing of information by using the Burdon Wiersma test which, performed before application of the patch and 24 hours thereafter, revealed no difference between the scopolamine and placebo group.

With 60 individuals participating, no significant difference between the two treatments was noted despite a trend toward greater drowsiness amongst participants using scopolamine (pooled RR 1.42; 95% CI 0.79 to 2.56) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). A further two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Marion-1985" TYPE="STUDY">van Marion 1985</LINK>) found no statistically significant difference in the experience of drowsiness amongst participants treated with either scopolamine or placebo, although the data could not be pooled due to poor reporting. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Uijdehaage-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Uijdehaage 1993</LINK>) comparing scopolamine to methscopolamine found no significant difference in the prevalence of drowsiness amongst its participants.</P>
<P>Drowsiness was also measured in two studies that compared scopolamine with cinnarizine. The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1982</LINK>) found scopolamine was more likely to induce drowsiness (3/21 participants) compared to those in the cinnarizine group (0/18 participants). The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Pingree-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pingree 1994</LINK>) found no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups. However, the study (<LINK REF="STD-Pingree-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pingree 1994</LINK>) reported a higher prevalence of drowsiness amongst participants treated with scopolamine aboard one of two ships used. It appeared that drowsiness levels were higher in calmer ship conditions, with nearly 60% of scopolamine-treated participants experiencing drowsiness at times of minimal ship motion compared with 35% of participants treated with cinnarizine.</P>

<P>Two studies found no significant difference when comparing the incidence of blurred vision with scopolamine and placebo (RR 2.73; 95% CI 0.89 to 8.37; P = 0.08) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Uijdehaage-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Uijdehaage 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Marion-1985" TYPE="STUDY">van Marion 1985</LINK>). A third study by <LINK REF="STD-Price-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1981</LINK> reported no differences in the participants' vision when treated with either scopolamine or placebo (results not presented graphically; P value not reported). When comparing the symptoms of blurred vision in those taking scopolamine versus cinnarizine, <LINK REF="STD-Pingree-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pingree 1994</LINK> reported a significantly greater prevalence of visual disturbances amongst participants treated with scopolamine than those treated with cinnarizine.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dry mouth</HEADING>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uijdehaage-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Uijdehaage 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Marion-1985" TYPE="STUDY">van Marion 1985</LINK>) found that the symptom of dry mouth was apparent in those treated with scopolamine rather than placebo. In the first study (<LINK REF="STD-Uijdehaage-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Uijdehaage 1993</LINK>), 7/20 (35%) participants reported dry mouth symptoms compared to 1/20 (5%) in the placebo arm. When treated with methscopolamine, the same study found a greater prevalence of dry mouth symptoms amongst participants treated with scopolamine (35%) than methscopolamine (10%).</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-van-Marion-1985" TYPE="STUDY">van Marion 1985</LINK>, the prevalence of dry mouth on days three and four was significantly higher amongst participants administered scopolamine compared to placebo (reported as a percentage of subjects: 34% taking scopolamine versus 7% taking placebo at day three, P &lt; 0.01; and 31% taking scopolamine versus 9% taking placebo at day four, P &lt; 0.05). However, there was no difference between groups experiencing dry mouth at days one and two (reported as a percentage of subjects: 26% taking scopolamine versus 23% taking placebo at day one and 36% taking scopolamine versus 25% taking placebo at day two). This may have been because the symptom of dry mouth may have accompanied nausea and motion sickness experienced early in the voyage.</P>
<P>A study (<LINK REF="STD-Pingree-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pingree 1994</LINK>) comparing scopolamine with cinnarizine reported a significantly greater prevalence of dry mouth in those treated with scopolamine rather than cinnarizine. Scopolamine was also more likely to cause symptoms of dry mouth for those treated with dimenhydrinate (<LINK REF="STD-Offenloch-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Offenloch 1986</LINK>). Five (50%) participants treated with scopolamine reported mild to moderate dry mouth symptoms, whereas no such symptoms were reported by participants treated with dimenhydrinate.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-18 11:45:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>There is evidence to support the use of scopolamine versus placebo in the prevention of sickness symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Scopolamine in conjunction with ephedrine was not significantly different, although fewer participants treated with scopolamine alone reported symptoms. Many of the other trials using other agents were far less than conclusive.</P>
<P>Trials using antihistamines as a comparator showed mixed results for decreasing motion sickness with one study highlighting scopolamine's superiority (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1984</LINK>) and the other claiming equal efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Offenloch-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Offenloch 1986</LINK>). Both studies included a small number of participants, indicating the likelihood of an underpowered study. Neither study design nor outcome definitions could have explained this heterogeneity. The variety of histamine antagonists used was the most plausible explanation, but could not be confirmed given the different types of antihistamines used within the studies and the lack of consistent outcome reporting by type of antihistamine exposure.</P>
<P>Two of the studies that used cinnarizine as comparator could not be pooled thus providing only a descriptive analysis of their effectiveness. Cinnarizine was far less effective than scopolamine but, in an alternative trial by Hargreaves, the two drugs were reported as being "statistically indistinguishable" in preventing nausea and vomiting symptoms. The reported differences could not be explained, but perhaps the aggressive motion (<LINK REF="STD-Pingree-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pingree 1994</LINK>) interacted with the drug action to result in the superior efficacy of scopolamine with an associated comparative reduction in side effects as motion severity increased.</P>
<P>Adverse effects in the form of level of drowsiness, blurred vision, dry mouth and dizziness were reported amongst the studies. A trend towards increased drowsiness was noted when scopolamine was compared to placebo, scopolamine derivatives and calcium channel antagonists. The dry mouth and visual disturbances were seen as being well-documented peripheral side effects of anticholinergic drugs rather than a manifestation of motion sickness. Conversely, participants might have had difficulty in distinguishing between the symptoms observed during motion sickness and those that were included in the category of adverse effects. In the poorly defined nauseogenic conditions that defined some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1982</LINK>), cinnarizine had less profound side effects and was better tolerated than scopolamine.</P>
<P>It is important to note that the method of scopolamine delivery varied across the studies. There were three possible delivery modes tested: oral (tablets or liquid), intravenous and transdermal, with half of the studies using transdermal scopolamine systems and the remaining testing oral preparations with one testing both oral and intravenous routes. The transdermal patch was most likely used to minimise the relatively high incidence of adverse effects seen with other routes of administration. More importantly, the main pharmokinetic difference between these delivery modes is the time taken for plasma concentrations to reach therapeutic levels with intravenous and oral routes taking one to two hours to take effect for a period of six hours while the transdermal routes take approximately eight hours to become therapeutically effective for over 72 hours. Additionally, the dosage of oral scopolamine administered to subjects ranged from 0.1 to 0.9 mg which would mean that plasma concentration levels of scopolamine would have differed between these studies.</P>
<P>Although scopolamine was seen to be effective for the prevention of sickness symptoms, methodological quality issues and small sample sizes may have limited the validity of these findings. The largest study included 179 participants and six of the 12 studies included 50 participants or fewer. No studies investigated the effectiveness or tolerance of scopolamine in children, and only two studies reported recruiting female participants. In the studies where scopolamine was found to be no more effective than a comparator (e.g. antihistamines), lack of sufficient power may have resulted in an erroneous conclusion. Furthermore, the quality of the trials varied. There were many opportunities for systematic bias as only a minority reported on an appropriate method of randomisation or on concealment of allocation, although incomplete reporting did not necessarily mean that the effectiveness of scopolamine was in doubt. Despite the potential biases that would most likely work against the intervention arm, the overall findings were that scopolamine was effective as a means of preventing motion sickness.</P>
<P>It appears that research into the effectiveness of scopolamine for treating or preventing motion sickness has declined since its peak during the 1980s. Only three of the included studies were conducted in the past 15 years. Similarly, only five of the 20 excluded studies were conducted in this time period. Examining the included studies in chronological order did not reveal any consistent pattern of dosage, method or comparators, and the general methodological quality did not improve over time.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:24:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The use of scopolamine versus placebo in preventing motion sickness has been shown to be effective. No conclusions or recommendations can be made on the comparative effectiveness of scopolamine and other agents such as antihistamines and calcium channel antagonists. In addition, no randomised controlled trials were identified that examined the effectiveness of scopolamine in the treatment of established symptoms of motion sickness.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-07-27 15:24:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The lack of high quality evidence showing the effectiveness and safety of scopolamine for preventing or treating motion sickness in women and children indicates a gap that should be a priority for future research studies. Well-designed randomised controlled trials with sufficient power are also needed to test the effectiveness of scopolamine compared to other pharmaceutical therapies, as well as behavioural and complementary therapies. The synthesis of future trials would be assisted if standardised outcome, motion condition and treatment regimes and/or dosages were used. All trials should also include a measure of adverse outcomes so that more evidence is available to compare the safety of scopolamine with other treatments.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2009-05-18 11:43:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Feedback:</P>
<P>1. The review does not examine how the effects of scopolamine (S) vary with the route of administration and the dose, nor does it describe the time course of the effects - although data relevant to these aspects are reported in most or all the included studies.</P>
<P>2. Doses and the timing of observations made in the studies are not given in the Table of Characteristics of included studies. They are needed to make clear what was done. Where doses are mentioned it is not stated whether they refer to S base, or to S hydrobromide - that makes a big difference.</P>
<P>3. The clinical pharmacology of S needs to be considered in the discussion. Four papers with relevant data, some of which should be included in the review, are:</P>
<P>a) Herxheimer A. A comparison of some atropine-like drugs in man. Br J Pharmacol 1958;13,184-192. This study measured effects of three different doses of S given subcutaneously in healthy people, using an incomplete block design.<BR/>b) Brand JJ et al. Hyoscine and cyclizine as motion sickness remedies. Br J Pharmacol 1967;30, 463.<BR/>c) Brand JJ et al. Side-effects of l-hyoscine and cyclizine studied by objective tests. Aerospace Med 1968; 39, 999.<BR/>d) Brand JJ, Whittingham P. Intramuscular hyoscine in control of motion sickness. Lancet 1970; 2, 232.</P>
<P>4. The review does not consider whether and how successive trials learnt [or failed to learn] from or built on earlier ones. Did they address new questions? Did the method improve? Why were they done? It would be useful to highlight this by arranging the studies in chronological rather than alphabetical order.</P>
<P>5. The implications for research are rather vague. It would be helpful if the authors specified more precisely what are the most urgent questions that require research.</P>

<P>Response to comment 1 and 2.</P>
<P>We have now included additional details in the 'Characteristics of included studies' that describes the timing and dosage information where available for each study. We did not do subgroup analyses of these alternative administration methods due to small numbers.</P>
<P>Response to comment 3.</P>
<P>We located each of the suggested studies however none of them were able to be included in the review due to the pre-established inclusion criteria. We have included comments on methods of delivery of scopolamine in the Discussion section of the review.</P>
<P>Response to comment 4.</P>
<P>We were unable to rearrange the order in which the studies appear in the inclusions table, however we have added a section to the Discussion which comments on when the included studies were conducted and whether any changes occurred over time.</P>
<P>Response to comment 5.</P>
<P>We have re-written this section.</P>
