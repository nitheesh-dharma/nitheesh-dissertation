<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-10 16:44:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During pregnancy, women need iron and folate to meet both their own needs and those of the developing baby. The concern is that if pregnant women become deficient in these nutrients they are unable to supply them in sufficient quantities to their baby. Low folate nutrition before conceiving increases the risk of the baby having neural tube defects. Low iron and folate levels in women can cause anaemia, which can make women tired, faint, and at increased risk of infection.</P>
<P>We included 61 randomised trials in the review with 44 trials involving 43,274 pregnant women contributing to the analyses. The use of iron or iron and folic acid supplements was associated with a reduced risk of anaemia and iron deficiency during pregnancy. There was some indication that maternal iron supplements during pregnancy could improve outcomes for babies (birthweight and preterm birth) but the evidence for this was not of high quality.There is no evidence that iron supplementation increases placental malaria.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-10 16:43:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 61 trials. Forty-four trials, involving 43,274 women, contributed data and compared the effects of daily oral supplements containing iron versus no iron or placebo.</P>
<P>Preventive iron supplementation reduced maternal anaemia at term by 70% (risk ratio (RR) 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.46, 14 trials, 2199 women, <I>low quality evidence</I>), iron-deficiency anaemia at term (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.69, six trials, 1088 women), and iron deficiency at term by 57% (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.66, seven trials, 1256 women, <I>low quality evidence</I>). There were no clear differences between groups for severe anaemia in the second or third trimester, or maternal infection during pregnancy (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.01 to 3.20, nine trials, 2125 women, <I>very low quality evidence</I>; and, RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.33 to 4.46; one trial, 727 women, <I>low quality evidence</I>, respectively), or maternal mortality (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.01 to 8.19, two trials, 12,560 women, <I>very low quality evidence</I>), or reporting of side effects (RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.83 to 2.02, 11 trials, 2423 women, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). Women receiving iron were on average more likely to have higher haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations at term and in the postpartum period, but were at increased risk of Hb concentrations greater than 130 g/L during pregnancy, and at term.</P>
<P>Compared with controls, women taking iron supplements less frequently had low birthweight newborns (8.4% versus 10.3%, average RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.03, 11 trials, 17,613 women, <I>low quality evidence</I>), and preterm babies (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.03, 13 trials, 19,286 women, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). They appeared to also deliver slightly heavier babies (mean difference (MD) 23.75; 95% CI -3.02 to 50.51, 15 trials, 18,590 women, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). None of these results were statistically significant. There were no clear differences between groups for neonatal death (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.18, four trials, 16,603 infants, <I>low quality evidence</I>), or congenital anomalies (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.33, four trials, 14,636 infants, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Twenty-three studies were conducted in countries that in 2011 had some malaria risk in parts of the country. In some of these countries/territories, malaria is present only in certain areas or up to a particular altitude. Only two of these studies reported malaria outcomes. There is no evidence that iron supplementation increases placental malaria. For some outcomes heterogeneity was higher than 50%.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-04-29 14:27:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Supplementation reduces the risk of maternal anaemia and iron deficiency in pregnancy but the positive effect on other maternal and infant outcomes is less clear. Implementation of iron supplementation recommendations may produce heterogeneous results depending on the populations' background risk for low birthweight and anaemia, as well as the level of adherence to the intervention.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-10 16:30:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-07-10 16:30:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Iron deficiency is thought to be the most common nutrient deficiency among pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Iron deficiency involves an insufficient supply of iron to the cells following depletion of the body's reserves. Its main causes are a diet poor in absorbable iron, an increased requirement for iron (e.g. during pregnancy) not covered through the diet, a loss of iron due to parasitic infections, particularly hookworm, and other blood losses (<LINK REF="REF-Crompton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crompton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-INACG-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">INACG 2002a</LINK>). Chronic iron deficiency frequently turns into iron-deficiency anaemia. While iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia, other causes such as acute and chronic infections that cause inflammation; deficiencies of folate and of vitamins B<SUB>2</SUB>, B<SUB>12</SUB>, A, and C; and genetically inherited traits such as thalassaemia and drepanocytosis (sickle-cell anaemia) may be independent or superimposed causal factors (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015a</LINK>). The global prevalence of anaemia among pregnant women was estimated to be 38.2% in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015b</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis of iron-deficiency and anaemia during pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>Anaemia during pregnancy is diagnosed if a woman's haemoglobin (Hb) concentration is lower than 110 g/L at sea level, although it is recognised that during the second trimester Hb concentrations naturally decrease by approximately 5 g/L (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011a</LINK>). Although Hb and, less frequently, hematocrit tests are used to screen for iron deficiency, low Hb or hematocrit values are not specific to iron deficiency.</P>
<P>Iron deficiency in non-pregnant populations can be measured quite precisely using laboratory tests such as serum ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and transferrin receptors. However, these tests are often not readily available and their results may be of limited value in some settings where different infections (e.g. malaria, HIV/AIDS, vaginosis) are highly prevalent (<LINK REF="REF-Nel-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nel 2015</LINK>). Furthermore, the results of those tests do not correlate closely with one another because each reflects a different aspect of iron metabolism. For example, serum ferritin concentration is an indicator of iron reserves. During pregnancy, however, serum ferritin levels as well as levels of bone marrow iron fall even in women who ingest daily supplements with high amounts of iron, which casts doubts about their true significance in pregnancy and suggests the need to review cut-off values (<LINK REF="STD-Puolakka-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Puolakka 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romslo-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Romslo 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svanberg-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Svanberg 1975</LINK>). Currently, a serum ferritin concentration of less than 15 µg/L in healthy adults is an accepted cut-off of depleted iron stores, even among pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011b</LINK>), although the review of cut-off points is recognised as a research need (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Casal-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Casal 2014</LINK>). Interestingly, the nadir of maternal serum ferritin occurs by week 28, before higher iron demands are believed to occur, a decrease only partially explained by the normal plasma volume expansion that occurs during pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ratio of serum transferrin receptors to serum ferritin has been suggested as a good indicator of iron nutrition among pregnant and non-pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2003</LINK>). Data from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999 to 2006 for 1171 pregnant women using this composed indicator showed that pregnant women in the first trimester had the highest mean total body iron compared with that of pregnant women in the second or third trimesters, and that the prevalence of iron deficiency in pregnant women increased with trimester (<LINK REF="REF-Mei-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mei 2011</LINK>). However, the lack of a standard soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) assay method and a standard reference material, limit the use and comparability of this indicator with other studies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014a</LINK>). There is still a need to improve the definition of the distribution of serum transferrin receptors during pregnancy in populations with different iron status (<LINK REF="REF-Nair-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nair 2004</LINK>) in various environments (<LINK REF="REF-Milman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milman 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>After considering various indicators, a World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) technical consultation concluded that Hb and ferritin were the most efficient combination of indicators for monitoring change in the iron status of a population as a consequence of iron supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_CDC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/CDC 2005</LINK>). Unfortunately, only two of the very varied studies on pregnant women were included, and only one of them demonstrated changes with iron supplementation. The use of multiple indicators (Hb, ferritin and sTfRs) is useful for population-based assessments of iron-deficiency anaemia, when this is feasible.</P>

<P>The consequences of iron-deficiency anaemia are serious, and can include diminished intellectual and productive capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 2002</LINK>), and possibly increased susceptibility to infections (<LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 2001</LINK>). The lowest rates of low birthweight and premature birth appear to occur when maternal Hb levels are between 95 and 105 g/L during the second trimester of gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steer 2000</LINK>), and between 95 and 125 g of Hb/L at term (<LINK REF="REF-Hytten-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hytten 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hytten-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hytten 1971</LINK>). However, the results of several studies suggest that near-term Hb levels below 95 g/L or even below 110 g/L may be associated with low birthweight, heavier placentas and increased frequency of premature births (<LINK REF="REF-Garn-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garn 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Godfrey-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Godfrey 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klebanoff-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klebanoff 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klebanoff-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klebanoff 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1986</LINK>). There is evidence that maternal Hb levels below 95 g/L before or during the second trimester of gestation are associated with increased risk of giving birth to a low birthweight infant and with premature delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 2014</LINK>). During pregnancy, low Hb levels, indicative of moderate (between 70 and 90 g/L) or severe (less than 70 g/L) anaemia, are associated with increased risk of maternal and child mortality and infectious diseases (<LINK REF="REF-INACG-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">INACG 2002b</LINK>). Favourable pregnancy outcomes occur 30% to 45% less often in anaemic mothers, and it has been estimated that their infants have less than one-half of normal iron reserves (<LINK REF="REF-Bothwell-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bothwell 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the time between birth and umbilical cord clamping has not been considered in the estimates of impact of maternal iron status and anaemia on the infant's iron reserves, even though late umbilical cord clamping (between one and three minutes) has been shown to improve them significantly (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2012</LINK>), and is recommended to prevent maternal postpartum haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012b</LINK>) and other outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014b</LINK>). Iron deficiency may adversely affect the cognitive performance, development and physical growth of infants (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Black-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2011</LINK>) even in the long term (<LINK REF="REF-Lozoff-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozoff 2006</LINK>). Moderate or severe iron deficiency during infancy has been shown to have irreversible cognitive effects (<LINK REF="REF-Gleason-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleason 2007</LINK>). A recent review concluded that correcting iron deficiency could have a beneficial impact in women's physical performance (<LINK REF="REF-Pasricha-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasricha 2014</LINK>). Studies in animal models suggest that suffering anaemia during the intrauterine period can lead to long-term chronic diseases such as hypertension, as part of a phenomenon known as fetal programming (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Haemoglobin levels greater than 130 g/L at sea level have also been associated with negative pregnancy outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Hytten-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hytten 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hytten-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hytten 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholl 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steer 2000</LINK>). Large epidemiologic retrospective studies (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xiong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xiong 2000</LINK>), and one prospective study in China (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 1998</LINK>), have shown that both low and high prenatal Hb concentrations are associated with increased risks for premature delivery and low birthweight. In fact, the incidence of these negative consequences increases dramatically when women's Hb levels, at sea level, are below 95 to 105 g/L at any time in pregnancy or above 130 to 135 g/L after mid-pregnancy. A randomised clinical trial in Mexico showed associations between prenatal daily iron supplement intake at recommended doses to be associated with high Hb concentrations and the risk for both low birthweight and premature delivery (<LINK REF="STD-Casanueva-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Casanueva 2003a</LINK>). A study (<LINK REF="STD-Ziaei-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ziaei 2007</LINK>) also showed that women whose Hb concentration at gestational weeks 32 to 36 was greater than 132 g/L had more low birthweight babies and also higher blood pressure than women with lower Hb concentrations. Unfortunately, any women considered anaemic were excluded from the study. Observational studies have shown that among iron supplemented pregnant women, and particularly among those who are anaemic early in pregnancy, a failure of Hb and/or ferritin levels to decline during the second and third trimesters, and overall high ferritin levels during pregnancy, not due to infection, are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, when some confounding factors are controlled for, the association between high serum ferritin concentrations and the risk for premature delivery was not significant (<LINK REF="REF-Scholl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholl 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholl 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholl-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholl 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The association between iron deficiency without anaemia and adverse perinatal outcomes is less clear, although some studies have shown iron deficiency to be associated with inadequate pregnancy weight gain, decreased defence against infections, preterm delivery and low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Garn-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garn 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kandoi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandoi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prema-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prema 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholl-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholl 1992</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-07-10 16:23:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Institute of Medicine recommends that women consume 27 mg/day of iron during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 2001</LINK>). Most women need additional iron as well as sufficient iron stores to prevent iron deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Bothwell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bothwell 2000</LINK>), and so direct iron supplementation for pregnant women has been used extensively in most low- and middle-income countries as an intervention to prevent and correct iron deficiency and anaemia during pregnancy. It has been recommended that iron supplements also contain folic acid, an essential B-vitamin, because of the increased requirements of pregnancy, due to the rapidly dividing cells in the fetus and elevated urinary losses. Other vitamins and minerals for which deficiencies are documented, and when requirements during pregnancy are higher, this may justify their addition to the supplementation formula, although this is an ongoing area of controversy, particularly with differing conclusions on maternal and infant benefits from various reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christian-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haider-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haider 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shrimptom-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shrimptom 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>International organisations have been advocating routine iron and folic acid supplementation for every pregnant woman in areas where anaemia is highly prevalent (<LINK REF="REF-Beard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 1997</LINK>). While iron supplementation, with or without folic acid has been used in a variety of doses and regimens, some current recommendations for all pregnant adolescents and adult women include the provision of a standard daily dose of 30 to 60 mg of elemental iron and 400 &#956;g (0.4 mg) of folic acid starting as soon as possible after gestation begins and continuing for the rest of the pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012a</LINK>). In settings where anaemia in pregnant women is a severe public health problem (40% of higher), a daily dose of 60 mg of elemental iron is preferred over a lower dose. Additionally, if iron deficiency prevalence in the country is high, (<LINK REF="REF-INACG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">INACG 1998</LINK>), or if a woman is diagnosed with anaemia in a clinical setting, she should be treated with daily iron (120 mg of elemental iron) and folic acid (400 &#956;g or 0.4 mg) supplementation until her Hb concentration rises to normal (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012a</LINK>). Recent data from national surveys from 46 countries during the years 2003 to 2009 estimated that 52% to 75% of mothers had received iron tablets during pregnancy, and that the duration of supplementation was usually short (<LINK REF="REF-Lutter-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutter 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>A dose of 60 mg of elemental iron was first established in 1959 and was based on estimated iron requirements for women during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1959</LINK>). This same dose was endorsed by subsequent expert consultations (<LINK REF="REF-INACG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">INACG 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). The use of folic acid during pregnancy was first suggested in 1967, during a technical consultation in Geneva, Switzerland. It was considered that a dose of 300 &#956;g (0.3 mg) of folic acid per day throughout pregnancy would help prevent megaloblastic anaemia, which is associated with folate deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015a</LINK>). This consultation was called three years after the start of a worldwide multi-country collaborative study in India, Israel, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Venezuela (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1968</LINK>). The recommended supplemental dose increased to 400 &#956;g (0.4 mg) per day in 1998 after various studies supported its periconceptional use for prevention of neural tube defects (<LINK REF="REF-INACG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">INACG 1998</LINK>). At the time it was acknowledged that the rationale for providing folic acid supplementation after the first trimester of pregnancy would not be to prevent congenital anomalies but that the 400 µg (0.4 mg) daily dose of folic acid would provide a safe and healthy intake for women during pregnancy and lactation, although probably more than was actually required to produce an optimal Hb response in pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-INACG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">INACG 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The tolerable upper intake level for iron has been set based on the gastrointestinal side effects associated with high levels of iron consumed on an empty stomach. Iron has the potential to cause direct erosion and irritation of the gastrointestinal mucosa, to cause oxidative damage of lipid membranes, proteins or DNA, can stimulate inflammation or, as an essential nutrient, fertilise the growth of pathogens. High-dose iron supplements are commonly associated with constipation and other gastrointestinal effects including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, with frequency and severity varying according to the amount of elemental iron released in the stomach. The Institute of Medicine has established the tolerable upper limit for iron during pregnancy as 45 mg/day of iron, a daily dose much lower than international recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 2001</LINK>), although the methodology and assumptions used have been questionable (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_mann-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schümann 2007</LINK>). In most industrialised countries, the decision to prescribe or recommend antenatal iron with folic acid supplementation to women during pregnancy is left to the healthcare personnel, and is based on the individual maternal condition (<LINK REF="REF-Nisar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nisar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanghvi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanghvi 2010</LINK>). In the United States, iron supplementation as a primary prevention intervention involves smaller daily iron doses (i.e. 30 mg/day), but therapeutic doses of up to 120 mg elemental iron daily are recommended for the treatment of anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1998</LINK>). In the UNited Kingdom, the British Committee for Standards in Haematology does not recommend routine iron supplementation for all women in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-BCSH-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BCSH 2011</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-07-08 10:35:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Several studies have shown that iron supplementation, with or without folic acid during pregnancy, helps cover the iron intake gap and results in a substantial reduction in women's risk of anaemia in late pregnancy, at delivery and six weeks postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2003</LINK>). However, the overall impact of iron supplementation interventions under field conditions has been limited, and the effectiveness of these interventions has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Beaton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaton 1999</LINK>). The limited success has been attributed to inadequate infrastructure and poor compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Mora-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mora 2002</LINK>), although few studies have evaluated these issues adequately. The effectiveness of iron supplementation for pregnant women has been evaluated mostly in terms of improvement in Hb concentration, rather than improvements in maternal or infant health (<LINK REF="REF-Beaton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaton 2000</LINK>). This narrow scope may have been an important omission in most studies addressing the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of iron and iron with folic acid supplementation during pregnancy.</P>
<P>An additional important consideration arises when providing iron supplements to women is the presence of malaria. Approximately 40% of the world population is exposed to the parasite and it is endemic in over 100 countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Of all the complications associated with this disease, anaemia is the most common and causes the highest number of malaria-related deaths. Malaria in pregnant women increases the risk of maternal death, miscarriage, stillbirth and low birthweight with an associated risk of neonatal death (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014c" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014c</LINK>). Provision of iron in malaria-endemic areas has been a long standing controversy due to concerns that iron therapy may exacerbate infections, in particular malaria in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 2001</LINK>). Although the mechanisms by which additional iron can benefit the parasite are far from clear, it is possible that lower-dose supplementation might be an effective intervention to prevent anaemia and improve malaria treatment in malaria endemic areas since less iron is available for the parasite (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2011</LINK>). The potential interaction between malaria interventions and iron interventions in pregnancy has not been well studied. Malaria intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) is recommended for pregnant women in areas of high transmission who are particularly vulnerable to contracting malaria or suffering its consequences. A total of 34 out of 45 countries in Africa with ongoing malaria transmission, had adopted IPT for pregnant women as national policy by 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2014c" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2014c</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review updates a previously published Cochrane Review on iron and iron + folic acid supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Pe_x00f1_a_x002d_Rosas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peña-Rosas 2012</LINK>) that has clearly shown improvements on biochemical and haematological parameters, and evaluates the issues related to dose and formulation as well as the potential benefits and hazards of daily iron supplementation as a preventive intervention for women during pregnancy.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of different iron treatments for anaemia among pregnant women in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Reveiz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reveiz 2011</LINK>), and the effects of supplementation with iron and vitamin A during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Broek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Broek 2010</LINK>) are covered in other Cochrane reviews. A Cochrane review assesses the effectiveness of oral folate supplementation alone during pregnancy on haematological and biochemical parameters during pregnancy and on pregnancy outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Lassi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lassi 2013</LINK>). The effects and safety of periconceptional folate supplementation for preventing birth defects (<LINK REF="REF-De_x002d_Regil-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">De-Regil 2010</LINK>), and the effects of multiple vitamin and mineral supplements during pregnancy have also been reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Haider-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haider 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramakrishnan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramakrishnan 2013</LINK>). A separate review addresses the effectiveness of intermittent iron and folic acid supplementation regimens for women during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Pe_x00f1_a_x002d_Rosas-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peña-Rosas 2012a</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of evidence using GRADE</HEADING>
<P>For the assessment across studies, we employed the GRADE approach to interpret findings (<LINK REF="REF-Langendam-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langendam 2013</LINK>) and the GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>) allowed us to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) to create 'Summary of findings' (SoF) tables (set out in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). The primary outcomes for each comparison have been listed with estimates of relative effects along with the number of participants and studies contributing data for those outcomes. These tables provide outcome-specific information concerning the overall quality of evidence from studies included in the comparison, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on the outcomes we considered. Only primary outcomes were included in the 'Summary of findings' tables. For each individual outcome, two review authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Balshem-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balshem 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>For assessments of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome that included pooled data from included trials, we downgraded the evidence from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias), indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias. This assessment was limited only to the trials included in this review and as we did not consider there was a serious risk of indirectness or publication bias, we did not downgrade in these domains.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We included cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. Cluster-randomised trials are labelled with a (C). Where possible, we estimated the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) from trials' original data sets and reported the design effect. On the basis of this information we used the methods set out in the <I>Handbook</I> to calculate the adjusted sample sizes (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We included four cluster-randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Christian-2003-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Christian 2003 (C)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoa-2005-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hoa 2005 (C)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menendez-1994-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Menendez 1994 (C)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-2008-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng 2008 (C)</LINK>). One of these trials did not contribute data to the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Hoa-2005-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hoa 2005 (C)</LINK>). For the remaining three cluster-randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Christian-2003-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Christian 2003 (C)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menendez-1994-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Menendez 1994 (C)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-2008-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng 2008 (C)</LINK>), data have been adjusted to take account of the design effect. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Christian-2003-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Christian 2003 (C)</LINK>, adjusted data were provided by the author using outcome-specific ICCs. For the <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-2008-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng 2008 (C)</LINK> trial, we adjusted the published results and calculated an effective sample size by dividing figures by the design effect calculated using the ICC for the trial&#8217;s primary outcome: birthweight ICC = 0.03. We used the same sample adjustment for all outcomes. We used the same method for the <LINK REF="STD-Menendez-1994-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Menendez 1994 (C)</LINK> trial, however in this case there was insufficient information in the study reports to allow us to calculate the design effect and so we estimated it using the ICC for Hb at term (ICC = 0.03) reported in another study with similar average cluster sizes (<LINK REF="STD-Winichagoon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winichagoon 2003</LINK>). We used this same ICC for all outcomes.</P>
<P>Where we have identified both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials reporting data for the same outcome, we considered that it was reasonable to combine the results from both if there was little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit was considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because of our experience in conducting other reviews in this area, we anticipated high heterogeneity among trials and we pooled trial results using a random-effects model and were cautious in our interpretation of the pooled results. We have indicated in the text that the random-effects model gives the average treatment effect. For statistically significant results where there are high levels of heterogeneity ((I² greater than 50%), we have given the values of I², Tau² and the P value of the Chi² test for heterogeneity and have provided an estimate of the 95% range of underlying intervention effects (prediction interval (PI)).</P>

<P>In previous versions of the review for primary outcomes we conducted sensitivity analysis based on risk of bias. We considered a study to be of high quality if it was assessed as low risk of bias in both the randomisation and allocation concealment and in either blinding or loss to follow-up. In this updated version of the review, for our main comparisons (comparisons 1 and 2) for primary outcomes we have now graded the overall quality of the evidence (taking into account risk or bias, heterogeneity, imprecision of findings and possible publication bias); we considered that this would give a better indication of the overall quality of evidence at the outcome level. The quality of the evidence is noted both in the text (<LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>) and in tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of outcome assessors (detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>The majority of the trials (34) were assessed as being at low risk of bias for detection bias, this was irrespective of whether or not a placebo was provided as we judged that for most outcomes (e.g. Hb level or iron-deficiency anaemia), the fact that there was no blinding of women or staff providing care was unlikely to impact on these sorts of laboratory outcomes. In nine cases we were not clear whether lack of blinding could lead to bias (<LINK REF="STD-Buytaert-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Buytaert 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chanarin-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Chanarin 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charoenlarp-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Charoenlarp 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corrigan-1936" TYPE="STUDY">Corrigan 1936</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hankin-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Hankin 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hood-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Hood 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerr-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-2008-_x0028_C_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng 2008 (C)</LINK>). This was because in some cases lack of blinding may have led to a change in clinical management of some women (e.g. women who developed anaemia were identified and withdrawn from trials or received additional treatment), or we thought that only certain outcomes would be blinded and others would not be (e.g. where those staff providing an unmasked intervention also collected data on side effects). </P>

<P>In this review we have included data from 44 trials, involving 43,274 women although in trials that included more than two treatment arms, we may not have included all arms in our analyses. We have organised the summary of results by supplementation regimens compared, and by primary and secondary outcomes. Most of the included studies focused on haematological indices and few reported on any of the other outcomes prespecified in the review protocol. Many of the findings showed heterogeneity that could not be explained by standard sensitivity analyses including quality assessment, and so we used a random-effects model to analyse the results. All results therefore represent the average treatment effect. Using random-effects means that for many outcomes the width of the 95% CIs is increased compared with using a fixed-effect model.</P>

<P>For each comparison we have indicated the number of studies contributing data to that comparison. Some studies, with more than two treatment arms are included in more than one comparison. For most outcomes only a relatively small proportion of studies included in the comparison reported data; for some outcomes a single study reported results; for this reason we have indicated for each outcome the number of studies contributing data and the number of women included in those studies. For those outcomes including data from cluster-randomised trials the number included is the effective sample size; that is, sample sizes and event rates have been adjusted for cluster-trials to take account of the design effect.</P>

In many cases, women who became anaemic were treated and excluded from the analysis in the trials, independently of the group assigned, so very few cases became severely anaemic.

<P>Forty-four trials compared the effects of daily oral supplements containing iron versus no iron or placebo. The majority of them (35) compared arms receiving iron alone versus no treatment and placebo. Compared with controls, women taking iron supplements were less likely to have low birthweight and preterm newborns and have heavier babies although these findings did not reach statistical significance. Results also suggest that babies born to mothers receiving iron were less likely to be born before 34 weeks' gestation. For other infant outcomes there were no clear differences between groups.</P>
<P>Regarding maternal outcomes, women receiving iron compared with those receiving no treatment or placebo were less likely to be anaemic at term (13.06% versus 35.71%) and were less likely to have iron deficiency (28.50% versus 51.33%) and iron-deficiency anaemia at term (4.37% versus 13.18%). Women who received iron supplements appeared more likely than controls to report side effects (25.30% versus 9.91%), although this was not statistically significant. Participants also had increased risk of high haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations at any time during second or third trimester and at term. Women receiving iron were also on average more likely to have higher Hb levels at term and in the postpartum period. For several outcomes where there was evidence of differences between groups, the size of the treatment effect in individual studies varied considerably, and so our results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Only nine trials compared the effects of daily iron + folic acid supplementation with the effects of same supplements without iron + folic acid. There were clear positive effects on maternal haematological status while the effects on infant outcomes were uncertain.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-04-29 15:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included 61 randomised controlled trials carried out since 1936 in 27 countries across the globe. Trials were mostly conducted during the last 20 years. There was some equilibrium between the trials that included non-anaemic women and those focused on populations with high prevalence of anaemia as well among the trials assessing early or late gestational iron supplementation. Although it was not possible to extract data from all the trials, these numbers clearly reflect the wide applicability of this review.</P>
<P>We addressed the effects of the use of iron or iron + folic acid by pregnant women, either provided alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals. The effects can be determined if the differences between the comparison groups relies only in the presence of iron or iron + folic acid, that is, we are estimating the effects of the addition of iron or iron + folic acid to the pregnant women independently of any other co-interventions given to both groups being compared.</P>
<P>Most of the trials focused primarily on maternal changes in Hb and on some haematological indices after a certain period of supplementation. The results consistently show that iron supplementation in pregnancy improves maternal haematological outcomes independently of the dosage. However, those women who consumed higher amounts of iron (60 mg of iron or more per day) tended to have higher Hb values at the end or near term of pregnancy. In some cases, women reached levels above the threshold of 130 g/L at sea level which may be associated with negative pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth, low birthweight and pre-eclampsia. Although the clinical significance of high Hb concentration is still being debated, it seems sensible to provide supplements with lower iron concentrations to those populations with lower prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency.</P>
<P>Side effects are also a clear drawback to most current iron compounds used as supplements, either alone or with folic acid. The results of this review suggest that women who consume daily supplements containing 60 mg of elemental iron or more may be more likely to report side effects, particularly diarrhoea, than those who consume lower doses per day although differences between subgroups were not statistically significant. This concurs with the Institute of Medicine's approach which set 45 mg of elemental iron as the upper tolerable limit per day based on the likelihood of having side effects (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 2001</LINK>). As a result, investigators are now testing highly bioavailable iron compounds (e.g. FeNaEDTA) that may produce fewer side effects and that can be administered at low doses, but their information in pregnant women is still limited.</P>
<P>This updated version includes two new trials, showing that the amount of evidence in this area grows slowly. Although the results indicate that iron may have positive effects on infant outcomes, the effects on low birthweight and infant weight at birth are less clear than in the previous version of this review and no longer reached statistical significance. There are two possible reasons for this. First, trials were conducted in areas where the background risk for low birthweight is not as high as in previous studies and thus the effect of supplements is less prominent. Secondly, the selection of random-effects as analytical model results in broader confidence intervals than a fixed-effect model and gives less weight to large trials with a large number of events. In the previous version, a single trial reporting an 18% reduction in low birthweight was responsible of 46% of the overall effect in this outcome while in this version the contribution of such trial was diluted to 33%.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-07-08 11:03:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The overall quality of the evidence in this review is mixed, with many studies being at risk of bias. In more than half of the included trials the methods used to conceal allocation were not described. Blinding of women, care providers and outcome assessors was not attempted in more than a third of trials, although in some studies technical staff carrying out laboratory investigations were reported to be unaware of group allocation. While for some outcomes (e.g. infant birthweight), the lack of blinding may have been unlikely to have had any impact on results, for others (e.g. maternal reports of side effects to care providers), lack of blinding may represent a potentially serious source of bias. Attrition was a problem in some studies and it was not always clear that loss was balanced across groups.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence for iron supplementation versus no iron was moderate for birthweight, preterm birth and maternal infection. The evidence was rated as low quality for low birthweight, neonatal death, congenital anomalies, maternal severe anaemia, and infections during pregnancy, maternal anaemia at term and maternal iron deficiency at term; whereas, it was of very low quality for maternal death and side effects (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence for iron + folic acid supplementation versus no iron + folic acid was moderate for maternal anaemia at term, side effects and low birthweight. The evidence was of low or very low quality for other outcomes due to imprecision and heterogeneity (<I>see </I>

<P>We were aware of the possibility of introducing bias at every stage of the reviewing process. In this updated review, we tried to minimise bias in a number of ways; two review authors assessed eligibility for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias. Each worked independently. Nevertheless, the process of assessing risk of bias, for example, is not an exact science and includes many personal judgements. Further, the process of reviewing research studies is known to be affected by prior beliefs and attitudes. It is difficult to control for this type of bias in the reviewing process.</P>
<P>While we attempted to be as inclusive as possible in the search strategy, the literature identified was predominantly written in English and published in North American and European journals. Although we did attempt to assess reporting bias, constraints of time meant that this assessment largely relied on information available in the published trial reports and thus, reporting bias was not usually apparent.</P>
<P>Assessing the quality of the evidence relating to specific outcomes is a difficult process, but we attempted to produce 'Summary of findings' tables using a transparent process. Two review authors independently assessed the evidence for each outcome for each quality domain and discussed any disagreements. The inclusion of the new trials modified the overall quality of the evidence in low birthweight from moderate to low.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-07-10 16:47:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Iron supplementation to pregnant women has been a long standing public health intervention that has been subject to multiple reviews, some of which also include a meta-analysis. In general, those meta-analyses tend to report the results in a segmented manner. Most of them are focused only on maternal anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Sloan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yakoob--2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yakoob 2011</LINK>), while others also include a few infant outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Imdad-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imdad 2012</LINK>). This topic has also been studied from the social determinants perspective (<LINK REF="REF-Nagata-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagata 2011</LINK>). Our results are not in agreement with a recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Cantor-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantor 2015</LINK>) that did not find conclusive evidence on whether routine prenatal iron supplementation improved maternal or infant clinical health outcomes, but only might improve maternal haematologic indices. This systematic review included only English-language articles and addressed other aspects such as the benefits or harms of screening iron deficiency anaemia in pregnant women. Unlike our review, the authors included also non-randomised, controlled trials; and cohort studies addressing their questions and excluded what authors had assessed as poor-quality studies if deemed good- and fair-quality studies were available.</P>
<P>A recent overview of reviews on the prevention and treatment of maternal anaemia identified 11 systematic reviews assessing the effects of iron and folic acid supplementation during the antenatal period, but only five were deemed as high quality, using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (short AMSTAR) as the assessment tool for methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>This Cochrane review is the most comprehensive assessment on the effects of daily iron supplementation on both maternal and infant outcomes. After two updates, there is consistent evidence that providing iron supplements to pregnant women as part of the antenatal care helps improve gestational outcomes and that these benefits can be observed at lower iron doses than usual, with less side effects.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-07-08 11:04:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-07-07 16:53:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Available data from 44 studies indicate that in comparison with receiving no iron or a placebo, women receiving daily iron supplements had:</P>
<OL>
<LI>lower risk of anaemia at term;</LI>
<LI>higher haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations at term and six weeks postpartum. Women who received higher iron doses tended to have the highest Hb concentrations;</LI>
<LI>higher risk of high Hb concentrations during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy;</LI>
<LI>borderline lower risk of delivering low birthweight babies;</LI>
<LI>borderline lower risk of giving birth to infants less than 37 weeks' gestation;</LI>
<LI>lower risk of giving birth to infants less than 34 weeks' gestation.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The lack of data impeded any evaluation of the effects of iron supplementation on maternal mortality.</P>
<P>Relatively few studies assessed the combined effects of iron and folic acid on maternal and infant outcomes. There were clear positive effects on maternal haematological status while the effects on infant outcomes were uncertain.</P>
<P>Supplementation with iron to pregnant women may be used as a preventive strategy to improve maternal and infant outcomes in all settings, although the magnitude of the effect may vary depending on the background risk of anaemia and low birthweight. In malaria endemic areas, it seems sensible to complement iron and folic acid supplementation programmes with measures to prevent, diagnose and treat malaria. In order to improve the success of this intervention in public health, it is important to encourage the establishment of logistic procedures that facilitate and improve accessibility to supplements and foster compliance.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-07-08 11:04:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>On the basis of the results of this review, researchers could consider investigating the following points regarding the use of iron or iron + folate supplements by pregnant women:</P>
<OL>
<LI>identify the mechanisms involved in high Hb concentrations during various gestational ages and its functional consequences;</LI>
<LI>the effects of providing other micronutrients than iron and folic acid on maternal and infant outcomes;</LI>
<LI>the assessment of effectiveness, safety, and affordability of novel iron supplementation compounds for use in public health pre-pregnancy and prenatal preventive supplementation programmes.</LI>
</OL>
<P>A better documentation of haematological indicators pre and post intervention, congenital anomalies, and side and adverse effects, including malaria-related outcomes, is encouraged.</P>

In the <LINK REF="REF-Pe_x00f1_a_x002d_Rosas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peña-Rosas 2012</LINK> update, we included 60 trials; 40 of these studies were included in the previous version of the review; but 10 had been excluded because they did not report outcomes of interest or the data reported were not extractable.

<LI>Only pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes are reported. The non pre-specified outcomes that were included in previous versions were removed from this updated version and the overall number of haematological outcomes was reduced for clarity.</LI>
<LI>We have added a description of the lay health worker setting for each trial. We have included a timeframe for haematological variables: at or near term (34 weeks or more gestational age) in addition to at term (37 weeks or more of gestational age).</LI>
<LI>We have added the outcome 'congenital anomalies' instead of birth defects as this name reflects adequately a condition existing at birth and often before birth, which involves defects in or damage to a developing fetus.</LI>
<LI>A new search was conducted (2 July 2012) and the comparisons were changed to evaluate the effects of daily tablets containing iron (alone or with any other micronutrients) versus no iron; iron alone; iron and folic acid; as well as the additional effects of iron alone or iron and folic acid when given in addition to other micronutrients in pregnancy.</LI>

<LI>the adjustment of cluster trials;</LI>
<LI>the inclusion of 'Summary of findings' tables to assess the overall quality of the evidence for primary outcomes.</LI>

<P>We have again gone through the inclusion criteria for all the trials identified in the search strategy and those included and excluded in previous versions of this review, now in an updated version after its split into two reviews to assess the effects of daily iron supplementation and intermittent iron supplementation for women during pregnancy as a preventive strategy. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Hemminki-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hemminki 1991</LINK> evaluates selective (providing iron only if participants become anaemic at any point during the study period) versus routine provision of iron supplements (providing iron to all participants independently of their haemoglobin (Hb) or ferritin concentrations). After careful discussions we have decided to exclude this study from this version of the review, as it in fact dealing with treatment of iron-deficiency anaemia, a topic covered in another review in comparison to preventive provision as here. Participants in the routine group received iron throughout pregnancy regardless of Hb level, starting at the latest in the 17<SUP>th</SUP> week of gestation. A dose of 100 mg elemental iron per day was recommended, but this could be tailored according to the midwife's judgment. Participants in the selective group were any pregnant women after the 14th week of gestation showing a hematocrit (HCT) &lt; 0.30 (Hb &lt; 100 g/L) in two consecutive visits. If the Hb was still less than 100 g/L and/or mean cellular volume (MCV) was less than 82, and a low ferritin was found, 50 mg iron twice a day as ferrous sulphate was recommended. The length of the treatment was to be two months or until the HCT was &gt;10.32 or higher (Hb 110 g/L) or higher). By request of the midwives, the treatment schedule was relaxed later during the trial: iron therapy was begun if the mother's HCT was 0.31 or below after the 33rd week. The participants received different doses of iron and also different iron compounds as decided by the health cadre workers following prenatal care. This study cannot be analysed as the same intervention as the studies randomised to receive or not receive the iron supplement or a placebo or no supplementation. We have thus agreed to exclude this study from the review and describe well the reasons for exclusion in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>

<P>2960 pregnant women were recruited by midwives in 27 maternity health centres in Tampere (15 centres) and in 5 neighbouring communities (12 centres) in Finland, and randomised into 2 groups: selective and routine iron supplementation. Routine group: Women received iron throughout pregnancy regardless of Hb level, starting at the latest in the 17<SUP>th</SUP> week of gestation. A dose of 100 mg elemental iron per day was recommended, but this could be tailored according to the midwife's judgment. Intervention group: any pregnant women after the 14th week of gestation showing HCT &lt; 0.30 (Hb &lt; 100 g/L) in 2 consecutive visits If the Hb was still less than 100 g/L and/or MCV was less than 82 and a low ferritin was found, 50 mg iron twice a day as ferrous sulphate was recommended. The length of the treatment was to be 2 months or until the HCT was &gt; 10.32 or higher (Hb 110 g/L) or higher). By request of the midwives the treatment schedule was relaxed later during the trial: iron therapy was begun if the mother's HCT was 0.31 or below after the 33rd week. Mothers were followed until the postpartum check-up, and data were collected by 5 different questionnaires and abstracted from the infant's patient record.</P>
<P>There were some changes during the trial. For example in group 2 &#8220;By request of the midwives the treatment schedule was relaxed later during the trial &#8220;or in group 1, iron doses or compounds &#8220;could be tailored according to the midwife's judgment&#8221;.</P>
<P>The study was excluded because there was not comparable control group because both groups received iron. The routine group received 100 mg of iron as elemental iron and was composed of anaemic and non-anaemic women. In group 2, anaemic women received 2 doses of 50 mg of iron as ferrous sulphate in slow release form, while for non-anaemic women it was not clear if women received routine treatment. Group 2 was separated into anaemic and non-anaemic women. Both groups received iron.</P>

<P>This project is a collaborative effort between Emory University, USA and Thainguyen University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vietnam.</P>
<P>Source of funding: Emory University, Micronutrient Initiative and The Mathile Institute for the Advancement of Human Nutrition</P>
<P>This study is timely and responds to the WHO Global Expert Consultation (2007) which identified the need to evaluate the long term benefits of weekly IFA and MM supplementation in WRA. The findings will provide the necessary evidence to policy makers to recommend weekly MM or IFA supplements to WRA to improve birth outcomes. The central hypothesis is that pre-pregnancy weekly IFA or MM supplementation followed by prenatal IFA and MM supplementation respectively, will improve birth outcomes as well as maternal and infant iron status compared to current practice of providing only prenatal IFA supplements. This hypothesis will be tested by conducting a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled trial in Vietnam.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2009-08-11 13:27:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>My trial, Hemminki 1989a, is excluded from this review and it is not clear why. The comment in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> is "Only women who were anaemic received iron in the unsupplemented group thus making any comparisons among the groups biased for the purposes of this review."<BR/>
<BR/>What bias is being referred to? Hemminki 1989a was in the previous version of this review. It was a randomised trial, analysed by intention to treat, having outcome data for all women randomised, and a high compliance (about 80% of women in both groups received the treatment they were allocated to). The 20% of women who received iron in the non-routine supplementation group was as expected.<BR/>
<BR/>There are two options for dealing with women whose haemoglobin falls below a pre-specified cut-off in the non-routine supplemented group:<BR/>1.  give them iron, as in my study where 20% of women in the non-routine treatment group had iron; or<BR/>2.  call those who take iron non-compliant and do the analysis by intention to treat, as did some of the included studies.<BR/>
</P>
<P>What is the difference between these two strategies? They seem to me to be essentially the same.</P>
<P>The effect of routine iron therapy on substantive health outcomes remains unclear. It is a real pity that you have excluded Hemminki 1989a, based on criteria I consider inappropriate: it had a large number of women, several health outcomes including long term follow up, and was well conducted.</P>
<P>A minor issue is that it is misleading to call this trial Hemminki 1989a. Although the study design was published in 1989, the main results were not published until 1991. Hence a more appropriate study identifier would be &#8216;Hemminki 1991&#8217;.</P>

<P>We agree that your trial was well conducted, had a large number of women and looked at several health outcomes including long term follow up.  We did review all publications on the work you have conducted on assessing the effects of routine versus selective iron supplementation during pregnancy. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of daily and intermittent use of iron supplements by pregnant women, either alone or in conjunction with folic acid given as a preventive universal measure. Your trial provided 100 mg of elemental iron daily with various choice of iron compounds and dosage as determined individually by the midwives to all women in the routine iron supplementation group. For women in the "selective iron supplementation group", treatment with iron supplements as slow release form for two months or until the hematocrit increased to 0.32 was provided only to those whose hematocrit was lower than 0.30 on two consecutive visits. Consequently, we have included your trial in the included studies and we thank you for the additional data you have provided us for this analysis. Your study compared the effects of routine versus selective iron supplementation, an issue that certainly deserves better understanding and that reflects current practices.   </P>
<P>We have changed the study identifier to Hemminki 1991 as requested.</P>
