The studies we identified included only women who had previously experienced postnatal depression, and had a higher risk of experiencing postnatal depression again.</P><P><B>Background</B></P><P>Postnatal depression is a common condition. Approximately 10 to 15 of every 100 women experience elevated symptoms of depression in the period after giving birth, and 5 in every 100 women will experience a depressive disorder. Symptoms of depression include low mood, loss of pleasure, and feelings of guilt or worthlessness. Postnatal depression has an impact on the mother, and may have a negative impact on the well-being of the infant and wider family.</P><P>Women with a history of depression &#8212; and particularly women who have previously experienced postnatal depression &#8212; have a higher risk of postnatal depression. Pregnant women who are not depressed, but are at high risk of developing postnatal depression, may want to consider taking measures to try to prevent depression developing in the postnatal period.</P><P>We examined whether taking antidepressants during pregnancy or after giving birth can prevent women from developing postnatal depression.</P><P><B>Study characteristics </B></P><P>We identified two small, relevant trials. All the women in these trials had a history of postnatal depression, but were not depressed or using antidepressants at the beginning of the studies. Both studies compared antidepressant medicine with placebo. Women started taking the medicine or placebo on the first day after giving birth.</P><P>In the larger study (56 women), the antidepressant given to women was nortriptyline, which is a tricyclic antidepressant. In the other study (25 women), the antidepressant used was sertraline which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI); these types of antidepressants work in different ways. The women and the researchers assessing the outcomes in both studies did not know which women were taking antidepressants and which placebo (i.e. both studies were 'double-blind'). Both studies were funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), a US government organisation.</P><P><B>Key results </B></P><P>There was no evidence that nortriptyline prevented postnatal depression. During the 17-week treatment period, 6 of the 26 women taking nortriptyline experienced postnatal depression compared with 6 of the 25 women taking placebo. One woman taking nortriptyline developed mania (a state of abnormally high arousal and energy level), and constipation was more common among women taking nortriptyline, but other unwanted, or harmful, effects did not differ between groups.</P><P>In the sertraline study, 1 of the 14 women taking sertraline developed postnatal depression compared with 4 of the 8 women taking placebo (during the 17-week treatment period). This study was very small, so we can't be sure whether the difference between sertraline and placebo is due to chance, or whether sertraline does prevent postnatal depression among women with a history of postnatal depression. One woman taking sertraline experienced a hypomanic episode (a state like mania but less severe); and dizziness and drowsiness were more common among women taking sertraline than women taking placebo.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence </B></P><P>This evidence is current to February 2018.</P><P>We could only identify two relevant studies, which had small numbers of participants and inconsistent findings, and were conducted by the same research group. Therefore we consider the quality of evidence in this review to be very low. Further studies with larger samples are needed before we can know whether antidepressants can prevent postnatal depression.</P><P>It is worth noting that no new relevant trials have been completed in the 10 years since we last examined this evidence. It may be useful for future medical studies to investigate whether antidepressants can prevent depression during pregnancy as well as during the postnatal period; and whether women who continue to take antidepressants during pregnancy (compared with stopping medication) are less likely to have a relapse of depression at this time.</P><P>We also need studies which have longer follow-ups periods; examine outcomes and side effects for both the mother and fetus or breastfeeding infant; and compare antidepressants with other preventative interventions (such as psychological therapies).</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-03-29 09:14:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Hendon"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-20 13:01:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Depression is common in the postnatal period and can lead to adverse effects on the infant and wider family, in addition to the morbidity for the mother.

All participants in both studies had a history of postnatal depression and were not taking antidepressant medication at baseline. Both trials were conducted by the same research group. Risk of bias was low or unclear in most domains for both studies. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis due to the small number of studies.</P><P>One study compared nortriptyline with placebo and did not find any evidence that nortriptyline was effective in preventing postnatal depression. In this study, 23% (6/26) of women who took nortriptyline and 24% (6/25) of women who took placebo experienced postnatal depression (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.59, very low quality evidence) in the first 17 weeks postpartum. One woman taking nortriptyline developed mania; and one side effect, constipation, was more common among women taking nortriptyline than those taking placebo.</P><P>The second study compared sertraline with placebo. In this study, 7% (1/14) of women who took sertraline developed postnatal depression in the first 17 weeks postpartum compared with 50% (4/8) of women who took placebo. It is uncertain whether sertraline reduces the risk of postnatal depression (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.07, very low quality evidence). One woman taking sertraline had a hypomanic episode. Two side effects (dizziness and drowsiness) were more common among women taking sertraline than women taking placebo.</P><P>Conclusions are limited by the small number of studies, small sample sizes and incomplete outcome data due to study drop-out which may have led to bias in the results. We have assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low, based on the GRADE system. No data were available on secondary outcomes of interest including child development, the mother&#8210;infant relationship, breastfeeding, maternal daily functioning, family relationships or maternal satisfaction.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-30 15:30:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Due to the limitations of the current evidence base, such as the low statistical power of the included studies, it is not possible to draw any clear conclusions about the effectiveness of antidepressants for the prevention of postnatal depression. It is striking that no new eligible trials have been completed in the period of over a decade since the last published version of this review. Larger trials are needed which include comparisons of antidepressant drugs with other prophylactic treatments (e.g. psychological interventions), and examine adverse effects for the fetus or infant. Future reviews in this area may benefit from broadening their focus to examine the effectiveness of antidepressants for the prevention of perinatal (i.e. antenatal or postnatal) depression, which could include studies comparing antidepressant discontinuation with continuation for the prevention of relapse of depression during pregnancy and the postnatal period.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-04-16 10:03:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Hendon"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-29 09:15:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Hendon"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-03-20 14:30:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Many women experience depression after they give birth, which is known as postnatal or postpartum depression (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=423703012114485881&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-O_x0027_Hara-1996">O'Hara 1996</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Howard-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2014</LINK>). Depressive episodes are characterised by a variety of symptoms, such as low mood, loss of enjoyment, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, loss of energy and possibly suicidal ideation. Standard diagnostic criteria for depression are used to diagnose depression in the postnatal period (e.g. the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-American-Psychiatric-Association-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Psychiatric Association 2013</LINK>). As well as the impact on the mother, postnatal depression can have negative implications for the infant and the wider family (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2014</LINK>). These outcomes may include adverse effects on mother&#8210;infant attachment, and the emotional or behavioural development of the child (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2014</LINK>).</P><P>It is estimated that approximately 10% to 15% of women experience elevated symptoms of depression in the period after giving birth, and approximately 5% of women have an episode of major depression at this time (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2014</LINK>). Women who have had one or more previous episodes of depression are at increased risk of developing postnatal depression, and this is particularly the case for women with a previous episode of postnatal depression (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2014</LINK>). The period of time in which episodes of depression are classified as 'postnatal depression' varies between studies, but often refers to onset of depression in the first three months (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Yonkers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yonkers 2008</LINK>) or six months (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Sharp-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 2010</LINK>) after delivery. However, it is important to remember that many women presenting with depression in the postnatal period may have developed depression before delivery, either before conception or during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Wisner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wisner 2013</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-03-29 09:15:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Hendon"><P>Antidepressants are medications to treat the symptoms of depression, and meta-analyses have shown that their effectiveness increases with the severity of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Fournier-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fournier 2010</LINK>). In general, medication exposure in pregnancy should be minimised when possible, and non-pharmacological interventions can be effective for the prevention and treatment of mild to moderate depression (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrell-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrell 2016</LINK>). However, antidepressant medications are clinically indicated for women with more severe mental disorders during pregnancy or the postnatal period when there are substantial risks to the mother, the pregnancy, and the fetus or infant (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2014</LINK>). Current NICE guidelines recommend the use of antidepressants for the treatment of moderate to severe depression and also for the prevention of depressive episodes in those with a high risk of relapse or a history of recurrent depression (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>). This review investigates the initiation of antidepressants during pregnancy or the early postpartum period for the prevention of postnatal depression. Antidepressants can be classified into the following types.</P><UL><LI>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): e.g. fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram</LI><LI>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): e.g. amitriptyline, nortriptyline, doxepin</LI><LI>Heterocyclic antidepressants: e.g. mianserin</LI><LI>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): e.g. phenelzine, brofaromine</LI><LI>Noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors (NARIs): e.g. reboxetine</LI><LI>Noradrenaline-dopamine re-uptake inhibitors (NDRIs): e.g. bupropion</LI><LI>Serotonin-noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs): e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine</LI><LI>Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NASSAs): e.g. mirtazapine</LI><LI>Serotonin antagonist and re-uptake inhibitors (SARIs): e.g. trazodone</LI><LI>Other unclassified antidepressants: e.g. vilazodone</LI></UL><P>The fetus and the infant may be affected by exposure to psychotropic drugs across the placenta or through breastfeeding, although exposure to antidepressants in breastfed infants is five to ten times lower than exposure in utero (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2014</LINK>). Breastfeeding women have been advised to avoid doxepin (a TCA) as its main metabolite has been found in breast milk in higher concentrations than other antidepressants (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002018.pub2#CD002018-bbs2-0033">Eberhard-Gran 2006</A>). More broadly, there are limited data on the safety of antidepressants during breastfeeding (particularly for longer-term child outcomes) but the findings to date suggest that the benefits of taking antidepressants may outweigh the risks in breastfeeding women who need treatment for depression (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2014</LINK>). The risk&#8210;benefit ratio is less clear for women offered antidepressants as a preventative intervention in the postpartum period, but it is important to note that the women who are offered antidepressants as a preventative intervention at this time often have a history of severe episodes of postnatal depression and are therefore at higher risk of experiencing another episode of postnatal depression.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-03-20 15:04:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The function of antidepressants is not fully understood. There is evidence from studies of both patients and healthy controls that antidepressants affect activity in areas of the medial prefrontal cortex and limbic system that are associated with emotion processing (e.g. the anterior cingulate, amygdala and thalamus), leading to increased activity in response to positive emotions and decreased activity in response to negative emotions (see systematic review and meta-analysis by <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002018.pub2/full#CD002018-bbs2-0050">Ma 2014</A>). Most antidepressants appear to inhibit uptake of monoamine neurotransmitters (e.g. serotonin or noradrenaline (norepinephrine)) into neurons, which increases the concentrations of these neurotransmitters at synapses (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002018.pub2/full#CD002018-bbs2-0023">Berton 2006</A>). The majority of evidence on the effects of antidepressants comes from treatment studies, but there is also evidence that antidepressants can reduce the risk of relapse of depression compared with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2003</LINK>). Women at higher risk of postnatal depression (such as those with a history of postnatal depression) may be more likely to benefit from preventative interventions and also more motivated to accept them. This is particularly relevant when considering antidepressant prevention of postnatal depression, given the possible adverse effects of antidepressant use on the breastfeeding infant (or on the fetus, if started during pregnancy).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-03-18 16:46:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2005, and previously assessed as up to date in 2007. Research into postnatal depression is important due to its high prevalence and potential negative impact on both the mother and child, as well as other family members (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=423703012114485881&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Cox-1982">Cox 1982</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2014</LINK>). Antidepressants have been shown to be more effective than placebo in treating postnatal depression (<LINK REF="REF-Molyneaux-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molyneaux 2014</LINK>); but it is also important to consider the prevention of postnatal depression, particularly for high-risk women. Other interventions have been found to be effective for preventing postnatal depression, for example psychological and psychosocial interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Morrell-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrell 2016</LINK>). However, these psychological interventions are not always available and some women may be recommended antidepressants as a preventative intervention, particularly those with a history of severe postnatal depression and those who have previously responded well to antidepressants. It is therefore important to determine whether antidepressants are effective for the prevention of postnatal depression.

The coded trials are held in the CCMDCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual, using a controlled vocabulary; (please contact the CCMD Information Specialists for further details).

If there had been sufficient data for meta-analyses to be performed on any outcomes (i.e. three or more comparable studies), we would have calculated the RR for dichotomous outcomes, the HR for time-to-event outcomes, and the MD or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING><P>We calculated the RR and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcome data. It has been shown that RRs are more intuitive than ORs and that ORs tend to be interpreted as RRs by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimation of the effect. If necessary for studies included in future updates of this review, we will attempt to convert continuous primary outcome measures to dichotomous data using cut-off points on rating scales to identify those who did and did not fulfil the criteria for depression.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Time-to-event data</HEADING><P>We presented the HR and 95% CI for time-to-event outcome data, when applicable.

We excluded a total of six of these for not meeting our inclusion criteria: one because the trial terminated due to low recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-NCT02235064" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02235064</LINK>); and the remaining five reports (four studies) as these assessed treatment rather than prevention of postnatal depression or continuation with discontinuation of antidepressants during pregnancy for the prevention of perinatal (i.e. antenatal or postnatal) depression rather than examining initiation of antidepressants for the prevention of postnatal depression. There are two primary study reports with an additional eight secondary publications for the two trials which meet the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. In addition, there is one completed but unpublished study (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00276900" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00276900</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>).

In both trials, the first dose of the antidepressant or placebo medication was provided for women in the hospital following delivery. For both studies, participants had to be aged 21 to 45 years, and not be depressed in the index pregnancy but have at least one previous episode of postnatal depression within five years prior to enrolment. <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2001</LINK> stated that to be considered to be postnatal depression, symptom onset must have been within three months of a live birth. Both studies excluded women with previous episodes of psychosis and bipolar disorder, other current Axis I diagnoses (except for generalised anxiety and panic disorder) and antisocial or borderline personality disorders. Women receiving psychotherapy or who used psychotropic medications after the first trimester of the index pregnancy were also excluded from both studies. <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2004</LINK> also excluded women with an incomplete blood count or abnormal results from thyroid tests.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING><P><LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2001</LINK> examined nortriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) and <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2004</LINK> examined sertraline (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)).

The dose was then adjusted over time based on further serum levels and side effects data, in order to maintain the nortriptyline serum level between 50 mg/day and 150 mg/mL with the optimum set at 80 mg/day to 120 mg/mL. The dose was then tapered through weeks 17 to 20 at a rate of 33% per week.

All participants in both studies had a history of postnatal depression and were not taking antidepressant medication at baseline. There were insufficient studies to conduct a meta-analysis. The first study provided no evidence that nortriptyline was more effective than placebo in preventing postnatal depression (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The second study found some evidence that sertraline may be effective in preventing postnatal depression (see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>) but the sample size was extremely small and the risk ratio, calculated for this review, was just below statistical significance. The low statistical power of this study means that we cannot exclude the possibility that sertraline is no different from placebo in its effectiveness for preventing postnatal depression, but we also cannot exclude the possibility that sertraline has a substantial preventative effect. It is not possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of antidepressants for the prevention of postnatal depression until more studies are conducted including greater number of participants.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-03-20 19:14:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review includes two trials comparing antidepressants with placebo but we identified no studies comparing antidepressants with other preventative interventions or with standard care. Both trials examined a 17-week treatment period with primary outcomes assessed immediately post treatment, meaning that it is not possible to draw conclusions about the optimal duration of antidepressant treatment for the prevention of postnatal depression. In addition, neither study addressed any of the secondary outcomes of this review regarding the effect of antidepressants on the infant or other family members, or secondary outcomes for the mother such as social functioning. In addition, neither study reported on the severity or course of depressive episodes, which means it is not possible to examine whether antidepressant use was associated with a milder symptom profile and course among women who did develop postnatal depression.</P><P>Recruitment rates were low and, where reported in <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2001</LINK>, under half of the women eligible for the study took part. This reflects many women's reluctance to take antidepressants in the perinatal period, observed in other studies and systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molyneaux-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molyneaux 2014</LINK>), which may be particularly the case for prevention rather than treatment of depression. This issue was also highlighted by one trial identified through the searches of ClinicalTrials.gov which would have been eligible for this review but was terminated due to slow recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-NCT02235064" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02235064</LINK>).</P><P>In both of the studies that we included in this review, women were only eligible if they had a history of postnatal depression. This is unlikely to be a major limitation to the applicability of this evidence to clinical practice, as prophylactic antidepressant use in the postnatal period is most likely to be considered for this group of women. No studies were identified for this review in which antidepressants were started during pregnancy as a preventative intervention. Many women will be very unwilling to start antidepressants in pregnancy if they are not currently depressed; however, some women with a recent history of major depressive episodes may stay on their antidepressants throughout pregnancy and the postnatal period to prevent relapse.</P><P>This update of the review identified no new studies, despite the last published version of this review being completed over a decade ago. This suggests significant barriers to the completion of research in this area which may, for example, be related to the difficulties in recruiting pregnant women to randomised trials and the reluctance of many women to take antidepressants during pregnancy and breastfeeding. In addition, the lack of recent trials in this area is likely to reflect the fact that research and clinical practice is moving away from a specific focus on the prevention of postnatal depression to also consider the prevention and treatment of antenatal depression, including the continuation of antidepressants throughout pregnancy to prevent relapse of depression during pregnancy or the postnatal period. For example, one ongoing study is comparing continuation of antidepressants throughout pregnancy with preventative cognitive therapy and gradual discontinuation of antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Molenaar-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molenaar 2016</LINK>). This pragmatic study would not meet the inclusion criteria for this systematic review, but should provide important data on whether continuation of antidepressants throughout pregnancy prevents relapse of depression. To maximise the clinical utility of future systematic reviews in this area, we recommend that reviews should examine the effectiveness of antidepressants for the prevention of perinatal depression more broadly (i.e. antenatal as well as postnatal), and should include trials investigating the effectiveness of the continuation of antidepressant use for the prevention of perinatal depression. Future studies should also consider the severity of women&#8217;s previous depression episodes, potentially stratifying by this in their randomisation and analyses. As described in <LINK TAG="AGREEMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</LINK>, evidence suggests that recurrence of depression after discontinuation of antidepressants may be more likely for women with a history of severe, or recent, episodes of depression.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-03-20 19:20:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The studies included in this review do not allow a robust examination of the effectiveness of antidepressants in preventing postnatal depression. Only two eligible studies were identified, which included 73 participants in total in their main analyses. Both studies were generally well conducted, with effective double-blinding for example; however neither trial was analysed on a 'once randomised, always analyse' basis as women who dropped out of the study after randomisation before taking any medication were excluded from the analyses. There was also drop-out from both studies and, although the numbers dropping out were not high, this may have influenced results owing to the small overall sample sizes. <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2001</LINK> stated that their results (that nortriptyline was not effective in preventing postnatal depression) were inconsistent with a pilot trial they had conducted on this topic that was unblinded and not randomised, which highlights the importance of high-quality study methodology in this field. There was also inconsistency between the findings in <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2001</LINK> and in <LINK REF="STD-Wisner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wisner 2004</LINK>. Finally, both studies were conducted by the same research team, which is a limitation of the evidence base to date. Overall, the results of the studies included in this review do not allow conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of antidepressants for postnatal depression, but do highlight that it may be important to consider the effectiveness of different antidepressants separately.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-03-20 19:21:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We minimised potential bias in the selection of studies by employing consistent and predefined eligibility criteria. In order to reduce potential biases we also predefined our methods for extracting data and conducting risk of bias assessment; and conducted them in accordance with guidance in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For example study screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed by two review authors independently. Publication bias may have influenced the findings of this review, as we did not search the grey literature and studies may be more likely to be published if they find that antidepressants are effective in preventing postnatal depression. However, we did search clinical trials' registries, which enabled us to identify relevant unpublished RCTs; this should limit any impact of publication bias. Overall, the review process is unlikely to have been biased, but it was limited by the extremely small number of relevant studies identified.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-03-20 19:23:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Previous systematic reviews of RCTs have shown that psychological and psychosocial interventions can be effective in preventing postnatal depression (<LINK REF="REF-Morrell-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrell 2016</LINK>); and that antidepressants can reduce the risk of relapse among non-pregnant adults with recent episodes of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2003</LINK>). There is also evidence from a Cochrane Review that antidepressants can be effective for treating postnatal depression (<LINK REF="REF-Molyneaux-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molyneaux 2014</LINK>). However, there have been very few trials of antidepressant prevention of postnatal depression and only two eligible RCTs were identified for this review. One of these trials suggested that antidepressants may be effective in preventing postnatal depression whereas the other trial found no evidence for this.</P><P>Related observational studies examining relapse following discontinuation of antidepressants during pregnancy have also had inconsistent findings. One prospective cohort study found a significantly higher rate of relapse among women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy than women who continued antidepressants (hazard ratio (HR) 5.0, 95% CI 2.8 to 9.1) (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2006</LINK>). In contrast, another prospective cohort study found no association between antidepressant discontinuation and rate of relapse of depression during pregnancy or the first two months after delivery (adjusted HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.50) (<LINK REF="REF-Yonkers-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yonkers 2011</LINK>). The difference in findings between these two studies may reflect differing severity of depression among participants. <LINK REF="REF-Yonkers-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yonkers 2011</LINK> recruited from obstetricians and general hospital settings, and found no difference in the rate of relapse related to antidepressant discontinuation. In contrast, <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2006</LINK> recruited from specialist mental health centres and participants are therefore likely to have had more severe disorders (and were more likely to relapse following discontinuation of antidepressants). The importance of ensuring that treatment needs are met for women with severe depression or other mental disorders during pregnancy and the postnatal period was also highlighted in a recent study using UK data from women in contact with psychiatric services, which found that suicides in the perinatal period are more likely to occur among women not receiving any treatment at the time of death (<LINK REF="REF-Khalifeh-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khalifeh 2016</LINK>).</P><P>This Cochrane Review is an update and did not include any additional studies beyond the previous version of this review, published in 2005. The overall conclusion of the original version of this review remains: it is not possible to conclude whether or not antidepressants are effective in preventing postnatal depression.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-20 19:25:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-02-21 11:28:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Hendon"><P>This systematic review only identified two completed studies of antidepressant prevention of postnatal depression. All participants in both studies had a history of postnatal depression, and were therefore at higher risk of experiencing postnatal depression again. It is not possible from these two studies to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of antidepressants in preventing postnatal depression. Decisions around the use of antidepressants for preventing postnatal depression need to be made through individual risk-benefit analyses which take into account the preferences of the woman as well as severity and recency of previous episodes of depression.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-20 19:25:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>RCTs with larger sample sizes and longer-term follow-up are needed. It is critical that future trials assess side effects of antidepressant use for the fetus or infant, as well as for the mother. Both of the trials eligible for this review compared antidepressants with placebo, and studies comparing the effectiveness of antidepressants with evidence-based psychological or psychosocial preventative interventions are also needed (such as cognitive behavioural therapy or interventions based on a person-centred approach; <LINK REF="REF-Morrell-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrell 2016</LINK>). No new studies were eligible for this update of the review, despite the last published version being completed over a decade ago. Future reviews in this area could broaden their scope to examine the effectiveness of antidepressants for the prevention of perinatal depression (i.e. antenatal as well as postnatal depression), and include trials investigating the effectiveness of the continuation of antidepressant use for the prevention of relapse of depression during the perinatal period.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-04-18 10:50:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Hendon"><P>The authors would like to thank the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group for their advice with this review.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">CRG Funding Acknowledgement</HEADING><P>The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) is the largest single funder of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Disclaimer</HEADING><P>The views and opinions expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the NIHR, NHS or the Department of Health.</P></SUBSECTION></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2018-03-20 21:23:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>None.</P></CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST><CONTRIBUTIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-20 16:06:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review.
