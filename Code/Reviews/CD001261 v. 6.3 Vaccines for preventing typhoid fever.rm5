<DESCRIPTION>
<P>2007, Issue 3: This review is an update of the original version prepared by EA Engels and J Lau (<LINK REF="REF-Engels-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engels 1998a</LINK>). This review evaluates the evidence available for a new vaccine (Vi-rEPA) and includes 3 new efficacy trials that were not included in Engels 1998a (1 evaluating the Vi-rEPA and 2 evaluating the Vi polysaccharide vaccine). It would also have included head-on comparisons of the different types of vaccines (not included in <LINK REF="REF-Engels-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engels 1998a</LINK>) had these direct comparisons been conducted. Since <LINK REF="REF-Engels-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engels 1998a</LINK> was published, killed whole-cell vaccines are no longer in use and therefore are not included in this review.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-22 14:14:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection found mainly among children and adolescents in south and east Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. Typhoid fever is spread by food, drink, or contaminated water. It is characterized by fever, abdominal symptoms, headache, loss of appetite, cough, weakness, sore throat, dizziness and muscle pains. The infection also sometimes causes psychosis and confusion. Mortality varies and can reach 10% of cases. Treatment normally consists of antibiotics, but problems with drug-resistant strains have been reported. Improved sanitation and food hygiene are important control measures. However, these are associated with socioeconomic progress that has been slow in most affected areas. Therefore vaccination is an effective way to try to prevent this disease. The review found 18 trials (17 with usable data): Six evaluated vaccine effectiveness only; six evaluated vaccine effectiveness and adverse events; and six provided data only on adverse events. The two major vaccines currently licensed for use, Ty21a and Vi polysaccharide, were effective in reducing typhoid fever; adverse events such as nausea, vomiting and fever were rare. Other vaccines, such as a new, modified, conjugated Vi vaccine called Vi-rEPA, are in development and appear promising. A vaccine that could be given to infants would be helpful as they are probably at increased risk of this infection.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Typhoid fever remains an important global public health problem. It is estimated that typhoid fever has caused 21.7 million illnesses and 217,000 deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Crump-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crump 2004</LINK>). However, this is likely to be a conservative estimate because availability of diagnostic testing and surveillance is limited, and the burden of typhoid fever is unknown in many developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Crump-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crump 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The highest burden of typhoid fever is seen in south-central and south-eastern Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Crump-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crump 2004</LINK>). Recent large population-based surveillance studies conducted in five Asian countries (China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) have confirmed the high incidence of typhoid fever in the region (<LINK REF="REF-Ochiai-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ochiai 2008</LINK>). Typhoid fever incidence in sub-Saharan Africa is poorly described; historically, typhoid fever within the region has been thought to occur in the form of outbreaks rather than as endemic disease. However, a recent population-based surveillance study conducted in Kenya found a high incidence of typhoid fever among children in urban settings, with rates similar to those seen in south-central and south-eastern Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Breiman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breiman 2012</LINK>). Typhoid fever is rare in industrialized nations, although travellers to endemic countries are at risk of acquiring the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bennish-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennish 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Until recently, the common view was that typhoid fever mainly affects children of school age and adults. However, it is now recognized that typhoid fever is an important cause of morbidity among younger children in areas of high incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Ochiai-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ochiai 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinha-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saha-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saha 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical features</HEADING>
<P>Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by the Gram-negative bacterium <I>Salmonella enterica</I> serotype <I>typhi</I> (<I>S. typhi</I>). <I>S. typhi</I> is spread by food, drink or water contaminated by faecal or urinary carriers excreting the bacteria. After ingestion, the bacteria spread from the intestine via the blood, where they multiply to the intestinal lymph nodes, liver and spleen. Typhoid fever is characterized by fever and abdominal symptoms. Nonspecific symptoms such as chills, perspiration, diarrhoea or constipation, headache, anorexia, cough, weakness, sore throat, dizziness and muscle pains are frequently present before the onset of fever in typhoid. Neuropsychiatric manifestations, including psychosis and confusion, occur in 5% to 10% of those with typhoid fever. Other symptoms include bradycardia, rose spots, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly (<LINK REF="REF-Mandell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandell 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Complications occur in 10% to 15% of patients, usually in the third and fourth weeks of infection. The most important complications are gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation and typhoid encephalopathy. Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common, occurring in up to 10% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Parry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parry 2002</LINK>). Estimates of case-fatality rates in typhoid fever range from 1% to 4%; fatality rates in children younger than 4 years of age are 10 times higher than in older children. In untreated cases, the fatality rates may rise to 10% to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Bhutta_x002c_-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta, 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis and treatment</HEADING>
<P>Confirmation of typhoid fever requires isolation of <I>S. typhi</I> from blood, bone marrow, stool or duodenal fluid; blood culture is the most common method of diagnosis. The Widal test identifies the agglutinating antibodies against the O (somatic) and H (flagellar) <I>S. typhi</I> antigens, which appear a week to 10 days after disease onset. However, the high numbers of false-positive and false-negative Widal test results limit its clinical usefulness (<LINK REF="REF-Bhan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhan 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Typhoid fever is treated with antibiotics. Increased case-fatality rates have been associated with multidrug-resistant strains and delays in antimicrobial therapy. Chloramphenicol was for a long time the preferred treatment for typhoid fever, but owing to substantial relapse rates and the development of bacterial resistance during the 1970s and 1980s, this drug was widely replaced by ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. More recently, increasing resistance to the latter antibiotics has prompted the use of quinolone derivatives and third-generation cephalosporins (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Potential control measures</HEADING>
<P>As humans are the only source of infection and because of the route of transmission, improved sanitation and food hygiene are important control measures. However, these measures are associated with socioeconomic progress that has been slow in most endemic areas. Furthermore, achieving control of typhoid fever by antimicrobial treatment alone requires well-functioning medical services and is hindered by the increasing problem of antibiotic-resistant <I>S. typhi.</I> Therefore vaccination against typhoid fever is a key control measure in high-risk areas (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>). In addition to the populations residing in areas in which typhoid fever is endemic, travellers to these regions as well as household contacts of typhoid fever carriers and laboratory workers may benefit from an effective vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-Parry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parry 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Typhoid vaccines</HEADING>
<P>Vaccination against typhoid fever is a key control measure; however, although they have been evaluated among populations in endemic middle- and low-income countries, typhoid fever vaccines have been used predominantly among travellers from high-income countries. This situation is changing, thanks to the availability of high-quality burden of disease data from endemic countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ochiai-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ochiai 2008</LINK>) and to the experience of typhoid vaccination programs in Thailand, China, Vietnam and India (<LINK REF="REF-DeRoeck_x002c_-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeRoeck, 2008</LINK>), and of vaccine demonstration projects in five Asian countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ochiai_x002c_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ochiai, 2007</LINK>). A 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) position paper on the use of typhoid vaccines concluded that given the continued high burden of disease and increasing antibiotic resistance, countries should consider the programmatic use of typhoid vaccines for controlling endemic disease (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>). Despite this recommendation, very few typhoid endemic countries have implemented a typhoid vaccination programme (<LINK REF="REF-Maurice_x002c_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maurice, 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two typhoid vaccines are currently available internationally: the live oral Ty21a vaccine (an attenuated strain of <I>S. typhi</I>) and the parenteral Vi polysaccharide (based on the purified capsular polysaccharide <I>S. typhi</I> Vi antigen).</P>
<P>Researchers are working to develop a low-cost typhoid vaccine that is effective in children younger than two years, and that can therefore be incorporated into the infant EPI (Expanded Programme on Immunization) schedule. Typhoid vaccine development is currently moving in two main directions: the development of Vi conjugate vaccines, and the development of an improved live oral vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Inactivated whole-cell typhoid vaccine</HEADING>
<P>Vaccines of this type were introduced in 1896 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). Their efficacy was established only in 1960 in controlled trials in Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, Poland and Guyana. The 1998 version of this Cochrane Review demonstrated that two doses of this type of vaccine resulted in 73% efficacy over three years (95% confidence interval 65% to 80%) (<LINK REF="REF-Engels-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engels 1998a</LINK>). Different methods of inactivating cells of <I>S. typhi</I> have been used to prepare these vaccines: acetone-inactivated, alcohol-inactivated or heat-inactivated and phenol preserved. In field trials, the vaccine has been associated with fever and systemic reactions in 9% to 34% of recipients, and with short absences from work or school in 2% to 17% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Therefore, the inactivated whole-cell typhoid vaccine is considered unsuitable for use as a public health vaccine, and, although licensed, it is no longer available for use (<LINK REF="REF-Garmory-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garmory 2002</LINK>). Consequently, we have not included killed whole-cell vaccines in this update.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ty2la vaccine</HEADING>
<P>This live oral vaccine is available as an enteric-coated capsule or liquid formulation. It is given in three doses every other day and is approved for use in children at least 5 years of age. It elicits protection that starts 10 to 14 days after the third dose. Travellers should be revaccinated annually, and those living in disease endemic areas every three years. A theoretical question associated with the Ty21a vaccine is whether it reverts to virulence; however, such hypothetical effects have never been documented in any of the multiple large field trials conducted (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 2007 version of this Cochrane review found that compared with placebo, the TY21a vaccine provided statistically significant protection over the first three years following vaccination, and that this vaccine was not associated with an increased rate of mild adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 2007a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vi polysaccharide vaccine</HEADING>
<P>The Vi polysaccharide vaccine is given as a single parenteral dose. Protection begins seven days after injection, and maximum protection is reached 28 days after injection, when the highest antibody concentration is attained (<LINK REF="REF-Garmory-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garmory 2002</LINK>). This vaccine is approved for persons of 2 years of age and older. Revaccination every three years is recommended.</P>
<P>The 2007 version of this Cochrane review found that this vaccine provided protection in Year 1 and in Year 2 but not in Year 3 (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 2007a</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vi-rEPA vaccine</HEADING>
<P>A new, modified Vi vaccine conjugated to a nontoxic recombinant <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>exotoxin A (rEPA) has been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among children 2 to 5 years of age. This vaccine (Vi-rEPA) has the potential of being immunogenic in infants younger than age 2 (<LINK REF="REF-Parry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parry 2002</LINK>).

Potentially relevant articles, according to at least one review author, were obtained in full-text format. We applied the inclusion criteria for the final decision regarding eligibility. We also checked that trials were independent, that is, we looked for multiple publications of the same trial and made sure that we included each trial only once.

<P>We (E Anwar and E Goldberg) independently extracted data into a standard form; a third review author (M Paul) extracted the data in cases of disagreement. We discussed data extraction, documented decisions and, when necessary, contacted the trial authors for clarification or additional details. E Anwar entered data into <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-5" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 5</LINK>. We aimed to extract data according to an intention-to-treat analysis. If a discrepancy was noted in the number randomly assigned and the numbers analyzed in each treatment group, we reported this information. We recorded the surveillance method used to assess outcomes in each trial, categorizing it as active (staff entry into the field to identify cases or establishment of additional study clinics), intermediate (reliance on existing clinics and encouragement to evaluate participants for typhoid fever) or passive (no increase in surveillance). We also recorded the unit of randomization and indicated whether trials were adjusted for cluster-randomization in the analysis.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcome measures, we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event and the number analyzed in each treatment group. For trials randomly assigned using clusters (cluster-RCTs) we extracted cluster-adjusted risk ratios when available; we also recorded the number of clusters in the trial, the average size of clusters and the unit of randomization (eg, household or institution). The statistical methods used to analyze the trial results were documented, along with details describing whether these methods were adjusted for clustering or for other co-variables.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-10-24 09:13:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We (E Anwar and E Goldberg) independently assessed the risk of bias in included trials; in cases of disagreement, we consulted a third review author (M Paul). We took an individual component approach to quality assessment by using five variables: generation of allocation sequence; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and investigators; inclusion of all randomly assigned participants in the analysis; and reporting of all stated outcomes. We categorized generation of the allocation sequence and allocation concealment as adequate, unclear, or inadequate by using the approach described in <LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>. We recorded whether trials used single, double or no blinding, and whether all randomly assigned participants were included in the results. We classified inclusion of all randomly assigned participants in the analysis as adequate if at least 90% and as inadequate if less than 90%.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-10-24 09:15:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If a single reference included more than one trial, we labelled the trials separately using a letter (eg, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997a-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997a CHN</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1997b-CHN" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1997b CHN</LINK>); if a single trial compared several vaccine arms with a control arm, we labelled the arms separately using a roman numeral (eg, <LINK REF="STD-Black-1990i-CHL" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1990i CHL</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Black-1990ii-CHL" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1990ii CHL</LINK>). To avoid including data for controls more than once in the same comparison, we divided the placebo group into equal parts while assuming equal incidence in these groups.</P>
<P>We combined dichotomous data from trials that randomly assigned individuals by using risk ratios (RRs) and presented them with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We interpreted the results as efficacy, defined as 1-RR and expressed as a percentage. We pooled cluster-RCT data that had been adjusted for clustering with data from trials that randomly assigned individuals (individual-RCTs) using the generic inverse variance method. When the results of a cluster-RCT had not been adjusted for clustering, we did not pool the data but presented the data in the additional table section.</P>
<P>We explored the following potential sources of heterogeneity in subgroup analyses: number of doses; length of follow-up; and vaccine type (Ty21a vaccine, Vi polysaccharide vaccine or Vi-rEPA) and age (if data were available). We rounded to the nearest year when trials included follow-up for only part of a year.</P>
<P>We calculated cumulative three-year efficacy, defined as efficacy for the entire three-year period, by vaccine type, as above. We also recorded cumulative data on vaccine efficacy for longer than three years of follow-up, if available. We analyzed efficacy per year and cumulative efficacy, as they provide different information. Analyses per year show whether the effect of the vaccine decreases over time, and cumulative efficacy demonstrates efficacy overall, for a given period, regardless of whether changes over time occurred within this period.</P>
<P>We extracted data on adverse events from trials comparing a typhoid fever vaccine with placebo, and from trials comparing a typhoid fever vaccine with a different typhoid fever vaccine. When the occurrence of adverse events was reported after each of several doses, we extracted only the occurrence after the first dose. Similarly, when reports provided estimates of the incidence of adverse events for different time points after vaccination, we presented the data corresponding to 24 hours after vaccination.</P>
<P>We assessed heterogeneity by inspecting the forest plots to detect overlapping confidence intervals and by applying the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test with a P-value of 0.10 indicating statistical significance and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic with a value of 50% used to denote moderate levels of heterogeneity. The random-effects model was used throughout the review.</P>
<P>We calculated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) (1/reduction in risk of typhoid fever attributable to vaccination) for each type of vaccine based on the cumulative 2.5- to 3-year point estimate and the incidence of typhoid fever in control groups of trials assessing the given vaccination.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>The quality of evidence across each outcome measure was assessed using the GRADE approach. The quality rating across studies has one of four levels: high, moderate, low or very low. Randomized trials are initially categorized as high quality but can be downgraded after assessment of five criteria: risk of bias, consistency, directness, imprecision and publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).

We contacted the cluster-randomized study authors to obtain unpublished cluster-adjusted results for efficacy at Year 2 following vaccination. We were therefore able to pool the results from the individually randomized RCTs and the cluster-adjusted RCTs using the generic inverse variance method.</P>
<P>The efficacy of the Vi polysaccharide vaccine was 69% at Year 1 (95% CI 63% to 74%; three trials, 99,797 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>), 59% at Year 2 (95% CI 45% to 69%; four trials, 194,969 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>) and 50% at Year 3 based on a single trial (95% CI 22% to 68%, 11,384 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>).

We were therefore unable to conduct subgroup analysis by age. Unadjusted results by age from the two cluster-RCTs are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. The cluster-randomized trial conducted in India (<LINK REF="STD-Sur-2009-IND" TYPE="STUDY">Sur 2009 IND</LINK>) found that compared with control, the Vi polysaccharide vaccine provided significant protection for children 2 to 5 years of age two years after vaccination (efficacy 59%, 95% CI 18% to 79%). However, contrary to these results, the cluster-randomized trial conducted in Pakistan (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2012-PAK" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2012 PAK</LINK>) showed no protection among children between two and five years of age compared with placebo at two years after vaccination (efficacy -30%, 95% CI -183% to 40%).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-11-28 16:13:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the absence of trials directly comparing different types of typhoid vaccines, we provide an indirect means of comparing the efficacy of different vaccines. The cumulative efficacy at 2.5 to 3 years for the Ty21a vaccine (3 doses) and the Vi polysaccharide vaccine was 48% (95% CI 34% to 58%) and 55% (95% CI 30% to 70%), respectively. The cumulative efficacy of the Vi-rEPA vaccine at 3.8 years was higher (89%, 95% CI 76% to 97%), but this vaccine is unlicensed. Adverse events were mild in nature and, for the most, were not significantly different between vaccine and placebo groups.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ty21a vaccine (three doses)</HEADING>
<P>Although the efficacy of the Ty21a vaccine was evaluated in five separate trials, four of these were cluster-RCTs that did not account for this design in the analysis and therefore were not included in the meta-analyses. In general, the cluster-RCTs suggested greater efficacy of the Ty21a vaccine, as would be expected in trials that do not adjust appropriately for the effect of clustering. The data for the efficacy of this vaccine therefore were derived from one three-arm individually randomized RCT conducted in Indonesia in the 1980s. Further evidence from other settings would be valuable in proving the generalizability of these findings.</P>
<P>None of the studies presented subgroup data by age. Therefore, we cannot report on efficacy of this vaccine in different age groups.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vi polysaccharide vaccine (one dose)</HEADING>
<P>Evidence available from four trials conducted in four different settings (two high-incidence settings: India and Pakistan; and two medium-incidence settings: China and South Africa) demonstrates that the Vi polysaccharide vaccine is efficacious for the first two years after vaccination. One trial from South Africa conducted in the 1980s provided efficacy data at three years.</P>
<P>Two recent cluster-RCTs presented unadjusted efficacy results stratified by age with contrasting results (presented in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The cluster-RCT conducted in India (<LINK REF="STD-Sur-2009-IND" TYPE="STUDY">Sur 2009 IND</LINK>) found that compared with control, the ViPS vaccine provided significant protection in children 2 to 5 years of age two years after vaccination. However, contrary to these results, the cluster-RCT conducted in Pakistan (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2012-PAK" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2012 PAK</LINK>) did not show any protection among children between two and five years of age compared with placebo. The reasons for the difference in effectiveness by age are unclear. The two trials differed in methodology, with the trial in India taking a mass vaccination approach (vaccinating the entire population) and the trial in Pakistan targeting only children. The trial conducted in India, which took a mass vaccination approach, demonstrated indirect protection (herd immunity) within the population under study; this was not seen in the trial in Pakistan, in which only children were vaccinated. It may be that this indirect protection led to reduced overall transmission within the intervention clusters and a reduced incidence of typhoid fever among young children compared with control clusters observed within the Indian trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vi-rEPA vaccine (two doses)</HEADING>
<P>Evidence of the efficacy of this vaccine is available from a single trial conducted in Vietnam (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2001-VNM" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2001 VNM</LINK>). This single study assessed efficacy of the vaccine only in children two to five years of age; therefore vaccine efficacy in different settings and age groups is unknown.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ty21a vaccine (three doses)</HEADING>
<P>Evidence obtained for the protective efficacy of the Ty21a vaccine was judged to be of moderate quality.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vi polysaccharide vaccine (one dose)</HEADING>
<P>Evidence obtained for the protective efficacy of the Vi polysaccharide vaccine was judged to be of high quality at Year 1 and of moderate quality at Year 2. At Year 2, the quality was downgraded for inconsistency&#8212;the magnitude of the protective effect varied between trials from 34% to 69% (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 72%). The reason for this may be the different efficacy of the vaccine within different age groups, with one cluster trial (<LINK REF="STD-Khan-2012-PAK" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2012 PAK</LINK>) finding that compared with control, the vaccine did not provide significant protection to children between 2 and 5 years of age.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vi-rEPA vaccine (two doses)</HEADING>
<P>Evidence obtained for the protective efficacy of the Vi-rEPA vaccine was judged to be of moderate quality. The quality was downgraded for indirectness&#8212;the vaccine has been evaluated only in children 2 to 5 years of age in one high-incidence setting (Vietnam), and studies of participants of different ages conducted elsewhere would be important before this result can be widely generalized.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence obtained for the adverse event of fever was downgraded for inconsistency (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 89% Year 1; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 85% Year 2). The reason for this heterogeneity is unclear, as both trials were conducted among children younger than 5 years in Vietnam. Further investigation of the potential adverse events of this vaccine is warranted.</P>

<P>Based on the available evidence, the currently licensed Ty21a and Vi polysaccharide vaccines are efficacious and safe public health measures for preventing typhoid fever. Factors such as costs, availability and convenience of administration may determine which vaccine is chosen for use.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-10-24 09:36:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An effective typhoid vaccine is needed for young children. Neither the Vi polysaccharide vaccine nor the Ty21a vaccine is licensed for children younger than 2 years of age. Given the finding that typhoid fever affects infants (<LINK REF="REF-Saha-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saha 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinha-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 1999</LINK>), development of a vaccine suitable for this age group is required. Future trials should be sufficiently powered to present results stratified by age group. This would mean that vaccine efficacy in different groups could be analyzed and would ensure that vaccine delivery can be targeted appropriately (eg, via a school-based programme or through the expanded programme of vaccination (EPI)).</P>
<P>None of the included trials compared different types of vaccines used to prevent typhoid fever. Such future comparisons may be helpful in allowing direct conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of the vaccines, although such evidence would not necessarily promote the introduction of vaccines against typhoid fever to new settings and would require substantial resources.</P>
<P>Future trials should conduct analyses suited to their design; cluster-randomization should be accounted for in sample size calculations and in analyses of results.</P>
