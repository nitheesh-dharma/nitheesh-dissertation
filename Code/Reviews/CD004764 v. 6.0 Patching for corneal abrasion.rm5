<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
<BR/>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out what effect using an eye patch for corneal abrasions has on healing and pain relief compared with not patching. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 12 studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key messages</B>
<BR/>Patching probably does not speed up healing and may not have an important effect on pain relief. None of the studies provided information on the effect of patching on larger abrasions.</P>
<P>
<B>What was studied in the review?</B>
<BR/>The cornea is the transparent outer layer of the eye. Corneal abrasions can result from scratches or superficial damage to the cornea. These are common problems which can be very painful. A common treatment option is to place a patch over the eye. This may have an impact on how long it takes for the abrasion to heal. It may also provide pain relief.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review?</B>
<BR/>The review authors found 12 relevant studies. 6 were from North America, 5 from Europe, and 1 from South America (Brazil). These studies compared the use of eye patches with no patching.</P>
<P>People receiving a patch may be less likely to have a healed corneal abrasion after 24 hours compared with people not receiving a patch (low certainty evidence). Using eye patches probably makes little or no difference to the number of people whose abrasion heals after 48 and 72 hours (moderate certainty evidence).</P>
<P>Corneal abrasions in people receiving patches probably take slightly longer to heal than in people not receiving patches but the difference is small and probably unimportant (moderate certainty evidence).</P>
<P>Using eye patches may lead to more pain at 24 hours (low certainty evidence). However, the range where the actual effect may be shows that eye patches may lead to more pain, but may also lead to less pain.</P>
<P>People with corneal abrasions frequently experience sensitivity to light, watery eyes, a foreign body sensation and blurred vision. There was little evidence to suggest any difference in these symptoms in people with or without a patch.</P>
<P>There were limited data available on quality of life, visual acuity and adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is this review?</B>
<BR/>The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 9 May 2016.</P>

<P>Published audits have demonstrated that corneal abrasions are a common presenting eye complaint.

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-09-09 19:50:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa  Shah">
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of patching for corneal abrasion on healing and pain relief.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-05-23 14:15:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to May 2016), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to May 2016), System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenGrey) (January 1995 to May 2016), the ISRCTN registry (<A HREF="http://www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch">www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch</A>), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en">www.who.int/ictrp/search/en</A>). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 9 May 2016. We also searched the reference lists of included studies, unpublished 'grey' literature and conference proceedings and contacted pharmaceutical companies for details of unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared patching the eye with no patching to treat simple corneal abrasions.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-06-15 14:36:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Investigators were contacted for further information regarding the quality of trials. The primary outcome was healing at 24, 48 and 72 hours while secondary outcomes included measures of pain, quality of life and adverse effects. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-08 14:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 12 trials which randomised a total of 1080 participants in the review. Four trials were conducted in the United Kingdom, another four in the United States of America, two in Canada, one in Brazil and one in Switzerland. Seven trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains and one trial was judged to be low risk of bias in all domains. The rest were a combination of low risk or unclear.</P>
<P>People receiving a patch may be less likely to have a healed corneal abrasion after 24 hours compared to those not receiving a patch (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.00, 7 trials, 531 participants, low certainty evidence). Similar numbers of people in the patch and no-patch groups were healed by 48 hours (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02, 6 trials, 497 participants, moderate certainty evidence) and 72 hours (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05, 4 trials, 430 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Participants receiving a patch took slightly longer to heal but the difference was small and probably unimportant (mean difference (MD) 0.14 days longer, 95% CI 0 to 0.27 days longer, 6 trials, 642 participants, moderate certainty evidence).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Ten trials reported pain scores. Most studies reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS). It was not possible to pool the data because it was skewed. In general, similar pain ratings were seen between patch and no-patch groups. Data from two trials reporting presence or absence of pain at 24 hours was inconclusive. There was a higher risk of reported pain in the patch group but wide confidence intervals compatible with higher or lower risk of pain (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.65, 2 trials, 193 participants, low certainty evidence). Five trials compared analgesic use between the patch and no-patch groups. Data from three of these trials could be combined and suggested similar analgesic use in the patch and no-patch groups but with some uncertainty (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.32, 256 participants, low certainty evidence). Frequently reported symptoms included photophobia, lacrimation, foreign body sensation and blurred vision but there was little evidence to suggest any difference in these symptoms in people with or without a patch.</P>
<P>Activities of daily living (ADL) were assessed in one study involving children. There was little difference in ADL with the exception of walking which was reported to be more difficult with a patch on: VAS 1.7 cm (SD 2.1) versus 0.3 cm (SD 0.7).</P>
<P>Complication rates were low across studies and there is uncertainty about the relative effects of patching or not patching with respect to these (RR 3.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 12.05, 8 trials, 660 participants, low certainty evidence). Three trials reporting rates of compliance to treatment found that 22% of participants did not have their eye patches during follow-up. No-patch groups generally received more adjuvant treatment with antibiotics or cycloplegics, or both, than the patch group. There were limited data on the effect of patching on abrasions greater than 10mm<SUP>2 </SUP>in size.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-08 09:43:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials included in this review suggest that treating simple corneal abrasions with a patch may not improve healing or reduce pain. It must be noted that, in these trials, participants who did not receive a patch were more likely to receive additional treatment, for example with antibiotics. Overall we judged the certainty of evidence to be moderate to low. Further research should focus on designing and implementing better quality trials and examining the effectiveness of patching for large abrasions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-06-12 00:50:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Lim">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-05-27 16:25:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The cornea is the transparent outer layer of the eye. Besides its crucial role in refraction, the cornea also functions as a protective barrier against infection and trauma. It comprises five layers, with the corneal epithelium located most anteriorly. Corneal abrasions are superficial defects involving the corneal epithelium that mostly arise from mechanical injuries. In fact, corneal abrasions are among the most frequently encountered ocular conditions in eye emergency departments (<LINK REF="REF-Lubeck-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubeck 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaughan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaughan 1995</LINK>). A published audit ranked corneal abrasions as the eighth most common condition diagnosed in a series of 274 consecutive cases in the accident and emergency department of a regional eye hospital in Hong Kong (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2003</LINK>). In the same audit, external eye foreign bodies were the second most commonly treated condition. Corneal foreign bodies are often associated with corneal abrasions as an epithelial defect remains on removal. Eye injuries lead to significant morbidity and lost productivity. A major United States automotive corporation found an annual incidence of 15 eye injuries per 1000 employees, with a third of workers unable to resume normal duties for at least one day (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Corneal abrasions are also a common presenting condition in general accident and emergency departments. An audit of US emergency departments (<LINK REF="REF-McGwin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGwin 2005</LINK>) found that contusions or abrasions (44.4%) were the most common cause of ophthalmic-based presentations in this setting, with foreign bodies (30.8%) identified as the next most common presentation. If one were to extrapolate the findings of a British audit of general emergency departments (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1987</LINK>) and consider 3% of new admissions to be eye-related trauma, then the total number of new cases of eye injuries would be approximately 420,000 per year in England alone (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2004</LINK>). This number is based on the total number of presentations to accident and emergency departments in one year. Two American audits of US emergency departments have estimated the incidence of eye-related presentations as between 315 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-McGwin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGwin 2005</LINK>) and 447.1 per 100,000 population (<LINK REF="REF-Nash-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nash 1998</LINK>). In England, there are a number of emergency departments specifically for ophthalmology presentations where the proportion of corneal abrasions and foreign body injuries is much higher (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2003</LINK>). A recent audit of an eye emergency service in Ireland reported that corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies were the most common causes for traumatic eye presentations, making up 28.4% and 26.9% of traumatic ophthalmic presentations (<LINK REF="REF-Vartsakis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vartsakis 2014</LINK>). In addition general practitioners and optometrists would likely deal with a significant proportion of corneal abrasions and therefore one can infer that this estimate of the total yearly number of corneal abrasions is conservative at best and underestimates the true incidence of this condition.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-05-06 11:39:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The management of a corneal abrasion with a patch (some form of occlusion of the affected eye) and topical antibiotics was the recommended therapy for corneal abrasion in many references (<LINK REF="REF-Catalano-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catalano 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cullom-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullom 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaw 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parrish-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parrish 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pavan_x002d_Langston-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavan-Langston 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webster-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 1987</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-06-12 00:50:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Lim">
<P>The practice of patching corneal abrasions has been questioned, with a number of trials suggesting no benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Hulbert-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hulbert 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirkpatrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkpatrick 1993</LINK>). Many of these trials had small numbers of participants and therefore lacked the statistical power to demonstrate any differences. A systematic review on the use of patching was completed in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Flynn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flynn 1998</LINK>). This was reviewed by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination which identified several areas for improvement: only a single author was involved in assessing the validity and quality of studies; the methods for selecting studies were not stated; and eligible studies were restricted to those published in English (<LINK REF="REF-CRD-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRD 2006</LINK>). A second review, published in a Japanese journal, was restricted to trials published in the English language with searches restricted to only one database (<LINK REF="STD-Yamada-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yamada 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, new randomised controlled trials on the topic have been published since these reviews were prepared.</P>

<P>Additional handsearching focused on reference lists and abstracts/proceedings of scientific meetings held on the subject. In particular, we searched the proceedings of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO). For the abstracts from 2002, we performed electronic searches using the key words: corneal abrasion; patch*; occlusion; abrasion; trauma; foreign bod*. For abstracts from 1993 to 2001 the ARVO proceedings index was used searching through sections on 'Cornea' and checking subsections of 'Wound healing', 'Abrasion', 'Epitheli*'.</P>
<P>We contacted the authors of relevant published studies to help identify unpublished data. In March 2004 we contacted companies and pharmaceutical firms that produce eye patches and topical antibiotics (including GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Alcon, Troge, Sigma, Novartis, CibaVision) for unpublished data.</P>

<P>All included studies were parallel group studies (i.e. people were randomly allocated to treatment). It was not clearly described how eyes were dealt with. In general corneal abrasions may be expected to occur predominantly in one eye and we have assumed that one eye per person only was included. Only one trial reported two bilateral cases (<LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK>). In these cases one eye was patched and the other not patched. It was difficult to distinguish this information from the complete dataset and was therefore ignored this in the analysis.</P>

<P>The initial search strategy resulted in a total of 74 reports of trials.

One further paper was a letter that contained enough information about a new trial to include its results in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK>). One study was subsequently excluded when translated since the two groups in the trial had different types of patches applied and there was no control group without patching (<LINK REF="STD-Gregersen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gregersen 1991</LINK>). Another randomised controlled trial was excluded as the characteristics of the participants did not fit our selection criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Kurt-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kurt 2003</LINK>). 11 papers were included in the review. The remaining 25 papers were either letters or comments made about trials that had been conducted.</P>

<P>The four earliest trials were conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) (<LINK REF="STD-Hulbert-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hulbert 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirkpatrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkpatrick 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK>). Four further trials were conducted in the United States of America (USA) (<LINK REF="STD-Campanile-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campanile 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1996</LINK>), two in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>), one in Brazil (<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK>) and one in Switzerland (<LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK>). All of the participants had a recent, simple corneal abrasion. Three trials excluded participants with a corneal abrasion secondary to a corneal foreign body (<LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirkpatrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkpatrick 1993</LINK>). Five trials included data on participants with corneal abrasions specifically related to removal of corneal foreign bodies (<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hulbert-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hulbert 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Most trials had two treatment groups with participants randomised to receive a patch (a form of occlusion of the affected eye) or no patch. One trial had three intervention arms (<LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK>) and in this review we only considered participants in the patch and no-patch groups. All the trials included a form of concurrent medication used in both treatment groups, for example antibiotic or cycloplegic eye drops. There were often differences in the formulation and administration of these additional drops between the two groups. For instance, participants in the patched group may have received one dose of an ointment-based formulation in 24 hours, while the no-patch group may have been instructed to administer three or four doses of a topical solution.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of outcome measures</HEADING>

Two trials measured mean time to healing (<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK>).

<P>All authors of included studies described elements of randomisation as part of their allocation process. However, we noted poor reporting of randomisation techniques across most studies. Only four studies were initially graded by both review authors who had judged risk of bias as having undergone &#8216;low-risk&#8217; randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Kirkpatrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkpatrick 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kirkpatrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkpatrick 1993</LINK>, was assessed as having undergone an adequate randomisation process, following review of previous correspondence describing a coin-tossing randomisation technique. <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK> utilised a computer-based permuted-block randomisation technique to determine the allocation of participants across different treatment arms prior to the start of the study. This information was concealed from study personnel in numbered envelopes. <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK> undertook a permuted-block randomisation process with allocations concealed within envelopes. These envelopes were pre-randomised within groups of four envelopes, which were numbered and subsequently handed out to participants in the designated sequence. <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1996</LINK>
 described a randomisation process involving the use of a computer-generated table. </P>
<P>Three studies described quasi-randomisation techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>). In these, participants were allocated to treatment arms, either based on cases presenting to the department (<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK>) or alternating days (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>), . We assessed these techniques as being at high risk of bias.  </P>
<P>Although the remaining studies alluded to randomisation techniques in their participant allocation processes, there was insufficient information to allow us to assess the adequacy and comprehensiveness of these randomisation processes with confidence (<LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campanile-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campanile 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hulbert-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hulbert 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>It was inherently impossible to conceal the implemented treatment modality from study participants because of obvious differences between patching and not patching. This may have influenced behaviours undertaken outside the study setting (e.g. those who belonged to the no-patch group may have gone home and applied other treatments to their eye). However, in terms of detection bias, masking of assessors (although achievable in all trials) was only reported in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campanile-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campanile 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK>). In three of these studies, participants in the patched group were requested to remove their eye patch prior to their scheduled consultations (<LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Campanile-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campanile 1997</LINK>). Although clinical assessors in <LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK> did not appear to be masked to the treatment allocation of participants, the assessment and reporting of digitised corneal images or grid template diagrams was performed by a reviewer who had no knowledge of the treatment allocation. The remaining studies were either graded as high risk (<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hulbert-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hulbert 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1960</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Kirkpatrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkpatrick 1993</LINK>) or unclear risk (<LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK>) of detection bias. Most of these studies provided insufficient detail about the measures adopted to mask assessors to the respective treatment arms to allow us to assess their effectiveness with any confidence.</P>

<P>The reported percentage of participants lost to follow-up ranged from 0% to 38%. High dropout rates may impact upon the validity of results obtained and their analysis. Furthermore, many included studies involved small numbers of enrolled participants. In these instances, even a small number of participants lost to follow-up could alter baseline characteristics of the different treatment arms. Moreover, in many of these trials, comparisons were not reported between dropout rates amongst patched and non-patched groups, nor were reasons provided for the losses.</P>
<P>Equal distribution of attrited participants across different treatment arms may not necessarily be acceptable, as participants may have dropped out for different or opposing reasons. The lack of such information across many studies made it difficult to assess the potential impact of this aspect on the validity of the results obtained. Although the highest percentage of participants lost to follow-up was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK>, they have argued that this would most likely not have impacted upon the significance of their findings, since all included participants demonstrated complete resolution of corneal abrasions earlier in the trial.</P>
<P>Trials also often reported exclusions of participants following randomisation due to certain exclusion criteria. For example, participants found to have residual foreign bodies or stains from a prior visit on their first follow-up visit were excluded from the study (<A HREF="http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com.wwwproxy0.library.unsw.edu.au/sp-3.10.0b/ovidweb.cgi?&amp;S=AIPEFPHOMGDDMKFKNCNKHDIBGMBJAA00&amp;Link+Set=S.sh.17%7c1%7csl_10#366">Hulbert 1991</A>). This may be a subjective assessment and could have resulted in the introduction of bias as assessors were not masked to the treatment group. The assessor may have noted very poor healing in the no-patch group for instance, and also happened to note some residual staining in the same participant, thereby finding grounds for exclusion. With the small numbers in this study, one or two exclusions of this nature could bias the results.</P>
<P>Although efforts to contact participants lost to follow-up was described in several trials, intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was not performed in many of these studies. Even in <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK>, where ITT was mentioned, participants lost to follow-up were not included in their analyses as outcome data were not available and there was a post-randomisation exclusion for ineligibility. Therefore, in this instance, ITT referred to participants who were assigned to the 'patch' group but removed their eye-patch during the follow-up period. They were still included in the data analysis despite deviating from protocol. Intention-to-treat is important since it seeks to minimise biases arising from differences in known and unknown prognostic factors between groups. As none of the studies adequately addressed ITT, results obtained should be interpreted with caution, especially given the apparent drop-out rates.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Complete healing after 24 hours</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials reported data for the number of participants in each group who had completely healed on the first day of follow-up. Participants receiving a patch may be less likely to have complete healing after 24 hours than participants receiving no patch (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.00; participants = 531; studies = 7; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). However, upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals for this analysis included the point of no difference (RR = 1). We judged this to be low certainty evidence, downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Complete healing after 48 hours</HEADING>
<P>Six trials reported data on complete healing of corneal abrasions after 48 hours. A RR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.02; participants = 497; studies = 6; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) suggested a negligible difference between the patch and no-patch groups (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). We judged this to be moderate certainty evidence, downgrading for risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Complete healing after 72 hours</HEADING>
<P>Four trials reported healing after 72 hours. Most corneal abrasions had healed regardless of which treatment option was used (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05; participants = 430; studies = 4; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Days to complete healing</HEADING>
<P>Six studies reported days to complete healing of corneal abrasions. Similar results were seen in the patch and no-patch groups (MD 0.14, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.27; participants = 642; studies = 6; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 37%) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). It is likely that this variable was skewed to a certain extent. However, using the rule of thumb proposed in <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>, in general most results were not too skewed as the mean was more than twice the size of the standard deviation. We judged this to be moderate certainty evidence, downgrading for risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Changes in corneal abrasion dimension size</HEADING>
<P>Corneal abrasion size at initial presentation and follow-up was measured in six trials. A variety of techniques and comparisons were utilised in the trials to evaluate changes in corneal abrasion size at follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK> reported mean residual corneal abrasion sizes at follow-up. The patch group (total number in patch group 27) was found to have a mean abrasion size of 0.07 mm<SUP>2</SUP> (SD 0.19) on day one of follow-up compared to 0.10 mm<SUP>2</SUP> (SD 0.20) in the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group = 27) (P value = 0.620). On day two of follow-up, the patch group had completely healed, whereas the mean abrasion size was 0.01 mm<SUP>2</SUP> (SD 0.04) in the no-patch group (P value = 0.167). <LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK> examined the linear and surface speed of re-epithelialisation. No marked differences were demonstrated in comparing the patch (total number in patch group = 17) and no-patch (total number in no-patch group = 16) groups. The authors also reported the percentage of erosions which closed at the first follow-up visit, which was 24% (6 participants) in the patch group compared to 27% (6 participants) in the no-patch group (P value = 0.80). <LINK REF="STD-Campanile-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campanile 1997</LINK> calculated the percentage healed in 24 hours by comparing the measured defect on a grid sheet at presentation to that at follow-up. The authors reported the mean initial abrasion size of the patch group (total number in patch group = 31) as 6.1 mm<SUP>2 </SUP>and 5.6 mm<SUP>2</SUP> for the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group = 35). This differed from a manual calculation of individual abrasion sizes provided. This revealed a mean of 6.0 mm<SUP>2 </SUP>(SD 7.3) for the patch group and 5.6 mm<SUP>2</SUP> (SD 9.6) for the no-patch group, which contrasted with the reported mean abrasion size of the patch group of 6.1 mm<SUP>2 </SUP>(P value = 0.8117). In this study, a larger percentage healing score was reported in the no-patch group (97.091%) compared to the patch group (84.130%) (P value = 0.0283). <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK> also reported the percentage of healing achieved at follow-up. In this study, 94.23% (SD 15.6) of healing was achieved by participants in the patch group (total number in patch group = 17) compared to 96.33% (SD 10.3) in the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group = 18) (95% CI -11.00 to 7.00). <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK> analysed the reduction in corneal abrasion area achieved at follow-up. A reduction of 3.4 mm<SUP>2</SUP> (SD 3.3) was achieved in the patch group (total number in patch group = 17) and 3.5 mm<SUP>2</SUP> (SD 3.1) in the no-patch group (total number in patch group = 26). All participants in this study displayed complete reduction of the corneal abrasion area by the second day of follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK> measured the mean and medial values of the minor and major axes at baseline and at follow-up. Statistical analysis did not demonstrate a difference in the dimensions of the corneal abrasion at presentation (P value = 0.58 for the minor axis and P value = 0.43 for the major axis) or on days one and two (P value &gt; 0.4).</P>

<P>Pain and discomfort was recorded utilising a wide variety of methods (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The means were not normally distributed for this outcome measure. Of the 10 trials that measured pain outcomes, only two reported results demonstrating evidence suggesting less pain in the no-patch group (<LINK REF="STD-Hulbert-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hulbert 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK>). Three other trials showed less pain in the no-patch groups (<LINK REF="STD-Kirkpatrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkpatrick 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK>) while five trials demonstrated less pain in the patch groups (<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK>).

<P>Six trials included information on the mean reduction in VAS between baseline and 24 hours' follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirkpatrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkpatrick 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK> reported the mean scores on a pain scale on days one and two post follow-up. The patch group (total number in patch group = 27) was found to have a mean pain score of 0.44 (SD 1.05) on day one of follow-up compared to 0.96 (SD 2.24) in the no-patch group (n = 27) (P value = 0.283). On day two of follow-up, the patch group had a mean pain score of 0.11 (SD 0.57), whereas the mean pain score was 0.14 (SD 0.45) in the no-patch group (P value = 0.794).</P>
<P>Arbour 1997 presented the mean VAS scores with a mean of 15.4 (SD 15.9) in the patch group (total number in patch group = 25) compared with the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group = 22) where mean VAS was 23.0 (SD 18.9) (P value = 0.15). Interestingly, a mean maximal VAS score was also examined in this study. The patch group was found to have a score of 23.7 (SD 22.8) compared to 33.9 (SD 27.3) (P value = 0.18) in the no-patch group. Despite the results appearing to favour the patch group, 48% identified the patch as their principal source of discomfort.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hulbert-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hulbert 1991</LINK> reported that 75% of patients in the patch group (total number in patch group = 16) compared to 29% of patients in the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group = 14) experienced discomfort (RR 7.5 95% CI 1.17 to 55.6).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK> found a greater reduction in mean pain scores in the patch group (total number in patch group = 39) compared to the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group = 42) of participants with corneal abrasions secondary to the removal of foreign bodies (MD 0.80, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.26). Similarly, there was also a greater reduction in the patch group (total number in patch group = 62) compared to the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group =58) in participants with traumatic corneal abrasions (MD 1.10 95% CI 0.71 to 1.48).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Kirkpatrick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkpatrick 2003</LINK> reported the mean decrease in pain scores of 20.8 (SD 20.3) in the patch group and 27.6 (SD 24.2) in the no-patch group (P value = 0.37) on a 100 point VAS.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK> measured the level of discomfort on a VAS and reported a mean reduction of 4.8 (interquartile range (IQR) 2.2 to 7.0) in the patch group (total number in patch group = 82) and 3.3 (IQR 1.5 to 5.8) in the no-patch group (total number in patch group = 81) on day one of follow-up. The authors also analysed the number of participants who reported experiencing pain at presentation and follow-up. 54% of participants reported experiencing pain at presentation, while 15% reported pain as a symptom at 24 hours' follow-up and none reported experiencing pain at 48 hours' follow-up. In the no-patch group, 47% of participants experienced pain at presentation, while 14% and 2% experienced pain at 24 hours' and 48 hours' follow-up respectively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK> demonstrated a difference in mean pain relief achieved by the patched group, with a mean score reduction of 4.1 (SD 2.0 95% CI 3.0 to 5.1; 19 participants), and the non-patched groups, with a mean score reduction of 2.2 (SD 3.0, 95% CI 0.9 to 3.4; 28 participants), 24 hours following therapy (P value = 0.04). However, this analysis included another intervention group involving the use of a soft therapeutic contact lens. No statistical differences between the different treatment arms were identified on further post-hoc analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK> used pain scores with a picture scale of faces depicting different levels of pain for children aged between 3 to 10 years, while a VAS was used for those aged between 11 to 17 years. Children in the patch group had a mean VAS score of 1.7 (SD 2.1) and 0.3 (SD 0.7) in the no-patch group, with a mean difference of 1.4 (95% CI 0.3 to 2.5; unclear number of participants).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1996</LINK> presented 24-hour mean pain scores without including individual data or standard deviations. The patch group (total number in patch group = 17) had a mean pain score of 1.11 versus 2.47 in the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group = 16). The mean change in pain score was 3.09 in the patch group and 2.77 in the no-patch group (P value = 0.50).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK> reported mean and median VAS at presentation and at follow-up on days one and two. The reduction in mean VAS from baseline for pain in the patch group (total number in patch group = 20) were 3.18 on day one and 2.43 on day two, while in the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group = 20), the reduction in mean VAS from baseline for pain was 0.44 on day one and 1.65 for day two in the no-patch group. A comparison between pain scores on days one (P value = 0.44) or two (P value = 0.89) did not demonstrate any statistical differences.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hulbert-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hulbert 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>) reported presence or absence of pain at 24 hours (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.65, 2 trials, 193 participants). (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) We judged this to be low certainty evidence, downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Use of analgesia</HEADING>
<P>The use of analgesia was reported in several included trials.

Comparable rates of strong analgesia use (52% and 54%; P value = 0.86) was reported. Similar proportions of participants were also found to have used any form of analgesia (84% in the patch group compared to 82% in the non-patch group, P value = 0.84). This was in contrast with reported rates of analgesia use by <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK> which was approximately 5% in the patch and non-patch groups. <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK> reported rates of analgesia use in the patch (total number in patch group = 18) and non-patch groups (total number in no-patch group = 28) as 14% and 25% respectively (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.32, 156 participants). <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK> explored the doses of pain medications taken, with similar mean scores of 1.4 between the patch (SD 1.2) and non-patch groups (SD 1.5) (95% CI -1.0 to 0.95). <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK> found no differences between the number of participants taking paracetamol (P value &gt; 0.2) and the number of tablets taken in both groups (P value &gt; 0.8) (total number in patch group = 20 , total number in no-patch group = 20).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Impact on quality of life</HEADING>
<P>The impact of the intervention (eye patching) upon quality of life was examined and reported in two studies. <LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK> found comparable rates of reported insomnia between the patch and no-patch groups (P value = 0.98, 47 participants). <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK> (participants were children) measured 10 aspects of daily living on a VAS. These included: dressing, feeding, walking, running, going to the bathroom, play, impact on resting and sleeping duration, any trips or falls, bumping into things and excessive crying. The only statistical difference between the patch (total number in patch group = 17) and no-patch groups (total number in no-patch group =18) was found with walking (95% CI for difference in means 0.3 to 2.5).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Duration of medical leave</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK> measured the duration of medical leave taken in the patch (total number in patch group = 18) and non-patch groups (total number in no-patch group = 28). The patch group took 2.0 days (SD 1.6) of medical leave compared to 1.9 days (SD 2.2) in the non-patch group. A comparison of these groups and another intervention arm involving the application of a therapeutic contact lens found no statistical differences between these three groups (P value = 0.553). <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK> examined the number of participants missing at least a day of school. 47%of participants in the patch group (total number in patch group = 17) were found to have taken at least one day off school compared to 33% in the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group =18) (95% CI -0.18 to 0.46).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reported symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Frequently reported symptoms across trials include photophobia, lacrimation, foreign body sensation, blurred vision, irritation and eye redness (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The latest reported time point was included for each of the trials to reflect the persistence of symptoms despite therapy. Pain and discomfort were reported as a separate outcome measure.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK> found that 25% of participants in the patch group (total number in patch group = 27) reported experiencing photophobia compared to 45% in the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group = 27) (P value = 0.091). 37% of participants in the patch group experienced lacrimation compared to 29% in the no-patch group (P value = 0.563). 25% of participants in the patch group and 48% of participants in the no-patch group reported experiencing foreign body sensations (P value = 0.761).

<LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK> did not examine the presence of these symptoms during the initial follow-up, but noted that 28% of participants (total number in patch group = 25) in the patch group compared to 4.5% (total number in no-patch group = 22) in the no-patch group reported experiencing residual symptoms at a six-month follow-up requiring further consultation.<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK> examined these symptoms in two specific cohorts of participants, those that had experienced a "traumatic corneal abrasion" and others that had had corneal foreign bodies removed. Although the study authors provided values at various time points, we chose to include reported rates at day one of follow-up as this was the most commonly available time point across the different studies. In the 'traumatic corneal abrasions' cohort of participants, 24% of participants in the patch group (total number in patch group = 62) compared to 19% of participants in the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group = 58) reported experiencing photophobia on day one (P value = 0.515). 61% of participants in the patch group experienced lacrimation compared to 57% of participants in the no-patch group (P value = 0.711). 45% of participants in the patch group reported experiencing a foreign body sensation compared to 36% of participants in the no-patch group (P value = 0.356). 40% of participants in the patch group experienced blurred vision compared to 17% in the no-patch group (P value = 0.009).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK> also examined symptoms at various time points. In this study, 15% of participants in the patch group (total number in patch group = 82) compared to 17% in the non patch group (total number in no-patch group = 81) reported photophobia, while 21% of participants in the patch group experienced foreign body sensation compared to 19% in the non-patch group at 24 hours following initial evaluation. This was distinguished from "local irritation", which 39% of participants in the patch group reported experiencing at 24 hours compared to 49% of participants in the non-patch group. Interestingly, <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK> also examined "eye redness" as a symptom.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Patient compliance</HEADING>
<P>Compliance to treatment was examined in three of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirkpatrick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkpatrick 2003</LINK>;
 

<LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK>). Thirty-three out of a total of 153 participants (22%) in the patch groups of these three trials were found not to have their eye patches during follow-up. Of these, 15 participants reported that the eye pads fell off, 17 participants described discomfort associated with the eye patches and one participant removed the patch "to sleep".</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Use of mydriatic drops</HEADING>
<P>Mydriatic agents were used routinely in eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campanile-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campanile 1997</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirkpatrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkpatrick 1993</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK>), while their use by <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1960</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK> was left up to the discretion of the treating physician. Agents used included: cyclopentolate hydrochloride, homatropine, atropine and phenylephrine. No comparisons were performed between participants in any of the included trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Visual outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Visual outcomes were measured in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK>), but only reported in one included trial. <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK> measured the best-corrected Snellen visual acuity (BCVA) at baseline and at one-week follow-up. The authors reported that the BCVA Snellen at baseline was 0.9 (SD 0.2) in the patch group and 1.1 (SD 0.3) in the no-patch group. Follow-up assessment found an average of 1.1 (SD 0.3) in the patch group compared to 1.1 (SD 0.2) in the no-patch group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Several trials examined participants longitudinally for adverse effects, with follow-up periods ranging from one week to 12 months. Adverse effects reported include persistent symptoms, recurrent corneal erosions, corneal ulceration with the development of hypopyon and conjunctivitis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK> attempted to perform a six-month follow-up on all included participants. They were able to contact 17 participants in the patch group (total number in patch group= 25) and 11 participants in the non-patch group (total number in no-patch group = 22). Out of these participants, 7 participants in the patch group and 1 in the no-patch group complained of persistent symptoms, which included pain, foreign body sensation, photophobia and lacrimation. 4 participants in the patch group and 1 in the no-patch group required consultation for these residual symptoms.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1960</LINK> reviewed participants over a two-month period following the conclusion of their study. During the initial healing process, one participant in the patch group developed corneal ulceration with hypopyon, requiring hospital admission, but was not included in the final cohort of participants analysed. Another 3 patients were reported to have developed complications after healing had occurred. One participant developed an acute conjunctivitis on the sixth day following the initial presentation while two other participants in the patch group (total number in patch group= 77) experienced recurrent corneal abrasions; one at four days, and another at five weeks from the first presentation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK> reported a follow-up period of between seven to 12 months. During this period, a participant from the patch group presented with a new corneal abrasion eight months after the initial treatment. This was included as part of our analysis. However, the authors were unable to confidently ascertain if this was a true recurrent erosion, or secondary to subsequent mechanical trauma. Two other participants returned with a diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, however this was not thought to have been related to the previous corneal abrasion or its management.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kirkpatrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkpatrick 1993</LINK> described a follow-up period of 27 weeks, during which one participant who had initially presented with a corneal foreign body in the no-patch group (total number in no-patch group = 42) experienced two episodes of recurrent corneal erosions in the same eye. The presence of a dendritic ulcer was also identified in the affected eye of the patient in the no-patch group.</P>
<P>Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK> who were reviewed one week following their initial presentation did not experience any adverse effects (total number in patch group = 46). One participant experienced a second corneal foreign body in the same eye and was excluded from subsequent analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK> (total number of evaluated participants = 54), <LINK REF="STD-Campanile-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campanile 1997</LINK> (total number of evaluated participants = 64), Michael 2002 (total number of evaluated participants = 35) reported no complications in either group during the follow-up periods.</P>
<P>Neither the presence or absence of adverse effects were discussed by <LINK REF="STD-Hulbert-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hulbert 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1996</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1994</LINK>,. Analysis of trials reporting adverse effects (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>) suggested an increased risk of adverse events in the patch group but the confidence intervals were wide and also compatible with fewer adverse events in the patch group (RR 3.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 12.05, 660 participants)</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Size of corneal abrasions</HEADING>
<P>The number of participants with large abrasions (more than 10 mm<SUP>2</SUP>) were limited in the trials. No trials specifically included or excluded participants with large abrasions so we were unable to do a subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>Two trials reported results for large abrasions separately (<LINK REF="STD-Campanile-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campanile 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK> 16 (13%) participants had large abrasions. The no-patch group showed longer mean time to healing with 4.20 days compared to the patched group with 3.45 days (P &gt; 0.08). Results were not presented separately for the small abrasion group.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Campanile-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campanile 1997</LINK> 13 people had large abrasions, 8 in the patch and 5 in the no-patch group. Six out of eight participants in the patch group were healed after 24 hours compared to two out of five participants in the no-patch group (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.8, 5.90)). 51 people had small abrasions, 23 in the patch and 28 in the no-patch group. 15 out of 23 people in the patch group were healed after 24 hours compared to 25/28 in the no-patch group (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53, 1.01). These two risk ratios were very similar (test for interaction P value = 0.12) but the low numbers of participants in these analyses means that the power to detect a difference is low.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Abrasions caused by the removal of foreign bodies</HEADING>
<P>We compared studies that included abrasions caused by removal of foreign bodies (<LINK REF="STD-Campanile-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campanile 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hulbert-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hulbert 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1996</LINK>) to studies that excluded abrasions caused by removal of foreign bodies (<LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirkpatrick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkpatrick 2003</LINK>) for the primary outcome: complete healing after 24 hours. There was no evidence of any difference in effect between these two groups of trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial reported foreign body abrasions separately (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK>). Similar results were seen in people with foreign body abrasions compared to those with traumatic abrasions; participants healed faster and had less pain when they were not patched.</P>

<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> shows the results of the sensitivity analysis excluding trials that were at high risk of bias, either because they were quasi-randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>) or because they were not masked (<LINK REF="STD-Hulbert-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hulbert 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirkpatrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkpatrick 1993</LINK>) or both (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1960</LINK>). In general effect estimates were similar after excluding these trials. Any differences favoured the no-patch group. This is perhaps unsurprising as it may be that participants and investigators were expecting patching to be beneficial.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-28 10:42:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was little evidence of demonstrable differences across primary and secondary outcomes for both patched and non-patched groups. This may have been attributable in part to a high attrition rate in some studies, which may affect eventual analyses. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that patching of the eye is not useful for the treatment of simple, traumatic corneal abrasions.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-05-28 11:21:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Wearing a patch renders an individual acutely monocular. This has important consequences for functional tasks requiring depth perception. These activities include walking or step climbing. Disorientation with sudden monocular vision may also limit other activities which require breadth of field, such as driving.</P>
<P>Acute corneal abrasions cause considerable pain which can impact upon visual acuity. This may be alleviated to an extent through patching, which theoretically obviates mechanical stimulation of the lesion by the eyelids during blinking. Interestingly, not patching was associated with a larger, albeit small, reduction in pain compared to patching. The authors here recognise the presence of other factors leading to ocular discomfort following a corneal abrasion, such as ciliary spasm, which may be alleviated via cycloplegics. We have also observed visual acuity to be conversely normal despite any pain. Although the study by <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK> showed an apparent improvement in BCVA in the patch group and none in the no-patch group, this may have been related to a state of co-operability during initial assessment correlating with the degree of pain (noted to be higher in the patch versus the non-patch group). Final visual acuities were noted to be similar in both groups as we would expect most corneal abrasions to be fully healed by the first week, barring any complications. Most patients also experience a rapid recovery of their vision, and the exclusion of a patch in their management may facilitate attendance at follow-up visits, if required, as they would not require accompaniment.</P>
<P>There were qualitative differences in the adjunctive treatment options applied to different treatment arms in each trial (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). These differences include the use of cycloplegics, analgesics and antibiotics. In the patch group, antibiotics were often administered prior to patching and at times re-administered a day later with removal of the patch for clinical assessment during follow-up. In contrast, the control group often received antibiotic drops or ointment more regularly during the day. <LINK REF="STD-Agostini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agostini 2004</LINK> instructed participants in the no-patch group to use an antibiotic ointment three times daily either for five days or until closure of the lesion, while the patch group only received application of the ointment prior to being patched daily. Similarly, in studies by <LINK REF="STD-Arbour-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arbour 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Campanile-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Campanile 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirkpatrick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkpatrick 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Le-Sage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Sage 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Menghini-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Menghini 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Michael-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Michael 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1996</LINK>, participants in the no-patch group applied topical antibiotics to the affected eye several times daily, while those in the patch group often had a single instillation of this treatment prior to application of the patch. It is possible that the use of the cycloplegics or ophthalmologic antibiotics may affect healing rates sufficiently to overshadow any benefit of patching. The use of cycloplegics may additionally induce comfort and reduce further mechanical trauma from rubbing.</P>
<P>Another theoretical problem associated with patching that has been proposed is that the warm, moist environment may support bacterial proliferation (<LINK REF="REF-Parrish-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parrish 1988</LINK>). Other problems include decreased oxygenation of the cornea, reduced epithelial turnover and decreased elimination of cellular metabolism waste products, which may interfere with the washout of bacteria. However, the complication of infection was reported in such low numbers in the trials that it would require much larger numbers of participants enrolled in the studies to demonstrate a difference, if any, between patching and no patching.</P>
<P>Furthermore, this review has revealed a lack of evidence to offer recommendations in the management of large corneal abrasions (that is, more than 10 mm<SUP>2</SUP>). In these circumstances, some practitioners may advocate the use of a patch with the rationale that this may promote epithelial proliferation and migration. This treatment option has however not been investigated satisfactorily in randomised controlled trials. Only one trial performed a subgroup analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK>). Even though this was one of the largest trials included in this review, there were insufficient large abrasions to make the subgroup analysis informative. <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1995</LINK> recommends that people with large abrasions as well as deeper stromal and partial-thickness defects should be managed with the currently accepted standard of care of an antibiotic ointment, mydriatic drops and a pressure patch. However, as mentioned, this treatment regimen is not evidence-based.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-07-07 14:11:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The certainty of the effect estimates was downgraded on the basis of study limitations and imprecision. Two of the studies were quasi-randomised, two were not masked and one study was quasi-randomised and not masked. Lack of masking may be problematic, especially as assessment of the outcome consisted of a subjective component. The other trials were generally poorly reported. Only one trial was judged to be at low risk of bias in all domains. In general the results of the studies were consistent. Excluding studies at high risk of bias, either because they were quasi-randomised or not masked, did not affect the conclusions of the study.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-05-28 10:47:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many of the included trials in this review are not recent studies. This has complicated the process of both retrieving unpublished data and seeking clarification from the authors of these studies. Previous attempts at contacting authors of the relevant studies were unsuccessful. Although we have tried to identify all relevant trials available, the search strategies adopted for this review have mostly revolved around electronic searches. Such an approach may result in the omission of unpublished data, which could result in the introduction of publication bias.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-05-27 10:56:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review contains a more thorough search of the grey literature than either of the previous reviews on this topic (<LINK REF="REF-Flynn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flynn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamada-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yamada 2001</LINK>) and has included studies published in non-English journals. This is important because exclusion of even a small number of trials could alter the results of this meta-analysis. This review also corrects errors in both aforementioned reviews, with respect to the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1960</LINK>, where data were incorrectly assigned to day two rather than day one in the meta-analysis.

<P>The results of this current review do not support patching of corneal abrasions. However, the meta-analysis should be interpreted cautiously, as we identified differences between treatment regimes, such as the frequency of antibiotic dosing.

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-05-27 11:16:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It would be helpful for future studies in this area to focus on minimising possible confounding variables in the management of participants with corneal abrasions without patching. Only by standardising the management of participants in either treatment arm and minimising the number of differences can we confidently determine the efficacy of eye patching.</P>
<P>It would also be helpful to develop a sufficiently powered trial to investigate either large corneal abrasions or corneal abrasions with partial-thickness defects involving the deeper stromal tissue, which would answer some useful and practical questions. A trial designed around this topic would need to take into account the flaws that we found in the trials included in this review.<BR/>
