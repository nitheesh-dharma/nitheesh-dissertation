<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Interventions for preventing reactions to snake antivenom</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>People die or can be seriously disabled after being bitten by a venomous snake. Different venomous snake species have different effects on the body, but initial treatment is similar - to try and prevent venom entering the general circulation. If it becomes apparent that the venom has reached the bloodstream, the patients start becoming extremely unwell and in these circumstances health staff may give a specific antivenom (made from horse serum). However, antivenom frequently causes adverse effects which can, in themselves, be severe and result in death.</P>
<P>There are drugs that can be given with the antivenom to try to reduce these adverse effects, and these include adrenaline, antihistamines, and steroids. The review looked to assess the benefit of giving these drugs along with the antivenom. The review of trials found one trial of 105 people in Sri Lanka looking at adrenaline; and a second trial of 101 people in Brazil looking at an antihistamine (promethazine). Both trials were well designed. Adrenaline showed fewer allergic reactions. There was no benefit seen from giving promethazine, and no trials were found on late allergic responses, nor on corticosteroids. </P>

<P>Routine prophylactic adrenaline for polyvalent antivenom known to have high adverse event rates seems sensible, based on this one trial. If clinicians believe local factors do not justify routine adrenaline, then they should test their belief in a randomized trial. Antihistamine appears to be of no obvious benefit in preventing acute reactions from antivenoms.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-20 13:29:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are over 500 species of venomous snakes; only a minority of these bite humans and cause death or disability (<LINK REF="REF-Warrell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warrell 1995</LINK>). People with a history of snake bite risk developing symptoms and signs of envenoming, caused by the toxic effects of the venom. Effects vary, depending on the species of snake and dose of venom, but can be fatal.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Incidence and prognosis</HEADING>
<P>There is no overall estimate for the number of snake bites globally, or fatalities. Most figures are unreliable and underestimate the true incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Warrell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warrell 1995</LINK>). Rates can be high: for example, one report from northern Ghana estimates an incidence of bites from carpet viper at 86/100,000 of the population each year, with a mortality of 12% (<LINK REF="REF-Warrell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warrell 1995</LINK>). In Myanmar, Russell's viper is thought to kill more than 2000 people each year (<LINK REF="REF-Warrell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warrell 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aims of treatment</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>To reduce the risk of systematic absorption of venom in people bitten by a snake.</LI>
<LI>To eliminate the clinical effects of venom.</LI>
<LI>To reduce the risk of death in people with evidence of envenoming.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment options for snake envenoming</HEADING>
<P>We categorised the options for treatment into two groups:</P>
<P>Specific measures for bites from particular snakes: This examines treatments by type of snake, and includes (a) specific antivenoms, and (b) specific drugs (such as anticholinesterases for envenoming by cobra).</P>
<P>General measures relevant to all snake bites: This includes first aid measures that aim to reduce systemic absorption, interventions to prevent wound complications, and interventions to prevent reactions to antivenom.</P>
<P>The aim of snake antivenom is to neutralise circulating venom and thus eliminate the toxic effects. This review concerns general measures in preventing reactions to antivenom.</P>
<P>Antivenom is prepared by immunising large animals, usually horses, with a particular snake venom or a range of venoms. Serum from the immunised animal is then processed by salt or caprylic acid and an enzyme, either pepsin or, more recently, papain (<LINK REF="REF-Theakston-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theakston 1997</LINK>). This is done in one of several specialist laboratories worldwide. The main problem with antivenom is that foreign animal proteins (from the immunised animal) frequently cause reactions, which could be severe and life threatening.</P>
<P>Antivenom reactions can be classified as early and late reactions. Early antivenom reactions may be mild (itch, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, or fever), but sometimes severe systemic anaphylaxis develops with bronchospasm, hypotension or angioedema, occurring 10 minutes to 3 hours after exposure to antivenom. These early reactions are not IgE mediated, and are most likely caused by complement activation by IgG aggregates that are in horse serum (<LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Malasit-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malasit 1986</LINK>). These early reactions could not be predicted by skin or conjunctival sensitivity tests (<LINK REF="REF-Malasit-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malasit 1986</LINK>). These reactions respond readily to subcutaneous adrenaline.</P>
<P>The potential for antivenom to cause anaphylaxis will vary with the particular type of antivenom, the process used to concentrate the antivenom, other aspects of the manufacturing process, and the dose given. The incidence of acute reactions varies from 2-50% of patients. Modification of antivenoms by enzymatic digestion with papain or pepsin, which cleaves IgG, followed by Fc removal can reduce, but not eliminate, acute reactions.</P>
<P>Late (serum sickness type) antivenom reaction can occur 1-2 weeks after treatment with antivenoms. It consists of fever, itching, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, and albuminuria. The late reaction is caused by immune complex, and responds to treatment with steroids and antihistamines.</P>
<P>To prevent potentially serious adverse effects, different interventions have been used to be given concurrently with antivenom. Adrenaline, antihistamines, and corticosteroids are potential interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of these antivenom reactions. Each of these interventions has a different biological mode of action, and each has different adverse effects:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adrenaline (epinephrine) provides immediate physiological reversal of hypersensitivity effects seen in anaphylaxis. It stimulates the cardiovascular system and can cause cardiac arrhythmias.</LI>
<LI>Antihistamine drugs are often given with adrenaline, and are thought to prevent anaphylactic relapse. They are relatively safe.</LI>
<LI>Corticosteroids are often given in anaphylaxis, and suppress the immune system, but any effect will only become apparent 4-6 hours after the administration of the drug.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Thus adrenaline is the most likely intervention to have an effect in the acute phase, with antihistamines and corticosteroids potentially avoiding relapse or preventing adverse effects of additional doses of antivenom.</P>
<P>All these drugs have some adverse effects, particularly adrenaline, where the adverse effects of the drug itself can be fatal. With adrenaline, this means the balance of benefit over harm when given prophylactically could theoretically vary with the baseline risk of developing the adverse reactions. This risk in turn depends on the quality of the antivenom, and the dose used. These factors therefore need to be taken into account when assessing the generalisability of trials.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to examine the evidence of benefit and harms when giving adrenaline, antihistamines or corticosteroids routinely with antivenom in patients showing signs of envenoming.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 1, 2004) and The Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (March 2004) were searched for relevant trials (published, in press or in progress). The search term used was "snake".</P>
<P>The following databases were also searched: MEDLINE 1966 to March 2004; and EMBASE 1988 to March 2004, using the Cochrane search strategy for identifying trials.</P>
<P>Organisations and individuals working in the field were contacted. These included the Venoms and Toxins Unit, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. The external referees were asked to check the completeness of the search strategy, and to identify any additional, ongoing and planned trials.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-09 15:55:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All identified trials were entered into a trials register. The inclusion criteria were then applied to all possible trials independently by two reviewers. Where they disagreed, a third person was asked for an opinion, and a consensus reached.<BR/>
<BR/>All included trials were examined by the two reviewers and each assessed independently the adequacy of concealment of allocation, generation of allocation sequence, inclusion of all randomised patients, and degree of blinding to intervention either observer blind or double blind. We used standard categories for the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (see Infectious Diseases Group editorial module in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> for details). If the diagnostic criteria for inclusion in studies, the randomisation techniques, the outcome criteria for allergic reactions, or other relevant information were not clearly stated, the authors were contacted for further information.<BR/>
<BR/>The following characteristics of included trials were pre-specified as potential sources of heterogeneity, extracted and tabulated: type of snakes; manufacturer of antivenom; and premedication with other drugs before antivenom was given. The pre-specified potential sources of heterogeneity were used to explore possible explanations of variation in effect between trials, and to guide interpretation of the findings.<BR/>
<BR/>Differences between the results from individual trials were assessed by visual inspection of the graphs and by a chi-squared test of homogeneity. The presence or absence of heterogeneity was considered before pooling data from more than one trial.<BR/>
<BR/>All trials included in this review reported binary outcomes (dichotomous data). The data were entered into Review Manager 5 and each presented as a risk ratio (RR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI).</P>

<P>Two trials met the inclusion criteria (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'). One trial was carried out in Sri Lanka in 105 patients to assess adrenaline against a saline control (<LINK REF="STD-Premawardhena-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Premawardhena 1999</LINK>). Steroid or antihistamine were not used as premedication. Acute adverse reaction to the antivenom was graded as mild, moderate or severe. Haffkine polyspecific venom was used. The type of snake were Russell's viper (D russelli), cobra (N naja), Sri Lankan krait (B ceylonicus), or uncertain.</P>

The patients received one of three types of antivenom, each made by a different manufacturer. The proportion receiving each antivenom was comparable between promethazine and control groups. Adrenaline or steroid was not used as premedication. An acute adverse reaction to the antivenom was graded as mild, moderate or severe.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adrenaline vs placebo</HEADING>
<P>In the adrenaline trial, the group receiving adrenaline suffered fewer adverse allergic reactions overall (adrenalin 6/56; control 21/49; RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The trend was evident when reactions were stratified by severity: more patients in the placebo group had moderate reactions, while severe reactions occurred in four patients in the placebo group and in none in the adrenaline group (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.77, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-20 14:10:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both of the studies were well designed. The only study of adrenaline showed the drug had a dramatic effect on adverse acute events, including anaphylaxis, when given prophylactically. Ten per cent (19 of 196) of patients who needed antivenom treatment in this study were not randomized because of medical history of allergy (atopy or wheezing) or cardiovascular risk (age &gt;70 years, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, or too ill to get consent). Adrenaline at this low dose appears to be safe, but we could not exclude occasional severe adverse effects of the drug as the study size was relatively small.</P>
<P>Antihistamines and steroids are widely used for the purpose of preventing or treating allergic reactions related to horse serum antivenoms, but the one small trial we identified showed no obvious benefit.</P>
<P>Most antivenoms from other manufacturers are horse serum. The use of adrenaline as premedication is likely to prevent acute reactions similar to those occurring with the antivenom used in this study. Anaphylaxis from antivenom, however, is rare and there is no evidence that adrenaline or any intervention could prevent it.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-20 14:10:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-20 14:10:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinicians are likely to choose to give adrenaline when the anticipated adverse effects are similar to those for the antivenom used in this trial, at 50%, and the patient has no previous history of cardiovascular risk (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, transient ischaemic attack, strokes, and age over 70 years). If clinicians consider the antivenom they are using or other conditions are different, and that adrenaline is not justified routinely, then they should be challenged to test their belief in a randomized controlled trial with adrenaline and placebo (see below).</P>
<P>Promethazine is equivalent to placebo, based on one small trial. There is therefore currently no good evidence to give this drug routinely before antivenom.</P>
<P>It has not been assessed whether corticosteroids can prevent adverse effects of horse serum antivenom. They are unlikely to help other than for treating late reactions, or in cases where further doses of antivenom are required some hours after receiving the steroid drug.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-20 14:10:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With antivenom that is more purified, and associated with fewer adverse effects, it is possible that the balance between benefit and harm of prophylactic adrenaline could be different. In these circumstances, routine adrenaline could be tested in the context of a randomized placebo controlled trial.</P>
<P>It is not known whether the newer generation of antihistamines which block histamine receptors other than H1 receptor would be beneficial in preventing horse serum antivenoms. There is still need for controlled trials to assess whether these newer antihistamines or steroids can prevent adverse effects from horse serum antivenoms in combination with adrenaline.</P>
<P>No trials have been found so far that report on late allergic responses, or the potential role of corticosteroids.</P>
