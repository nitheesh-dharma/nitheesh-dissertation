<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-16 08:39:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Blood clots in the veins (venous thromboembolism (VTE)) can develop spontaneously or after surgery or bed rest. Venous thromboembolism can be life threatening if clots travel to the lungs. Blood-thinning drugs such as heparin are used to dissolve clots. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) can be given by injection, enabling people to leave hospital. The usual treatment is two injections a day, but once a day would be more convenient. This review included five studies with a combined total of 1508 participants. The combined data showed no statistically significant difference in recurrent VTE between the once daily and twice daily treatment regimens. A comparison of major bleeding events, improvement of the blood clot size and death also showed no statistically significant difference between the two treatment regimens. None of the five included studies reported information on post-thrombotic syndrome (ongoing swelling of the affected leg, pain, and skin changes). One daily injection with LMWH is therefore as effective and safe as twice daily injections.<BR/>

<P>In the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is administered once or twice daily.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-15 13:36:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-15 13:36:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease with an annual incidence of between two and three cases per 1000 inhabitants (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nordstrom-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordstrom 1992</LINK>). Risk factors for VTE can be acquired through trauma, surgery or periods of immobilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2000</LINK>) or can be inherited, e.g. Factor V Leiden mutation or protein C deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Bertina-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertina 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heijboer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijboer 1990</LINK>). The disease requires immediate anticoagulant therapy, as left untreated, VTE has a high morbidity and can be fatal.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-08 14:00:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin (UFH) for approximately one week has been the standard initial treatment for VTE for decades (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsh-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsh 1991</LINK>). A group of anticoagulants derived from the unfractionated form of heparin has become available, namely low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). Low molecular weight heparins have pharmacokinetic advantages over UFH, including a longer half-life (the compounds remain active within the body for longer), and a more predictable anticoagulant response (the dose does not have to be adjusted continually to maintain the desired level of coagulability) (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsh-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsh 1992</LINK>). Hence, a fixed, body-weight-adjusted dose of LMWH can be administered subcutaneously without the need for laboratory monitoring. This facilitates the initial treatment and leads to a shorter hospitalisation period for people with VTE, as treatment can take place partially or entirely at home (<LINK REF="REF-Erkens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erkens 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koopman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopman 1996</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-07-08 14:00:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>In the trials that established the efficacy of LMWH for the initial treatment of VTE, LMWH was usually given twice a day (<LINK REF="STD-Bratt-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bratt 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harenberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Harenberg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prandoni-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prandoni 1992</LINK>) but there are also trials in which LMWH was administered once a day (<LINK REF="STD-Fiessinger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fiessinger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindmarker-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lindmarker 1994</LINK>). In the past few years, head to head comparisons of once versus twice daily LMWH regimens have been performed (<LINK REF="STD-Charbonnier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Charbonnier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 1996</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-10-27 15:56:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>A single daily injection of LMWH is more convenient for people and may optimise home treatment. In addition, the appeal on economic resources is lower in a once daily administration regimen. However, it is conceivable that twice daily LMWH results in a more stable level of anticoagulation and thus in fewer complications.</P>
<P>This review evaluates the relative efficacy and safety of LMWH administered once daily versus twice daily.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of trials</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (for the original review MM, CVD and for the update SB, PW) independently evaluated the eligibility and methodological quality of the trials. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies were evaluated to extract information on study details including route of administration, intensity of heparin therapy, and intensity of oral anticoagulant therapy. The adequacy of concealment of allocation prior to randomisation and blinding of the outcome measurement was assessed, based indirectly on the criteria of Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Trials without adequate concealment of allocation and/or without blinded outcome measurement were excluded. <B>
<BR/>

<BR/>For future updates of the review, where the information in the original article is not clear, we will contact the authors for clarification. To date this has not been necessary.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>For the original review, two review authors (MM, CVD) extracted data independently. The following information was collected: patient characteristics (age, gender, co-morbidity); incidence of recurrent VTE; incidence of haemorrhagic events; incidence of thrombus size improvement; and, additionally, mortality and the incidence of a post-thrombotic syndrome. Disagreements were resolved according to the same procedure used for the selection of trials. No authors were contacted for additional information.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analysis</HEADING>
<P>The following comparisons were made between once and twice daily LMWH:</P>
<UL>
<LI>incidence of symptomatic recurrent DVT and PE during the initial treatment and during follow up;</LI>
<LI>number of people in each group with improved venographic score;</LI>
<LI>frequency of major haemorrhagic episodes during initial treatment;</LI>
<LI>overall mortality at the end of follow up;</LI>
<LI>incidence of people suffering from a post-thrombotic syndrome at the end of follow up.</LI>
</UL>
<P>An odds ratio (OR) for all outcome measurements within each study was calculated (an OR of less than one favours once daily). Subsequently, a chi-square test for statistical heterogeneity was done for each of the comparisons to assess whether differences in treatment effect over individual trials were consistent with natural variation around a constant effect (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1987</LINK>). Finally, the ORs were combined across studies giving weight to the number of events in each of the two treatment groups in each separate study using the Mantel-Haenszel procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>).</P>
<P>When unfractionated heparin (UFH) is used against placebo, the risk of recurrent VTE is reduced from 20 to 6.7 percent (relative risk reduction (RRR) 67%) (<LINK REF="REF-Brandjes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandjes 1992</LINK>). The use of LMWH (mostly twice daily) at least maintains this benefit (upper limit of 95% CI of the OR of LMWH versus UFH = 1.01) (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Belt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Belt 1999</LINK>). Consequently, taking into account the changes of the comparator drug, LMWH twice daily, (OR below one means that once daily LMWH is better), the upper limit of the 95% CI of the primary analysis should not exceed one by more than 0.5, to show that at least 75% of the effect of LMWH twice daily is maintained.</P>

<P>One of the five included studies included people with PE and DVT (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2001</LINK>). The other four studies included only people with DVT. The five included studies used four brands of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (enoxaparin, tinzaparin, dalteparin and nadroparin). The manufacturer recommends twice daily administration for nadroparin and enoxaparin. Once daily administration is recommended for tinzaparin and dalteparin. In all the included studies the same generic compounds were used in the head-to-head comparison of a once and a twice daily regimen. No authors were contacted for additional information.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE)</HEADING>
<P>Three of the five included studies reported on the recurrence of symptomatic VTE (<LINK REF="STD-Charbonnier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Charbonnier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siegbahn-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Siegbahn 1989</LINK>). In the smallest of these (<LINK REF="STD-Siegbahn-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Siegbahn 1989</LINK>), no recurrent events were reported in either treatment group, hence an OR could not be calculated. In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Charbonnier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Charbonnier 1998</LINK>), a statistically non-significant lower incidence of recurrent VTE was shown in participants receiving LMWH once daily compared with those who received LMWH twice daily. While in the third study a lower incidence of VTE could be observed, which was also not statistically significant, in participants treated with LMWH twice daily (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2001</LINK>). When the results of these two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Charbonnier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Charbonnier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2001</LINK>) were combined, 26 (4.2%) of the 624 participants treated with LMWH once daily and 33 (5.0%) of the 657 participants treated with LMWH twice daily had a recurrent thromboembolic event. Analysis of the pooled data showed no statistically significant difference in the incidence of recurrent thromboembolic events between LMWH once daily compared with LMWH twice daily (OR 0.82, 0.49 to 1.39; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Thus, the a priori determined criterion for equivalence was satisfied. The test for statistical heterogeneity was negative (P = 0.07), although borderline. Visual inspection does not give the impression of heterogeneity.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence of haemorrhagic events</HEADING>
<P>All the included studies reported on the occurrence of major haemorrhagic events. In one study none of the participants had a haemorrhagic event so an OR could not be calculated (<LINK REF="STD-Siegbahn-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Siegbahn 1989</LINK>). Two studies showed a statistically non-significant lower incidence of haemorrhagic events in people treated with LMWH once daily (<LINK REF="STD-Charbonnier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Charbonnier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holmstr_x00f6_m-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Holmström 1992</LINK>). The other two studies showed a non-significant lower risk of major haemorrhage in people treated with LMWH twice daily compared with people treated once daily (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 1996</LINK>). When data were combined it could be seen that 16 (2.2%) out of a total 742 participants in the once daily treatment groups suffered a haemorrhagic event compared with 22 (2.9%) events in the 766 participants in the twice daily treatment groups. Pooled analysis of the study results showed a non-significant lower incidence in haemorrhagic events in people treated with LMWH once daily compared with those who had a regimen of twice daily administration (OR 0.77, 0.40 to 1.45; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Extension of thrombus size</HEADING>
<P>Data on change in thrombus size could be extracted from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Holmstr_x00f6_m-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Holmström 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siegbahn-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Siegbahn 1989</LINK>). In the larger of these (<LINK REF="STD-Holmstr_x00f6_m-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Holmström 1992</LINK>), interpretable repeat phlebography was available for only 87 of 101 participants. The number of people in whom an improvement of the thrombus size was found was not statistically significant. The thrombus size improved in 23 (54.8%) of the 42 participants treated with LMWH once daily and 23 (51.1%) of the 45 treated twice daily (OR 1.16, 0.50 to 2.69). The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Siegbahn-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Siegbahn 1989</LINK>) reported that in the once daily group the thrombus size improved in six out of 10 participants; in the twice daily group the thrombus size improved in three out of 10 participants (OR 3.50, 0.55 to 22.30). Therefore, a combined OR could be calculated which showed no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups (OR 1.41, 0.66 to 3.01; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>Four studies reported data on overall mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Charbonnier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Charbonnier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siegbahn-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Siegbahn 1989</LINK>). In the smallest study (<LINK REF="STD-Siegbahn-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Siegbahn 1989</LINK>), the mortality in both treatment groups was zero. In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Charbonnier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Charbonnier 1998</LINK>), there were fewer deaths amongst the people treated with LMWH once daily, however, this difference was not statistically significant. In the two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 1996</LINK>), a statistically non-significant lower number of deaths was observed in people who received LMWH twice daily compared with people who received LMWH once daily. Combining these results showed that 23 (3.3%) out of a total of 700 in the once daily groups and 21 (2.9%) out of a total of 721 in the twice daily groups died. A pooled analysis of the data showed that there was no statistically significant difference in mortality between people who are treated with LMWH twice daily compared with people treated with LMWH once daily (OR 1.14, 0.62 to 2.08; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-16 08:48:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>In this systematic review we assessed the relative efficacy and safety of once daily administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) compared with a twice daily treatment regimen. Five studies comprising a total of 1508 participants were included. Procedures of randomisation and blinded outcome assessment assured reliable estimates of the pooled ORs (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). We found no statistically significant difference in efficacy with respect to recurrent thromboembolic events between the once daily and twice daily treatment regimens. The predefined criterion for equivalence was met since the confidence interval of the pooled OR for recurrence of VTE did not exceed 1.5. In fact, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was 1.39, which indicates that at least approximately 80% of the efficacy of the twice daily regimen was maintained by the once daily regimen. The observed clinical equivalence with regard to efficacy was accompanied by similar rates of bleeding complications with both the once and twice daily regimens. Also, mortality rates were low and similar in both groups. No data were available for the incidence of the development of post-thrombotic syndrome.</P>
<P>With regard to our two main outcome events, recurrent VTE and major haemorrhage, the following should be stated: although the pooled OR (OR 0.82, 0.49 to 1.39) for recurrent thromboembolic events was based on only two studies, it is likely that it is a reliable estimate since the methodological quality of these two largest studies (including 1261 of the total of 1508 participants) was high. Moreover, the two studies that evaluated the change in thrombus size confirm the absence of an important difference in efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Holmstr_x00f6_m-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Holmström 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siegbahn-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Siegbahn 1989</LINK>). In Holmström's study, a relatively large number of the repeat venographs (14 out of 101) were not available. However, the numbers between the two groups (six in the twice daily and eight in the once daily) were comparable. Therefore, it is unlikely that the lack of available venographs in the analysis has biased the results. Data on the other main outcome, risk for major haemorrhagic events, could be derived from all studies. The observed OR indicates at least equal safety for the once daily regimen.</P>
<P>In meta-analyses of studies comparing UFH with LMWH in relation to recurrent VTE and bleeding outcomes, it appeared that LMWH is at least as effective and safe as UFH (<LINK REF="REF-Dolovich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolovich 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Erkens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erkens 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gould-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 1999</LINK>). In addition, in all three studies it was concluded that LMWH shows a statistically significant decrease in overall mortality compared with UFH. Frequency of administration was beyond the main scope of these studies. In only one of these meta-analyses a comparison was made between once daily and twice daily administration of LMWH and it was concluded that once daily administration of LMWH is as effective and safe as a twice daily treatment regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Dolovich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolovich 2000</LINK>). This comparison was made across studies, rather than based on direct randomised comparisons. Therefore, the conclusion drawn by the authors can be potentially biased by group differences. However, the results are in agreement with our findings.</P>
<P>This systematic review demonstrates equivalence in efficacy and safety, in the short term, between once and twice daily administration of LMWH for VTE. It should be noted that there are no data available on the effect of dosing frequency on long-term recurrent thromboembolic events and the development of the post-thrombotic syndrome. Further research will be required to answer these clinically relevant questions definitively. However, an important difference in these outcomes seems implausible based on the short duration of the initial treatment regimens and their fully comparable efficacy at that stage.</P>
<P>It is questionable whether the results obtained from the small number of PE patients included in this systematic review can be extrapolated to all people with PE. However, if we consider DVT and PE as different manifestations of the same disease, VTE, we can conclude from the evidence presented in this systematic review, that a once daily treatment regimen is not significantly different - with respect to efficacy and safety - to a twice daily regimen in people treated for an first episode of DVT. Therefore, we have no reason to suppose that the recurrence risk in people with PE is increased. However, further research should be done to give more insight in the impact of different LMWH regimens in people with PE.</P>
<P>In the studies of Charbonnier (<LINK REF="STD-Charbonnier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Charbonnier 1998</LINK>) and Merli (<LINK REF="STD-Merli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Merli 2001</LINK>), different LMWH compounds were used (nadroparin and enoxaparin, respectively). A meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Heijden-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Heijden 2000</LINK>) concluded that safety and efficacy of LMWH is comparable for different compounds of LMWH used in the initial treatment of VTE. Therefore, we believe that different LMWH compounds do not differ with respect to safety and efficacy in relation to a once or twice daily regimen. The best available evidence is presented in this systematic review but further research should be performed to elucidate whether the safety and efficacy of different LMWH compounds are comparable in a once or twice daily regimen.</P>

<P>My colleagues and I read with interest your Cochrane Review, "Once versus twice daily low molecular weight heparin for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism." We would like to address a few points from this review.</P>
<P>First, we would like to acknowledge that an important outcome presented in the review is mortality. We noted that the Holmoström 1992<SUP>1</SUP> trial did not report on mortality, and was therefore not included in the mortality analysis. Because this outcome takes precedence over all others in determining if one treatment is better than another, we believe that it would be important to attain as much data on it as possible. This can be achieved by contacting the authors of the original article. Furthermore, as the odds ratio confidence interval was so wide for this outcome [(OR 1.14, 0.62 to 2.08)], it is not possible to determine whether a clinically significant difference in mortality is seen when comparing treatments. Therefore, the statement in the review that "there was a statistically non-significant difference in mortality in favour of people who are treated with LMWH twice daily compared with people treated with LMWH once daily" can be reworded to "there was a statistically non-significant difference in mortality, but a clinically significant increase or decrease cannot be ruled out." This would allow readers to put the available data into clinical context. In our opinion, the wide confidence interval for mortality limits the ability to conclude with certainty that "once daily treatment with LMWH is as effective and safe as twice daily treatment with LMWH."</P>
<P>We would also like to address the protocol of the review regarding the types of studies that were to be included. The protocol was to include only those that were randomized with an intention-to-treat analysis, and that had adequate allocation concealment and blinded outcome measurement. We do not believe that trials should be excluded from a systematic review due to any form of bias. Rather, biases should be outlined in the bias reports, and sensitivity analyses should be done as necessary. Regardless, based on the table of excluded studies, all reasons for exclusion appear to be reasonable. However, it should be clarified in the review that biases did <U>not</U> serve as exclusion criteria, which would aid in strengthening the validity of the review.</P>
<P>We performed a risk of bias assessment for all the included trials, and noted that missing data was present in the Merli 2001<SUP>2</SUP> trial, and that Holmström 1992<SUP>1</SUP> was not an intention-to-treat trial. Missing data is important to address, as analyses using the missing data may yield different results from those presented in the review. For example, in the Merli 2001<SUP>2</SUP> trial, 34 patients in the once daily group and 37 in the twice daily group were lost to follow-up, and no sensitivity analyses were done. Sensitivity analyses assuming hemorrhagic event worst case scenarios for patients lost to follow-up either in the once or twice daily group would yield statistically significant different results: the odds ratio would increase to 2.39 (1.45, 3.93) if assuming all lost to follow-up patients in the once daily group had hemorrhagic events, and decrease to 0.28 (0.16, 0.48) if the same is done for the twice daily group.</P>
<P>Thank you for conducting this review; we believe that this is an important issue, as it affects convenience, patient comfort, and cost. We hope that you consider our suggestions, and we appreciate your time.</P>
<P>Sincerely</P>

<P>I think we found a mistake in the table of haemorraghic events.<BR/>In the Charbonnier´s study 10 major events are reported in the once daily regimen and 17 events in the twice daily regimen. Looking at the original source, 4 events are reported in each regimen as it´s also stated in the Couturaud meta-analysis (Thromb Haemost 2001; 86: 980-4).<BR/>Could you tell us if that is just a mistake or if you have other information not published.</P>
