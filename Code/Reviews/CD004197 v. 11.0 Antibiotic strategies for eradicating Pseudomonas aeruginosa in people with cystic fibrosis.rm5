<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-04-05 15:42:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>What is the best way of using antibiotics to eliminate lung infections caused by a germ called <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>in people with cystic fibrosis?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition where the airways often become blocked with mucus. It is associated with chest infections, which can lead to progressive breathing failure and death. A germ called <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>is often the cause of infection and is difficult to treat successfully, once infection has become established. </P>
<P>We wanted to compare different combinations of inhaled, oral and intravenous (IV) antibiotics for eliminating <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>in people with cystic fibrosis to see if any single treatment works best and is more cost-effective.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to 10 October 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included seven trials with 744 people with cystic fibrosis of both sexes, any age and both mild and more severe lung disease. The trials lasted from 28 days to 27 months. We could not combine many results as trials used different treatments. Two trials compared tobramycin to placebo (a dummy treatment). Three trials combined oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistin in the experimental group but used different comparators - one compared the antibiotic combination to no treatment, one to inhaled tobramycin and the third to oral ciprofloxacin with inhaled tobramycin. Another trial considered inhaled tobramycin and compared 28 days of treatment to 56 days. The final trial compared regular cycles of inhaled tobramycin (plus oral ciprofloxacin or placebo) to only treating with inhaled tobramycin (plus oral ciprofloxacin or placebo) based on the results of cultures grown in the laboratory.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Two small trials (38 people) treating early infection showed that after two months inhaled antibiotics were better than no treatment and eliminated <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> in most people. One of these trials reported for longer and suggested that this effect may last for up to 12 months. Another small trial (26 people) which lasted two years showed that treating early infection with a combination of inhaled and oral antibiotics was better than no treatment for eliminating <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>. A trial comparing 28 days of nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation (88 people) to 56 days showed both were equally tolerated and successful at eliminating <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>. Four direct comparisons of oral or inhaled antibiotics (or combinations of both), including one with 223 people, did not find a difference between different antibiotic combinations. A recent trial in 306 children (aged up to 12 years) compared a regular cycle of inhaled tobramycin (with either oral ciprofloxacin or placebo) to treatment only when it was shown that a child was infected with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>and showed that when children were given a regular cycle of inhaled tobramycin (with either oral ciprofloxacin or placebo) fewer of them grew <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> from their sputum. The trial report made an adjustment for age and did not show any difference in the number of times <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> was grown from samples between the groups, nor was there any difference in the length of time until the children had their next chest infection.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Some trials were conducted up to 20 years ago and the results may not be applicable today. Some trials were small. All the trials had quite a short follow-up period, so we could not show whether treatment made people with cystic fibrosis feel better or live longer. Given the treatments compared in most of the trials, it would have been easy for people to guess which treatment they were receiving, which might have influenced some of the results. Two trials were supported by the pharmaceutical industry. Further research is still needed to see whether eliminating the bacteria completely improves the well-being and quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis and to establish which antibiotic combination provides the best way of eliminating <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>.</P>
<P>Overall the quality of evidence was moderate to very low, meaning that further research is likely to change the estimate of the size of the treatment effect. Future, larger trials (with greater power) may show one treatment is more effective in eradicating <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>than another.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-04-25 10:16:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-04-19 09:59:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Respiratory tract infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> occurs in most people with cystic fibrosis. Once chronic infection is established, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>is virtually impossible to eradicate and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Early infection may be easier to eradicate.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2006, 2009 and 2014.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-09-09 10:56:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>To determine whether antibiotic treatment of early <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>infection in children and adults with cystic fibrosis eradicates the organism, delays the onset of chronic infection, and results in clinical improvement. To evaluate whether there is evidence that a particular antibiotic strategy is superior to or more cost-effective than other strategies and to compare the adverse effects of different antibiotic strategies (including respiratory infection with other micro-organisms).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-19 15:32:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.</P>
<P>Most recent search: 10 October 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-10-23 13:18:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials of people with cystic fibrosis, in whom <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>had recently been isolated from respiratory secretions. We compared combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics with placebo, usual treatment or other combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics. We excluded non-randomised trials, cross-over trials, and those utilising historical controls.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-02-13 08:33:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Both authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-25 10:16:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The search identified 60 trials; seven trials (744 participants) with a duration between 28 days and 27 months were eligible for inclusion. Three of the trials are over 10 years old and their results may be less applicable today given the changes in standard treatment. Some of the trials had low numbers of participants and most had relatively short follow-up periods; however, there was generally a low risk of bias from missing data. In most trials it was difficult to blind participants and clinicians to treatment given the interventions and comparators used. Two trials were supported by the manufacturers of the antibiotic used.</P>
<P>Evidence from two trials (38 participants) at the two-month time-point showed treatment of early <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>infection with inhaled tobramycin results in microbiological eradication of the organism from respiratory secretions more often than placebo, odds ratio 0.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.65) and data from one of these trials, with longer follow up, suggested that this effect may persist for up to 12 months.</P>
<P>One randomised controlled trial (26 participants) compared oral ciprofloxacin and nebulised colistin versus usual treatment. Results after two years suggested treatment of early infection results in microbiological eradication of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>more often than no anti-pseudomonal treatment, odds ratio 0.12 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.79).</P>
<P>One trial comparing 28 days to 56 days treatment with nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation in 88 participants showed that both treatments were effective and well-tolerated, with no notable additional improvement with longer over shorter duration of therapy. However, this trial was not powered to detect non-inferiority or equivalence .</P>
<P>A trial of oral ciprofloxacin with inhaled colistin versus nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation alone (223 participants) failed to show a difference between the two strategies, although it was underpowered to show this. A further trial of inhaled colistin with oral ciprofloxacin versus nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation with oral ciprofloxacin also showed no superiority of the former, with increased isolation of <I>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</I> in both groups.</P>
<P>A recent, large trial in 306 children aged between one and 12 years compared cycled nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation to culture-based therapy and also ciprofloxacin to placebo. The primary analysis showed no difference in time to pulmonary exacerbation or proportion of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> positive cultures. An analysis performed in this review (not adjusted for age) showed fewer participants in the cycled therapy group with one or more isolates of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, </I>odds ratio 0.51 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.28)<I>. </I>
</P>
<P>Using GRADE, the quality of evidence for outcomes was downgraded to moderate to very low. Downgrading decisions for <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>eradication and lung function were based on applicability (participants mostly children) and limitations in study design, with imprecision an additional limitation for lung function, growth parameters and adverse effects.</P>

<P>We found that nebulised antibiotics, alone or in combination with oral antibiotics, were better than no treatment for early infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>. Eradication may be sustained for up to two years. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether antibiotic strategies for the eradication of early <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> decrease mortality or morbidity, improve quality of life, or are associated with adverse effects compared to placebo or standard treatment. Four trials comparing two active treatments have failed to show differences in rates of eradication of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa. </I>There have been no published randomised controlled trials that investigate the efficacy of intravenous antibiotics to eradicate <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>in cystic fibrosis. Overall, there is still insufficient evidence from this review to state which antibiotic strategy should be used for the eradication of early <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>infection in cystic fibrosis.</P>

<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting, autosomal recessively inherited disease in white populations. Although this is a multisystem disease, the primary cause of death in CF is respiratory failure resulting from chronic pulmonary infection (<LINK REF="REF-FitzSimmons-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">FitzSimmons 1993</LINK>). The most frequent cause of chronic pulmonary infection beyond infancy in people with CF is <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P aeruginosa</I>) and, once established, appears to be permanent in the majority of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimmons-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimmons 1996</LINK>). A number of definitions have been used for chronic <I>P aeruginosa </I>infection in CF.</P>
<OL>
<LI>The presence of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> in monthly specimens for six successive months or the development of precipitating antibodies to <I>P. aeruginosa </I>or both (<LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The culture of <I>P aeruginosa</I> from the sputum or respiratory secretions, on two or more occasions extending over six months or a shorter period if accompanied by a sustained rise of anti-pseudomonal antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-UK-CF-Trust-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK CF Trust 2004</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The isolation of <I>P aeruginosa </I>in more than 50% of months over a 12-month period (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>) - the second and subsequent positive specimens in the same month do not count. Conversely, eradication is defined as all monthly specimens negative for <I>P aeruginosa </I>over 12 months.</LI>
<LI>Three or more isolates of <I>P aeruginosa</I> in a 12-month period (<LINK REF="REF-UK-CF-Registry-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK CF Registry 2012</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>We have used the first definition in this systematic review.</P>
<P>The age-specific prevalence of <I>P aeruginosa</I> in pre-school children is under 5%, rising to 30% at aged 16 years (<LINK REF="REF-UK-CF-Registry-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK CF Registry 2015</LINK>). Some authors have suggested that the use of prophylactic anti-staphylococcal antibiotic therapy in early childhood may predispose to chronic <I>P aeruginosa </I>infection (<LINK REF="REF-Ratjen-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratjen 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stutman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stutman 2002</LINK>). However, this effect was not seen in a systematic review of prophylactic antibiotic use, including over 400 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2017</LINK>).</P>
<P>In children who are too young to expectorate, cough swabs or oropharyngeal swabs are the only respiratory specimens which can be easily obtained. These do not reliably predict the presence of <I>P aeruginosa </I>in the lower respiratory tract (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1999</LINK>), whereas flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may detect positive <I>P aeruginosa </I>in children with negative cough swabs or oropharyngeal swabs (<LINK REF="REF-Douglas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hilliard-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilliard 2007</LINK>). Sputum cultures have been shown to accurately reflect lower respiratory tract organisms in expectorating children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Iacocca-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iacocca 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomassen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomassen 1984</LINK>). Over half of people with CF have chronic infection with <I>P aeruginosa </I>by their mid-twenties (<LINK REF="REF-UK-CF-Registry-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK CF Registry 2015</LINK>), although prior to chronic infection <I>P aeruginosa</I> is often isolated intermittently from respiratory tract specimens. This may represent transient colonies of <I>P aeruginosa</I> within the lower respiratory tract or alternatively it may reflect the difficulties in accurately detecting <I>P aeruginosa </I>in the lungs of young people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2001</LINK>). The quantity and type of <I>P aeruginosa </I>present in the lower respiratory tract changes as infection becomes established. It is known that <I>P aeruginosa</I> has two major phenotypes - mucoid and non-mucoid. Following first isolation there is a progressive increase in the density of <I>P aeruginosa</I> colonies in the lower respiratory tract (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2001</LINK>). Initial isolates often show a non-mucoid phenotype; however, as infection progresses a mucoid phenotype may prevail and will be more difficult to eradicate. Douglas has reported a relatively high prevalence (18.2%) of mucoid <I>P aeruginosa</I> at first isolation in newborn screened infants, speculating that the notion of transformation from non-mucoid to mucoid phenotype under environmental pressure may be inaccurate in young children (<LINK REF="REF-Douglas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 2009</LINK>). It has been reported that <I>P aeruginosa</I> provokes an inflammatory response of the lower respiratory tract (<LINK REF="REF-Muhlebach-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muhlebach 1999</LINK>) and there is a marked step up in this inflammatory response as the number of <I>P aeruginosa</I> colonies increases (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The presence of <I>P aeruginosa </I>in respiratory secretions is a major predictor of mortality in children with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 2002</LINK>). Individuals with CF infected with <I>P aeruginosa</I> also suffer greater morbidity with a more rapid deterioration in lung function (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pamukcu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pamukcu 1995</LINK>) and a more rapid decline in chest radiograph score (<LINK REF="REF-Kosorok-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosorok 2001</LINK>), poor growth, reduced quality of life, increased hospitalisation and increased need for antibiotic treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Ballman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ballman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nixon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nixon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winnie-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winnie 1991</LINK>). Some studies suggest there is a temporal relationship between the onset of chronic infection and increased morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Abman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hudson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kosorok-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosorok 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parad-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parad 1999</LINK>), whilst others do not support these findings (<LINK REF="REF-Kerem-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerem 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2001</LINK>). On balance, there seems to be good evidence from well-designed non-experimental studies that clinical state deteriorates after first isolation of <I>P aeruginosa</I>.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-04-05 15:58:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Several strategies exist to treat early infection with <I>P aeruginosa </I>and include the use of the inhaled antibiotics such as colistin and tobramycin (<LINK REF="STD-Littlewood-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Littlewood 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2001a</LINK>), oral quinolones such as ciprofloxacin (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2005</LINK>) and intravenous (IV) antibiotics usually consisting of combination of an aminoglycoside with a beta-lactam (<LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Douglas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 2009</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-04-05 15:58:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>As well as antibiotic treatment of <I>P aeruginosa </I>given at the time of first isolation, other strategies have the potential to prevent or delay infection of the respiratory tract. These include avoidance of contact with people who carry <I>P aeruginosa </I>(<LINK REF="REF-UK-CF-Trust-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK CF Trust 2004</LINK>) and the development of vaccines against <I>P. aeruginosa </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Johansen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 2015</LINK>). Uncontrolled series have indicated that a variety of anti-pseudomonal antibiotics either singly (<LINK REF="STD-Littlewood-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Littlewood 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2001a</LINK>) or in combination (<LINK REF="STD-Vazquez-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vazquez 1993</LINK>) at first isolation may delay the onset of chronic infection. A trial using historical controls suggested that oral ciprofloxacin and nebulised colistin are effective in delaying or preventing chronic infection (<LINK REF="STD-Frederiksen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Frederiksen 1997</LINK>). An uncontrolled pilot study of IV therapy suggested that IV treatment alone was less effective in delaying the onset of chronic infection (<LINK REF="STD-Steinkamp-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Steinkamp 1989</LINK>). There is also evidence supporting eradication therapy from long-term observational studies of chronic infection with <I>P aeruginosa</I> in CF clinics such as the study reported by Lee (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-04-19 10:31:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>There are differences in the approach to detection and management of first isolation of <I>P aeruginosa</I>. Some CF centres advocate frequent microbiological surveillance with attempts to eradicate <I>P aeruginosa </I>when it first appears in the lung (<LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2000</LINK>), whereas others treat only when clinical or radiological signs of pulmonary infection are present (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 1996</LINK>). There is evidence that, when <I>P aeruginosa</I> is cleared from respiratory secretions it is not simply suppressed because, when infection recurs, this is with a genetically distinct organism in most cases (<LINK REF="REF-Munck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munck 2001</LINK>). Evidence that eradication strategies result in increased survival or improved quality of life for people with CF are from observational studies alone. There are multiple different eradication regimens that have been described using different anti-pseudomonal antibiotics in different combinations of IV, oral or nebulised (or both) and with varying doses and duration of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2009</LINK>). Given the expense of chronic anti-pseudomonal suppressive therapy, there is a clear rationale for early eradication from a cost-effectiveness perspective and this is supported by observational data (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2005</LINK>); however, there has not been any formal evaluation of cost effectiveness to date.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2006, 2009 and 2014 (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langton_x002d_Hewer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langton-Hewer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langton_x002d_Hewer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langton-Hewer 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>To determine whether antibiotic treatment of early <I>P aeruginosa</I> infection in children and adults with CF alters clinical and microbiological outcome when compared to usual treatment.</P>

<P>To investigate whether these antibiotics prevent or delay the onset of chronic infection of the respiratory tract with <I>P aeruginosa</I>; increase the incidence of isolates of other micro-organisms from the respiratory tract; and are associated with adverse effects which are either important to the individual with CF or have long-term sequelae.</P>

<P>For binary outcome measures (eradication of <I>P aeruginosa</I>, mortality, isolation of micro-organisms and adverse effects), in order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the authors sought data on the number of participants with each outcome event, by allocated treated group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the participant was later thought to be ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow up. We calculated a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across trials - the odds ratio (OR) or the ratio of the odds of an outcome among treatment allocated participants to the corresponding odds among controls with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We presented binary data on clearance of <I>P aeruginosa</I> from BAL, sputum or oropharyngeal cultures and occurrence of chronic infection with <I>P aeruginosa</I> at multiple time points. We calculated the OR at each time point separately, thus ignoring the correlation between time points.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes (quality of life, lung function, weight, height, BMI, number of respiratory exacerbations, days in hospital, days of antibiotic use, clinical and radiological scores), in order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis, we sought outcome data by allocated treated group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the participant was later thought to be ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow up. We recorded either mean change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment or intervention values and standard deviation (SD). We calculated a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs.</P>
<P>In this version of the review, we entered time-to-event data into the meta-analysis using the log hazard ratio. This was possible for the outcome 'time to pulmonary exacerbation' (severe or any), in the comparison of cycled versus culture-based therapy (<LINK REF="CMP-006.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.7</LINK>) and ciprofloxacin versus placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-007.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.7</LINK>). We used the generic inverse variance (GIV) to analyse the data for time to next isolation of <I>P aeruginosa</I> from the Ratjen trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>). For future updates of this review, for time-to-event data, such as time to next <I>P aeruginosa</I> infection or time to chronic infection, we will attempt to obtain individual patient data (IPD). We will use these IPD to provide estimates of the log hazard ratio and its standard error and plan to combine time-to-event data from trials in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The authors have reported longitudinal data as individual time points. We realise that this method ignores any correlation between the participants; however, we have been unable to analyse these data using more appropriate methods as we do not have the correlation co-efficient for these data. If in the future, we are able to obtain the correlation co-efficient, we will analyse these data more appropriately.</P>

<P>Cross-over trials are not eligible for inclusion within this review.</P>
<P>The natural history of infection with <I>P aeruginosa </I>in CF comprises an initial infection with the organism usually in planktonic form, followed by chronic infection (in which the <I>P aeruginosa</I> frequently exists in the mucoid state). In the planktonic form, antibiotics can eradicate the organism; however, persistent infection is associated with biofilm growth and adaptive evolution mediated by genetic variation. The development of mucoidy, hypermutability and the acquisition of mutational antibiotic resistance are important factors associated with persistent infection and are associated with increased difficulty in eradication (<LINK REF="REF-Ciofu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciofu 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a cross-over trial comparing active treatment with placebo, given the progression of infections due to of <I>P aeruginosa, </I>the group receiving the active treatment after placebo will be at a disadvantage compared with those receiving active treatment first. The<I> P aeruginosa</I> may form a biofilm during placebo treatment and so it would not be able to be eradicated during the active treatment phase.

We will consider values of I² up to 30% to indicate little or no heterogeneity, values between 30% and 60% to represent moderate heterogeneity, values from 60% to 90% to represent substantial heterogeneity and values over 90% to represent considerable heterogeneity. We accept that the importance of the observed value of I² depends firstly on the magnitude and direction of effects and secondly on strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from the Chi² test, or a confidence interval for I²). In a future version of this review (with more trials included in the meta-analysis of individual treatment comparisons), if we find evidence of at least substantial clinical heterogeneity (as defined above) in the included trials, we will perform a random-effects analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of Findings and Quality of the Evidence (GRADE)</HEADING>
<P>In a post hoc change in line with current Cochrane guidance, at the 2017 update, we added a summary of findings table for each comparison presented in the review. We selected the following seven outcomes to report (chosen based on relevance to clinicians and consumers):</P>
<UL>
<LI>eradication of <I>P aeruginosa</I> from the respiratory tract;</LI>
<LI>FEV&#8321;;</LI>
<LI>FVC;</LI>
<LI>growth and nutritional status;</LI>
<LI>frequency of infective pulmonary exacerbations;</LI>
<LI>isolation of other micro-organisms from the respiratory tract; and</LI>
<LI>adverse effects to antibiotics, e.g. renal or auditory impairment and hypersensitivity reactions.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We determined the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach; and downgraded evidence in the presence of a high risk of bias in at least one study, indirectness of the evidence, unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency, imprecision of results, high probability of publication bias. We downgraded evidence by one level if they considered the limitation to be serious and by two levels if very serious.</P>

<P>All seven included trials were randomised controlled trials of parallel design. One trial reported stratification for age and participating centre (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>), another trial reported stratification by age and FEV&#8321; values as an expression of illness severity (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>); the remaining five trials did not use stratification (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). Two trials stated that they were double-blind (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>); the Treggiari trial used placebo to blind for ciprofloxacin but not for TSI (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>); the other trials could not be blinded due to differing treatment regimens.</P>
<P>Five trials were multicentre (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>) and the other two were single-centre trials (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participant characteristics</HEADING>
<P>The number of participants in each trial ranged from 21 to 306 and were as follows: 306 in the Treggiari trial (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>); 223 in the Taccetti trial (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>); 88 in the Ratjen trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>); 26 in the Proesmans trial (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>); 26 in the Valerius trial (<LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>); 22 in the Wiesemann trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>); and 21 in the Gibson trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>). The Gibson trial reported that the planned sample size was 98 participants, but randomisation was stopped after an early interim analysis by the Data Monitoring Committee was undertaken due to poor accrual. This analysis showed a statistically significant treatment effect and so the trial was stopped (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Only two trials recruited adult participants; Taccetti recruited participants aged from 1 to 35 years (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>) and in the Ratjen trial any patient over six months of age was eligible for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>). Two trials were restricted to younger children: six months to six years (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>) and 1 to 12 years (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>All seven trials had approximately equal numbers of males and females.</P>
<P>All seven trials specified that participants had to have microbiological evidence of recent onset of airway infection with <I>P aeruginosa. </I>However, the interval allowed between isolation of <I>P aeruginosa</I> and randomisation to study treatment varied greatly, from four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>) to as long as six months (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>). Two trials additionally specified that individuals with raised titres to anti-pseudomonal antibodies were excluded from the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). Other data from the EPIC trial (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>) have shown that raised antibodies to <I>P aeruginosa</I> (anti-alkaline protease and anti-exotoxin A) are associated with an increased risk of recurrence in the 60 weeks following eradication treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Anstead-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anstead 2013</LINK>). Trials excluding participants with raised antibodies might therefore be expected to achieve higher eradication rates.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>Trials have used various combinations of inhaled tobramycin, inhaled colistin, oral ciprofloxacin, placebo and no treatment. Two trials were placebo-controlled (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>); one trial compared active treatment to no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>); and three open-label trials compared different active treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>). The design of the Treggiari trial was complex, with randomisation to cycled treatment with tobramycin solution for inhalation (TSI) or culture-based treatment and further randomisation to additional oral ciprofloxacin or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials compared tobramycin to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). One trial used tobramycin solution for inhalation (TSI) TOBI<SUP>®</SUP> (now marketed by Novartis) at a dose of 300 mg twice-daily for 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>); the second trial used aerosolised tobramycin parenteral preparation (Eli Lilly, Bad Homburg, Germany) at a dose of 80 mg twice-daily for 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ratjen also used TSI and evaluated a short (28 days) versus a longer (56 days) course of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Participants in the Treggiari trial were randomised to one of four arms; they received either cycles of four weeks of treatment with nebulised TSI (with or without ciprofloxacin) in every 12-week period or TSI (with or without ciprofloxacin) only when respiratory culture was positive for <I>P aeruginosa </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>). All trial participants had an initial 28-day course of TSI, with an additional 28 days given if the patient remained positive after initial treatment. Ciprofloxacin or placebo was not given with second course of TSI and follow up was for 18 months from randomisation and first treatment with TSI (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials evaluated inhaled colistin in combination with oral ciprofloxacin (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>). Proesmans compared colistin 2 million units (MU) twice daily for three months (in combination with oral ciprofloxacin 30 mg/kg/day) to TSI 300 mg twice daily for 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>). The Taccetti trial compared 28 days of inhaled colistin with 28 days TSI; both arms also had oral ciprofloxacin 30 mg/kg/day for 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>). Valerius compared colistin 1 MU (plus ciprofloxacin 250 mg to 750 mg), both given twice daily for three weeks, for initial and any subsequent isolate of <I>P aeruginosa </I>to no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome measures</B>
</P>
<P>The most widely used primary outcome measure was eradication of <I>P aeruginosa</I> from respiratory secretions, though definitions of eradication differ considerably between trials. In the Gibson trial, the primary outcome was the change in <I>P aeruginosa</I> density in BAL from baseline to 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>). However, the trial also looked at eradication at 28 days, and defined eradication as a density of <I>P aruginosa </I>in BAL of less than 20 colony forming units (CFU). Proesmans defined eradication as a negative culture result for <I>P aeruginosa </I>(from sputum, cough swab or BAL) at 28 days or three months (depending on which intervention the participant received) (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>). Both trials based successful eradication on a single specimen (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>). In contrast, Taccetti used a more stringent definition of eradication as per guidance published by the UK CF Trust of three negative cultures in a six-month period (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UK-CF-Trust-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK CF Trust 2004</LINK>). Ratjen used the median time to recurrence of any strain of <I>P aeruginosa</I> during a 27-month follow-up period (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>). In the oldest trial, the primary outcome measure was time to chronic infection with <I>P aeruginosa,</I> defined as the presence of <I>P aeruginosa</I> in monthly sputum samples for six consecutive months or the development of precipitating serum antibodies against <I>P aeruginosa </I>or both (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CONDITION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of the condition</LINK> for other definitions of chronic infection) (<LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>). There were two primary outcomes in the Treggiari trial, time to pulmonary exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics and proportion of <I>P aeruginosa</I> positive cultures over the 18-month trial period (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other measured outcomes included less severe pulmonary exacerbations, <I>Pseudomonas</I> antibody levels, lung function, nutritional status, modified Shwachman score and monitoring for adverse clinical and microbiological effects.</P>

<P>The TORPEDO Trial (Trial of Optimal Therapy for Pseudomonas Eradication in Cystic Fibrosis) is a multicentre randomised trial of parallel design (<LINK REF="STD-TORPEDO-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">TORPEDO Trial</LINK>). Participants with CF older than 28 days are eligible for enrolment and should have isolated <I>P aeruginosa</I> either for the first time or after having been <I>P aeruginosa</I>-free (i.e. a minimum of four consecutive cough or sputum samples should be <I>P aeruginosa</I>-free within a 12-month period. Treatment will commence no later than 21 days from the date of a positive microbiology report for <I>P aeruginosa </I>and will compare 10 days IV ceftazidime together with IV tobramycin to three months of oral ciprofloxacin. Both treatment regimens will be in conjunction with three months nebulised colistin. The primary outcome is the successful eradication of <I>P aeruginosa</I> infection three months after treatment has started, remaining infection-free through to 15 months after the start of treatment. Secondary outcomes include the time to reoccurrence of the original <I>P aeruginosa</I> infection or re-infection with a different genotype of <I>P aeruginosa</I>, lung function, oxygen saturation, growth and nutritional status, number of pulmonary exacerbations, hospitalisation (frequency and duration), QoL, adverse events, other sputum or cough microbiology, costs, burden of treatment (carers and participants).<BR/>

<P>All seven trials were described as randomised controlled trials; in four, the method of generation of allocation sequence was not stated; hence the trials are judged to have an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>). The remaining three trials are judged to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). In the first of these, Taccetti describes a balanced randomisation sequence that was created using statistical software using permuted blocks of size 10 (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>). Treggiari employed a computer random number generator to assign treatments within permuted blocks of 12 (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>). In the Wiesemann trial, the allocation sequence was generated using a coin flip (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). There is no information as to who was responsible for the coin flip or what controls were in place to ensure validity of the result of the coin flip; however we have still judged this to have a low risk of bias.</P>
<P>In five trials it was not reported how allocation was concealed and we judged these to have an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). In the Taccetti trial, the staff involved in randomisation and in treatment assignments were "kept separate" and we judged this trial to have a low risk of selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>). In the Treggiari trial, randomisation was remote and so allocation was concealed (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two trials were reported as double-blind trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). Gibson did not provide any details in the published paper regarding who was blinded or the method of blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>). However, in response to a request for further information, Dr Gibson confirmed that drugs and placebo were sufficiently masked that neither participants or clinicians were able to differentiate between them. Wiesemann reported that participants were blinded by providing a placebo inhalation with a similar taste to the treatment inhalation, but it is not clear whether the clinicians administering the treatment were blinded to treatment allocation; however, we still judged this to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Treggiari trial, the oral ciprofloxacin treatment was blinded but the TSI was open label and so we judged this to have an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The remaining four trials did not utilise blinding and were judged to have a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>). The Proesmans trial compared an inhaled intervention to a combination of inhaled and oral treatment, so blinding of participants and clinicians was not possible; there is no information available as to whether the outcome assessors were blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>). The Ratjen trial was open label comparing 28 or 56 days of nebulised therapy and made no attempt at blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>). The Taccetti trial was also open label comparing 28 days of inhaled colistin with 28 days of TSI, both groups also receiving 28 days of oral ciprofloxacin (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>). Valerius compared a combination of inhaled and oral treatment to no treatment, so again blinding of participants and clinicians was not possible and no information is available with regards to the outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>).</P>

Four trials were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis; all four reported data on all participants who were randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>). In the Ratjen trial, 65 of the 88 randomised participants were included in the primary outcome (time to recurrence of <I>P. aeruginosa</I>). A total of 52 participants were prematurely withdrawn from the trial, but these were approximately evenly distributed across the two treatment groups and reasons were given for each withdrawal; we therefore judge there to be a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>). In the Treggiari trial only two of 306 randomised participants were excluded from the analysis (because they did not receive treatment) (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial had an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). Five participants withdrew from this trial after randomisation and only baseline data at entry to the trial were presented for these participants; to date we have been unable to obtain further outcome data. The trial was therefore analysed on an available-case basis and we judged it to have an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>It is current practice for newer trials to publish a protocol, but we have not been able to locate a published protocol for the Taccetti trial and have therefore judged this trial to have an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>We judged three trials to have a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). Although a protocol for the Proesmans trial was available online and we were able to confirm from the full paper that all outcomes from the protocol were measured, the paper did not provide actual data for BMI z score, weight z score or frequency of exacerbations and simply reported that none of these changed significantly for trial participants (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>). Ratjen reported that there were no major short-term (at three months) or long-term (at 27 months) changes in spirometry, but did not record the figures for either of the two groups. In addition, only summary statements and no numerical data were provided for weight, height or BMI (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>). Wiesemann reported no change in spirometric pulmonary function during or after the treatment period, but again no data were given (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>We judged one trial to have a high risk due to other potential sources of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>). The Gibson trial planned to recruit to a sample size of 98 participants, but was stopped early by the Data Monitoring Committee after interim analysis of the first 21 participants showed a statistically significant microbiological effect in favour of the tobramycin-treated group (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>). This trial was supported in part by Chiron, the manufacturer of the inhaled tobramycin (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>We judged the Ratjen trial to have an unclear risk due to other potential sources of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>). This trial recruited fewer participants than planned, the total number of planned randomised participants was 100, but 35 from the recruited cohort of 123 were not randomised: 31 because of high <I>P aeruginosa</I> antibody levels (which led the investigators to believe that they were chronically infected with <I>P aeruginosa</I>); one for an adverse event; one where consent was withdrawn; one for a protocol deviation; and one 'other' (unspecified) reason (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>). Therefore the trial investigators actually randomised 88 participants and the primary outcome was evaluable in 65 of these (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>). The trial results cannot be generalised to a population where anti-<I>Pseudomonas</I> antibodies are not measured. Furthermore, like the earlier Gibson trial, this trial was initially supported by Chiron and later Novartis Pharma, the manufacturer of TSI (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Proesmans study was judged to have an unclear risk of bias in view of the different time-points at which the primary outcome was measured - at 28 days in the inhaled tobramycin group and three months in the colistin with ciprofloxacin group (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>).</P>

An available-case analysis of the data presented in the Wiesemann trial showed that, when combined with the data from the Gibson trial, there was a statistically significant reduction in the odds of a positive culture in the treatment group compared to the placebo group both at one month, OR 0.06 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.33); and two months, OR 0.15 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.65) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis following imputation of the missing data to provide best-case and worst case-scenarios for the combined analysis showed a range of possible results.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-04-19 12:04:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-19 12:04:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Our review includes seven trials (with data from 744 participants) of antibiotic strategies for the eradication of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P aeruginosa</I>) infection in cystic fibrosis (CF), conducted over a period of over 20 years. Each trial used a different intervention and only two trials could be combined in a meta-analysis of the same treatment comparison. An early interim analysis was performed due to slow accrual in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cumulative data from 43 participants in two of the seven included trials indicate that <I>P aeruginosa</I> was more frequently eradicated from the respiratory secretions in the participants receiving antibiotics than from those receiving placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). This reduction in the number of isolates of <I>P aeruginosa</I> was noted at both one month and two months after the start of treatment. A further trial suggests that the onset of chronic infection with <I>P aeruginosa</I> is delayed in those individuals who have received antibiotic therapy compared to those receiving no therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>). There was evidence from the trials by Valerius and Wiesemann that this effect may persist for up to 24 months (<LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). We found no difference in adverse events. In two trials, an increased incidence of the emerging pathogen <I>S maltophilia</I> was reported following treatment, but no difference was found between eradication regimens in either of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>) .</P>
<P>The trial by Proesmans, which randomised 58 participants, was associated with a low rate of short-term eradication of <I>P aeruginosa </I>from both groups of children treated with nebulised high-dose tobramycin and a combination of oral ciprofloxacin with inhaled colistin (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>). The numbers of participants in each group were too low to allow comparisons of superiority between the two eradication regimens to be made. A further possible cause of the low eradication rate in this trial may be that participants were recruited if they had been free of <I>P aeruginosa</I> for at least six months (with negative microbiology samples for at least six months), which is shorter than the 12-month <I>P aeruginosa-</I>free interval used by the Leeds definition of '<I>Pseudomonas</I>-free' (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Ratjen trial (n = 88) ran from November 2003 until January 2008 and has reported both 28-day and 56-day treatment with inhaled tobramycin to be effective and safe; with no additional advantage to 56 days of therapy over 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>). The authors of this trial concluded that head-to-head comparisons will clarify whether adding either oral ciprofloxacin or IV antibiotic therapy can further increase treatment success in people with CF with early <I>P aeruginosa</I> infection.</P>
<P>The Taccetti trial randomised 223 participants and failed to demonstrate superiority of inhaled tobramycin with oral ciprofloxacin over inhaled colistin with oral ciprofloxacin, both treatments given over 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>). As in the Ratjen trial, the included participants had been free of <I>P aeruginosa</I> for at least six months, again at variance with the Leeds definition of <I>Pseudomonas-</I>free (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Treggiari trial was the largest trial of <I>P aeruginosa</I> eradication in CF reported so far randomising 306 children (aged 1 to 12 years) and reporting data on 304 children (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>). The trial used a complex, four-arm design, comparing cycled with culture-based treatment with TSI and also additional oral ciprofloxacin versus placebo. The trial was adequately powered for its two primary outcome measures (time to severe pulmonary exacerbation and proportion of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> positive cultures) and found no difference between arms for either outcome. In contrast, our analysis (which was not corrected for age) did find a significant difference in the proportion of <I>P aeruginosa </I>positive cultures in favour of cycled therapy. There was no difference between ciprofloxacin and placebo for this outcome.</P>
<P>No deaths were reported in any of the trials.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-04-06 10:30:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The aim of antibiotic therapy for early <I>P aeruginosa </I>infection in CF should be both eradication of the micro-organism and improvement in (or slowing in the rate of decline of) clinical parameters, whilst minimising adverse effects and the isolation of new micro-organisms. If <I>P aeruginosa </I>is successfully eradicated, but there is no measurable clinical benefit, it is likely that current measures of clinical status are not sufficiently sensitive or that the duration of follow up is too short to show a difference.</P>
<P>There are differences in the type and dose of drug administered to the treatment groups in the two trials where nebulised tobramycin was compared to placebo. In the Wiesemann trial, tobramycin injectable solution was administered by nebuliser, at a low dose (80 mg twice daily) for a long duration (12 months) (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>); whereas Gibson used TSI TOBI<SUP>®</SUP> (now marketed by Novartis) at a high dose (300 mg twice daily) for a short duration (28 days) (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>). This is a potential source of heterogeneity between the trials. It is of interest that significant heterogeneity was detected between the trials at the one-month time point but this was not detected at the two-month time point.</P>
<P>The Proesmans and Taccetti trials included participants who were <I>Pseudomonas</I>-naive and those that had not isolated <I>P aeruginosa</I> for at least six months (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>), which is at variance with the 12-month definition proposed by Lee to define a person as '<I>Pseudomonas</I>-free' (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>). It was not possible for the authors of this review to extract IPD for those participants who fit this longer definition of <I>Pseudomonas-</I>free. The Treggiari trial required participants to have been free of <I>P aeruginosa</I> for at least two years (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eradication of isolates of <I>P aeruginosa</I> is easiest in people with CF with recent onset of <I>P aeruginosa</I> infection of the respiratory tract, in particular in those who have non-mucoid isolates of <I>P aeruginosa </I>as they seem particularly susceptible to antibiotic therapy. Two trials included in this review have recruited adults suggesting that early <I>P aeruginosa</I> infection can be eradicated from adults as well as from children and therefore adults should be included in future studies.</P>
<P>Finally, it should be noted that some of the trials were conducted between 10 and 20 years ago and the results may be less applicable to people with CF today.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-04-13 14:32:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The quality of the trials was variable with important deficiencies identified in some. For example, in four out of the seven included trials we judged there to be a high risk from a lack of blinding of participants and clinicians; in two of these trials the different interventions used in the treatment and control groups precluded blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>) and two trials were open label and no attempt was made at blinding. We also judged there to be a high risk of bias due to selective reporting in three of the trials, which only reported summary statements with no actual data for a number of outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>While we generally judged there to be a low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data, there was incomplete follow up of a number of participants in one of the older and smaller trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). The absence of these data has complicated the combined analysis of the two trials that compare inhaled tobramycin with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>); one trial was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>) and another on an available-case basis (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). A sensitivity analysis based on best- and worst-case scenarios demonstrated similar results to the available-case analysis. The available-case analysis revealed a reduction in the odds of a positive culture for <I>P aeruginosa</I> in the group treated with tobramycin inhalation when compared to the odds in the placebo group at both one and two months from the start of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Gibson trial was stopped early because of evidence of significant treatment effect (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>). It has been suggested that the results of randomised controlled trials stopped early for benefit should be interpreted with caution particularly when the number of events is small (<LINK REF="REF-Montori-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Ratjen trial, the authors wished to enrol 120 participants in order to randomise 100 participants. They succeeded in recruiting 123 individuals of whom 88 were randomised and 65 could be included in the analysis of the primary outcome (time to recurrence of <I>P aeruginosa</I>). This trial is potentially subject to bias because of the exclusion of non-randomised individuals, including 31 people in whom there were elevated antibody titres to <I>P aeruginosa </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Ratjen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ratjen 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The relationship between the presence of <I>P aeruginosa </I>in secretions from the upper respiratory tract and the isolation of <I>P aeruginosa</I> from the lower respiratory tract is inconsistent. Reporting of the presence of organisms in respiratory secretions is difficult to standardise, dependent on the sampling methods used and on the number of samples taken. The trials included in this review used a heterogeneous mix of methods to sample respiratory secretions from both the lower and upper respiratory tracts. No two trials used the same methods and more than one method was used in two trials. There was no subgroup analysis based on sampling method in any of the trials, probably owing to relatively small numbers of participants in individual trials. Wiesemann used a combination of oropharyngeal swabs and sputum samples, whereas Gibson used oropharyngeal swabs and BAL fluid (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesemann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesemann 1998</LINK>). Proesmans used sputum, throat swab and BAL (<LINK REF="STD-Proesmans-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Proesmans 2013</LINK>). The Taccetti study did not describe the technique used for culture collection (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>). The Treggiari trial enrolled younger children and used oropharyngeal swabs or sputum samples (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>). Armstrong has shown that the results of oropharyngeal specimens are poorly predictive of the presence of organisms in the lower respiratory tract (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1996</LINK>). Valerius relied on sputum samples which can be of poor quality in younger children (<LINK REF="STD-Valerius-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Valerius 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, based on GRADE criteria (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>).</P>

<P>The original review stated that trials would be included only where eradication begins within two months of isolation of <I>P aeruginosa</I>. In a post hoc change, this has now been altered to include those where eradication has been initiated up to six months since isolation. Whilst prompt treatment of new <I>P aeruginosa </I>infection is recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2014</LINK>), there is no robust evidence for a specific time limit for initiation of treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-04-06 10:39:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Significantly more children with cystic fibrosis (CF) show clearance of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P aeruginosa</I>) from their respiratory secretions up to three months after commencing antibiotic therapy aimed at eradication of the organism from their respiratory tract when compared to placebo. This effect may last for several months. This review has not established any improvement in clinical outcome measures following treatment. The small numbers of participants in some trials and the short duration of follow up mean that this review may have insufficient statistical power to detect changes in these clinical outcomes. However, there are many observational studies which have shown a decline in clinical status once chronic <I>P aeruginosa </I>infection occurs and so clinical benefit from eradication is likely. There was no significant difference in the rate of common adverse effects detected. An increased incidence of the emerging pathogen <I>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia </I>(<I>S maltophilia</I>) was seen after eradication treatment in two trials, but there was no statistically significant difference between regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Taccetti-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taccetti 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found that nebulised antibiotics (or a combination of nebulised and oral antibiotics) were better than no treatment in treating early infection with <I>P aeruginosa</I>, which was eliminated in the majority of individuals. Eradication may be sustained in the short term. We were unable to determine whether there is an associated clinical benefit to people with CF, though data from observational studies suggest that benefit is likely. Overall, there is insufficient evidence from this review to state which antibiotic strategy should be used for the eradication of early <I>P aeruginosa</I> infection in CF.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-04-19 12:06:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Whilst there is evidence that eradication treatment is more effective than placebo or no treatment, there is no evidence to help the clinician choose which regimen to use. There remains an urgent need for well-designed and well-executed trials, comparing eradication regimens. Where possible these should evaluate whether eradication results in appreciable clinical benefit to people with CF, without causing them harm. Trials should also explore the influence of prior infection with <I>P aeruginosa </I>('<I>Pseudomonas</I>-free' compared to '<I>Pseudomonas-</I>naive') and whether there is an advantage in early institution of therapy (within weeks rather than within months). This might be accomplished, using a stratified trial design. Consideration should be given to appropriate outcome measures, particularly spirometric lung function, nutritional status, socio-economic outcomes (including quality of life) and duration of follow up. Long-term follow-up trials with careful clinical and bacteriological surveillance are required. These trials will be challenging to design and deliver. Randomisation should include two active treatments that are both believed to be effective and safe and would still need to recruit a sufficient number of participants to show differences in efficacy with adequate power. Adults as well as children should be included in such trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">2014</HEADING>
<P>The inclusion criteria have been changed to include participants who have received study treatment within six months of the first isolation of <I>P aeruginosa</I> (previously not more than two months). This is to reflect differences in clinical practice between Europe and North America and to allow trials from earlier decades (where early treatment of <I>P aeruginosa</I> was not established clinical practice) to be included. A large trial (306 participants), published in 2011, is therefore now eligible for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>). However, it is possible that, where infection has been present for as long as six months, it may have become more difficult to eradicate.</P>
<P>In recent years 28 days of inhaled tobramycin has been recommended as 'standard of care' for eradication of <I>P aeruginosa</I> in guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-D_x00f6_ring-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Döring 2012</LINK>). This has been reflected in trial design, where investigators have designed their trials to ensure that all participants receive an initial 28-day course of inhaled tobramycin before randomisation to the next stage of therapy. We have therefore altered our eligibility criteria to allow trials where all participants receive some eradication therapy before randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Treggiari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Treggiari 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have added cost as an outcome measure, as cost-effectiveness has become increasingly important in CF care. None of the trials included to date have reported this outcome but future trials may do so.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Recruited fewer participants than planned; actually randomised 88 participants (primary outcome evaluable in 65) - planned randomisation of 100 participants.</P>
<P>Did not randomise 35 participants from the recruited cohort of 123 participants: 31 because of high <I>P aeruginosa</I> antibody levels, one for an adverse event, one where consent was withdrawn, one for a protocol deviation and one 'other' (unspecified) reason. Participants with raised antibody levels were not included because the investigators believed that they were chronically infected with <I>P aeruginosa </I>based on their antibody results.</P>
<P>This trial was initially supported by Chiron and later Novartis Pharma, the manufacturer of TSI.</P>

<P>2. Downgraded once due to applicability: the included studies recruited only children; results are not applicable to adults. Also the included trial required patients to have been free of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> for at least two years so results may not be applicable to a wider population.</P>
<P>3. Downgraded once due to applicability: a large proportion of the randomised and treated participants (161 out of 304, 53%) did not contribute to this outcome.</P>
