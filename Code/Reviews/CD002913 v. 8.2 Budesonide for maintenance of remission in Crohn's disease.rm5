<TITLE>Budesonide for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-08-19 07:44:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Budesonide is a corticosteroid drug which is rapidly broken down by the liver, reducing corticosteroid-related side effects (e.g., moon face). Research showing that budesonide is effective in treating active Crohn's disease has led to clinical trials examining the effect of budesonide on reducing disease recurrence in non-active Crohn's disease.</P>
<P>This review identified 12 studies that included a total of 1273 participants. Eight studies compared budesonide with placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), one study compared budesonide to mesalamine (an anti-inflammatory drug), one study compared budesonide to traditional systemic corticosteroids, one compared budesonide to azathioprine (an immunosuppressive drug), and one compared two doses of budesonide. Pooled analyses show that budesonide 6 mg daily was no more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission at 3 months (6 studies, 540 patients), 6 months (5 studies, 420 patients) or 12 months (5 studies, 420 patients). A pooled analysis showed that budesonide 3 mg daily was more effective than placebo for maintaining remission at 3 months (4 studies, 163 patients). However, there was no difference in continued remission rates between budesonide 3 mg/day and placebo at 6 months (3 studies, 180 patients) or 12 months (5 studies, 442 patients). The overall quality of the evidence from the studies comparing budesonide to placebo was rated as moderate due to lack of precision of the results. One study (90 patients) found no difference in continued remission rates at 12 months between budesonide and prednisolone. The overall quality of the evidence from this study was rated as low due to lack of precision of results and low methodological quality. One study (77 patients) found no difference in continued remission rates at 12 months between budesonide and azathioprine.The overall quality of the evidence from this study was rated as very low due to lack of precision of results and low methodological quality. One study (57 patients) found that budesonide (6 mg/day) was better than mesalamine for continued remission at 12 months. The overall quality of the evidence from this study was rated as very low due to lack of precision of results and low methodological quality. No differences in effectiveness were found for different doses or formulations of budesonide. The use of budesonide 6 mg/day resulted in slight improvements in Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) scores when assessed at 6 months (5 studies, 420 patients) and 12 months (5 studies, 420 patients) and mean time to relapse of disease (4 studies, 171 patients). Mean time to relapse was significantly shorter for patients receiving budesonide than for those receiving azathioprine. Side effects were not more common in patients treated with budesonide compared to placebo. These side effects were relatively minor and did not result in increased rates of study withdrawal. Commonly reported treatment-related side effects included acne, round face, body hair growth, mood swings, insomnia, weight gain, stretch marks, and hair loss. Abnormal adrenocorticoid stimulation tests were seen more frequently in patients receiving both budesonide 6 mg daily and 3 mg daily compared to placebo. The results of this review suggest budesonide is not effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease, particularly when used beyond three months following induction of remission. Budesonide does have minor benefits in terms of lower CDAI scores and longer time to relapse of disease. However, these benefits are offset by higher treatment-related side effect rates and more frequent adrenocorticoid suppression in patients receiving budesonide.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-18 19:52:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Corticosteroids are effective for induction, but not maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Significant concerns exist regarding the risk for adverse events, particularly when corticosteroids are used for long treatment courses. Budesonide is a glucocorticoid with limited systemic bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and is effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-08-18 19:52:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing budesonide to a control treatment, or comparing two doses of budesonide, were included. The study population included patients of any age with quiescent Crohn's disease.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-08-19 07:42:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was maintenance of remission at various reported follow-up times during the study. Secondary outcomes included: time to relapse, mean change in CDAI, clinical, histological, improvement in quality of life, adverse events and study withdrawal. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The Chi<SUP>2</SUP> and I<SUP>2</SUP> statistics were used to assess heterogeneity. Random-effects models were used to allow for expected clinical and statistical heterogeneity. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-19 07:42:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Twelve studies (n = 1273 patients) were included in the review: eight studies compared budesonide to placebo, one compared budesonide to 5-aminosalicylates, one compared budesonide to traditional systemic corticosteroids, one compared budesonide to azathioprine, and one compared two doses of budesonide. Nine studies used a controlled ileal release form of budesonide, while three used a pH-modified release formulation. Nine studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Three studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to blinding and one of these studies also had inadequate allocation concealment. Budesonide 6 mg daily was no more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission at 3 months, 6 months or 12 months. At three months 64% of budesonide 6 mg patients remained in remission compared to 52% of placebo patients (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.58; 6 studies, 540 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was low due to moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 56%) and sparse data (315 events). At six months 61% of budesonide 6 mg patients remained in remission compared to 52% of placebo patients (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.39; 5 studies, 420 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (238 events). At 12 months 55% of budesonide 6 mg patients remained in remission compared to 48% of placebo patients (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.35; 5 studies, 420 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (215 events). Similarly, there was no significant benefit for budesonide 3 mg compared to placebo at 6 and 12 months. There was no statistically significant difference in continued remission at 12 months between budesonide and weaning doses of prednisolone (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.13; 1 study, 90 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to sparse data (51 events) and high risk of bias (no blinding). Budesonide 6 mg was better than mesalamine 3 g/day at 12 months (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.03 to 6.12; 1 study, 57 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to very sparse data (18 events) and high risk of bias (no blinding). There was no statistically significant difference in continued remission at 12 months between budesonide and azathioprine (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.08; 1 study 77 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to sparse data (55 events) and high risk of bias (single-blind and no allocation concealment). The use of budesonide 6 mg resulted in slight improvements in CDAI scores when assessed at 6 months (MD -24.30, 95% CI -46.31 to -2.29) and 12 months (MD -23.49, 95% CI -46.65 to -0.32) and mean time to relapse of disease (MD 59.93 days, 95% CI 19.02 to 100.84). Mean time to relapse was significantly shorter for patients receiving budesonide than for those receiving azathioprine (MD -58.00, 95% CI -96.68 to -19.32). Adverse events were not more common in patients treated with budesonide compared to placebo (6 mg: RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.52; 3 mg: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.24). These events were relatively minor and did not result in increased rates of study withdrawal. Commonly reported treatment-related adverse effects included acne, moon facies, hirsutism, mood swings, insomnia, weight gain, striae, and hair loss. Abnormal adrenocorticoid stimulation tests were seen more frequently in patients receiving both 6 mg (RR 2.88, 95% CI 1.72 to 4.82) and 3 mg daily (RR 2.73, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.57) compared to placebo.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-19 09:09:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by chronic transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (<LINK REF="REF-Bousvaros-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousvaros 2007</LINK>), characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue. Disease activity ranges from chronic clinical activity to a series of relapses and remissions. CD is currently thought to be caused by a cascade of immunologic reactions triggered by environmental factors in a genetically predisposed host. Corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment for acute flares of CD in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Baumgart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumgart 2007</LINK>), and children (<LINK REF="REF-Hyams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyams 2005</LINK>). Corticosteroids down-regulate production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by inhibiting transcription of specific genes involved in their production (<LINK REF="REF-Hyams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyams 2000</LINK>). Corticosteroids also inhibit protein synthesis by affecting the stability of messenger RNA (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>). The interaction between corticosteroid receptors and NF-&#954;B results in down regulation of NF-&#954;B and therefore a blunting of inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2002</LINK>). Unfortunately, systemic corticosteroids are associated with adverse effects such as moon facies, acne, infection (increased risk of abdominal and pelvic abscess in CD patients), ecchymoses, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, cataracts, glaucoma, and growth failure in children (<LINK REF="REF-Baumgart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumgart 2007</LINK>). Additionally, use of systemic corticosteroids has been independently associated with mortality in patients with IBD (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Budesonide is a glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory effects and limited systemic bioavailability due to extensive (90%) first-pass hepatic metabolism by cytochrome p-450 enzymes. These properties theoretically limit systemic adverse effects. Budesonide is commercially available in two forms: an oral controlled ileal release (CIR) preparation designed to deliver the drug to the distal small intestine (Entocort®, Astra Zeneca, London, UK; Entocir®, Sofar S.p.A, Trezzano Rosa, Italy; Budecol®, AstraZeneca A&amp;D, Lund, Sweden) and a pH-dependent release formulation (Budenofalk® or Budeson®, Dr Falk Pharma, Freiburg, Germany). The controlled-ileal release medication is in the form of a gelatin capsule containing acid-stable microgranules composed of an inner sugar core surrounded by a layer of budesonide in ethylcellulose and an outer acrylic-based resin coating (Eudragit L 100-55) that dissolves at a pH higher than 5.5. The pH-dependent release formulation is available as a capsule containing 400 pellets of budesonide coated with Eudragit resistant to a pH of less than six (<LINK REF="REF-Fedorak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedorak 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Budesonide has been shown to be effective with minimal adverse events when used to induce clinical remission in active CD affecting the distal ileum and right colon (<LINK REF="REF-Seow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seow 2008</LINK>). However, previous meta-analyses conducted for the Cochrane Collaboration found that budesonide was not effective for maintaining clinical remission in patients with CD and did not increase the risk of adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Benchimol-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benchimol 2009</LINK>). The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to update the evidence with regard to the safety and efficacy of budesonide for maintenance of remission in CD based on the results of all published clinical trials, including recently conducted studies.

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2014-08-19 07:46:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The same comprehensive search used in previous versions of this review was updated for this review (<LINK REF="REF-Simms-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simms 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Benchimol-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benchimol 2009</LINK>). A detailed outline of the search strategy is provided in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. We searched the following databases from inception to June 2014: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (June 2014). The Cochrane Inflammatroy Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders (IBD/FBD) Group Specialised Trials Register and conference proceedings from major gastroenterology meetings (e.g. American Gastroenterology Association, British Society of Gastroenterology, United European Gastroenterology Week, Digestive Disease Week) were searched manually from 2009 onwards. Ongoing and unpublished trials were identified using ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched the reference lists of trials and review articles to identify additional studies. Relevant pharmaceutical companies were also contacted for further information.</P>

<P>
<B>Selection of studies<BR/>
</B>Abstracts of all articles identified using the above search strategy were screened for eligibility. Studies were included in the full-text review if they were potentially eligible for inclusion or if they were relevant review articles, for manual reference search. The retrieved full text articles were then independently reviewed by MEK and AR for eligibility.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction and management<BR/>
</B>Two authors (MEK and AR) independently completed a data extraction form for each eligible study. The following data were retrieved:</P>
<OL>
<LI>General information: title, journal, year, published or unpublished.</LI>
<LI>Study information: design (e.g. who was blinded), years of enrolment, crossover or not, methods used to ensure adequacy of randomization, allocation concealment and blinding, power calculation (a priori and post hoc).</LI>
<LI>Intervention: formulation and dose of budesonide, type of comparison group, co-intervention.</LI>
<LI>Eligibility: inclusion/exclusion criteria, total number screened and randomized.</LI>
<LI>Baseline characteristics (in each group): age, sex, race, disease severity (and how evaluated), concurrent medications used, disease location, prior surgery, time since last surgery, CDAI/PCDAI, length of symptoms prior to randomization.</LI>

<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality of included studies<BR/>
</B>The Cochrane risk of bias tool was utilized to assess the quality of included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The assessment of study quality included the methods used for randomization and allocation concealment (both measures of selection bias); blinding (performance and detection biases); incomplete outcome data (attrition bias); and selective reporting of study outcomes (reporting bias). Each potential source of bias was scored as low risk of bias (high quality) or high risk of bias (low quality). If a criterion could not be evaluated, that characteristic was considered to have an unclear risk of bias. The quality of included studies was assessed independently by two reviewers (MEK and AR). Disagreeements were settled by consensus. Any study with at least one aspect of study quality determined to be at high risk of bias was excluded from the analysis in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>The overall quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). The GRADE approach appraises the overall quality of a body of evidence based on the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect reflects the item being assessed. Randomised trials start as high quality evidence, but may be downgraded due to: risk of bias (methodological quality), indirectness of evidence, unexplained heterogeneity, imprecision (sparse data) and publication bias. The overall quality of the evidence for each outcome was determined after considering each of these factors and graded as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>High: further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Moderate: further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Low: further research is very likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate; and</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</LI>

<P>
<B>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS<U>
<BR/>
</U>
</B>Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3, Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). </P>
<P>
<B>Measures of treatment effect</B>
<BR/>For dichotomous outcomes we calculated the risk ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). When relapse rates were reported in the study, the proportion of patients in remission was defined as those who did not relapse and did not withdraw from the study (i.e., intention-to-treat analysis). We calculated the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI for continuous outcomes (e.g. change in CDAI and mean time to relapse). The analysis of studies using placebo or other control interventions was conducted separately.</P>
<P>
<B>Meta-analysis</B>
<BR/>Data from individual studies were pooled for meta-analysis if the interventions, patient groups and outcomes were sufficiently similar (determined by consensus). Random-effects models were used to combine data to allow for expected clinical and statistical heterogeneity across studies (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis</B>
<BR/>The following a priori subgroup analyses were attempted, governed by the number of identified studies: dose of budesonide used (in milligrams (mg)), pediatric versus adult patients (not done due to absence of pediatric studies), different formulations of budesonide (e.g., CIR versus pH-modified form), disease location (not done due to the majority of studies including patients with disease limited to the ileum or ileocecal regions), and the method used to induce remission (e.g., medical versus surgical treatment). Subgroups were chosen based on the possibility that differing doses or formulations and disease location may impact on success of treatment success.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of Heterogeneity</B>
<BR/>Heterogeneity was assessed by calculating the I<SUP>2</SUP> measure, interpreted as low heterogeneity (25%), moderate heterogeneity (50%) and high heterogeneity (75%) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Cochran's Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for homogeneity (Q test) was also calculated with P &lt; 0.10 being considered statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis<BR/>
</B>In order to assess the robustness of the eligibility criteria, a sensitivity analysis was planned to exclude poor quality studies (as defined by "high risk" in at least one quality criterion), studies published in abstract form only, studies not reporting methods to assess compliance and small studies (&lt; 50 patients).</P>

<P>The literature search conducted on 12 June 2014 identified 2732 records. After duplicates were removed, a total of 2167 studies remained for review of titles and abstracts. Two authors (MEK and AR) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of these trials and 20 studies were selected for full text review (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Eight studies were excluded (See:<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Twelve studies (n = 1273 patients) met the pre-defined inclusion criteria and were included in the review (See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). These studies evaluated budesonide for maintenance of remission in patients with quiescent CD. Nine studies used CIR budesonide (<LINK REF="STD-Cortot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortot 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hellers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lofberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lofberg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schoon 2005</LINK>) and three studies used a pH-dependent formulation (<LINK REF="STD-de-Jong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Jong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1998</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1996</LINK>
<BR/>This RCT was conducted at 32 centres in Canada from January 1992 to February 1994 (N = 105). It was designed as a parallel arm trial with three arms, CIR budesonide 6 mg compared with 3 mg and placebo. Induction of remission was accomplished with budesonide 15 mg, 9 mg, 3 mg or placebo as part of a previously published clinical trial. Twenty-seven per cent of patients enrolled in this study had received 9 mg of budesonide on an open label basis following withdrawal from the acute trial due to treatment failure. Patients with quiescent disease (CDAI &#8804; 150) restricted to the ileum and proximal colon were randomized to receive either budesonide 6 mg once daily (n = 36), budesonide 3 mg once daily (n = 33) or placebo (n = 36) and followed for 52 weeks. Outcomes assessed included remission rates (obtained from study sponsor), relapse rates, time to relapse (obtained from study sponsor), quality of life scores using IBDQ, change in serum C-reactive protein and ACTH stimulation test.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lofberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lofberg 1996</LINK>
<BR/>This RCT was performed in multiple Swedish centres and five other European countries and compared CIR budesonide 6 mg with 3 mg and placebo (N = 90). Induction of remission was accomplished with a ten-week course of either budesonide or prednisolone as part of a clinical trial. Patients with quiescent disease (CDAI &#8804; 150) restricted to the ileum or ileocecal region were randomized to receive budesonide 6 mg once daily (n = 32), budesonide 3 mg once daily (n = 31), or placebo (n = 27) for 12 months. Outcomes assessed included remission rates (obtained from study sponsor), relapse rates, time to relapse, adverse events and ACTH stimulation test.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>
<BR/>With 20 centres involved, this study was performed in seven European countries and Australia (N = 75). Remission was induced using a 12-week course of budesonide in a clinical trial. Patients were included if their disease was in remission (CDAI &#8804; 150) and limited to the ileum, ileocecal region, or ascending colon. Seventy-five patients were randomized to receive either CIR budesonide 3 mg twice daily (n = 22), CIR budesonide 3 mg once daily (n = 26), or placebo (n = 27) for 12 months. Outcomes assessed included remission rates (obtained from study sponsor), disease relapse rates, time to relapse, adverse events, baseline plasma cortisol and ACTH stimulation test.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gross-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1998</LINK>
<BR/>This multicenter German trial evaluated the efficacy of a pH-dependent release formulation of budesonide designed to release at a pH greater than 6.4 (N = 179). Patients were screened for this RCT when they had active disease (CDAI &gt; 200) and placed on the identical regimen of systemic corticosteroids used in the European Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study (ECCDS, <LINK REF="REF-Malchow-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malchow 1984</LINK>), consisting of oral 6-methylprednisolone at a dose of 48 mg/day for one week and then reduced to 32 mg, 24 mg, 20 mg, 16 mg and 12 mg on a weekly basis. In order to enter the maintenance study, patients were required to be in remission (CDAI &#8804; 150) and to have required only 5 to 10 mg of prednisolone for the preceding eight weeks. Patients were randomized to receive budesonide 1 mg three times daily (n = 84), or placebo (n = 95) for 12 months. Outcomes included relapse rates, time to relapse and adverse events.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1999</LINK>
<BR/>This multicenter German study involving three university-based hospitals assessed a pH-dependent release formulation of budesonide, comparing 3 mg/day to placebo. Patients were enrolled following remission induced by surgical resection of ileal, ileocolonic or colonic disease. The location of the anastomotic site was required to be accessible by colonoscope, and no disease could be grossly visible at the resection margins. A total of 83 patients were randomized. The most common indications for surgery included: ileus, chronic obstruction, stenosis or stricture (n = 71), fistula, abscess or abdominal mass (n = 41), and failure of medical management (n = 25). Patients were randomized to receive either budesonide 1 mg three times daily (n = 43), or placebo (n = 40) for 12 months. The primary outcome was recurrence of CD based on endoscopic findings (<LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 1990</LINK>). In cases where colonoscopy was refused, recurrence was defined as an increase in CDAI from 60 up to 200 from the first follow-up or a CDAI &gt; 200 and signs or symptoms characteristic of active Crohn's disease. Secondary outcomes included histology scores, change in CDAI, global judgement of well-being and time to recurrence.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hellers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hellers 1999</LINK>
<BR/>Patients who underwent ileocolonic resection in 13 European centres were included in this study (N = 130). Screening and consent were obtained prior to surgery and complete resection of ileocolonic disease was verified with intraoperative endoscopy or eversion of the neoterminal ileum with direct visualization of the margins. Biopsy specimens were also obtained to confirm absence of disease. The reason for surgical resection was not detailed in the publication. Patients were randomized to CIR budesonide 6 mg daily (n = 63), or placebo (n = 67) for 52 weeks. Outcomes included remission rates (obtained from study sponsor), endoscopic recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 1990</LINK>), CDAI score, adverse events and ACTH stimulation test.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cortot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortot 2001</LINK>
<BR/>This study examined the utility of CIR budesonide to maintain clinical remission in corticosteroid-dependent CD patients (N = 120). It was performed in 24 centres across Europe, Israel, and South Africa. All enrolled patients received prednisolone or prednisone 10 to 30 mg/day for at least six months prior to study entry with at least two attempts to taper the dose with resulting relapsed disease. Patients had inactive CD at entry (CDAI &#8804; 200). Concomitant immune suppression with azathioprine was initially an exclusion criteria, however this was revised midway during the study to facilitate enrolment. Patients were permitted to enrol if they received azathioprine for a minimum of six months or 5-aminosalicylates for a minimum of one month prior to entry to ensure an adequate trial of these medications and allow for further steroid weaning. Patients were randomized to CIR budesonide 6 mg once daily (n = 60), or placebo (n = 60) for 16 to 22 weeks. Length of treatment depended on corticosteroid dose at entry. Prednisolone was tapered by 5 mg per week until 20 mg and thereafter by 2.5 mg per week until the dose was zero. Patients were assessed every four weeks while on prednisolone and then at six and 12 weeks following discontinuation. The primary outcome was rate of relapse (defined as CDAI &gt; 200 with an increase of at least 60 points from baseline). Secondary outcomes included changes in CDAI, time to relapse, quality of life (IBDQ), and adverse events.</P>

<BR/>This American RCT compared CIR budesonide to placebo in patients in clinical remission (CDAI &#8804; 150) with disease restricted to the distal ileum or proximal colon (N = 110). Induction of remission was achieved using an eight week course of budesonide 9 mg/day as part of a clinical trial. Patients were randomized to CIR budesonide 6 mg once daily (n = 55), or placebo (n = 55) for 52 weeks. Outcomes included remission rates (obtained from study sponsor), disease relapse, time to relapse, adverse events and ACTH stimulation test.</P>

<BR/>This investigator-blinded study was conducted in a single-centre in Greece (N = 57). Patients in clinical remission (CDAI &#8804; 150) were included if they were steroid-dependent, defined as having received at least two courses of oral or intravenous corticosteroids in the 12 months prior to enrolment with a relapse of disease prior to discontinuation. Patients' disease was localised to the ileum, ileocolonic region or proximal colon. Remission was achieved using systemic corticosteroids with a minimum dose of 1 mg/kg for at least 4 months prior to study entry followed by a tapering of 5 mg/week to the lowest dose that effectively maintained remission. Patients were randomized to CIR budesonide 6 mg daily (n = 29) or pH-dependent release mesalamine (Salofalk) 1 gram three times daily (3 grams/day) for 1 year (n = 28). Outcomes included disease relapse, time to relapse, quality of life assessment using IBDQ, and adverse events.</P>

<BR/>This RCT was performed in 34 centres in 8 European countries and Israel (N = 90) and evaluated the efficacy of CIR budesonide at maintaining remission compared with low-dose systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone). Two categories of patients were included in this study: corticosteroid-free patients with mild to severe active CD (CDAI &#8805; 150) who had not received steroids during the 6 months prior to enrolment; and corticosteroid-dependent patients with disease in remission (CDAI &#8804; 200) while receiving traditional corticosteroids. Only the latter group was evaluated for this review. It is noteworthy that the full journal article referenced here evaluates the bone mineral density of patients in the two intervention groups (<LINK REF="STD-Schoon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schoon 2005</LINK>). Efficacy outcomes for the steroid-dependent group in clinical remission are detailed in a published abstract (<LINK REF="REF-Stockbrugger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockbrugger 2003</LINK>). Additional information was obtained from the study authors. Subjects were randomized to continued prednisolone therapy (7 to 20 mg/day) as per a predefined regimen (n = 44) or CIR budesonide 9 mg/day for 24 months with tapering of corticosteroid dose by 5 mg/week (n = 46). Patients and physicians were not blinded to the intervention. Outcomes included continued remission rates, quality of life assessment using IBDQ, adverse events, ACTH stimulation test and bone mineral density using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).</P>

<BR/>This study was conducted in Greece between January 1998 and November 2001 (N = 77). Patients receiving 6 to 9 mg of CIR budesonide (n = 39) were compared to patients receiving 2.0 to 2.5 mg azathioprine (n = 38) for one year with the option of entering a six month study extension. Dose of budesonide was based on the dose of prednisolone required to maintain remission (CDAI <U>&lt;</U> 150) prior to beginning the study. Patients were steroid-dependent at study onset, as defined by at least one flare in the last 6 to 12 months, followed by disease recurrence in response to tapering or withdrawal of steroids. Of note, patients were not aware that the study was a randomized controlled trial (separate consent forms were used for each trial arm) and were therefore not blinded to study treatment. Outcome measures included mucosal improvement based on the Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS; <LINK REF="REF-Mary-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mary 1989</LINK>); histologic improvement (D'Haens Score; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Haens-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Haens 1998</LINK>); rates of continued clinical remission (no definition of remission is provided); withdrawals due to disease worsening and adverse events; time to treatment discontinuation; and laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate).</P>

Patients were included if their disease was in remission for at least 3 months (defined by a CDAI &lt; 150), and was confined to the ileum or colon, except rectal and perianal involvement. All methods of induction of remission were permitted with the exception of small bowel resection &gt; 80 cm within 6 months of enrolment. Patients were randomized to budesonide three capsules of 3 mg once daily (total 9 mg/day; n = 81) or budesonide two capsules of 3 mg plus one placebo capsule once daily (total 6 mg/day; n = 76). Outcome measures included relapse of disease, time to relapse and adverse events.<BR/>

<P>The results of the risk of bias analysis are summarized in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. Three studies were identified as being at a high risk of bias due to inadequate blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schoon 2005</LINK>). Trial participants were not blinded in two trials, increasing the risk of performance bias (<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2009</LINK>); the outcome assessors were not blinded in the third (<LINK REF="STD-Schoon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schoon 2005</LINK>), increasing the risk of detection bias. Each of these three studies compared budesonide to a different comparator (<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2003</LINK>: mesalamine; <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2009</LINK>: azathioprine; <LINK REF="STD-Schoon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schoon 2005</LINK>: prednisolone). The study comparing budesonide with azathioprine was also at high risk of selection bias due to a failure to adequately conceal allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2009</LINK>). Since no other studies made these comparisons, a sensitivity analysis excluding studies at high risk of bias could not be performed.</P>

<I>A) Budesonide 6 mg versus placebo </I>(<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>)<BR/>All studies included in this comparison used CIR budesonide compared with placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Cortot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortot 2001</LINK> was the only study that compared budesonide 6 mg to placebo among steroid-dependent patients and was the only study to demonstrate a statistically significant benefit of budesonide for maintenance of remission at three months follow-up (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.81). None of the pooled analyses showed any statistically significant differences in continued remission rates between budesonide 6 mg and placebo indicating that budesonide 6 mg per day is not effective for maintenance of clinical remission in CD in the long term. At three months 64% of budesonide 6 mg patients remained in remission compared to 52% of placebo patients. The pooled risk ratio of continued remission using budesonide was 1.25 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.58; 6 studies, 540 patients) at 3 months. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome (maintenance of clinical remission at 3 months) was low due to moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 56%) and sparse data (315 events, see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). At six months 61% of budesonide 6 mg patients remained in remission compared to 52% of placebo patients (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.39; 5 studies, 420 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome (maintenance of clinical remission at 6 months) was moderate due to sparse data (238 events, see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). At 12 months 55% of budesonide 6 mg patients remained in remission compared to 48% of placebo patients (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.35; 5 studies, 420 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome (maintenance of clinical remission at 6 months) was moderate due to sparse data (215 events, see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). There was significant heterogeneity in remission rates at 3 months (I<SUP>2</SUP>=56%; P = 0.04), but not at 6 months (P = 0.29; I<SUP>2</SUP>=19%) or 12 months (P = 0.56; I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0%). Of note, <LINK REF="STD-Cortot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortot 2001</LINK> only reported 3-month data and its exclusion likely contributed to the lack of heterogeneity at 6 and 12 months and the lack of statistical significance at these later time points.</P>
<P>Similar results were observed when trials consisting of patients with budesonide-induced remission were included (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.52; 4 studies, 290 patients). Removing trials of surgically-induced and steroid-dependent patients removed all heterogeneity across studies (P=0.75; I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0%). Further subgroup analyses including all patients with medically-induced remission (excluding patients who were induced surgically (<LINK REF="STD-Hellers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hellers 1999</LINK>)) were performed for the 3 month and 12 month follow-ups. When excluding trials that induced remission surgically, budesonide was significantly better than placebo at maintaining remission at three months (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.68; 5 studies, 410 patients) but there was no statistically significant difference at 12 months (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.67; 4 studies, 290 patients). There was no significant heterogeneity after excluding trials that induced remission surgically at either 3 months (P = 0.28; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 21%) or 12 months (P = 0.28; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>

<I>B) Budesonide 3 mg versus placebo </I>(<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>)<BR/>Remission rates were defined by CDAI &#8804; 150 for the CIR budesonide studies and as absence of disease relapse for the studies using pH-modified release budesonide. Budesonide was better than placebo for maintaining remission when subjects were assessed at three months. Fifty-seven per cent of budesonide patients maintained remission at three months compared to 44% of placebo patients (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.63; 4 studies, 263 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome (maintenance of clinical remission at 3 months) was moderate due to sparse data (133 events, see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). There were no statistically significant differences in maintenance of remission at 6 months or 12 months. At 6 months, 49% of budesonide patients maintained remission compared to 44% of placebo patients (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.51; 3 studies, 180 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome (maintenance of clinical remission at 6 months) was moderate due to sparse data (84 events, see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). At 12 months, 42% of budesonide patients maintained remission compared to 40% of placebo patients (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.34; 5 studies, 442 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome (maintenance of clinical remission at 12 months) was moderate due to sparse data (182 events, see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). There was no significant heterogeneity across trials at any time point (3 months: P = 0.87, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; 6 months: P = 0.80, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; 12 months: P = 0.80, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the efficacy of each budesonide formulation relative to placebo. Neither the pH-modified formulation (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.51; 2 studies, 262 patients) nor the CIR formulation (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.42; 3 studies, 180 patients) were effective for maintaining remission at 12 months of follow-up. There was no significant heterogeneity for either the pH-modified formulation (P = 0.28; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 14%) or the CIR formulation (P = 0.64; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.0%). A subgroup analysis including medically-induced patients was performed for the 3 month and 12 month follow-ups. There was no statistically significant difference between budesonide and placebo at either 3 months (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.60; 3 studies, 180 patients) or 12 months (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28; 4 studies, 359 patients). There was no significant heterogeneity at either 3 months (P = 0.94; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) or 12 months (P = 0.82; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%,).</P>

Fifty-six per cent of budesonide 6 mg patients maintained remission at 3 months compared to 59% of patients in the budesonide 3 mg group (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.34; 3 studies, 180 patients). At 6 months 56% of patients in the budesonide 6 mg group maintained remission compared to 49% of patients in the budesonide 3 mg group (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.47; 3 studies, 180 patients). At 12 months 47% of patients in the budesonide 6 mg group maintained remission compared to 39% of patients in the budesonide 3 mg group (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.65; 3 studies, 180 patients).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-08-19 09:49:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Oral budesonide is a corticosteroid designed to be topically released in the small intestine with a high first-pass effect, limiting systemic adverse events. It is effective for induction of remission in CD with fewer adverse effects than traditional corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Seow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seow 2008</LINK>). However, the results of this review suggest that budesonide is not effective for maintaining remission in CD patients compared to placebo in the long-term. For the placebo-controlled studies a GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence for continued remission at 6 and 12 months as moderate due to sparse data (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). However, budesonide significantly increased the mean time to relapse compared to placebo. This is true of both drug formulations (CIR or pH-dependent) and for both methods used to induce remission (pharmacological or surgical). Additionally, although adverse events did not appear to be more common than placebo in the studies reviewed, the risk of budesonide affecting the adrenocorticoid axis is demonstrated by higher rates of abnormal ACTH stimulation tests.</P>
<P>At three months, budesonide demonstrated a modest benefit over placebo at doses of both 3 mg and 6 mg, but this benefit was not sustained at 6 and 12 months. Significant heterogeneity was observed among the trials comparing 6 mg of budesonide to placebo. Removing trials of surgically-induced patients decreased between-study heterogeneity and removing studies of both surgically-induced and steroid-dependent patients completely removed statistical heterogeneity. When the trial of surgically-induced patients was excluded, budesonide demonstrated significant benefit over placebo. This effect was likely driven by the one trial of steroid-dependent patients that found a significant benefit of budesonide 6 mg over placebo but only followed patients for three months (<LINK REF="STD-Cortot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortot 2001</LINK>). Therefore the benefit seen at three months following enrolment may have been influenced by the methods used to induce remission prior to study enrolment. These findings support suggestions that CD may not be one disease but in fact a broad spectrum of diseases, as indicated by the different patient populations in the different trials (<LINK REF="REF-Ruel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruel 2014</LINK>). Budesonide may have different efficacy across different subtypes of CD. Comparison of budesonide 3 mg to placebo identified no statistical heterogeneity across trials; this comparison included one trial of surgically-induced patients (<LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1999</LINK>), and no trial of steroid-dependent patients.</P>
<P>The four studies which compared different doses of budesonide (6 mg versus 3 mg in three studies:<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1996</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Lofberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lofberg 1996</LINK> and 9 mg versus 6 mg in one study: <LINK REF="STD-de-Jong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Jong 2007</LINK>) did not demonstrate any benefit for higher doses of budesonide. While no study has compared budesonide 9 mg to placebo for maintenance of remission, this higher dose has been shown to be effective for induction of remission in CD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Seow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seow 2008</LINK>). Nevertheless, there is no evidence that higher doses are more effective than lower doses.</P>
<P>The definition of remission was not consistent across all studies. Most studies defined sustained remission as a CDAI of less than or equal to 150 at each follow-up time point. Other studies reported only relapse rates defined as a CDAI of greater than 150 or 200 with a minimum 60 point increase from baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Cortot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortot 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Jong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Jong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2003</LINK>). Clinical remission was not defined in the study comparing budesonide to azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2009</LINK>). For the purposes of this review, in the cases where remission rates were not reported or obtainable from study authors, the proportion of patients in remission at each time point was defined as the inverse of the relapse rate at that time point. Only one study comparing budesonide 6 mg to placebo reported relapse rates (<LINK REF="STD-Cortot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortot 2001</LINK>). This study was the only one to include steroid-dependent patients and had higher rates of remission relative to those that included patients induced as part of a clinical trial. Prednisolone was tapered over time and may have prolonged remission and contributed to both the magnitude of the effect and heterogeneity across studies. Relapse rates were reported after only 13 weeks of treatment. The different inclusion criteria compared to other studies in the analysis and the short follow-up time may have accounted for the benefit attributed to budesonide. The results of the studies comparing 3 mg to placebo reported only relapse rates (<LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1998</LINK>), and were consistent with the studies reporting remission rates. No appreciable heterogeneity was detected when studies were pooled. The subgroup analysis of studies using the pH-modified form of budesonide reported relapse rates only and budesonide had no benefit over placebo.</P>
<P>Budesonide decreased CDAI scores relative to placebo at the 6 mg daily dose. This benefit amounts to less than 40 points on the CDAI scale at all assessed time points and is unlikely to be clinically significant. Most clinical trials consider changes in CDAI score of 70 to 100 points to be the minimum clinically important change (<LINK REF="REF-Sands-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sands 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2007</LINK>). Among patients that relapse, budesonide 6 mg extends the time to disease recurrence by 60 days and 3 mg extends the time to disease recurrence by 30 days.</P>
<P>Budesonide was also compared to conventional steroids (weaning dose of prednisolone) in a single unblinded trial. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution as a GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for continued remission at 12 months as low due to high risk of bias (i.e. no blinding) and sparse data. The results of this study may have been subject to detection bias. Despite issues related to study quality, there were no differences between budesonide and prednisolone both in terms of efficacy (i.e., maintenance of remission) or safety (withdrawals due to adverse events). However, budesonide was safer than prednisolone in terms of impact on the adrenocortical axis with significantly less budesonide-patients experiencing abnormal ACTH stimulation tests than those treated with prednisolone.</P>
<P>One small study found budesonide to be superior to mesalamine for maintenance of remission, and was associated with fewer withdrawals due to adverse events. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution as a GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence for continued remission at 12 months as very low due to high risk of bias (i.e. no blinding) and very sparse data (18 events). There was no significant difference in continued remission at 12 months between azathioprine and budesonide. Azathioprine increased the time to disease recurrence among patients who relapsed. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution as a GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence for continued remission at 12 months as very low due to high risk of bias (i.e. single-blind design and lack of allocation concealment) and sparse data. The failure to blind trial participants leads to performance bias and may partly explain the results of these trials. The failure to adequately conceal allocation in the trial comparing budesonide to azathioprine may have exaggerated the differences between budesonide and azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>While budesonide did not increase the risk of adverse events relative to placebo or any active comparators, any dose increased the risk of an abnormal ACTH test compared to placebo. However, there does appear to be dose-dependent suppression of the adrenocortical axis, with those receiving 6 mg being numerically more likely to have an abnormal ACTH stimulation test than those receiving 3 mg. This comparison was not available for the study comparing 9 mg to 6 mg. Abnormal ACTH stimulation tests were less common among patients receiving budesonide compared to conventional steroids.</P>
<P>These results demonstrate that budesonide, when used for long periods, has systemic effects. This could have important implications for at risk patients including growing children and adults with osteopenia or osteoporosis, although these systemic effects appear to be less pronounced with budesonide than conventional steroids. <LINK REF="STD-Schoon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schoon 2005</LINK> compared budesonide to conventional steroids, with the primary outcome being bone mineral density (as measured by DXA). Among corticosteroid-naive patients, decreases in bone mineral density were less pronounced following treatment with budesonide than prednisolone. However, the effect of budesonide on bone mineral density remains inconclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Cino-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cino 2002</LINK>). No randomized clinical trial has compared changes in bone mineral density between budesonide and placebo. The risk of systemic corticosteroid effects in light of these limited benefits make the use of budesonide for maintenance of remission difficult to justify. Additionally, selection bias may also play a role in these minor benefits, as patients were often included in maintenance trials only if they had previously responded to budesonide during a trial for induction of remission.</P>
<P>The reasons for budesonide's lack of efficacy for maintenance of remission in CD are not entirely clear. There is evidence that the use of systemic corticosteroids may contribute to the loss of immune tolerance, potentially due to reduced immune cell apoptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Towers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Towers 2005</LINK>). The early use of corticosteroids may, in fact, propagate the abnormal immune response in patients with CD resulting in repeated episodes of inflammation and tissue damage, as well as decreased efficacy of corticosteroids with repeated or long-term use (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Den-Brande-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Den Brande 2002</LINK>). It is also possible that the location of disease in patients receiving budesonide who relapse is outside of the location of budesonide's greatest effect (the ileocecal region). Only two studies reported endoscopic recurrence both reporting only recurrences at the neo-terminal ileum or anastomotic site in patients who had a surgically-induced remission (<LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hellers 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>These data suggest budesonide is not effective for maintenance of remission in CD, particularly when used beyond three months following induction of remission. However, it has a modest benefit in terms of decreasing the CDAI score and prolonging time to relapse. Any mild benefits are outweighed by the risk of adrenocorticoid suppression when using budesonide for extended periods of time. Patients receiving 6 mg daily of budesonide for extended periods of time experienced a higher rate of treatment-related adverse events, although these events did not result in study withdrawal and therefore may have been relatively mild. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-19 07:53:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The results of this review demonstrated no benefit for budesonide for the maintenance of remission in CD. Studies included in this review examined different doses (9 mg, 6 mg, and 3 mg daily), formulations (CIR and pH-dependent release) and modes of remission induction (e.g., systemic corticosteroids, budesonide and surgical resection). Additionally, higher doses of budesonide (9 mg vs. 6 mg or 6 mg vs. 3 mg) do not appear to provide any additional benefit. The only comparison lacking amongst these studies is that of budesonide 9 mg compared with placebo for maintenance of remission. However, considering the lack of benefit of 9 mg over 6 mg (<LINK REF="STD-de-Jong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Jong 2007</LINK>), and the higher rates of adrenocorticoid axis suppression such a trial is unlikely to be undertaken. Further information on the long-term implications of budesonide on bone mineral density would be beneficial.</P>
