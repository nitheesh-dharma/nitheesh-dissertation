<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-09-10 10:47:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some evidence that caffeine is as effective as theophylline in the short-term for reducing apnea in premature babies, is better tolerated and is easier to give.</P>
<P>Apnea is a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds. It may occur repeatedly in preterm babies (born before 34 weeks gestation). Persistent apnea may be harmful to the developing brain or organs. Methylxanthines (such as theophylline and caffeine) are drugs that are believed to stimulate breathing efforts and have been used to reduce apnea. This review of trials found that caffeine has similar effects to theophylline but has a larger gap between levels that are therapeutic and those with toxic effects. Caffeine is more easily absorbed and has a longer half-life that allows for once daily dosing.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-01 19:59:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recurrent apnea is common in preterm infants, particularly at very early gestational ages. These episodes of loss of effective breathing can lead to hypoxemia and bradycardia, which may be severe enough to require resuscitation including use of positive pressure ventilation. Two forms of methylxanthine (caffeine and theophylline) have been used to stimulate breathing in order to prevent apnea and its consequences.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-09-06 16:06:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effect of caffeine compared with theophylline treatment on the risk of apnea and use of mechanical ventilation in preterm infants with recurrent apnea.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-11-02 14:01:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of electronic databases in August 2009: Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2, 2009); MEDLINE (1966 to April 2009); and EMBASE Drugs and Pharmacology (1990 to April 2009), previous reviews including cross references.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-08-17 11:57:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing caffeine to theophylline for treating apnea in preterm infants and reporting effects on apnea event rates.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-11-02 14:03:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Each author assessed eligibility and trial quality, extracted data separately and compared and resolved differences. Study authors were contacted for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-09-07 13:28:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials involving a total of 108 infants were included. The quality of most of these small trials was fair to good. No difference in treatment failure rate (less than 50% reduction in apnea/bradycardia) was found between caffeine and theophylline after one to three days treatment (based on two studies) or five to seven days treatment (based on one study). There was no difference in mean apnea rate between caffeine and theophylline groups after one to three days treatment (based on five trials) and five to seven days treatment (based on four trials).</P>
<P>Adverse effects, indicated by tachycardia or feed intolerance leading to change in dosing, were lower in the caffeine group (summary relative risk 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.72). This was reported and consistent in three studies.</P>
<P>No trial reported the use of ventilation and no data were available to assess effects on growth and development.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-01 20:01:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caffeine appears to have similar short-term effects on apnea/bradycardia as does theophylline although caffeine has certain therapeutic advantages over theophylline. Theophylline is associated with higher rates of toxicity. The possibility that higher doses of caffeine might be more effective in extremely preterm infants needs further evaluation in randomized clinical trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-01 20:04:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-09-07 13:14:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infant apnea has been defined as a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds or one of less than 20 seconds and associated with bradycardia and/or cyanosis (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2003</LINK>). Recurrent episodes of apnea are common in preterm infants and the incidence and severity increases at lower gestational ages (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 1995</LINK>). Although apnea can occur spontaneously and be attributed to prematurity alone, it can also be provoked or made more severe if there is some additional insult such as infection, hypoxemia or intracranial pathology.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-10-01 20:03:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methylxanthines are thought to stimulate breathing efforts and have been used in clinical practice to reduce apnea since the 1970's. Theophylline and caffeine are two forms that have been used. The efficacy of methylxanthines compared with control was evaluated in another review in the Cochrane Library (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2004</LINK>), which concluded that their use reduced apnea. The mechanism of their action is not certain. Possibilities include increased chemoreceptor responsiveness (based on increased breathing responses to CO2), enhanced respiratory muscle performance and generalized central nervous system excitation.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-10-01 20:04:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caffeine has a potential therapeutic advantage over theophylline due to its higher therapeutic ratio, more reliable enteral absorption and longer half life, which allows once daily administration (<LINK REF="REF-Blanchard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchard 1992</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-10-01 20:04:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If prolonged, apnea can lead to hypoxemia and reflex bradycardia, which may require active resuscitative efforts to reverse. There are clinical concerns that these episodes might be harmful to the developing brain or cause dysfunction of the gut or other organs, although there are no data to support this. Frequent episodes may be accompanied by respiratory failure of sufficient severity as to lead to intubation and the use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV).</P>

<P>
<B>Caffeine vs. theophylline for apnea in preterm infants (all infants)(Comparison 1):</B>
</P>
<P>There is no difference in the failure rate (&lt; 50% reduction in apnea/bradycardia) of treatment with caffeine or theophylline at one to three days [two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Bairam-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bairam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scanlon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Scanlon 1992</LINK>); summary relative risk (RR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41, 4.52] (<I>Outcome 1.1</I>) or at five to seven days (one study, <LINK REF="STD-Bairam-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bairam 1987</LINK>; RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.32, 7.14) (<I>Outcome 1.2</I>). There was a small borderline but insignificant increase in the mean rate/100 min of apnea in the caffeine group at one to three days [all five included studies, weighted mean difference (WMD) 0.11, 95% CI 0.00, 0.22] (<I>Outcome 1.3</I>). In individual studies at one to three days there was a significantly higher mean apnea rate in the caffeine group in <LINK REF="STD-Scanlon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Scanlon 1992</LINK> (0.46 95%CI 0.14, 0.78) and a non-significant trend of increase in <LINK REF="STD-Bairam-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bairam 1987</LINK>. At five to seven days there was no difference in mean apnea rates in individual studies or in WMD between groups [four studies, <LINK REF="STD-Bairam-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bairam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brouard-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Brouard 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuglsang--1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fuglsang 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 1992</LINK>; (WMD 0.0; 95% CI -0.05, 0.05] (<I>Outcome 1.4</I>), or in individual studies.</P>
<P>Side effects, as indicated by tachycardia or feed intolerance leading to change in dosing, were lower in the caffeine group [RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.04, 0.72; risk difference (RD) -0.29; 95% CI -0.47, -0.10, number needed to treat (NNT) 3.5; 95% CI 2.1, 9.6] (<I>Outcome 1.5</I>). This was consistent across the three studies reporting side effects data (<LINK REF="STD-Bairam-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bairam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brouard-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Brouard 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scanlon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Scanlon 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>No trial reported the use of IPPV and no data are available to assess the effects on growth and neurological development.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-10-01 20:21:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was no difference in the failure rate (number of infants with &lt; 50% reduction in apnea) between caffeine and theophylline at one to three and five to seven days. There was also no significant differences in the weighted mean differences of apnea on day one to day three and on day five to day seven.</P>
<P>Three studies found standard caffeine treatment to have less short-term side effects than theophylline, consistent with known caffeine and theophylline pharmacology. The NNT of 3.5 indicates that for every three to four patients treated with caffeine, one patient having a significant adverse event can be avoided.</P>
<P>There are no data from these studies on long-term effectiveness.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-10-01 20:23:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for clinical trials with larger numbers of infants born at a lower gestational age to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of caffeine compared to theophylline treatment with respect to clinically important outcomes including safety and long-term effects on neurodevelopmental outcome. The appropriate dose of methylxanthine therapy requires further investigation.</P>
<P>The daily maintenance dose of caffeine was 2.5 mg (equal to 5 mg caffeine citrate) in four trials and 3 mg (10 mg caffeine citrate) in one (<LINK REF="STD-Scanlon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Scanlon 1992</LINK>). In most clinical practices, 5 mg (10 mg caffeine citrate) is used. The possibility that higher doses of caffeine might be more effective in extremely preterm infants needs further evaluation in randomized clinical trials.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-10-01 20:24:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review should be interpreted with caution. The number of infants in each study was small. There was some variability in the characteristics of participants in terms of gestational age as well as clinical status. For example <LINK REF="STD-Scanlon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Scanlon 1992</LINK> examined infants who were of lower gestational age and who were oxygen dependent. This trial contributed the most weight to the difference in mean rates of apnea/bradycardia at one to three days. It also examined a third treatment arm of higher dose caffeine but this has not been included here.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-10-01 20:25:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In treatment of preterm infants with apnea, caffeine appears to have similar short-term reductions of apnea/bradycardia when compared to theophylline. In view of the other therapeutic advantages of caffeine (a higher therapeutic ratio, more reliable enteral absorption and a longer half life as well as less side effects than theophylline) caffeine is the preferred treatment for apnea in preterm infants. There are no data from these studies on the long-term effectiveness and safety of the drugs.</P>
