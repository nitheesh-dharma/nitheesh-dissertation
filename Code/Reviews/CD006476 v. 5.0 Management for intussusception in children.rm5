<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>How is intussusception best managed in children?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Intussusception is a medical emergency that occurs in children when a part of the bowel 'telescopes' (folds) into another part of the bowel. This causes pain, vomiting, and obstruction, preventing passage. If left untreated, the bowel can perforate, resulting in passage of its contents into the abdominal cavity, causing further complications. In rare cases, these events can cause death. Prompt diagnosis and management reduces associated risks and the need for surgery.</P>
<P>Once intussusception is diagnosed, most doctors agree on the use of enema as initial treatment. This procedure involves introducing a substance (air or liquid) into the bowel, via the rectum, with a particular pressure that reduces the 'telescoped' bowel into its normal position.</P>
<P>Debate persists on specifics regarding what type of substance should be used for the enema, how the substance is visualised during the process, whether extra medications should be given to enhance treatment, and how one should deal with treatment failure, as well as the best approach to surgical management of intussusception in children.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence is current to September 2016. We identified six randomised studies, with a total of 822 participants, that explored the management of intussusception in children and assessed different types of interventions. We also identified three ongoing trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Main results</B>
</P>
<P>The main outcome was the number of children with a successfully reduced intussusception. Furthermore, outcomes included the number of children returning with a recurrent intussusception and evaluation of harms (adverse events) resulting from the interventions.</P>
<P>Evidence from two studies suggests that using air for the enema to reduce intussusception is superior to using liquid for the enema. Evidence from two studies also suggests that giving the child with intussusception a steroid medication, such as dexamethasone, may reduce the recurrence of intussusception, irrespective of whether liquid or air is used for the enema.<BR/>
<BR/>We identified only sparse information on intraoperative and postoperative complications and on other adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Of the six trials identified, we considered all to be potentially biased owing to lack of detail in reporting of how each study was undertaken. We found lack of consistency in how outcomes were defined and measured. All included studies were subject to serious concerns of imprecision based on few events, wide confidence intervals,or high risk of bias, Overall, we concluded that the quality of evidence provided by these studies was low, and that the real effects may differ significantly from those noted in these studies.<BR/>
<BR/>Further research is needed to help doctors better understand the most effective way to manage intussusception in children.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-30 08:40:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intussusception is a common abdominal emergency in children with significant morbidity. Prompt diagnosis and management reduces associated risks and the need for surgical intervention. Despite widespread agreement on the use of contrast enema as opposed to surgery for initial management in most cases, debate persists on the appropriate contrast medium, imaging modality, pharmacological adjuvant, and protocol for delayed repeat enema, and on the best approach for surgical management for intussusception in children.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-06-04 08:42:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the safety and effectiveness of non-surgical and surgical approaches in the management of intussusception in children.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-30 09:01:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8) in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to September 2016); Ovid Embase (1974 to September 2016); Science Citation Index Expanded (via Web of Science) (1900 to September 2016); and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to September 2016).</P>
<P>We examined the reference lists of all eligible trials to identify additional studies. To locate unpublished studies, we contacted content experts, searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov (September 2016), and explored proceedings from meetings of the British Association of Paedatric Surgeons (BAPS), the American Soceity of Pediatric Surgery, and the World Congress of Pediatric Surgery.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-05-30 08:40:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials comparing contrast media, imaging modalities, pharmacological adjuvants, protocols for delayed repeat enema, and/or surgical approaches for the management of intussusception in children. We applied no language, publication date, or publication status restrictions. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-05-30 08:40:54 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently conducted study selection and data extraction and assessed risk of bias using a standardised form. We resolved disagreements by consensus with a third review author when necessary. We reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis and evaluated the overall quality of evidence supporting the outcomes by using GRADE criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-30 08:41:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 822 participants. Two trials compared liquid enema reduction plus glucagon versus liquid enema alone. One trial compared liquid enema plus dexamethasone versus liquid enema alone. Another trial compared air enema plus dexamethasone versus air enema alone, and two trials compared use of liquid enema versus air enema.<BR/>
<BR/>We identified three ongoing trials.</P>
<P>We judged all included trials to be at risk of bias owing to omissions in reported methods. We judged five of six trials as having high risk of bias in at least one domain. Therefore, the quality of the evidence (GRADE) for outcomes was low. Interventions and data presentation varied greatly across trials; therefore meta-analysis was not possible for most review outcomes.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Enema plus glucagon versus enema alone</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether use of glucagon improves the rate of successful reduction of intussusception when compared with enema alone (reported in two trials, 218 participants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.26;<I> low quality of evidence</I>). No trials in this comparison reported on the number of children with bowel perforation(s) nor on the number of children with recurrent intussusception.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Enema plus dexamethasone versus enema alone</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Use of the adjunct, dexamethasone, may be beneficial in reducing intussusception recurrence with liquid or air enema (two trials, 299 participants; RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.60; <I>low quality of evidence</I>). This equates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 13 (95% CI 8 to 37). It is uncertain whether use of the adjunct, dexamethasone, improves the rate of successful reduction of intussusception when compared with enema alone (reported in two trials, 356 participants; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.10;<I> low quality of evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Air enema versus liquid enema</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Air enema may be more successful than liquid enema for reducing intussusception (two trials, 199 participants; RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.49; <I>low quality of evidence</I>). This equates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 6 (95% CI 4 to 19). No trials in this comparison reported on the number of children with bowel perforation(s) or on the number of children with recurrent intussusception nor any intraoperative complications, such as bowel perforation, or other adverse effects. Only one trial reported postoperative complications, but owing to the method of reporting used, a quantitative analysis was not possible. We identified no studies that exclusively evaluated surgical interventions for management of intussusception.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-30 08:45:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified a small number of trials that assessed a variety of interventions. All included trials provided evidence of low quality and were subject to serious concerns about imprecision, high risk of bias, or both. Air enema may be superior to liquid enema for successfully reducing intussusception in children; however, this finding is based on a few studies including small numbers of participants. Dexamethasone as an adjuvant may be more effective in reducing intussusception recurrence rates following air enema or liquid enema, but these results are also based on a few studies of small numbers of participants. This review highlights several points that need to be addressed in future studies, including reducing the risk of bias and including relevant outcomes. Specifically, surgical trials are lacking, and future research is needed to address this evidence gap.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-05-30 08:54:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intussusception in children is a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and management. It occurs when a segment of bowel (the <I>intussusceptum</I>) invaginates or telescopes into the lumen of another segment of bowel (the <I>intussuscipiens</I>). Both small and large bowel can be involved, but the most common kind of intussusception arises at the junction between the ileum and the caecum and is called <I>ileocaecal intussusception</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Loukas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loukas 2011</LINK>). When untreated, intussusception may cause bowel perforation, peritonitis, and shock (<LINK REF="REF-Ko-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 2007</LINK>). Mortality is rare, with the USA reporting a stable mortality rate of 2.1 per 1 million live births between 1997 and 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Buttery-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buttery 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Desai-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parashar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parashar 2000</LINK>). Case fatality rates are higher in developing countries, particularly in Africa (9.4%), than in other regions (&lt; 1%). This may be due to delays in treatment, a higher incidence of non-viable bowel, and lack of adequate medical care (<LINK REF="REF-Iwase-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iwase 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jiang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiang 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meier-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meier 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intussusception is one of the most common abdominal emergencies for children younger than age three (<LINK REF="REF-Applegate-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Applegate 2009</LINK>). Its incidence varies from 0.24 to 2.4 per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Bines-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bines 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eng-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eng 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huppertz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huppertz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samad-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samad 2014</LINK>), although evidence suggests that this rate is higher in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ugwu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ugwu 2000</LINK>). Boys are affected two to eight times more often than girls (<LINK REF="REF-Bines-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bines 2002</LINK>), and peak incidence occurs between five and nine months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Daneman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daneman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samad-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samad 2012</LINK>). Vaccination against rotavirus has been shown to increase the risk of intussusception. Currently, the monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix, GlaxoSmithKline, Abbott Park, North Carolina, USA) accounts for an increase of 5.3 cases of intussusception per 100,000 infants receiving the two doses of vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-Weintraub-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weintraub 2014</LINK>). However, each year, rotavirus infection causes gastroenteritis, resulting in 592,000 deaths among children younger than five years of age, with 82% of deaths reported in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Parashar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parashar 2000</LINK>). Hence, rotavirus vaccination is considered beneficial. A much stronger link between intussusception and an older rotavirus vaccine (RotaShield, Wyeth Laboratories, Marietta, Pennsylvania, USA) (<LINK REF="REF-Kramarz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramarz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soares_x002d_Weiser-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares-Weiser 2004</LINK>) led to its worldwide withdrawal in 1999.</P>
<P>The cause of intussusception is often idiopathic (<LINK REF="REF-Staatz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staatz 1998</LINK>), although any condition that produces pathological lead points (lesions in the bowel) can cause intussusception (<LINK REF="REF-Loukas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loukas 2011</LINK>). Of these conditions, lymphoid hypertrophy seems to be the most common (<LINK REF="REF-Applegate-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Applegate 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staatz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staatz 1998</LINK>), implicating a viral or bacterial origin for most cases (<LINK REF="REF-Nylund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nylund 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okimoto-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okimoto 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parashar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parashar 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staatz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staatz 1998</LINK>). Other potential causes of pathological lead points include Meckel's diverticulum, duplication cyst, polyp, and lymphoma (<LINK REF="REF-Daneman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daneman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daneman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daneman 2004</LINK>). Compared with idiopathic intussusception, intussusception caused by lead points is associated with poorer outcomes and may not be amenable to standard treatment owing to different intussusception locations (<LINK REF="REF-Applegate-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Applegate 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loukas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loukas 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diagnosis is challenging because the symptoms of intussusception are wide-ranging and non-specific (<LINK REF="REF-Beasley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beasley 1988</LINK>); the classic triad of symptoms associated with intussusception comprises vomiting, colicky abdominal pain, and bloody stool, but this triad is noted in less than half of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Blanch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanch 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lehnert-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehnert 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samad-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samad 2012</LINK>). Three studies found that physicians correctly diagnosed intussusception in less than half of initial clinical encounters (<LINK REF="REF-Beasley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beasley 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blanch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanch 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Budwig-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Budwig 1994</LINK>). Following successful reduction of the intussusception, early recurrence is rare, with rates ranging from 2.7% to 5.4% (<LINK REF="REF-Beres-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beres 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gray-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2014</LINK>). Diagnostic delay increases the risk of surgical intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Lehnert-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehnert 2009</LINK>), thus emphasising the importance of prompt and effective management.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-30 08:55:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-surgical management of intussusception in children consists of contrast enema (<LINK REF="REF-Applegate-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Applegate 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daneman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daneman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ito-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ito 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ko-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 2007</LINK>), which involves instilling contrast medium (i.e. air, saline, or barium) into the rectum via a rectal tube to reduce the intussusceptum by increasing intraluminal pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2003</LINK>). Fluoroscopy or, in the case of liquid contrast media, ultrasonography can guide the procedure and monitor the reduction. Ultrasonography avoids the radiation exposure associated with fluoroscopy and is an effective diagnostic tool (<LINK REF="REF-del_x002d_Pozo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">del-Pozo 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pharmacological adjuvants can facilitate non-surgical management, but their efficacy remains controversial. For example, glucagon is an antispasmodic adjuvant used by 10% to 21% of surveyed practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Cachat-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cachat 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1999</LINK>). It provides analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Lappas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lappas 1995</LINK>) and reduces colonic muscle tone (<LINK REF="REF-Skucas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skucas 1994</LINK>). However, a recent narrative review suggests that glucagon does not improve the rate of reduction in the non-surgical management of intussusception (<LINK REF="REF-Cachat-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cachat 2012</LINK>). Other adjuvants include antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Ein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ein 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pepper-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepper 2012</LINK>). One prospective study concluded that the actual risk of bacteraemia following fluoroscopically guided air reduction is low (<LINK REF="REF-Somekh-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Somekh 1996</LINK>), although two other studies reported an elevated risk for intussusception following antibiotic administration (<LINK REF="REF-Hviid-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hviid 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spiro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiro 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical management entails open laparotomy with manual reduction of the intussusception, although case series and retrospective studies show that laparoscopy may be safer and just as effective and may result in shorter hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bonnard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonnard 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sklar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sklar 2014</LINK>). Surgical management is generally indicated only if peritonitis, bowel perforation, or shock occurs; when appropriate radiological facilities are unavailable; or when contrast enema fails (<LINK REF="REF-American-College-of-Radiology-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">American College of Radiology 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daneman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daneman 2004</LINK>). However, because non-surgical management may be associated with lower morbidity and shorter hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Bruce-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruce 1987</LINK>), delayed repeat attempts at contrast enema may be preferred to surgical management (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez_x002d_Spinola-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez-Spinola 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandler 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>Intussusception is a common abdominal emergency in children with significant morbidity. Despite widespread agreement on the use of contrast enema for initial management, debate persists on the appropriate contrast medium, imaging modality, pharmacological adjuvant, and protocol to be used for delayed repeat enema (i.e. duration of delay and number of repeated attempts) (<LINK REF="REF-Beasley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beasley 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daneman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daneman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-del_x002d_Pozo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">del-Pozo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Littlewood-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littlewood 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmit-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmit 1999</LINK>). Debate also surrounds the best approach for its surgical management (i.e. open laparotomy vs laparoscopy). Prior reviews of non-surgical management (<LINK REF="REF-Applegate-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Applegate 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cachat-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cachat 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daneman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daneman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gray-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ko-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 2007</LINK>) are narrative in nature.

<P>Electronic searches of the Conchrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (n = 59), MEDLINE (n = 307), Embase (n = 140), BIOSIS (n = 94), and the Science Citation Index (n = 158) yielded a total of 758 publications. We identified three additional ongoing trials through trial registries and found no additional trials by searching conference proceedings and reference lists, or by contacting content experts. After exclusion of duplicates and ongoing trials, 435 unique records remained. Of these, we excluded 423 after reviewing titles and abstracts. We examined the full text of the remaining 12 publications and excluded five additional trials - four because they were not RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Diaz_x002d_Aldagalan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Diaz-Aldagalan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsiao-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hsiao 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 2009</LINK>) and one because we could not obtain a translation of the trial and classification is pending (Zhang 2014a).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-30 09:28:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified six completed trials of 822 participants in which all children had presented for management of intussusception. Investigators used a wide range of treatments, and this prevented meta-analysis for most of our outcomes. In particular, many review outcomes related to adverse effects (e.g. number of intraoperative complications) were not reported.</P>
<P>We could make few direct comparisons of interventions. However, air enema may be superior to liquid enema for successfully reducing intussusception in children. Use of dexamethasone as an adjunct may reduce the rate of recurrence of intussusception. No other results were statistically significant. See summary of findings tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). Of note, we downgraded many of the recommendations provided in these tables owing to the small numbers of included trials and the small participant numbers.</P>
<P>It is important to note that surgical intervention was not the primary study question for any of the included studies. Lack of trials on surgical management might reflect the nature of treatment of children with intussusception, and might suggest that cases are managed largely by non-surgical means, although this suggestion does not seem to be based on trial evidence.</P>

<P>The internal validity of the design, conduct, and analysis of included studies was difficult to assess because important methodological details were omitted from the study reports. No single study adequately reported all domains of the risk of bias assessment (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). We judged most trials as having high risk of bias in at least one domain, and omissions in methods were evident in all included studies. Selection bias was generally addressed adequately.Although detection and performance biases are difficult to mitigate for researchers in this field, it may be possible to overcome such biases, for example, <LINK REF="STD-Franken-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Franken 1983</LINK> used identical appearing vials for injection in both intervention and control groups. Reporting bias was also difficult to address, although with adequate reporting of protocols and reporting of all expected outcomes, as in <LINK REF="STD-Essa-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Essa 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Franken-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Franken 1983</LINK>, this may be mitigated. Although postoperative complications were reported (Outcome 2.9), <LINK REF="STD-Essa-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Essa 2011</LINK> presented data in such a way that analysis was not possible. Data for one subgroup of children, specifically those undergoing manual reduction, were not available. We attempted to contact study authors but received no response. Thus data were provided by only one study, and for only a subgroup of children receiving surgical intervention, and data were not sufficient to permit an analysis of this outcome. Again, trials infrequently reported data related to adverse events and harms. These situations might reflect missing data, which may have implications for analysis.</P>
<P>Included trials largely assessed participants of varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds from single centres; this fact may influence the comparability of results between studies. However, given the small quantity of evidence and our inability to perform a meta-analysis, we could not assess the implications of population differences for applicability of the evidence.</P>
<P>Again we wish to highlight the lack of evidence on surgical interventions and on different imaging modalities and protocols used for delayed repeat enemas.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-05-30 09:32:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have summarised the quality of evidence for each outcome in summary of findings tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>), which present evidence of low quality for all outcomes examined. We obtained only data for the outcomes 'liquid enema plus glucagon versus liquid enema alone' and 'air enema versus liquid enema' from two trials each, and data for all other outcomes from single trials only, most with small sample sizes. In <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, and <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>, we downgraded quality of trial evidence for serious to very serious concerns of imprecision or wide confidence intervals, or because trials were subject to serious to very serious concerns of high risk of bias. This limits the strength of our conclusions and our ability to investigate both clinical and statistical heterogeneity. The limited number of included studies and the heterogeneity between them precluded performance of sensitivity and subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>As all examined outcomes were subject to a GRADE assessment of low quality, the true effect of outcomes measured may be substantially different from the estimates; therefore, these estimates can be accepted only with limited confidence.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-05-30 09:32:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We undertook an extensive literature search to examine different aspects of surgical and non-surgical management of intussusception in children, and we sought data from each identified study. In particular, we attempted to contact study authors to gain further information, and we identified ongoing trials. Two independent review authors undertook searching and data extraction and analysis, and a third review author provided arbitration. However, we could not contact study authors to obtain the data that we required. Individuals who apply the results of this review need to acknowledge the limitations of available data derived from few trials.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-05-30 10:19:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To the best of our knowledge, this is the only systematic review of RCTs related to this topic, including unpublished data and ongoing trials. However, several narrative reviews have included comparative studies and RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Applegate-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Applegate 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cachat-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cachat 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daneman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daneman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ko-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sadigh-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadigh 2015</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Applegate-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Applegate 2009</LINK> included comparative trials as well as RCTs to examine the role of ultrasonography, air versus liquid enema for reduction, and risk of bowel perforation in children with intussusception. This review concurred that air enema was superior to liquid enema for successful reduction of intussusception in children - a fact that review authors attribute to speed, cost of the procedure, and safety. <LINK REF="REF-Daneman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daneman 2003</LINK> similarly included comparative studies and RCTs, highlighting in their review the ongoing debate regarding fluoroscopy versus ultrasound-guided enema reduction, suggesting that greater accuracy can be afforded with ultrasound-guided reduction. <LINK REF="REF-Ko-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 2007</LINK> also examined the role of fluoroscopy versus ultrasound-guided enema reduction by examining both comparative studies and RCTs; these review authors concluded that ultrasound-guided reduction is superior to fluoroscopy owing to its greater accuracy, lack of ionising radiation, lower costs, and no need for sedation. The authors of the current review could not perform the comparison offered in both <LINK REF="REF-Daneman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daneman 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Ko-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 2007</LINK> but agree with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Ko-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 2007</LINK>, which suggest that lack of standardisation among single studies makes objective comparison difficult. <LINK REF="REF-Cachat-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cachat 2012</LINK> performed a meta-analysis of studies examining children with radiologically confirmed intussusception, including RCTs and retrospective comparative studies, to compare rates of recurrence. Although Cachat found that dexamethasone was beneficial in reducing rates of recurrence of intussusception among children, review findings suggest that risk of recurrence of intussusception is low, and that regardless of the technique used for successful reduction, it is safe to discharge a patient after performing successful reduction. <LINK REF="REF-Sadigh-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadigh 2015</LINK> compared the efficacy of air versus liquid enema for reduction of intussusception in children and found that air enema was superior to liquid enema. These results are similar to those of the current review. <LINK REF="REF-Applegate-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Applegate 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cachat-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cachat 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Daneman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daneman 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ko-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 2007</LINK>, and <LINK REF="REF-Sadigh-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadigh 2015</LINK> included no relevant randomised trial that was not included in our review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-05-30 09:36:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low-quality evidence suggests that air enema may be more effective than liquid enema for reducing intussusception in children. Evidence is insufficient to show whether adjuncts such as glucagon or dexamethasone influenced intussusception reduction rates. Low-quality evidence suggests that use of dexamethasone as an adjunct may be associated with lower rates of recurrent intussusception when compared with enema alone. Evidence on any of the interventions examined was insufficient to allow us to draw any conclusions regarding rates of bowel perforation or other adverse effects.</P>
<P>We found no data on surgical interventions that were suitable for analysis, and no evidence regarding the relative effectiveness and safety of different imaging modalities or protocols for delayed repeat enemas.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-05-30 09:37:20 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence base for this topic is lacking and must be developed further. Clinical trials in children present specific challenges, although randomised controlled trials in surgery are well documented. Researchers must address these concerns. Populations studied should include people in low- and middle-income countries, where the burden of disease is greatest; and trials should be more adequately powered. Interventions utilised must be standardised and clearly defined. In particular, research on the surgical management of intussusception is needed. Outcomes should be standardised and data related to safety and harm should be included. In addition, future investigators should consider how blinding of participants and personnel might be achieved to minimise bias. Further clinical research is needed to determine the most effective and least harmful non-surgical and surgical approaches to management of intussusception in children.</P>

<P>In contrast to our published protocol, we decided to conduct the analysis using fixed-effect meta-analysis because it is more conservative in the presence of heterogeneity and small-study effects. Although not specifically stipulated in the protocol, we saw both quasi-RCTs and cluster RCTs as fit for inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>When data were missing, and intention-to-treat analysis was not possible, we planned to use available-case or per-protocol analysis.</P>
<P>Although we did not discuss these matters in the protocol, we used the GRADE approach and 'Summary of findings' tables to summarise our findings.</P>

<P>
<B>Procedure details: </B>During the first 1.5 years of the study, barium was the only liquid contrast agent used. During the final year, owing to evolving concepts in intussusception management and changes in personnel, the type of liquid contrast material (water-soluble or barium) used was determined at the radiologist's discretion</P>
<P>The study protocol allowed a maximum of 3 attempts at reduction for each participant. An attempt was defined as pneumatic or hydrostatic pressure applied for a total of 5 minutes. After 3 unsuccessful attempts, the examination was considered a failure</P>
<P>The concentration of barium used in individual cases was not recorded</P>
<P>Cysto-Conray II (Iothalamate meglumine 17.2%; Mallinckrodt Medical, St Louis, Missouri) was the water-soluble enema administered</P>
<P>The air insufflation device included an electronic pop-off valve that could be set to pressure of 60, 80, or 120 mmHg</P>
<P>
<B>Other details: </B>This study examined the accuracy of diagnosis with air versus liquid enema, and thus included participants who did not have intussusception. It was necessary to extrapolate the data of those who did have confirmed intussusception for our review</P>

<B>Procedure details:</B> The pressure of the enema employed was kept as uniform as possible, corresponding to 100 to 120 cm of barium suspension</P>
<P>Reduction was considered a failure when an intussusception could no longer be moved in an oral direction after several minutes of effective pressure</P>
<P>5 minutes after a first attempt had failed, a second and later a third attempt was made. Failure after this point meant that the participant was prepared for operation. Participants in the control group with 3 failed attempts were administered IV glucagon, as in the treatment group, and an attempt at hydrostatic reduction was repeated. After a fourth attempt, these participants were prepared for operation</P>
<P>
<B>Other details: </B>Study was undertaken in 3 steps (Step 1: initial 3 attempts at reduction as per treatment group; Step 2: participants belonging to the control group were administered glucagon and a fourth attempt was made at reduction; participants with reduction regarded as a failure were prepared for surgery; Step 3: all other participants otherwise not reduced were given a final attempt at reduction before they were prepared for surgery). We have included data only for Step 1, as this step pertains to our outcomes and criteria for inclusion</P>
