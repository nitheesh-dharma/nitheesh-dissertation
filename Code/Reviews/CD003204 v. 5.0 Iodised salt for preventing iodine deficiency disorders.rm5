<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Iodine deficiency causes mental retardation in children as well as enlarged thyroid glands (goitre) and deficiencies in thyroid hormones in people of all ages. It still exists in large parts of the world. This review looked at studies of iodised salt in the diet that included a comparison group. Six studies, most of them in children but some also in adults, were included. Iodine in the urine increased in all but one studies, but there was some concern that small children did not eat enough salt to achieve adequate iodine status. Some studies, but not all, also showed a reduction in the enlargement of the thyroid gland (goitre) that can accompany lack of iodine in the diet. Adverse effects were not reported, but these may not have been studied adequately. More high quality long term studies measuring outcomes related to child development, to deaths associated with iodine-deficiency and to adverse effects are needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Iodine deficiency is the main cause for potentially preventable mental retardation in childhood, as well as causing goitre and hypothyroidism in people of all ages. It is still prevalent in large parts of the world. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of iodised salt in comparison with other forms of iodine supplementation or placebo in the prevention of iodine deficiency disorders.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:25:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, the Register of Chinese trials developed by the Chinese Cochrane Centre, and the Chinese Med Database, China National knowledge Infrastructure, and searched reference lists, databases of ongoing trials and the Internet.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included prospective controlled studies of iodised salt versus other forms of iodine supplementation or placebo in people living in areas of iodine deficiency. Studies reported mainly goitre rates and urinary iodine excretion as outcome measures.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The initial data selection and quality assessment of trials was done independently by two reviewers. Subsequently, after the scope of the review was slightly widened from including only randomised controlled trials to including non-randomised prospective comparative studies, a third reviewer repeated the trials selection and quality assessment. As the studies identified were not sufficiently similar and not of sufficient quality, we did not do a meta-analysis but summarised the data in a narrative format.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We found six prospective controlled trials relating to our question. Four of these were described as randomised controlled trials, one was a prospective controlled trial that did not specify allocation to comparison groups, and one was a repeated cross-sectional study comparing different interventions. Comparison interventions included non-iodised salt, iodised water, iodised oil, and salt iodisation with potassium iodide versus potassium iodate. Numbers of participants in the trials ranged from 35 to 334; over 20,000 people were included in the cross-sectional study. Three studies were in children only, two investigated both groups of children and adults and one investigated pregnant women. There was a tendency towards goitre reduction with iodised salt, although this was not significant in all studies. There was also an improved iodine status in most studies (except in small children in one of the studies), although urinary iodine excretion did not always reach the levels recommended by the WHO. None of the studies observed any adverse effects of iodised salt.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The results suggest that iodised salt is an effective means of improving iodine status. No conclusions can be made about improvements in other, more patient-oriented outcomes, such as physical and mental development in children and mortality. None of the studies specifically investigated development of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, which can be easily overlooked if just assessed on the basis of symptoms. High quality controlled studies investigating relevant long term outcome measures are needed to address questions of dosage and best means of iodine supplementation in different population groups and settings.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:16:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Iodine deficiency (urinary iodine excretion less than 100 &#956;g/day) is the main cause for potentially preventable mental retardation in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>). It causes hypothyroidism, resulting in thyroid enlargement, mental retardation, increased neonatal and infant mortality, retardation of growth and development of the central nervous system in children (cretinism), reproductive failure, and an increase of fluid in the tissues (myxoedema) (<LINK REF="REF-Delong-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delong 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beaufrere-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaufrere 2000</LINK>). There are three main laboratory indicators of iodine deficiency: increased TSH concentration in neonatal blood and cord blood, increased concentration of thyroglobulin, and decreased concentration of iodine in the urine. Development of goitre, i.e. an enlargement of the thyroid gland (due to stimulation of growth by TSH), is common (endemic goitre) and does not need to be accompanied by an abnormality in thyroid hormones (euthyroid goitre).</P>
<P>Iodine deficiency is common, especially in Asia and Africa, but also in large parts of Eastern Europe. Only a small number of countries currently have sustainable iodine sufficiency, and about a third of the world's population lives in areas with some iodine deficiency. Inland areas, especially mountainous areas like the Alps, Himalayas and the Andes are particularly iodine deficient (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 2004</LINK>). Iodine deficiency disorders are a global health problem with nearly two billion people at risk (<LINK REF="REF-FAO_x002f_WHO_x002f_IAEA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">FAO/WHO/IAEA 1996</LINK>). In countries such as China, the incidence of iodine deficiency diseases in children and pregnant women in areas of iodine deficiency may be up to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Fong-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fong 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1997</LINK>). In certain Asian, African and Latin American countries iodine deficiency diseases affect more than 200 million people (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis of iodine deficiency disorders</HEADING>
<P>The following recommendations regarding assessment of iodine deficiency disorders are given by the WHO (in collaboration with the United Nations' Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the ICCIDD) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>):</P>
<P>Urinary iodine levels are useful for assessing iodine status as a result of recent iodine intake. Even though intra-individual variation exists, this tends to even out among populations. Twenty-four hour urine samples and relating urinary iodine to creatinine are not recommended.</P>
<P>One variable often measured is thyroid size. However, the determination of thyroid size is not feasible in neonates and it may be of limited use in school children (8-12 years), a group often studied, as the highest prevalence of goitre occurs during puberty and childbearing age. The two most common methods of measuring thyroid size are by palpation or by ultrasonography. While many studies assess goitre by palpation, the WHO suggests that this is not a very useful technique for determining the impact of iodisation programmes, where thyroid volumes may decrease over time, making the assessment difficult. The technique and classification of measurement of goitre by palpation are specified by the WHO. Ultrasonography is the method of choice for assessing the impact of iodisation programmes on thyroid size, an application of the technique is becoming feasible even in remote areas of the world (the 'thyromobil project').</P>
<P>Measurement of TSH levels, which are expected to be elevated in iodine deficiency, is not a reliable indicator in school children and adults as differences to normal levels are small and there is a large overlap between values in people who are iodine sufficient and those who are iodine deficient. However, TSH levels are a good indicator of iodine deficiency in neonates. Increased thyroglobulin levels are a good indicator of thyroid hyperplasia resulting from iodine deficiency. Thyroglobulin levels reflect iodine nutrition over months and years, whereas urinary iodine levels measure the more immediate effects of increased iodine intake on iodine status. Measurement of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) is not recommended, as the tests are difficult and expensive and the measurements are not very reliable indicators of iodine deficiency.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Iodine</HEADING>
<P>Iodine is a trace element which is an integral part of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), produced by the thyroid gland, a small butterfly-shaped organ situated in the neck. Thyroid hormones are essential for regulating and stimulating metabolism, temperature control, and normal growth and development (<LINK REF="REF-Larsen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsen 1981</LINK>). Synthesis and release of thyroid hormones are stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin), which is released from the pituitary gland; this regulation is subject to feedback inhibition.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">History of prevention of iodine deficiency disorders</HEADING>
<P>Large programmes for the prevention of iodine deficiency - or more specifically endemic goitre - using iodised salt were already initiated in Switzerland and in the USA in the 1920s, where large surveys of goitre incidence before and after the intervention showed the use of iodised salt to be an effective preventative intervention. New Zealand followed in 1941 but only very low iodisation levels were used in the first 20 years. Then in the 1950s and the 1960s a number of European countries followed, with associated reductions in endemic goitre rates. Before 1960, interventions for iodine deficiency disorders were pursued by every country independently. Between 1961 and 1973, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) had four international meetings regarding interventions for iodine deficiency. At the fourth meeting in 1973, diagnostic criteria, measures of intervention, and directions of research were suggested. At the fifth meeting in 1983, these diagnostic criteria were revised. In 1986, the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD) was established in Kathmandu, Nepal. Based on the proposal of the ICCIDD, the 39th World Health Congress in 1986, declared that iodine deficiency disorders should be controlled within the following ten years. Since its establishment in 1986, the ICCIDD's work focused on Africa and South-East Asia. The 43rd World Health Congress in 1990 declared that iodine deficiency disorders should have disappeared from the earth by 2000. Also in 1990, the 71 heads of States and 80 other officials from 150 governments who attended the World Summit for Children held in New York in 1990 adopted the goal of virtual elimination of iodine deficiency disorders by the year 2000. In response to this recommendation, most of the countries with iodine deficiency problems agreed to try to iodise 90% of all edible salt by 1995. However, iodine deficiency disorders have not yet been eliminated and 36 affected countries have not yet introduced salt iodisation programmes (see <LINK REF="REF-Delange-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delange 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Salt iodisation</HEADING>
<P>Iodised salt, iodised bread, iodised water and injecting iodine oil are commonly used for preventing iodine deficiency disorders. Iodised salt is considered the most appropriate means of iodine supplementation for the following reasons: 1. It is consumed by nearly everyone at roughly equal amounts throughout the year, 2. Salt production is limited to a few centres, facilitating quality control, 3. Addition of iodate or iodide does not affect the taste or smell of the salt, and 4. Iodisation is cheap (less than 0.01 US Dollar a day for the estimated amount of salt intake). However, there have been problems with implementing salt iodisation in countries with numerous scattered salt deposits and complex distribution systems, so alternatives are sometimes required (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Salt is commonly iodised using potassium iodate (KIO3) or potassium iodide (KI). Potassium iodate is the more stable and less soluble form, making it the recommended form, especially for use in moist tropical locations. The WHO recommends a daily intake of 90 &#956;g of iodine for infants (0-59 months), 120 &#956;g for schoolchildren (6-12 years), 150 &#956;g for adolescents and adults and 200 &#956;g for pregnant and lactating women. The appropriate level of salt iodisation will depend on the individual consumption of salt, the degree of iodine deficiency in the area and the loss of iodine from producer to consumer. All these factors will be different in different countries, and levels of salt iodisation have varied substantially between countries and over time. Currently, iodisation levels of 20-40 mg iodine per kg of salt are recommended. In addition, the response to supplemental iodine may be reduced by other factors in the environment, such as consumption of specific goitrogenic foods (for example, cassava (manioc)), and deficiency of other trace elements in the diet, such as selenium (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-K_x00f6_hrle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Köhrle 1999</LINK>) or iron (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmermann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmermann 2000</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:18:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Many large surveys on goitre prevalence have been carried out worldwide, but only few controlled trials on the effectiveness of iodised salt for goitre prevention have been done. A Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 2001</LINK>) investigates the effect of maternal iodine supplementation in pregnant women. The review suggests that iodine supplementation leads to improved outcomes in the children of the mothers having received the supplements (decreased mortality, decreased prevalence of cretinism and increased scores of psychomotor development). However, as the review only included pregnant women and outcomes in their children, and as none of the included studies used iodised salt, conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the effects of supplementation with iodised salt in the general population. A small number of controlled trials have suggested that iodised salt may be effective at preventing iodine deficiency disorders. There remains some uncertainty whether goitre rates are reduced by the supply of iodised salt (<LINK REF="STD-Hintze-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hintze 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 1997</LINK>). Furthermore, there is some evidence that correcting for iodine deficiency with excessive supplementation of iodine increases the risk of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Delange-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delange 1999</LINK>) and thyroid auto-immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Kahaly-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahaly 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In light of this incomplete evidence and the possibility of adverse effects, a systematic review of controlled trials of iodised salt in comparison to other forms of iodine supplementation in the general population is needed.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Originally we had intended to include only randomised controlled trials in this review. However, after becoming better acquainted with the literature, we felt that it would be appropriate also to include other types of prospective comparative epidemiological studies. We therefore included in this review any prospective study that had a control group and studied the prevention of iodine deficiency disorders using iodised salt. We were particularly interested in randomised and quasi-randomised trials of a duration of at least one year, but other controlled trials were also considered. Trials using indicators for assessment of iodine deficiency disorders that are approved by the WHO, UNICEF and the ICCIDD were preferred.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The review includes trial participants (adults and children) living in areas with low iodine intake (iodine deficiency). Controlled trials of iodine supplementation before or during pregnancy with outcomes referring only to the neonate were excluded as these have already been included in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 2001</LINK>). </P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-08 14:05:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The quality of reporting of each trial was assessed independently by three reviewers (TW, GL, CC) according to a modification of the quality criteria specified by Schulz (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) and in Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook 4.2.2.</P>
<P>In particular, the following quality criteria were assessed.<BR/>1. Minimisation of selection bias - a) was the randomisation procedure adequate? b) was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>2. Minimisation of performance bias - were the participants and people administering the treatment blind to the intervention?<BR/>3. Minimisation of attrition bias - a) were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? b) was analysis by intention-to-treat?<BR/>4. Minimisation of detection bias - were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were subdivided into one of the following three categories:<BR/>A - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias.<BR/>B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias.<BR/>C - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>
<P>We had intended to use this classification as the basis of a sensitivity analysis. Additionally, we were going to explore the influence of individual quality criteria in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>After reviewing the literature, we also decided that the following two quality criteria were important.</P>
<UL>
<LI>similarity of the groups at baseline</LI>
<LI>measurement of the level of salt iodisation and of other potential sources of iodine accessible to the participants</LI>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-11-08 14:27:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>As we did not identify enough high quality randomised controlled trials and as outcome measures were reported in various different ways that could not easily be converted into a standard measure, we decided against doing a meta-analysis. Data were summarised in a narrative format. Different comparisons were analysed separately.</P>
<P>If there are data available for meta-analysis in future, we will proceed as follows: Data will be included in a meta-analysis if they are of sufficient quality and sufficiently similar. We expect both event (dichotomous) data and continuous data. Dichotomous data will be expressed as odd ratios (OR). The relative risk (RR) may be used as an alternative to the OR as interpretation is easier, especially if the outcome is a negative event. Continuous data will be expressed as weighted mean differences (WMD). Overall results will be calculated based on the random effects model. Heterogeneity will be tested for using the Z score and the Chi square statistic with significance being set at P &lt; 0.1. Possible sources of heterogeneity will be assessed by sensitivity and subgroup analyses as described below. Small study bias will be tested for using the funnel plot or other corrective analytical methods depending on the number of clinical trials included in the systematic review.</P>

<P>Numbers of participants of the studies ranged from 35 to over 20,000. Most studies had over hundred participants. Most studies examined children (5 years and younger to 16 years) (<LINK REF="STD-Sooch-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Sooch 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hintze-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hintze 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1999</LINK>) one study examined women of childbearing age (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK>), one studied pregnant women (<LINK REF="STD-Romano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 1991</LINK>), and one the general population (<LINK REF="STD-Sooch-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Sooch 1965</LINK>). Studies were all carried out in areas of know iodine deficiency with substantial goitre rates (9.5-83%). Some studies had substantial differences in baseline goitre rates and urinary iodine excretion (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-l_x0027_Ons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">l'Ons 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>Four of the studies included a control group where no iodine supplementation was used (<LINK REF="STD-Sooch-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Sooch 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hintze-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hintze 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-l_x0027_Ons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">l'Ons 2000</LINK>). In one study, iodised water was used as a comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK>), one study used iodised oil (<LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1999</LINK>), and two studies compared different forms of iodised salt (specially prepared iodised salt versus commercially available iodised salt in the trial by Zhao et al (<LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1999</LINK>), and salt fortified with potassium iodide versus salt fortified with potassium iodate in the trial by Sooch and Ramalingaswami (<LINK REF="STD-Sooch-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Sooch 1965</LINK>)). Levels of iodisation were 12 to 53 parts per million (ppm). All interventions were given orally.

<P>All studies measuring goitre rates (or thyroid volume) showed a trend towards reduction in goitre rates (or prevention of occurrence of goitre) with the use of iodised salt. These reductions were significant in the studies by Sooch and Ramalingaswami (<LINK REF="STD-Sooch-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Sooch 1965</LINK>), Zhao et al (<LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1999</LINK>) (at least for specially distributed salt and for market salt plus iodised oil), and Foo et al (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK>) (women only). The prevention of increase in thyroid volume in pregnancy with use of iodised salt in the study by Romano et al (<LINK REF="STD-Romano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 1991</LINK>) was a significant effect. No significant effects of iodised salt on goitre rates were seen in the study by Hintze et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hintze-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hintze 1988</LINK>) and the (short term) study by l'Ons et al (<LINK REF="STD-l_x0027_Ons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">l'Ons 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>In almost all studies measuring urinary iodine, iodine excretion was significantly increased with use of iodised salt. The only exception was the study by Foo et al (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK>), were iodine excretion was not significantly increased in small children (of less than six years). The WHO target value of iodine excretion of at least 100 µg/L was reached in at least three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK> (women only); <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-l_x0027_Ons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">l'Ons 2000</LINK>). It was clearly not reached in the study by Hintze et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hintze-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hintze 1988</LINK>) and in the children in the study by Foo et al (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK>). From the data, no clear relation can be seen between dose of iodine in the salt and urinary iodine excretion.

In the study by Foo et al (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK>), iodised salt was about as effective as iodised water in women aged 15-40 years, but iodised water was more effective in children below six years. In the study by Zhao et al (<LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1999</LINK>), iodised salt with a carefully controlled iodine content and commercially available iodised salt with a supplementation of iodised oil were more efficient that commercially available iodised salt alone (which had a very variable iodine content).</P>

However, in the study by Foo et al (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK>), small children (below six years) benefited less than adults. The conclusion of that study is similar to the one given by Hintze et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hintze-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hintze 1988</LINK>), who suggested that salt consumption in children is lower than that of adults and that therefore children might benefit less from salt iodised at a relatively low level.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:24:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We only found one randomised controlled trial relating to our question that was of fairly good quality, the other studies examined were of fairly poor quality and some of them were not randomised. The studies did not assess many of the outcome measures we had considered important. The studies identified used differing levels of salt iodisation and different units of measurement, and were therefore not easily comparable. There was a tendency towards goitre reduction with iodised salt, although this was not significant in all studies. There was also an improved iodine status in most studies (except in small children in one of the studies), although this did not always reach the levels recommended by the WHO.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>There have been concerns about adverse effects of iodine supplementation, including iodised salt supplementation. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism has been observed in a number of iodine supplementation programmes, including programmes using iodised salt (<LINK REF="REF-Galofre-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galofre 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Todd-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bourdoux-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourdoux 1996</LINK>). In the cases cited, iodisation levels were much higher than those recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Todd-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bourdoux-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourdoux 1996</LINK>) or iodisation occurred in an area of iodine sufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Galofre-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galofre 1994</LINK>), however, iodine-induced hyperthyroidism has also been observed when lower levels of iodine were given. An associated increase in cardiovascular mortality has been reported. The data suggest that iodine-induced hyperthyroidism mainly occurs in people over forty years of age with nodular goitres, in whom some thyroid autonomy has developed, i.e. thyroid hormone production is not inhibited by increased levels of iodine (<LINK REF="REF-Corvilain-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corvilain 1998</LINK>). The risk of developing iodine-induced hyperthyroidism seems to be higher when initial iodine deficiency was severe and when the initial rise in iodine intake was great. Increases in cases of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism are often only temporary after the introduction of iodisation programmes, but there are also cases in which the disorder persists. As symptoms of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism are often not very severe and very non-specific, it is easy to overlook the problem unless investigators specifically study hormone levels (<LINK REF="REF-Stanbury-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanbury 1998</LINK>), which was done in none of the studies included in this review. While surveys suggest that the benefits of iodine supplementation outweigh the risks, the potentially fatal nature of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism places an increased importance on adequate monitoring of the levels of iodine in supplements, on adequate monitoring of the iodine status of populations and on early detection of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1998b</LINK>).</P>

It becomes apparent that delivery and quality control of iodised salt is probably more difficult in remote areas in developing countries and this method of iodine supplementation is therefore not without problems. However, the impression also arises that it is the most practicable and well accepted means of providing iodine supplementation.</P>
<P>The studies identified focussed mainly on children and women of childbearing age. While these are probably the most vulnerable to iodine deficiency disorders, future studies should also include other population groups. The question also arises of the most adequate way of iodine supplementation in newborn babies and infants. They will not consume any iodised salt at all. If they are breast fed, it would be interesting to establish if any iodised salt consumed by the mother to achieve an adequate iodine status is also enough to achieve an adequate iodine status in the child.</P>
<P>Studies generally concentrated on measuring iodine status by measuring urinary iodine levels - presumably because these measurements can be easily and quickly obtained. However, these values will not reflect long term iodine status and therefore other indicators should be used, for example, thyroglobulin levels or iodine excretion profiles, to get a more accurate picture of iodine status.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-11-08 14:18:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>There was only a small number of studies included in this review, none of which abided by the criteria laid down in the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2001</LINK>). The only study of slightly higher quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1999</LINK>) was faced with the problem that the commercially available iodised salt had a very unreliable iodine content. This may demonstrate that in certain parts of the world the quality control of iodisation programmes is a problem, but does not allow any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of salt iodisation per se. Most of the other studies were also faced with major confounders, such as differences in baseline goitre rates (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-l_x0027_Ons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">l'Ons 2000</LINK>), presence of goitrogens in the diet (<LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK>), levels of iodisation not reaching the recommended level of iodine intake (<LINK REF="STD-Hintze-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hintze 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Foo 1996</LINK> (children)), and restriction to pregnant women, in whom iodine requirements are different to those of the general population (<LINK REF="STD-Romano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 1991</LINK>). In the study by Sooch and Ramalingaswami (<LINK REF="STD-Sooch-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Sooch 1965</LINK>) the populations studied at the different time points did not consist entirely of the same people, even though the populations studied were fairly well isolated and increases in numbers in the groups at the end of the study may have been due to internal effects (for example, children below five years at the beginning of the study growing older). However, all this means that none of the studies were ideally suited to investigate the effectiveness of iodised salt in preventing iodine deficiency disorders and any conclusions must be treated with great caution.</P>
<P>This review focussed on iodised salt as a means of iodine supplementation. While iodised salt is undoubtedly the form of iodine supplementation most widely used and most practical for global use, the results of the review also suggest that it is not suitable for all situations. It may therefore be more useful to compare all the different forms of iodine supplementation, to give a more complete picture. We intend to do this in a future version of this review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results suggest that iodised salt is an effective means of improving iodine status and support the current endeavours to achieve universal salt iodisation. Variations in the iodine levels in the salt used by some studies suggest that particular care must be taken to ensure the quality of the production and storage of iodised salt - and that there may be situations in which other forms of iodine supplementation may be more appropriate. There was also a suggestion that forms of iodine supplementation should be reassessed in small children, as their salt intake may not be high enough to guarantee adequate iodine levels through the use of iodised salt. There was no suggestion from the studies that the use of iodised salt with the levels of iodine studied had any unwanted side effects, although this point must be regarded with caution as most studies did not specifically consider adverse effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More high quality controlled trials (following the CONSORT criteria) are required for assessing the effects of iodised salt in comparison to other forms of iodine supplementation. These studies should also address the question of the most effective dose to be used (under given conditions). Studies should be large and long term, lasting at least two years, including participants of all ages. The outcomes studied should not be restricted to goitre rates and urinary iodine excretion, but should include the other outcome measures specified above, such as mental and physical development in children, mortality, etc. Special attention should be paid to adverse effects. The effects of iodised salt should be assessed separately for children (including very young children who may have a relatively low salt consumption) and adults. </P>
