<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-30 17:19:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Smokeless tobacco is any product in which tobacco is held in the mouth so that nicotine is absorbed through the lining of the mouth. Smokeless tobacco is less dangerous than cigarettes and other products where tobacco is burnt and nicotine absorbed through the lungs. However, smokeless tobacco still leads to nicotine addiction and can be harmful, especially to the mouth. Many types of smokeless tobacco are used around the world, including chewing tobacco, snuff and snus. The risks to health vary with the type of product.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence from randomized trials about interventions to help people stop using smokeless tobacco, including nicotine replacement therapy, other pharmacotherapies and behavioural support. This evidence is current to June 2015. Trials had to report the number of participants who had stopped using smokeless tobacco or other products after six months.</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
</P>
<P>We found 34 relevant trials covering over 16,000 participants. All except one were conducted in the USA. Some studies in dental health clinics provided advice about oral health problems to smokeless tobacco users whether or not they were interested in stopping. Some studies recruited users who wanted to stop.</P>
<P>Sixteen trials with 3,722 participants tested pharmacotherapies. Twelve studies tested different types of nicotine replacement therapy (five gum, two patch, five lozenge). The evidence suggests that the nicotine lozenge might help people quit, but the quality of evidence was low and more research is needed. There was not enough evidence to be sure whether nicotine gum or patches could help. Two trials of varenicline (a medication that helps smokers to quit) suggested it can also help people quit using smokeless tobacco.Two small trials of bupropion (an antidepressant that helps smokers to quit) did not find that bupropion helped people quit using smokeless tobacco.</P>
<P>Seventeen trials with 12,394 participants tested behavioural support. The behavioural support could include brief advice, self-help materials, telephone support, access to a website, and combinations of elements. There was a lot of variation in results with some trials showing clear evidence of benefit and some not showing any effect. We could not be certain what the important elements of effective support were, but providing access to telephone support generally seemed to be helpful.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-21 12:06:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 34 trials that met the inclusion criteria, of which nine were new for this update, representing over 16,000 participants. There was moderate quality evidence from two studies suggesting that varenicline increases ST abstinence rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.68, 507 participants). Pooled results from two trials of bupropion did not detect a benefit of treatment at six months or longer (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.44, 293 participants) but the confidence interval was wide. Neither nicotine patch (five trials, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.37, 1083 participants) nor nicotine gum (two trials, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43, 310 participants) increased abstinence. Pooling five studies of nicotine lozenges did increase tobacco abstinence (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.59, 1529 participants) but confidence in this estimate is low as the result is sensitive to the exclusion of three trials which did not use a placebo control.</P>
<P>Statistical heterogeneity was evident among the 17 trials of behavioural interventions: eight of them reported statistically and clinically significant benefits; six suggested benefit but with wide CIs and no statistical significance; and three had similar intervention and control quit rates and relatively narrow CIs. Heterogeneity was not explained by study design (individual or cluster randomization), whether participants were selected for interest in quitting, or specific intervention components. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, trials of behavioural interventions incorporating telephone support, with or without oral examination and feedback, were associated with larger effect sizes, but oral examination and feedback alone were not associated with benefit.</P>
<P>In one trial an interactive website increased abstinence more than a static website. One trial comparing immediate cessation using nicotine patch versus a reduction approach using either nicotine lozenge or brand switching showed greater success for the abrupt cessation group.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-21 12:06:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Varenicline, nicotine lozenges and behavioural interventions may help ST users to quit. Confidence in results for nicotine lozenges is limited. Confidence in the size of effect from behavioural interventions is limited because the components of behavioural interventions that contribute to their impact are not clear. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-21 12:06:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Smokeless tobacco (ST) is tobacco that is orally consumed and not burned. A variety of types of ST are consumed throughout the world and ST use is an important worldwide public health issue. In the United States, the principal types of ST are chewing tobacco (cut tobacco leaves) and snuff (moist ground tobacco). In Sweden, 'snus' (finely ground moist tobacco) is most commonly used. In India, ST contains tobacco leaf mixed with other ingredients, such as betel leaf, areca nut and lime (i.e., gutkha) (<LINK REF="REF-Critchley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Critchley 2003</LINK>). In Sudan, toombak is made from a fermented ground powdered tobacco mixed with sodium bicarbonate (<LINK REF="REF-Idris-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idris 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Around the world, ST is used by 300 million people in at least 70 countries. The majority of smokeless tobacco users (89%) are in Southeast Asia (<LINK REF="REF-NCI-_x0026_-CDC-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI &amp; CDC 2014</LINK>). In the US in 2012, 3.5% of individuals aged 12 or older (9 million people) used ST in the past month (<LINK REF="REF-SAMHSA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAMHSA 2014</LINK>). Rates of past month ST use have remained stable between 2002 and 2012 in the U.S. In India, smokeless tobacco remains by far the most prevalent form of tobacco used (26% of population) (<LINK REF="REF-Kostova-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kostova 2015</LINK>). In 2013 in Sweden, 20% of men and 4% of women used ST daily and 3% and 1%, respectively, did so occasionally (<LINK REF="REF-Norberg-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norberg 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Available literature suggests that adverse health consequences may vary by the type of ST use, which is strongly associated with geography. According to the 1986 report of the US Surgeon General, the use of ST products can lead to nicotine addiction (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1986</LINK>). ST consumed in the US has been associated with periodontal disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ernster-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernster 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2005</LINK>), precancerous oral lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Mattson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattson 1989</LINK>), oral cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Stockwell-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockwell 1986</LINK>), and cancer of the kidney (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muscat-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muscat 1995</LINK>), pancreas (<LINK REF="REF-Muscat-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muscat 1997</LINK>), and digestive system (<LINK REF="REF-Henley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henley 2005</LINK>). ST has been shown to act as an autonomic and haemodynamic stimulus by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and epinephrine levels (<LINK REF="REF-Wolk-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolk 2005</LINK>), and has been associated with death from cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Henley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henley 2005</LINK>). A recent systematic review concluded that betel quid and tobacco use in India are associated with substantial risks of oral cancer, but studies from the US and Scandinavia do not show a consistent association (<LINK REF="REF-Critchley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Critchley 2003</LINK>). Studies have suggested that ST use during pregnancy is likely to be harmful to the foetus (<LINK REF="REF-England-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">England 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two of the world's largest cigarette manufacturers, Phillip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds, entered the ST market in the mid 2000s. Phillip Morris USA marketed Marlboro Snus and R.J. Reynolds marketed Camel Snus (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2010</LINK>). These products were marketed as low-nitrosamine ST products (<LINK REF="REF-Alpert-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alpert 2008</LINK>) which potentially confer a lower risk of cancer. At the same time, ST was increasingly being proposed as a harm reduction strategy for cigarette smokers (<LINK REF="REF-McNeill-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeill 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2006</LINK>). Although the health risks of ST use are lower than those from smoked tobacco, concern existed that the promotion of ST use may lead to smokers using both products rather than quitting tobacco use altogether, and to former smokers and never smokers initiating ST use. The impact of these factors on the prevalence of ST use remains unclear, but suggests an ongoing need for developing effective treatments for ST use.</P>
<P>Despite the widespread use of ST products and their potentially adverse health consequences, medical and oral health professionals have had a lack of evidence summaries or evidence-based guidelines to assist them in providing effective treatment for ST use. Smokeless tobacco cessation guidelines for health professionals in England were published after the first version of the present review was published in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-West-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2004</LINK>). An evidence summary of ST interventions has also been published (<LINK REF="REF-NCI-_x0026_-CDC-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI &amp; CDC 2014</LINK>).</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2015-09-24 10:25:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the most recent update we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register in June 2015. At the time of the search the Register included the results of searches of: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), issue 5, 2015; MEDLINE (via OVID) to update 20150501; EMBASE (via OVID) to week 201519; and PsycINFO (via OVID) to update 20150506. See the <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clabout/articles/TOBACCO/frame.html">Tobacco Addiction Group Module</A> in the Cochrane Library for full search strategies and list of other resources searched for the register. Additional sources were also searched for early versions of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Ebbert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebbert 2003</LINK>); these included Web of Science, Dissertation Abstracts Online, Scopus, Healthstar, ERIC, National Technical Information Service database, and Current Contents.</P>
<P>The search strategy for the Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register used the following terms for smokeless tobacco: chewing tobacco; oral tobacco; spit tobacco; snuff; smokeless tobacco; quid; chew; plug; and tobacco, smokeless (MeSH), appearing in titles, abstracts or keywords. No intervention terms were used. No language restrictions were imposed.<BR/>
<BR/>We scanned the reference lists of retrieved studies including review articles, conference proceedings, and personal reference files. For early versions of the review we asked content experts through electronic mail and telephone contact to identify unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We corresponded with experts in tobacco and ST use research.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2015-07-30 09:15:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>One author examined each title generated from the search and identified potentially eligible articles for which we obtained the abstracts. These were considered by two authors. For abstracts consistent with study eligibility, we obtained the full article text. Any difference of opinion about study inclusion would have been resolved by consensus.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2015-10-21 12:06:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data about participants, interventions, outcomes and methodological quality. Any discrepancies in extracted data were resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>We extracted data on the number of users quit at the longest follow-up, using the strictest definition of abstinence reported. We selected continuous or prolonged abstinence in preference to point prevalence where both were reported. Participants who were randomized but dropped out or were lost to follow-up were assumed to be continuing users.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-10-21 12:07:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the risk of selection bias. To be judged low risk for selection bias a trial had to report both an adequate method of random sequence generation, and of allocation sequence concealment. Studies reporting a method of sequence generation which did not allow allocation concealment (for example, allocation on the basis of patient record number) were judged to be at high risk of bias. Studies which did not report an acceptable method of allocation concealment, for example central enrolment and allocation, or consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes, were rated at high risk of bias. Studies which did not give sufficient detail to assess quality were rated unclear. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of the effect of including trials at high risk of selection bias in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We also considered the completeness of follow-up (attrition bias), judging risk of bias as low if more than 80% of participants provided data at follow-up, unclear if the proportion reached was lower but similar in each condition, and at high risk of bias if there was evidence of differential loss by intervention condition. Other possible indicators of quality include: blinding status of participants, investigators and outcome assessors; group similarity at baseline; equal treatment of groups during study conduct; analysis and conduct by the intention-to-treat principle; and use of a placebo or active intervention in the control group (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1993</LINK>). We did not formally assess the impact of differences in these criteria on the results. In the table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' we noted the use of biochemical validation, and reported differences in baseline characteristics, any co-interventions and the control intervention. If we were not able to extract data allowing an intention-to-treat analysis, this was recorded.</P>

<P>We use risk ratios (RRs) to represent the point estimate of the magnitude of association between intervention exposure and treatment outcomes, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to represent the precision around this point estimate. A RR greater than one indicates that the rates of tobacco abstinence were higher in the intervention group than in the control group. Earlier versions of the review used odds ratios because of the possibility that some cluster randomized trials would report adjusted odds ratios. We now use risk ratios as the majority of the included studies are individually randomized, risk ratios allow comparisons of effects with other Cochrane reviews, and are easier to interpret (Cochrane Handbook 9.2.2.2, <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-08-06 16:36:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We pooled results of studies when it was clinically and statistically appropriate to combine them. We did not combine pharmacotherapy and behavioural interventions. We conducted meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model, unless there was evidence of between-study heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1993</LINK>). Heterogeneity was quantified using the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). Values over 50% suggest moderate heterogeneity. Where heterogeneity was higher than this we explored possible explanations, and did not report a pooled estimate of the effect.</P>
<P>For the pharmacological interventions, we hypothesized that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) would lead to different outcomes compared with non-NRT pharmacotherapies (i.e., bupropion, varenicline). Underlying this hypothesis is the difference in the mechanisms of action between different pharmacotherapies (<LINK REF="REF-Fiore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiore 2000</LINK>). Thus, we kept different pharmacotherapies in separate prespecified subgroups.</P>
<P>We also hypothesized that the behavioural interventions involving recruitment of individual ST users would be associated with higher abstinence rates for intervention compared to control than those recruiting ST users at the organizational level. This was based upon the presumption that ST users receiving interventions at the organizational level (e.g. dental practice or athletic teams) may receive interventions although they are not actively seeking treatment for ST use, which will potentially lead to lower abstinence rates in this group.</P>

<P>The bupropion SR studies used a dose of 150 mg by mouth once a day for three days and then increased the dose to 150 mg twice a day (<LINK REF="STD-Dale-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 2007</LINK>). One nicotine patch study used 15 mg patches for six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Howard_x002d_Pitney-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howard-Pitney 1999</LINK>); the second used 21 mg patches with a tapering schedule for a total of 10 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Hatsukami-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hatsukami 2000</LINK>), and a third, in adolescents, tailored patch dose to baseline cotinine, using either 21 mg or 14 mg, both tapered over a six-week period (<LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2003</LINK>). The fourth nicotine patch study randomized participants to doses of 21, 42 and 63 mg per day compared to placebo, and the 21 mg and placebo arms were compared for analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>). The fifth nicotine patch study randomized patients to 42 mg of the nicotine patch (two 21 mg patches worn simultaneously) for eight weeks or two matching placebo patches (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2013b</LINK>). One nicotine gum trial instructed enrolled ST users to attempt a target daily dose of 12 pieces of 2 mg nicotine gum per day (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 1992</LINK>). The other nicotine gum study instructed ST users to use at least six pieces of 2 mg nicotine gum a day for one month and then gradually reduce use (<LINK REF="STD-Hatsukami-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hatsukami 1996</LINK>). Four of the nicotine lozenge studies used the 4 mg lozenge given for 12 weeks with a tapering schedule (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2015b" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2015</LINK>).

For studies determining abstinence from all tobacco products, carbon monoxide measurements and urinary anabasine and anatabine were used to determine abstinence from smoked tobacco. Three studies reported abstinence from smokeless tobacco only (<LINK REF="STD-Hatsukami-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hatsukami 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard_x002d_Pitney-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howard-Pitney 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hatsukami-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hatsukami 2000</LINK>). Since validation was also required, other forms of regular tobacco use would have been detected, but infrequent smokers might have been included as quitters.</P>

<P>Seven RCTs randomized over 3000 ST users at the organizational level. <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK> randomly allocated 75 dental practices to receive a workshop for their dental health professionals to develop skills in the identification and counselling of ST users or to provide usual care. <LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1995</LINK> analysed data from the Working Well Trial that randomized energy-related worksites to receive either employee-targeted intense interventions based upon the Social Learning Theory (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1986</LINK>) and the Transtheoretical Model of Change (<LINK REF="REF-DiClemente-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiClemente 1998</LINK>), or minimal interventions consisting of mailings and posters displayed in the workplace. Four of the organizational level trials were school-based, of which three targeted athletes. A trial in college athletes (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>) randomized college athletes at 16 campuses to receive either a behavioural intervention based upon the Health Belief Model (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenstock-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstock 1988</LINK>) and the Social Learning Theory (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1986</LINK>), or no intervention. A trial in high school athletes (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2003</LINK>) randomized 44 schools to either an intervention that included oral screening, a peer-led discussion, small group cessation counselling and a phone call on quit date, or to a control condition. A trial in college baseball athletes (<LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK>) randomized 52 colleges to an intervention based on the diffusion of innovation theory (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1983</LINK>) and cognitive social learning theory which included a video conference, an oral-cancer screening examination, a certified athletic trainer (ATC)-facilitated discussion, and a peer-led component. A trial in 41 rural public high schools (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2010</LINK>) randomized to an intervention consisting of a peer-led educational session, an oral examination, and three nurse-led group cessation counselling sessions, or a control. <LINK REF="STD-Virtanen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Virtanen 2015</LINK> randomized Swedish dental clinics to delivering a structured tobacco use intervention based upon the 5 A's referring to the participants oral health and recommending pharmacotherapy but not providing it or to usual care. None of the studies randomized by organization selected ST users according to their motivation to quit.</P>
<P>Eleven RCTs randomized over 9000 ST users at the individual level. <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK> allocated ST users attending a routine dental visit to a multicomponent intervention consisting of feedback on oral lesions and advice to quit from both hygienist and dentist, as well as self-help materials and a follow-up call from a counsellor. The control group received usual care which may have included advice to quit. Participants were not selected according to motivation to quit. Two studies from the same research group assessed the impact of adding components to a minimal self-help intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2000</LINK> tested a hand-held device for programming gradual reduction, as an adjunct to self-help materials and support. Due to problems with the prototype device, people whose machine failed twice or more were excluded from the reported analysis, and we have not included it in the meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2007</LINK> compared telephone support with self-help written materials alone. Two studies assessed the efficacy of telephone-based counselling for ST users compared to self-help materials alone (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2008</LINK>). A study in high school adolescents, also included in the pharmacotherapy section, randomized a behavioural intervention of six weekly group sessions with a health educator, plus stage-based follow-up telephone counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2003</LINK>). The control group had five to ten minutes of counselling and a single telephone call. A pilot study in personnel on active military service recruited self-identified ST users at a health screening, unselected for motivation to quit. Members of the intervention group were telephoned and asked if they wished to receive self-help materials and to have further support calls, using a motivational interviewing approach (<LINK REF="STD-Cigrang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cigrang 2002</LINK>). Based upon these promising preliminary results, a similar study was conducted with a larger sample of military recruits (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>). Two studies assessed the efficacy of a web-based intervention randomising ST users to a basic or enhanced version (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2013</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pharmacological interventions</HEADING>
<P>None of the sixteen randomized trials of pharmacological interventions were assessed as being at high risk of selection bias although some had insufficient information on randomization and allocation procedures and the potential for bias was unclear. Thirteen trials used a placebo control, two just provided the same behavioural support to the control (<LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2015a" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2015</LINK>), and one provided nicotine free snuff (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2013b</LINK>). Four studies assessed the efficacy of the blinding procedure by having participants guess their treatment assignment, suggesting that blinding was adequate in two (<LINK REF="STD-Dale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2009</LINK>), and inadequate in another (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>), while the fourth did not report the results (<LINK REF="STD-Hatsukami-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hatsukami 2000</LINK>). No studies reported high and differential levels of loss to follow-up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Behavioural interventions</HEADING>
<P>One study did not use an appropriate method of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>). Eligibility was assessed by a receptionist on the basis of a questionnaire given to all clinic attendees, with allocation on the basis of clinic record number. This method has the potential for selection bias, although allocation was not conducted by the person providing the intervention. We tested the sensitivity of the results to the inclusion of this study. In one cluster randomized trial (cRCT) (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2010</LINK>) it was unclear whether individual participants were identified before or after the school status was revealed but there was no evidence of an imbalance in baseline characteristics. This study also reported high loss to follow-up and results are based only on participants reached at follow-up. In a second cRCT in worksites only participants reached at two-year follow-up were included (<LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Across the behavioural studies, no co-interventions were apparent except for one RCT in which the intervention group was offered nicotine gum, although less than 10% of participants reportedly used it (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Randomization at the organizational level and analysis of outcomes at the individual level may lead to errors in estimated confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1997</LINK>). All the studies using cluster randomization used appropriate methods of analysis and reporting, using cluster level averages (<LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>), odds ratios adjusted for clustered responses (<LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2003</LINK>), or reported low levels of intraclass correlation and non-significant practice effects (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)</HEADING>
<P>We did not find evidence of heterogeneity within subgroups based on type of NRT. At six months or longer, neither nicotine patch (five trials, 1083 participants, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.37, I² = 14%) nor nicotine gum (two trials, 310 participants, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43, I² = 0%) increased tobacco abstinence rates. For the study that randomized patients to three different doses of nicotine patches (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>), we used the comparison between the 21 mg patch and placebo. In the trial of nicotine patch for adolescent ST users (<LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2003</LINK>) the quit rates were twice as high in the placebo group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Pooled results showed the nicotine lozenge increased tobacco abstinence rates (five trials, 1529 participants, RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.59, I² = 0%). However, three of the nicotine lozenge trials did not use a placebo control (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2015b" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2015b</LINK>) and in a post hoc sensitivity analysis the result was sensitive to the removal of these three trials. In <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2015</LINK>, we compared the nicotine lozenge plus coaching calls to the coaching calls alone, and the nicotine lozenge-only arm did not contribute to the comparison.</P>
<P>Pooling all twelve trials with a total of 2922 participants, nicotine replacement therapy increased tobacco abstinence rates (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.39, I² = 6%, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), but again this result was no longer significant when the three lozenge trials without placebo controls were removed.</P>

Excluding the trial that used a potentially biased method for treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>) did not affect this.

<P>Our prespecified subgroup analysis based on study design did not reduce heterogeneity (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). Amongst the ten studies randomising individuals the I² value was 75%. In this group of studies, five reported significant treatment effects (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2015a" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2015a</LINK>), and the other five had point estimates ranging from RR 1.07 to RR 2.18 (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cigrang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cigrang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2013</LINK>). The largest trial, <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2008</LINK>, reported an RR of 1.59 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.02). Overall these trials suggest a benefit of behavioural interventions, but the larger trials show smaller effects than the smaller trials, and a pooled estimate, whether fixed-effect or random effect, risks overestimating the benefit.</P>
<P>Among the seven trials that randomized by organization the I² value was 79%. In this subgroup three trials detected large and statistically significant effects, with RRs over two (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the distinction between individual and cluster designs was based on expectations about the level of motivation of participants, we also considered this factor directly (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). All the clustered RCTs enrolled unselected participants, but <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cigrang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cigrang 2002</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK> also recruited any ST user without assessing interest in quitting. Statistical heterogeneity persisted in both subgroups, and there was no evidence that effects were larger in the trials in more motivated populations.</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis preferring ST abstinence over all tobacco abstinence where trials reported both outcomes did not affect heterogeneity or alter the findings (<LINK REF="CMP-004.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.7</LINK>) .</P>
<P>In two further subgroup analyses we considered whether treatment effect might be moderated by including an oral examination and feedback (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>) or telephone support (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>) as intervention components. Intervention characteristics and study design tended to be correlated as <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> shows. Most individually randomized studies did not include an oral examination but did include telephone support, whilst cRCTs typically involved oral examination with some also including telephone support. Heterogeneity remained after grouping the 17 trials according to whether or not the intervention included an oral examination component with direct feedback to patients regarding ST-induced mucosal changes (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). Amongst the six trials including an oral examination the I² was 80%, with the largest trial, <LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK>, showing the smallest effect. Gansky and colleagues suggested that the lack of effect in their trial could have been due to a 'spill-over' effect due to contact between the athletic trainers in the different groups. Although three of the trials did show significant effects (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2003</LINK>), conclusions about the effect of oral examinations have to be cautious. There was also substantial heterogeneity (I² = 72%) among the eleven studies without an oral examination component (<LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cigrang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cigrang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2015a" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Virtanen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Virtanen 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the telephone support subgroup analysis there were ten studies in which telephone support formed part of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cigrang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cigrang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2015a" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2015a</LINK> (quitline intervention arms)) and seven where it did not (<LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Severson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2015a" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2015a</LINK> (web only arm); <LINK REF="STD-Virtanen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Virtanen 2015</LINK>). A trial where brief phone support was included in the control condition but not the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2003</LINK>) was not included. Heterogeneity within the telephone support subgroup was moderate as opposed to considerable (I² = 50%) and the pooled risk ratio indicated benefit (3480 participants, RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.00, <LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>). Heterogeneity was substantial in the subgroup of seven trials of interventions without telephone support (I² = 58%), which included one study showing evidence of benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2008</LINK>). A second study comparing similar intervention and control conditions did not replicate this effect (<LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2013</LINK>). The pooled estimate for this subgroup suggested only a small benefit with the CI excluding 1 narrowly (6611 participants, RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.28).</P>
<P>In this update we added a further exploratory subgroup analysis combining the oral examination and telephone components (<LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>). This suggested that the combination of oral examination and telephone support was consistently beneficial (4 studies, 1818 participants, RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.66, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%), whereas oral examination alone did not show evidence of benefit (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.19). The estimated effect for telephone support without oral exam was slightly smaller, and less consistent than for the combination of components (7 studies, 3965 participants, RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.91, I<SUP>2</SUP> =57%) but there was not a significant difference between these two subgroups. The estimated effect of interventions without either component was smaller, and uncertain because of heterogeneity (5 studies, 5728 participants, RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.39, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 64%).</P>
<P>One further behavioural study was not included in the meta-analysis because two active interventions were compared; in this study technical problems with the device for scheduling gradual cessation led to a high drop out rate in that condition and the intention-to-treat analysis was not used. No significant difference was detected between the conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Severson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 2000</LINK>). At six months, the self-reported ST abstinence rate was 27.6% (21/76) in the hand-held device group and 30.2% (29/96) in the manual and video group.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hatsukami-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hatsukami 1996</LINK>) failed to detect a difference between more intense and less intense behavioural interventions in a 2x2 study of nicotine gum and behavioural interventions (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.12, <LINK REF="CMP-004.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial recruiting ST users without plans to quit and which compared immediate cessation using nicotine patch versus a reduction approach using either nicotine lozenge or brand switching (<LINK REF="STD-Schiller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Schiller 2012</LINK>) showed greater success for the abrupt cessation group (11/97 vs 1/102, RR 11.57, 95% CI 1.52 to 87.91, <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).</P>

<P>No effort was made to perform a quantitative synthesis of the incidence of adverse events reported with the different interventions. One study reported a higher rate of skin reactions and nausea associated with the nicotine patch, but found no difference in the number of people who stopped treatment due to side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Howard_x002d_Pitney-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Howard-Pitney 1999</LINK>). One study reported the loss of two subjects due to headache and gastro-intestinal distress associated with nicotine gum use (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 1992</LINK>). Sleep disturbance was more common among patients on active bupropion SR (<LINK REF="STD-Dale-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 2007</LINK>). Nausea occurred in more than one-third of patients in one varenicline study (<LINK REF="STD-Fagerstrom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fagerstrom 2010</LINK>) and in 24% in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-10-15 15:04:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review provides evidence from 34 randomized controlled trials enrolling more than 16,000 smokeless tobacco (ST) users, testing pharmacological and behavioural interventions to treat ST use.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Pharmacotherapies</HEADING>
<P>There were 16 trials evaluating pharmacotherapy. Two small trials of bupropion did not detect an effect although confidence intervals do not rule out a small benefit. Twelve trials of NRT including gum, patch and lozenge suggested a statistically significant treatment effect, which appears to be driven by the efficacy of the nicotine lozenge. However, the lozenge subgroup meta-analysis included three studies without a placebo arm and a post hoc analysis found the results were sensitive to the removal of these three trials. Despite the absence of heterogeneity between the different types of NRT, we do not think that there is evidence to support the use of nicotine gum or patch. Two studies in Scandanavian and U.S. populations demonstrated that varenicline increases long term ST abstinence rates by 34% compared to placebo among ST users. In cigarette smokers, however, varenicline increases abstinence rates 131% compared to placebo (RR 2.31, 95% CI 2.01 to 2.66) (<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2012</LINK>). However, the prolonged abstinence rates in the control group in the ST studies were higher at six months (31.6% (<LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2011</LINK>) and 34% (<LINK REF="STD-Fagerstrom-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fagerstrom 2010</LINK>)) than in studies of smokers (e.g. 13.2% (<LINK REF="REF-Jorenby-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorenby 2006</LINK>) and 10.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzales-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzales 2006</LINK>)). This may relate to the low availability of treatment for ST users resulting in high efficacy of behavioral interventions provided in the control arms of these studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Behavioural interventions</HEADING>
<P>We found evidence of heterogeneity among the behavioural interventions, with some trials showing a statistically and clinically significant effect, some with non-significant increases in intervention arms and three with very similar intervention and control quit rates and relatively narrow confidence intervals (<LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gansky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gansky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danaher-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Danaher 2013</LINK>). In seeking to explain the heterogeneity we considered subgroups based on trial design and intervention characteristics. These included whether or not the studies were individually randomized, or recruited only participants motivated to quit, or whether the intervention included an oral examination or telephone support. Categorization by use of telephone support had lower levels of subgroup heterogeneity, but this was a post hoc analysis. In the earliest version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Ebbert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebbert 2004</LINK>) we suggested that interventions including oral examination and feedback were more effective. In the current review, this observation is not made.</P>
<P>The inference of the effect size of behavioural interventions for increasing ST abstinence rates is weakened by the limited methodological quality of some of these trials, including loss to follow-up and potential baseline differences between the groups. We cannot exclude the possibility that publication bias is also impacting on our results.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pharmacotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Varenicline appears to increase tobacco abstinence rates among Swedish snus and American ST users and could be offered clinically. The nicotine lozenge also increases ST abstinence rates though confidence in this effect is limited due to the absence of placebo controls. The efficacy of varenicline and the nicotine lozenge are lower than observed with these medications among cigarette smokers attempting to quit smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2013</LINK>). Evidence for the effect of bupropion SR for the treatment of ST use is inconclusive.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Behavioural interventions</HEADING>
<P>Behavioural interventions can increase tobacco abstinence rates among ST users, whether or not they are already motivated to stop and seeking treatment, though limited methodological quality also weakens the strength of this conclusion. Telephone counselling may be a useful component of an intervention.</P>

The <I>oral exam</I> was conducted by the school nurse who also pointed out any tobacco-associated lesions to students in their own mouths and applied a brief tobacco intervention consisting of verbally asking about tobacco use, advising users to quit, assessing readiness to quit in the next month, assisting with the quitting process by offering a self-help guide and the opportunity to participate in three group cessation counselling sessions, and arranging follow-up with interested tobacco users. Students with oral lesions were scheduled 1 week later for a follow-up exam by the nurse. The <I>nurse-led counselling </I>consisted of three noncompulsory, 1-hr nurse-led cessation sessions scheduled after school approximately 1 week apart comprised of assessment, education, and preparation to get ready to quit, and the importance of social support. The second session focused on setting a quit date and skills to cope with cravings and temptation to use. The third session reviewed progress and focused on relapse prevention.</P>
