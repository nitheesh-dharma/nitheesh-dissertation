<TITLE>Aromatase inhibitors for treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-23 11:11:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Advanced (or metastatic) breast cancer is cancer that has spread beyond the breast and regional lymph node areas. Breast cancer can progress to metastatic disease despite the person undergoing a range of therapies given after initial treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Metastatic breast cancer is treatable but it is not curable. Most breast cancer is sensitive to the female hormone oestrogen. Sensitive cancer cells need oestrogen to stay alive and removal of oestrogen from the body, or stopping any circulating oestrogen getting to the cancer cells, is very effective treatment for hormone-sensitive breast cancers. Endocrine (hormonal) therapy removes the influence of oestrogen on breast cancer cells. Hormonal treatments for advanced breast cancer include tamoxifen, the progestins megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate, and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). AIs reduce the body's ability to make (synthesise) oestrogen and have tumour-regressing effects. The AIs in current clinical use include anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole.</P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to compare AIs to other endocrine therapy in the treatment of advanced (metastatic) breast cancer. A systematic search was conducted which identified 37 controlled trials in which over 14,000 women were randomised to treatment groups. Treatment with an AI improved survival for women with metastatic disease by 10%. The overall benefits on disease-free survival and response of the tumour were however unclear based on the studies included in this review. Trials using AIs as first-line and second-line therapy reported benefits of therapy that varied with the different AIs and measures of effectiveness. We were unable to identify specific subgroups of women who may benefit from AI use.</P>
<P>Toxicity (negative side effects) was not well reported in the trials. Where it was reported, there was variation as to the method used for reporting, the type of toxicities reported, as well as the criteria used to assess toxicity. Nevertheless, toxicity data were available for 26 of the 32 trials where an AI was compared with a non-AI. AIs had similar levels of arthritic pain (arthralgia) and hot flushes (especially when compared to tamoxifen); increased risks of rash, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting; but decreased risk of vaginal bleeding and blood clotting (thromboembolic) events compared with other endocrine therapies. Limited quality of life (QOL) data were provided and, as such, no conclusions can be drawn by this review as to the effect on QOL related to an AI versus a non-AI. This is due to the differences between participants and the side-effect profiles of the agents used, different methods of drug application (injection versus tablets), and use of four different QOL instruments at several different timepoints, some which provided results of responders versus non-responders rather than by treatment group. Some QOL measures were based on clinician-reported rather than patient-reported symptoms.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-23 10:47:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endocrine therapy removes the influence of oestrogen on breast cancer cells and so hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen, megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate have been in use for many years for advanced breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) inhibit oestrogen synthesis in the peripheral tissues and have a similar tumour-regressing effect to other endocrine treatments. Aminoglutethimide was the first AI in clinical use and now the third generation AIs, anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole, are in current use. Randomised trial evidence on response rates and side effects of these drugs is still limited.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-07-23 10:48:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and relevant conference proceedings were searched (to 30 June 2008).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-07-23 10:56:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials in postmenopausal women comparing the effects of any AI versus other endocrine therapy, no endocrine therapy, or a different AI in the treatment of advanced (metastatic) breast cancer. Non-English language publications, comparisons of the same AI at different doses, AIs used as neoadjuvant treatment, or outcomes not related to tumour response were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-07-23 10:59:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from published trials were extracted independently by two review authors and cross-checked by a third. Hazard ratios (HR) were derived for analysis of time-to-event outcomes (overall and progression-free survival). Odds ratios (OR) were derived for objective response, clinical benefit, and toxicity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-23 11:03:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-seven trials were identified, 31<B> </B>of which were included in the main analysis of any AI versus any other treatment (11,403 women). No trials were excluded due to inadequate allocation concealment. The pooled estimate showed a significant survival benefit for treatment with an AI over other endocrine therapies (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97). A subgroup analysis of the three commonly prescribed AIs (anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole) also showed a similar survival benefit (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.96). There were very limited data to compare one AI with a different AI, but these suggested an advantage for letrozole over anastrozole.</P>
<P>AIs have a different toxicity profile to other endocrine therapies. For those currently prescribed, and for all AIs combined, they had similar levels of hot flushes and arthralgia; increased risks of rash, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting; but a 71% decreased risk of vaginal bleeding and 47% decrease in thromboembolic events compared with other endocrine therapies.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-23 11:34:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-07-23 11:18:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer and cancer mortality in women worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2000</LINK>). Metastatic breast cancer occurs when the cancer has spread beyond the breast and regional node areas. Breast cancer can progress to metastatic disease despite a range of adjuvant systemic therapies. Once breast cancer is metastatic it is no longer curable, but it is treatable. The aim of any further treatment is to improve the individual's quality and length of life.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-07-23 11:22:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endocrine (hormonal) therapy removes the influence of oestrogen on breast cancer cells, preventing the cancer cells from growing and spreading. It has been shown to improve survival in early breast cancer <LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2005</LINK>. Hormone dependency of breast cancer was first demonstrated in the 19th century by a Glasgow surgeon, Thomas Beatson, who achieved temporary regression of metastatic disease by oophorectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Beatson-1896" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beatson 1896</LINK>). Other early methods of therapy consisted of adrenalectomy and hypophysectomy. These procedures have largely been superseded by effective hormonal treatments. Most endocrine therapies either block the binding of oestrogen to its receptor, for example tamoxifen, or reduce serum and tumour concentrations of oestrogen, for example aromatase inhibitors (AIs). A positive initial response to endocrine treatment is a good indication for use of second and even third-line endocrine therapy, until the disease becomes hormone resistant (<LINK REF="REF-Roseman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roseman 1997</LINK>). The most important predictor of response to hormone therapy is the oestrogen receptor (ER) status of the original tumour.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-07-23 11:29:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently, the most widely-used endocrine therapy for treatment of hormone-sensitive metastatic disease is tamoxifen (<LINK REF="REF-Howell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howell 1997</LINK>). Tamoxifen is an oral, non-steroidal competitive ER antagonist. Tamoxifen, however, also has an agonist effect and although patients may relapse and develop acquired resistance to tamoxifen, this does not mean that they will not respond to other endocrine therapy.</P>
<P>Other endocrine therapies used in this setting are fulvestrant, megestrol acetate (MA), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Fulvestrant is an ER antagonist that both downregulates and degrades the ER and reduces progesterone receptor content but, unlike tamoxifen, does not have an agonist effect. It can be used as a treatment for tamoxifen-resistant advanced disease or after failure of treatment with an AI, so is an alternative second choice to an AI. MPA and MA are oral progestogens which have been shown to have significant antitumour activity after failure of other endocrine therapies in postmenopausal patients.</P>
<P>In postmenopausal women, oestrogen is no longer produced in the ovaries but androgens (mainly from the adrenal glands) are converted to oestrogens in peripheral tissue by the enzyme aromatase (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1996a</LINK>). Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a class of compounds that act systemically to inhibit oestrogen synthesis in tissues. AIs are of two types, reversible and irreversible; both types of inhibitors compete with normal substrates for binding on the enzyme. The non-competitive inhibitors (which are steroidal) leave the enzyme permanently inactivated (<LINK REF="REF-Ibrahim-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ibrahim 1995</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>AIs are classified as either first, second or third generation (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Aminoglutethimide (AG) was the first AI and although effective it was poorly tolerated. This was supplanted by 4-hydroxy androstenedione (formestane), which was better tolerated. Third generation AIs fall into two principal categories of (a) non-steroidal, reversible triazole derivatives (anastrozole, fadrozole, letrozole, vorozole) and (b) steroidal, irreversible inhibitors (exemestane). The most widely used AIs are currently anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-07-23 11:34:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>AIs have a different toxicity profile to other endocrine therapies, although some side effects that mimic menopausal symptoms due to depletion of oestrogen are the same, such as hot flushes and sweating. Adverse events particular to AIs include stomach upsets (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), rash, and arthralgia. In particular, AG is poorly tolerated and can cause drowsiness, fever, and inhibition of cortisol synthesis. Formestane, although generally well tolerated as a treatment, results in a local reaction around the injection site. Of the other endocrine therapies, tamoxifen can cause endometrial changes including vaginal bleeding and increased risk of thromboembolic events. Side effects with progestogens are usually mild but may include hot flushes, night sweats, nausea and indigestion, fluid retention, weight gain, and headaches as well as an increased risk of thromboembolism. Fulvestrant can have similar oestrogen deprivation side effects, injection site reactions, vomiting and diarrhoea.</P>
<P>AIs are now increasingly being used in the treatment of early breast cancer, which may have an impact on their use in advanced (metastatic) disease.<B>

A third author (DJL) assessed the data collected to ensure consistency and accuracy. Any differences were resolved by discussion. Data on study quality were extracted as described in 'Assessment of the methodological quality'. Hazard ratios and their associated variances were extracted for all measures available. If a hazard ratio and confidence interval were not reported, these values were calculated (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1995</LINK>).

<P>Two review authors (LJG, CLD) independently assessed the quality of all trials deemed eligible and discrepancies were resolved by discussion. The quality of each trial was assessed based on reports in the publication regarding:</P>

<LI>quality of allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>comparability between the baseline characteristics of the treatment arms;</LI>
<LI>inclusion of all randomised participants in the analysis;</LI>
<LI>details of dropouts.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Randomisation was assessed by grading the allocation concealment (for example blinded, stratified) as: A = adequate, B = unclear, C = inadequate (see Characteristics of included studies). It was not possible to accurately assess the quality of randomisation in all trials due to lack of information in the published articles. Any imbalance between treatment arms, both in numbers and characteristics, was taken into account in the grading.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat statements: analyses that were stated to be by intention to treat and included all randomised patients for the primary endpoint. However, it is common practice to report response variables, that is clinical benefit and objective response, only on 'assessable' patients.

<P>The most complete dataset feasible was assembled. Data were, however, only available for the following endpoints: overall survival, progression-free survival, clinical benefit, objective response, and toxicity. </P>
<P>Overall and progression-free survival were analysed using time-to-event methods and for this the hazard ratio (HR) is the most appropriate statistic. If a HR and corresponding confidence intervals (CI) were not reported, these values were calculated indirectly using median time to event (progression or survival) and the number of events extracted from the published Kaplan-Meier curves, following the method of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1995</LINK>. A weighted average of survival duration across trials was then calculated. Ratios of treatment effects for time to event were reported so that HRs less than 1.0 favoured the AI regimen.</P>
<P>Response rates were obtained from the tables of best response presented for each trial. Response has been analysed based on assessable (not randomised) patients as most of the trials included in this review only reported responses in this way. As a sensitivity analysis, we also analysed results by intention to treat (ITT); there was no difference. Response rates were analysed as dichotomous variables (for example objective response compared complete or partial response versus stable disease or no response). An odds ratio (OR) and its associated 95% CI were calculated for each trial and a pooled OR derived. Ratios of treatment effects on response were reported so that ORs less than 1.0 favoured the AI regimen. In this case, the 'event' is in effect 'not getting an objective reponse' or 'not getting a clinical benefit'.</P>
<P>Results are presented graphically and all figures follow the same format. Each trial is presented as a single line within each category. The point estimate of the treatment effect is represented by a square, the size of which is proportional to the size of the trial. The associated 95% CI is included as a horizontal line. The summary in each category is represented by a diamond, the north-south axis is the pooled estimate and the east-west axis is the 95% CI.</P>

<P>The number of actual dropouts was very difficult to quantify as the quantity and quality of reporting varied greatly. Only 10 trials gave full details by treatment arm. Three trials quoted the number of patients withdrawn due to toxicity as "a small number" (<LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-1996c" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 1996c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 2000</LINK>).

</P>
<P>Not all toxicities (also known as side effects or adverse events) were reported in this review. We selected eight predefined toxicities from expert experience, reflecting side effects specific to AIs (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, arthralgia) and other hormonal treatments (hot flushes, vaginal bleeding, thromboembolic events). Each side effect was analysed as a dichotomous variable (yes or no) with the effect of the AI considered separately to that of the comparator. This was deemed the most informative method of presentation as the different comparators have different toxicity profiles, whereas AIs have similar toxicity profiles. An OR and its associated 95% CI were calculated for each trial and a pooled OR derived. Ratios of treatment effects for toxicity were reported so that ORs less than 1.0 favoured the AI regimen.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-07-23 12:36:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Statistical heterogeneity between trials was assessed using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. However, there were cases where the value for the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was high but the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test was not statistically significant; we advise caution in interpreting these results. Evidence of heterogeneity between trials was identified for tumour response rates and progression-free survival though not overall survival, which seems less susceptible to heterogeneity. The reasons for this are unknown but this statistical heterogeneity may be explained by clinical heterogeneity. It is possible that outcomes involving subjective endpoints, that is tumour response, may be subject to variation whereas the hard endpoint used in the survival analysis is unequivocal. With progression-free survival, the trials were undertaken in populations that varied considerably. For example, some trials were using the AI as first-line treatment, some as second-line treatment, and in other trials as mixed first- and second-line. Other contributory factors may be the difference in dosage of some AIs and significant differences in the proportion of patients who were truly hormone receptor positive. We stress that as this review describes a very mixed range of studies of mixed patient populations, carried out over 30 years, the relative effect between treatment arms would still be consistent even with this mix of different patient groups.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-08-06 13:37:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon Parker">
<P>The Cochrane Review Manager Software (RevMan5) was used to analyse the data.</P>
<P>A Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model was used for the primary analyses (see the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions) unless there was significant heterogeneity, in which case a random effects model was used (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). A fixed-effect model was used for all overall survival analyses, and all analyses for any AI versus a different AI. For any AI versus a non-AI, and current AIs versus non-AIs, a random-effects model was used for progression-free survival, clinical benefit, and objective response. When an AI was used as first-line therapy, a random-effects model was used for the clinical response variables but not for progression-free survival; whereas a fixed-effect model was used for the clinical response variables for second-line therapy.</P>
<P>A pooled analysis was performed in each group, but the results from each AI were considered separately within the same group, where possible. Trials were pooled by type of AI for survival, progression-free survival, clinical benefit, and objective response outcomes. For toxicity, the data were pooled by type of comparator, that is tamoxifen, MA, MPA, or fulvestrant, as the toxicities of different AIs are similar due to their mode of action. This approach was considered to be more informative due to differences between the AIs (first versus second or third generation; steroidal versus non-steroidal). Post hoc, it was also decided to separately present the pooled results for the AIs that are in current clinical use (by definition the newer, third generation AIs) as this is more relevant to the clinical situation today. The AIs included were: aminoglutethimide (first generation); formestane (second generation); and anastrozole, exemestane, fadrozole, letrozole and vorozole (third generation). The non-AIs included were: megestrol acetate (MA), tamoxifen, fulvestrant, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), and hydrocortisone (HC).</P>

<P>All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle as far as was possible, that is comparing all women allocated to one treatment versus all those allocated to the other irrespective of compliance. Thus the results may slightly underestimate any treatment effects. However, analysis of response used the number of assessable women as the denominator as this is the accepted method. As a sensitivity analysis, both denominators were used (see Figures) and there was no major difference for response when comparing assessable to ITT. For statistical tests a P value of less than 0.05 was considered to denote statistical significance.</P>

<P>We included 37 trials which randomised 14,060 women. There was a great deal of variation across the trials. Trials ranged in size from 60 (<LINK REF="STD-Kleeberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kleeberg 1997</LINK>) to 1021 women (<LINK REF="STD-Bonneterre-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bonneterre 2001</LINK>). Fourteen trials randomised patients from multiple countries; of the remaining 23 trials, three were limited to the UK, two were from Spain, two from South Africa, two from Switzerland, six from the US, and one each from North America (US and Canada), Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Japan, Norway, and Switzerland. The country was not formally reported in 14 trials but surmised from the addresses of the authors.</P>
<P>In 32 trials comparing AIs with non-AIs,11,710 women were randomised; 2350 women were randomised in five trials of one AI versus a different AI. It should be noted that seven trials included two different doses of an AI compared with a third comparison. Data for 12,883 women were included in this review.</P>
<P>Of the 32 trials comparing AIs with non-AIs, 11 used the first generation AI aminogluthetimide, three used the second generation AI formestane, and 18 used a third generation AI (anastrozole: four trials; exemestane: three trials; fadrozole: six trials; letrozole: four trials; vorozole: one trial). In these, tamoxifen was the comparator in 12 trials, MA in 13 trials, MPA in four trials, hydrocortisone (HC) in one trial, and fulvestrant in two trials.</P>
<P>The five trials of AIs versus a different AI compared letrozole versus anastrozole, aminoglutethimide, atamestane, or fadrozole; and anastrozole versus formestane.</P>

<P>Data for all endpoints were not available in the published reports. Where data were unavailable, authors were approached for supplementary data. Five principal endpoints with sufficient data were identified: overall survival, progression-free survival, response (either based on clinical benefit or objective response), and treatment toxicity. Likewise, data were not available in the published reports for all subgroups proposed in the review protocol. The AI versus any non-AI comparison had enough data for all five endpoints as well as a subgroup consisting of data from the three most commonly prescribed AIs (anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole).

<P>Thirty-seven randomised trials were included in this review. One of the included trials did not have data on the primary or secondary endpoints so could not be included in any analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Leitzel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Leitzel 1995</LINK>). It should be noted that trials by the author of one of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bezwoda-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bezwoda 1998</LINK>), relating to high dose chemotherapy, have been found to include falsified data. However, no such findings have been reported for trials included in this review. There was therefore no reason to exclude the trial. Analysis was performed with and without this trial and there was no difference in the pooled results, although for clinical benefit the result became just significant.</P>
<P>It was not possible to accurately assess the quality of all trials due to lack of information in the published articles. Allocation concealment was rated as adequate in 23 trials but there were insufficient details of the allocation concealment in the remaining 14 and so they were labelled as unclear. Of these, no randomisation method was given in eight trials and four were reported to have parallel groups. No trials were deemed to have inadequate allocation concealment, from the information given in the published papers, and none were excluded for this reason. Six trials were double-blind, double-dummy; seven were double-blind; one was double-blind in one arm but open in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 1996a</LINK>); and one (which consisted of two trials analysed together) was double-blind in one and open in the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mauriac-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mauriac 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Baseline characteristics were not commented upon in 12 trials, five trials commented on a slight imbalance. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 1996a</LINK>) had an imbalance in the treatment arm but this was believed to be an artefact. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lundgren-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lundgren 1989</LINK>) reported that "the two groups were well balanced with regard to the most important prognostic variables, with the exception of main metastatic site".

Some trials reported predefined or selected toxicities (<LINK REF="STD-Bonneterre-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bonneterre 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mauriac-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mauriac 2003</LINK>), some chose to report toxicities occurring in a certain minimum percentage of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Bezwoda-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bezwoda 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chia-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chia 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dombernowsky-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dombernowsky 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mauriac-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mauriac 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourisden-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mourisden 2001</LINK>), some used worst toxicity grades (<LINK REF="STD-Falkson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Falkson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thuerlimann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thuerlimann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thuerlimann-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Thuerlimann 1997</LINK>) or major toxicity (<LINK REF="STD-Canney-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Canney 1988</LINK>); one reported toxicity grades 1 to 4 separately (<LINK REF="STD-Paridaens-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Paridaens 2003</LINK>), one used common toxicities (<LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 1996a</LINK>) though what this meant was not defined, two reported adverse experiences (<LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-1996c" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 1996c</LINK>), and two reported all toxicities (<LINK REF="STD-Freue-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Freue 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1986</LINK>). Eight trials did not state which reporting criteria they used. In addition, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Perez-Carrion-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Perez Carrion 1994</LINK>) only reported on the toxicities considered to be treatment related and has not been included. For the trial of an AI against fulvestrant (<LINK REF="STD-Mauriac-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mauriac 2003</LINK>), data on toxicity were obtained from different sources. The combined analysis of the two trials 0020 and 0021 reported predefined events and data on hot flushes and thromboembolic events were available. The separate publications of the results of 0020 and 0021 detailed toxicities occurring in 10% or more of the participants. Trial 0020 reported data on both nausea and vomiting so these were combined with these data from 0021. In addition, trial 0021 had data on the frequency of diarrhoea and rash. </P>
<P>Despite the different reporting criteria the data were pooled. This must be borne in mind when looking at the absolute numbers. The analyses are reported according to the comparator due to the different toxicity profiles of each. An overall pooled result for AI versus non AI is not provided.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Hot flushes</B>
</I>
<BR/>Hot flushes were the specific toxicity that was most widely reported. Data on hot flushes were available from 20 of the 32 trials with 8306 women. Of these, seven compared an AI with tamoxifen, 10 with MA, two with fulvestrant, and one with MPA. The use of an AI had a very similar risk of hot flushes to tamoxifen and fulvestrant. The AI was associated with statistically signficantly more reports of hot flushes than with MA (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.14) but less than with MPA (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.73), which had data from only one very small trial.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Nausea</B>
</I>
<BR/>Data on nausea were available from 18 trials with 7895 women. Another two trials reported data on nausea and vomiting combined. Of the 18, six compared an AI with tamoxifen, nine with MA, two with fulvestrant, and one with MPA. AIs were associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of nausea compared to MA (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.35) but there was no statistically significant difference between AIs and tamoxifen (P = 0.32) or fulvestrant (P = 0.96).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Vomiting</B>
</I>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Two trials had data on nausea and vomiting combined and so were not included. Data on vomiting were available from two trials comparing AIs with tamoxifen, five versus MA, and one versus fulvestrant for a total of 4404 women. The AI was statistically significantly worse when compared to MA (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.90). The comparisons with tamoxifen and fulvestrant suggested no statistically significant differences.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Diarrhoea</B>
</I>
<BR/>Ten trials with 5200 women had data on diarrhoea toxicity. Of these, three compared an AI with tamoxifen, five with MA, and two with fulvestrant. AIs were associated with a statistically significant higher rate of diarrhoea than either tamoxifen (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.55) or MA (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13) but not fulvestrant (P = 0.36).<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>Rash</B>
</I>
<BR/>Fifteen trials with 4598 women had data on rash toxicity. Of these, four compared an AI with tamoxifen, eight with MA, two with MPA, and one with fulvestrant. AIs were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of rash when compared with tamoxifen (OR 33.61, 95% CI 4.71 to 239.97) and for the two trials versus MPA (OR 36.80, 95% CI 3.35 to 404.73) but not against MA or fulvestrant. Within the comparison with MA there was statistically significant heterogeneity (P = 0.0003) and moderate heterogeneity with tamoxifen.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
<B>Vaginal bleeding</B>
</I>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Data on vaginal bleeding were reported in six trials of 2750 women: one compared an AI with tamoxifen, three with MA, and two with MPA. Compared with MA, there was a statistically significant benefit of 78% for treatment with the AI (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.45). The two trials versus MPA also found a statistically significant difference with an OR of 0.13 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.71). In one of the larger trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bonneterre-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bonneterre 2001</LINK>) that compared an AI with tamoxifen, there was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.15).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Thromboembolic events</B>
</I>
<BR/>Thromboembolic event data were available from six trials with 2937 women. Two compared an AI with tamoxifen, three with MA, and one with fulvestrant. The AI had a statistically significant advantage only over tamoxifen (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.85).<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
<B>Arthralgia</B>
</I>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Data on arthralgia were available for 2470 women in two trials versus tamoxifen (1031 women) and four trials versus MA (1439 women). There was no statistically significant difference between the AIs and either tamoxifen or MA.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Subgroup analysis: aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in current clinical use versus any non-aromatase inhibitor</B>
</P>
<P>Eleven of the 32 trials comparing an AI with a non-AI were on the three AIs in current clinical use, namely anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. The pooled results for these are reported. Data on overall survival and time to progression were available from only six and seven trials respectively, but response rates and clinical benefit were available from all 11 trials. In terms of survival, HRs were reported in the publications of four trials: anastrozole (<LINK REF="STD-Bonneterre-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bonneterre 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 1996a</LINK>) and letrozole (<LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dombernowsky-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dombernowsky 1998</LINK>). Another two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milla_x002d_Santos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Milla-Santos 2003</LINK>) had sufficient data for calculation of the HRs. For time to progression, the corresponding numbers of trials were four (<LINK REF="STD-Bonneterre-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bonneterre 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chia-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chia 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourisden-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mourisden 2001</LINK>) and three (<LINK REF="STD-Dombernowsky-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dombernowsky 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mauriac-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mauriac 2003</LINK>), respectively.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>1. Overall survival</B>
</I>
<BR/>Data on survival were available from six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bonneterre-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bonneterre 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dombernowsky-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dombernowsky 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milla_x002d_Santos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Milla-Santos 2003</LINK>). The AI was statistically significantly superior to the non-AI with a HR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.96), equivalent to a 12% benefit of treatment with an AI. This effect was consistent across all subgroups.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>2. Progression-free survival</B>
</I>
<BR/>Data on progression were available from seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bonneterre-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bonneterre 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chia-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chia 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dombernowsky-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dombernowsky 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mauriac-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mauriac 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourisden-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mourisden 2001</LINK>) reporting an estimated 3660 events in 5004 women. Use of an AI was not statistically significantly associated with a change in the hazard of progression (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12). The results did not vary by type of AI. There was significant heterogeneity in the pooled result (P &lt; 0.00001) within the anastrozole trials (P &lt; 0.00001) and the letrozole trials (P = 0.01).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>3. Proportion of women with clinical benefit </B>
</I>(5619 assessable women)<BR/>Data were available from 11 trials. The pooled OR suggested a statistically significant advantage of 20% for the AI (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97). There was statistically significant heterogeneity among the trials (P = 0.002).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>4. Proportion of women with an objective response </B>
</I>(5619 assessable women)<BR/>All 11 trials reported objective response. The pooled OR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.97) showed a statistically significant advantage to the AI but there was statistically significant heterogeneity (P = 0.03) across the trial results. There was also significant heterogeneity within the exemestane trials.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>5. Toxicity</B>
</I>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>One of the suggested benefits of the third generation AIs is a reduced toxicity profile. The results were presented by comparator as the comparators have different toxicity profiles whereas the AIs have similar toxicity profiles. The denominators for the comparison of anastrozole with fulvestrant varied depending on whether the combined trial results were available (hot flushes, nausea, vomiting, thromboembolic events) or not (diarrhoea, rash).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
<I>Hot flushes</I>
<BR/>
</B>Hot flushes were the specific toxicity that was reported most widely. Data on hot flushes were available from nine of the 11 trials, with 5623 women. Three trials compared the AI with tamoxifen, four with MA, and two with fulvestrant. The use of an AI had a very similar risk of hot flushes to tamoxifen and fulvestrant but was associated with statistically significant more reports of hot flushes than with MA (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.30).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
<I>Nausea</I>
<BR/>
</B>Data on nausea were available from nine of the 11 trials, involving 5623 women. Of the nine trials, three compared an AI with tamoxifen, four with MA and two with fulvestrant. The AIs had statistically signicantly more reports of nausea than MA (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.95) but there was no statistically significant difference when the AIs were compared to tamoxifen or fulvestrant.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Vomiting</B>
</I>
<BR/>Five trials with 3499 women had data on vomiting alone and only MA as the comparator had more than one trial. There was no statistically significant differences between the AI and either tamoxifen or fulvestrant. Compared with MA, the AIs had a statistically significantly increased risk of vomiting (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.83).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Diarrhoea</B>
</I>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Seven trials with 4295 women had data on diarrhoea toxicity. Two compared an AI with tamoxifen, three with MA, and two with fulvestrant. There was a statistically significant increased risk of diarrhoea with the AIs against MA (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.29).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Rash</B>
</I>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Four trials with 2033 women that compared AIs with MA or fulvestrant (one trial only) had data on rash. AIs were not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of rash and there was statistically significant heterogeneity among the three trials with MA as the comparator (P = 0.04).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
<I>Vaginal bleeding</I>
<BR/>
</B>Data on vaginal bleeding were reported in three trials with 1932 women, one compared an AI with tamoxifen and two with MA. There was a statistically significant benefit to treatment with the AIs in comparison with MA (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.65).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Thromboembolic events</B>
</I>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Thromboembolic event data were available for 2378 women in three trials but there was only one trial per comparator (tamoxifen, MA, or fulvestrant). AIs were associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of thromboembolic events than tamoxifen (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.96) but not compared with MA or fulvestrant.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Arthralgia</B>
</I>
<BR/>Data on arthralgia as a specific side effect were only available for 1394 women in three trials, two versus tamoxifen and one versus MA. Against both comparators, the AI was not statistically significantly associated with a difference in the incidence of arthralgia.</P>
<P>
<B>Other analyses<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<B>Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) versus any different aromatase inhibitor </B>
</P>
<P>A total of 2346 women in five trials were randomised to one AI versus a different AI. Of these, all five had data on response but only two had results on overall survival and progression-free survival (<LINK REF="STD-Gershanovich-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gershanovich 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goss 2007</LINK>). Letrozole was compared with a different AI in all the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gershanovich-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gershanovich 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tominaga-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tominaga 2003</LINK>) except that of <LINK REF="STD-Kleeberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kleeberg 1997</LINK> which compared anastrozole with formestane. The trial by Rose and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2003</LINK>) compared letrozole to anastrozole and in this section has been included in both the letrozole and anastrozole groups.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
<I>1. Overall survival</I>
</B>
<BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-Gershanovich-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gershanovich 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goss 2007</LINK> trials were the only ones that had data on overall survival and the results were driven by <LINK REF="STD-Goss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goss 2007</LINK> as 70% data came from this trial. Letrozole had a reduced HR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.02) but this was not statistically significant and there was signficant trial heterogeneity (P = 0.006).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>2.</B> <B>Progression-free survival</B>
</I>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Two trials had data on progression from 1416 women (<LINK REF="STD-Gershanovich-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gershanovich 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goss 2007</LINK>) and, again, the results were driven by the <LINK REF="STD-Goss-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goss 2007</LINK> trial. In these trials, letrozole was associated with a slightly reduced hazard in terms of progression-free survival compared to aminoglutethimide, but this was not statistically significant and there was heterogeneity (P = 0.01) between the trials.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>3. Proportion of women with clinical benefit </B>
</I>(1747 assessable patients)<I>
<BR/>
</I>Letrozole was associated with a statistically significant clinical benefit compared with a different AI (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95). There was no significant trial heterogeneity (P = 0.63).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>4. Proportion of women with an objective response </B>
</I>(1747 assessable patients)<BR/>The pooled overall result was not presented as <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2003</LINK> was included in both individual AI comparisons and so would be counted twice. Letrozole was statistically significantly different from any other AI (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.78). Results of all letrozole trials were consistent (test for heterogeneity P = 0.32). Anastrozole appeared to be significantly inferior to a different AI (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.37).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Aromatase inhibition as first-line therapy versus any non-AI therapy (tamoxifen)</B>
</P>
<P>Twelve trials that randomised 3746 women used AIs exclusively as first-line therapy for advanced (metastatic) disease and all comparisons were against tamoxifen. We did not include any trials that were mixed first- and second-line. Data from three trials with 1483 women (anastrozole, fadrozole, AG) were available for overall survival and four trials with 2390 women (one trial each on formestane, anastrozole, and letrozole) for progression-free survival. Eleven trials reported results for objective response and nine trials for clinical benefit.</P>

<B>2. Progression-free survival</B>
</I>
<BR/>The first-line AI regimen was statistically significantly superior to tamoxifen with a decreased hazard of 0.78 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.86). Anastrozole (<LINK REF="STD-Bonneterre-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bonneterre 2001</LINK>) and letrozole (<LINK REF="STD-Mourisden-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mourisden 2001</LINK>) were statistically significantly different from tamoxifen (reduced hazard of 18% and 30%, respectively).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>3. Proportion of women with clinical benefit </B>
</I>(3252 assessable women) <B>
<BR/>
</B>As results for individual AIs, except for aminoglutethimide and anastrozole, were based on only a single trial the pooled result is emphasised. The AIs were better than tamoxifen as first-line therapy (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.92) although there was significant heterogeneity across the AIs (P = 0.002).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
<I>4. Proportion of women with objective response </I>
</B>(3503 assessable women)<B>
<BR/>
</B>Aminoglutethimide was the only AI with more than two trials published. The AIs were better than tamoxifen as first-line therapy (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.00) although this was of borderline statistical signficance. There was considerable heterogeneity (P = 0.003) by type of AI. Exemestane and letrozole were the only AIs that were statistically significantly better than tamoxifen but in both cases the results were only based on one trial.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Aromatase inhibition as second-line therapy versus any non-AI therapy<BR/>
</B>Women who had previously been treated with endocrine therapy, either a different AI or non-AI, for advanced (metastatic) disease and received the trial AI as second-line therapy were included in 19 trials. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Leitzel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Leitzel 1995</LINK> was of second-line therapy but does not contribute to the results here, thus giving 18 trials. Aminoglutethimide was used as second-line in five trials, formestane in two, anastrozole in two, exemestane in two, fadrozole in three, letrozole in three, and vorozole in one trial. The majority of the comparisons (12) were against MA. We did not include trials where there was a mixture of first- and second-line therapy.</P>
<P>Data on objective response were available from all of the trials; clinical benefit from 16 trials; HRs for progression-free survival from eight trials; and HRs for overall survival from two trials.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>1. Overall survival</B>
</I>
<BR/>Data on overall survival were limited with data from two trials of different AIs, anastrozole and letrozole. Second-line treatment with an AI was statistically significantly associated with a decreased hazard of death (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96). This effect was consistent for both AIs (heterogeneity P = 0.79).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>2. Progression-free survival</B>
</I>
<BR/>AI use was not associated with a statistically significant difference in the risk of progression. There was significant heterogeneity (P = 0.001) across trials, with use of either anastrozole or vorozole associated with a significantly increased risk of progression.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>3. Proportion of women with clinical benefit </B>
</I>(5410 assessable women) <B>
<BR/>
</B>There did not appear to be any effect in terms of a statistically significant clinical benefit when an AI was used as second-line therapy (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.11). This lack of effect was consistent across AI subgroups (heterogeneity P = 0.88).</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>4. Proportion of women with objective response </B>
</I>(5937 assessable women)<BR/>Overall there was no statistically significant difference between the use of an AI as second-line therapy and any other therapy (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.13). When looking at individual AIs, none showed any evidence of a benefit but this was based on small numbers. There was no statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.52).</P>
<P>
<B>Other subgroup analysis</B>
</P>
<P>We were not able to perform subgroup analyses on the following groups of patients as these data were not systematically reported:</P>
<UL>
<LI>ER positive versus ER unknown;</LI>
<LI>according to site of distant metastases and differential treatment effect.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Quality of Life</B>
</P>
<P>Nine trials (Bezwoda 1998; Buzdar 1996b; Buzdar 1996c; Buzdar 2001; Chia 2008;<B> </B>Goss 1999;<B> </B>Kaufmann 2000; Mauriac 2003; Thuerlimann 1997) quoted quality of life (QOL) as a secondary endpoint. Three of the trials (Bezwoda 1998;<B> </B>Buzdar 1996b; Buzdar 1996c) did not report any QOL data. Only one (Thuerlimann 1997) has published two papers on the QOL data in detail. One trial (Dombernowsky 1998) mentioned that a QOL instrument was used, at baseline and at each visit whilst on treatment, but it was not mentioned as an endpoint nor were any data included. Chia 2008 reported that the difference in QOL between the treatment arms was not statistically significant; however the graph was shown on the online publication only. </P>
<P>There are several reasons why the limited QOL data are not included in this review: heterogeneous changes among patients, that is different symptoms and side effect profiles; different methods of drug application, that is injection versus tablets; use of four different QOL instruments at several different timepoints; some results given as responders versus non-responders rather than by treatment groups; some QOL measures based on clinician-reported rather than patient-reported symptoms.<BR/>

<P>This review demonstrates a survival benefit of 10% with the use of AIs for the treatment of advanced (metastatic) breast cancer. This finding is not consistent across all AIs, with the greatest benefit (a survival benefit of 12%) associated with the AIs in current clinical use, namely anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. However, data on survival were only available for about half the women and one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Buzdar-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar 1996a</LINK>) was not designed or powered to detect significant differences in survival.</P>
<P>The positive effects of AIs in terms of tumour response were statistically significant for first-line therapy where the comparator was tamoxifen. There were no data available for other comparators. When comparing the effect of the AI as second-line therapy there was no statistically significant difference on tumour response. In terms of progression-free survival, there was a statistically significant decrease in hazard of progression for treatment with the AIs as first-line therapy only. The paucity of data makes it difficult to make any firm conclusions in terms of overall survival.</P>
<P>In terms of toxicity, AIs are known to be associated with a higher incidence of nausea, diarrhoea, rash and arthralgia but a lower risk of vaginal bleeding and thromboembolic events. However, combining data across trials was difficult as both the toxicities reported and the criteria for reporting toxicities, if reported at all, varied greatly. We therefore did not have data on all predetermined toxicities with all comparators. Despite the inadequacies of the data, our review corroborated the direction of the known side effects. There was a higher incidence of hot flushes when compared to MA but not to tamoxifen; nausea compared to MA but not tamoxifen or fulvestrant; vomiting compared to MA but not tamoxifen or fulvestrant; diarrhoea compared to tamoxifen and MA but not fulvestrant; and rash compared to tamoxifen and MPA but not  MA or fulvestrant. The risk of vaginal bleeding was about 80% lower with AI treatment and the incidence of thromboembolic events halved. For arthralgia, there was no statistically significant difference between the AIs and either tamoxifen or MA.   </P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-07-23 21:22:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A lack of standardised reporting of clinical endpoints impacted upon the analysis of all AIs, not just aminoglutethimide. Therefore, it was not possible to include all trials in each section. This reduced the power of certain analyses, especially overall and progression-free survival. In addition, many of the data required to carry out analyses of prospectively identified subgroups, as set out in the review protocol, were not available. We could not, therefore, identify specific subgroups of women who may benefit from AI use.</P>
<P>There are very limited data on quality of life reported in this setting. The limited quality of life data which was reported did not show any significant differences between the AI and comparator groups; however, some differences were found with some subscales in favour of the AI (<LINK REF="STD-Goss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 2000</LINK>). The patient's perspective in advanced disease treatment is an important endpoint and should be included in trials as it would aid interpretation in this mainly palliative setting.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-07-23 21:25:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has combined data from a wide variety of trials that were carried out over 20 years. Some of the trials did not use an AI as a single agent but in combination with another endocrine therapy. There was heterogeneity both across types of AI and within each AI. The results of trials of three generations of AIs have been combined as well as results from trials of steroidal and non-steroidal therapy. This has been forced, to some extent, by the lack of data on individual AIs.</P>
<P>Within each AI, trials varied in terms of sample size, dose of AI, comparison regimen, outcomes, length of follow up and quality of reporting. For example, the 11 trials of aminoglutethimide consisted of between 62 and 313 patients; four of the trials were of first-line therapy, five second-line, and two mixed. Doses of aminoglutethimide used were 125 mg in one trial, 250 mg* in three, 500 mg* in four, 750 mg in one, and 1000 mg in two (* dose doubled after a specific period of treatment). The comparator was tamoxifen in five<B> </B>trials (20 mg in three, 30 mg in one, 40 mg in one), MA 160 mg in three trials, MPA 500 mg in one trial, MPA 1000 mg in four trials, and HC 20 mg in one trial. Not all endpoints were available in each trial and four reported overall survival, three progression-free survival, eight clinical benefit, and 10 objective response.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-07-23 21:47:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If the description of randomisation is used as a barometer of reporting trial quality, it appears that this has improved over time. For example, in the trials of the first generation AI aminoglutethimide six of 11 randomisations were categorised as unclear whereas only two of the nine trials of third generation AI letrozole were considered as such.</P>
<P>Evidence of heterogeneity between trials was identified for tumour response rates and progression-free survival though not overall survival. The reasons for this are unknown but this statistical heterogeneity might be explained by clinical heterogeneity. It may be that outcomes involving the subjective endpoint, that is tumour response, are subject to variation whereas the hard endpoint used in the survival analysis is unequivocal. Other contributory factors may be the difference in dosage of some AIs and significant differences in the proportion of patients who were truly hormone receptor positive.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-07-23 21:51:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Historically, the treatment for advanced (metastatic) breast cancer has been with hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen or the progestins MA or MPA. This review confirms a survival benefit of treating advanced (metastatic) breast cancer with the third generation aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole) that are being used clinically today.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-07-23 21:51:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review would benefit from additional publications with greater survival details, that is median survival and number of events, for those trials that did not publish them originally. Further data from exemestane trials are required to evaluate this AI more completely. Efforts should be made to standardise reporting of toxicity and a quality of life component should also be included.</P>
