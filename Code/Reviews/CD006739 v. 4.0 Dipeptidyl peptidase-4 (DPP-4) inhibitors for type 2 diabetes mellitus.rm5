<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes mellitus</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors like sitagliptin and vildagliptin are promising new medicines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. They are supposed to improve metabolic control (as measured by lowering blood glucose) without causing severe hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels leading to unconsciousness and other symptoms). <BR/>Altogether 12.864 people took part in 25 studies investigating the new compounds sitagliptin and vildagliptin. Most studies lasted 24 weeks, the longest trials evaluated 52 weeks of treatment. So far, no study reported on patient-oriented parameters like mortality, diabetic complications, costs of treatment and health-related quality of life. When compared to placebo treatment sitagliptin and vildagliptin improved metabolic control. Comparison with other already established blood-glucose lowering drugs did not reveal advantages of DPP-4 treatment. Weight gain was not observed after sitagliptin and vildagliptin therapy. Overall, sitagliptin and vildagliptin were well tolerated, no severe hypoglycaemia was reported in patients taking sitagliptin or vildagliptin. However, all-cause infections increased significantly after sitagliptin treatment but did not reach statistical significance following vildagliptin therapy. Unfortunately, all published randomised controlled trials of at least 12 weeks treatment with sitagliptin and vildagliptin only reported routine laboratory safety measurements. Since the new DPP-4 inhibitors may influence immune function additional long-term data on the safety of these drugs are necessary. Also, cardiovascular outcomes like heart attacks and strokes should not be increased with any antidiabetic therapy but data so far are lacking. Until new information arrives, DPP-4 inhibitors should only be used under controlled conditions and in individual patients.<BR/>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>In type 2 diabetes mellitus there is a progressive loss of beta-cell function. One new approach yielding promising results is the use of the orally active dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors like sitagliptin and vildagliptin. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials in adult people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and had a trial duration of at least 12 weeks.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Pooling of studies was performed by means of fixed-effect meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-five studies of good quality were identified, 11 trials evaluated sitagliptin and 14 trials vildagliptin treatment. Altogether, 6743 patients were randomised in sitagliptin and 6121 patients in vildagliptin studies, respectively. Sitagliptin and vildagliptin studies ranged from 12 to 52 weeks duration. No data were published on mortality, diabetic complications, costs of treatment and health-related quality of life. <BR/>Sitagliptin and vildagliptin therapy in comparison with placebo resulted in an HbA1c reduction of approximately 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively. Data on comparisons with active comparators were limited but indicated no improved metabolic control following DPP-4 intervention in contrast to other hypoglycaemic agents. Sitagliptin and vildagliptin therapy did not result in weight gain but weight loss was more pronounced following placebo interventions. No definite conclusions could be drawn from published data on sitagliptin and vildagliptin effects on measurements of beta-cell function. Overall, sitagliptin and vildagliptin were well tolerated, no severe hypoglycaemia was reported in patients taking sitagliptin or vildagliptin. All-cause infections increased significantly after sitagliptin treatment but did not reach statistical significance following vildagliptin therapy. All published randomised controlled trials of at least 12 weeks treatment with sitagliptin and vildagliptin only reported routine laboratory safety measurements</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>DPP-4 inhibitors have some theoretical advantages over existing therapies with oral antidiabetic compounds but should currently be restricted to individual patients. Long-term data especially on cardiovascular outcomes and safety are urgently needed before widespread use of these new agents. More information on the benefit-risk ratio of DPP-4 inhibitor treatment is necessary especially analysing adverse effects on parameters of immune function. Also, long-term data are needed investigating patient-oriented parameters like health-related quality of life, diabetic complications and all-cause mortality.</P>

<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About', 'Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs)'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>There are two main types of diabetes mellitus, type 1 (formerly termed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and type 2 (formerly termed non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus):</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type 1 diabetes mellitus</HEADING>
<P>Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease characterised by hyperglycaemia due to absolute deficiency of insulin secretion which is caused by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells. Evidence of autoimmunity is provided by the appearance of autoantibodies prior to the onset of clinical disease. The clinical presentation ranges from mild nonspecific symptoms or no symptoms to coma. Although type 1 diabetes usually develops before 30 years of age, it can occur at any age. At presentation, most patients are thin and have experienced weight loss, polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, and diabetic ketoacidosis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type 2 diabetes mellitus</HEADING>
<P>In type 2 diabetes mellitus, the actions and secretion of insulin are impaired, as opposed to the absolute deficiency of insulin that occurs with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes is characterised by two major pathophysiologic defects: (1) insulin resistance, which results in increased hepatic glucose production and decreased peripheral glucose disposal, (2) impaired b-cell secretory function (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 1997</LINK>). Insulin resistance is an impaired biological response to the effects of exogenous or endogenous insulin. Insulin resistance in the hepatic and peripheral tissues, particularly skeletal muscle, leads to unrestrained hepatic glucose production and diminished insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose uptake and utilization (<LINK REF="REF-DeFronzo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeFronzo 1992</LINK>). Insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cell is initially sufficient to compensate for insulin resistance, thereby maintaining normal blood glucose levels. Hyperinsulinaemia, which accompanies insulin resistance, can maintain sufficiently normal glucose metabolism as long as pancreatic b-cell function remains normal. However, in patients who may develop type 2 diabetes, insulin secretion eventually fails, leading to hyperglycaemia and clinical diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Warram-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warram 1990</LINK>). Individuals with type 2 diabetes may have few or no classic clinical symptoms (see above) of hyperglycaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Ruige-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruige 1997</LINK>). The difficulty in maintaining metabolic control, for example measured by haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) over time may be related to several behavioral factors (for example difficulties with healthy eating, exercise, medication regimens) but primarily reflects the underlying progressive decline in b-cell function (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_16-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-16 1995</LINK>).<BR/>Type 2 diabetes has traditionally been treated in a stepwise manner, starting with lifestyle modifications (<LINK REF="REF-Armour-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armour 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gimenez_x002d_Perez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gimenez-Perez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>), exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>) and later on pharmacotherapy with oral agents. Several classes of oral agents are available for clinical use. These mainly include insulin secretagogues, drugs that delay the absorption of carbohydrates from the gastrointestinal tract, and insulin sensitizers. Over time, many patients with type 2 diabetes will require insulin therapy (Burt 2005; <LINK REF="REF-Misso-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misso 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Royle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royle 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siebenhofer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebenhofer 2004</LINK>).<BR/>Insulin secretagogues: Currently, the sulphonylureas used are mainly glibenclamide (glyburide), glipizide, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, and glimepiride. These drugs stimulate pancreatic b-cell insulin secretion by binding to a sulphonylurea receptor. The short-acting non-sulphonylurea insulin secretagogues are repaglinide and nateglinide (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2003</LINK>). These are newer agents that also stimulate insulin secretion by binding to the sulphonylurea receptor.<BR/>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors: Acarbose and miglitol are a-glucosidase inhibitors. These drugs slow the absorption of carbohydrates, reducing especially postprandial elevations in plasma glucose levels. They do not significantly lower fasting plasma glucose levels but cause a modest reduction in HbA1c (<LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Laar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Laar 2005</LINK>).<BR/>Insulin sensitizers: Metformin belongs to the biguanides class (<LINK REF="REF-Saenz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saenz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2003</LINK>). It might increase insulin sensitivity in the liver by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis and thereby reducing hepatic glucose production. Metformin also seems to increase peripheral insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose uptake in the muscle. The thiazolidinediones consist of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. These substances decrease insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#947; (PPAR-&#947;) which increases production of proteins involved in glucose uptake. They also decrease hepatic glucose production by improving hepatic insulin sensitivity.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-10 12:37:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Type 2 diabetes mellitus can be treated by non-pharmacological (diet, exercise) and pharmacological means. Insulin, as the natural hormone of the body, might be given as animal (mainly pork or beef) insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Richter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2005</LINK>), genetically constructed 'human' insulin or as insulin-'analogues' with a modified molecular structure compared to human insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siebenhofer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebenhofer 2004</LINK>). Insulin is currently administered by diabetic people in various ways: Subcutaneous injections, insulin pumps (<LINK REF="REF-Misso-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misso 2005</LINK>), and by inhalation (<LINK REF="REF-Royle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royle 2003</LINK>). Oral antidiabetic agents are most often used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus in its initial stages if lifestyle modifications have failed. The thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone and pioglitazone (<LINK REF="REF-Richter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2006</LINK>) offer new oral treatment options and affect many tissues and parts of the body. In order to evaluate their effects not only on metabolic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus but also on patient-oriented outcomes like cardiovascular disease, longer-term studies of at least 24 weeks continuous intake will be critically appraised in this review.</P>
<P>It has been demonstrated that, for a given rise in plasma glucose, the increase in plasma insulin is approximately threefold greater when glucose is administered orally compared with intravenously. This enhancement of insulin release is known as the 'incretin' effect. The peptides glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are the most important incretin hormones. Both act as potent insulinotropic hormones, released by oral glucose, and up to two-thirds of the insulin normally secreted in relation to a meal are thought to be a result of the actions of these hormones. GLP-1 has been shown to be essential for normal postprandial glucose homeostasis in humans and its secretion throughout the day is highly correlated to the release of insulin. The insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 is thought to be glucose-dependent, and this dependence on blood glucose concentration at or above fasting glucose levels means that GLP-1 should not cause profound hypoglycaemia. Direct effects of GLP-1 on beta-cell growth and survival as well as inhibition of beta-cell apoptosis have been shown in animal models. GLP-1 suppresses glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and therefore is unlikely to impair the glucagon counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia. GLP-1 delays gastric emptying and secretion, thus reducing postprandial glucose excursions by delaying nutrient delivery to the small intestine (<LINK REF="REF-Drucker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drucker 2006</LINK>).<BR/>It is recognized that inadequate secretions of insulin are a very early element in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the progression happens because of declining beta-cell function which in part is a result of loss of beta-cells. Patients with type 2 diabetes show an almost complete loss of the incretin effect. GLP-1 is metabolised very rapidly in the circulation, with a half-life in vivo of less than two minutes. The ubiquitous enzyme, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4) is in many tissues, including the kidney, intestine and capillary endothelium. DPP-4 metabolises GLP-1 and is involved in regulating the biological activity of GLP-1. DPP-4 inhibitors or 'gliptins' prevent GLP-1 degradation and improve circulation time, thereby increasing the biological activity of incretin hormones. Two inhibitors are currently on the market, vildagliptin and sitagliptin for once daily oral administration (<LINK REF="REF-Drucker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drucker 2006</LINK>).<BR/>DPP-4, also known as the lymphocyte cell surface marker CD 26, is a ubiquitous complex enzyme that exists as a membrane-spanning cell-surface aminopeptidase that transmits intracellular signals via a short intracellular tail and a second smaller soluble form circulating in the plasma. It is widely expressed in many tissues, such as liver, lung, kidney, intestine, lymphocytes, capillary endothelium and T-cells, B-cells and natural killer cells (<LINK REF="REF-Thornberry-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornberry 2007</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>In addition to stabilising the incretins, GLP-1 and GIP, DPP-4 inhibitors also prolong the action of a number of neuropeptide like neuropeptide Y, growth hormone-releasing hormone and chemokinines such as stromal-cell derived factor 1 and macrophage-derived chemokine. Potential side-effects include neurogenic inflammation, increase in blood pressure, enhanced inflammation and allergic reactions. DPP-4 contributes to T-cell activation, raising the possibility that these compounds compromise immune function. Therefore, the long-term safety of DPP-4 inhibitors merits careful consideration and investigation. The elucidation of several new members of the DPP-4 family have consequences for the development of DPP-4 inhibitors. Compound previously though to be specific could in fact be inhibitors of other members of the DPP-4 enzyme family (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2006</LINK>).<BR/>As a T-cell co stimulator, DPP-4 is of importance in the immune system. Levels of tissue DPP-4 are reduced in nasal tissue of people with chronic rhinosinusitis and DPP-4 inhibition seems to aggravate nasopharyngitis as could be observed in clinical studies. Therefore, it seems to be highly important to monitor DPP-4 treated patients for the development of inflammatory conditions, such as angioedema, rhinitis and urticaria. DPP-4 also regulates migration of human cord blood CD34+ progenitor cells and the homing and engraftment of hematopoetic stem cells.</P>

<P>One systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of incretin therapy was recently published (<LINK REF="REF-Amori-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amori 2007</LINK>). A Cochrane review on glucagon-like peptide analogues for type 2 diabetes mellitus is currently being accomplished (<LINK REF="REF-Snaith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snaith 2007</LINK>). This Cochrane review focuses on DPP-4 inhibitor compounds and aggregates the most recent data on sitagliptin and vildagliptin therapy.

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2009-05-04 09:56:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>To determine the studies to be assessed further, two authors independently scanned the abstract, titles or both sections of every record retrieved. All potentially relevant articles were investigated as full text. Interrater agreement for study selection was measured using the kappa statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1960</LINK>). Differences were planned to be marked and if these studies were later on to be included, the influence of the primary choice would have been subjected to a sensitivity analysis. Where differences in opinion existed, they were resolved by a third party. If resolving disagreement was not possible, the article was to be added to those 'awaiting assessment' and authors would have been contacted for clarification. An adapted PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow-chart of study selection will be attached (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dealing with duplicate publications</HEADING>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-10 12:41:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Two authors assessed risk of bias of each trial independently. Possible disagreement was resolved by consensus, or with consultation of a third party in case of disagreement. We planned to explore the influence of individual quality criteria in a sensitivity analysis (see under 'sensitivity analyses'). Interrater agreement for key quality indicators (for example concealment of allocation) was calculated using the kappa statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1960</LINK>). In cases of disagreement, the rest of the group would have been consulted and a judgement would have been made based on consensus.</P>

<P>In the event of substantial clinical or methodological or statistical heterogeneity, study results were not combined by means of meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was identified by visual inspection of the forest plots, by using a standard &#967;2-test and a significance level of &#945; = 0.1, in view of the low power of such tests. Heterogeneity was specifically examined with I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>), where I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 50% and more indicate a substantial level of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).

<P>Funnel plots were planned to be used in an exploratory data analysis to assess for the potential existence of small study bias. There are a number of explanations for the asymmetry of a funnel plot, including true heterogeneity of effect with respect to study size, poor methodological design of small studies and publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2001</LINK>).

Only one publication described the number of study centres with regard to sitagliptin trials (<LINK REF="STD-Nonaka-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nonaka 2008</LINK>). Almost all publications of vildagliptin therapy specified number of study centres ranging from 15 to 202. In sitagliptin and vildagliptin studies 1 to 34 and 1 to 11 countries participated. Sitagliptin was mainly investigated in Asia, Europe, North and South America whereas vildagliptin trials mainly took place in Europe and North America.

<P>Secondary outcomes in sitagliptin and vildagliptin studies consisted mainly of fasting plasma glucose and lipids, insulin, proinsulin, measurements of beta-cell function, such as proinsulin-to-insulin ratio, homeostasis model assessment beta (HOMA-beta) and insulinogenic index at peak glucose (I/G) as well as the corrected insulin response at peak glucose (CIR(GluPeak), measurements of insulin resistance, such as HOMA-insulin resistance (IR) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). Moreover, standard meal tolerance tests were performed, for example to analyse plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptid, 2-hr post-prandial glucose, area-under-the-curve (AUC) insulin, C-peptide AUC and insulin AUC-to-glucose AUC ratio. Some studies also evaluated responders to treatment, defined as the percentage of patients achieving certain HbA1c endpoints A1C (for example, less than 7%).<BR/>Safety outcomes mainly comprised adverse experiences including hypoglycaemic episodes, physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECG) and body weight. Laboratory measurements were composed of routine or standard haematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis.</P>

<P>Sitagliptin versus placebo trials demonstrated substantial heterogeneity. After elimination of the single study in Japanese patients only (<LINK REF="STD-Nonaka-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nonaka 2008</LINK>), heterogeneity decreased to an I<SUP>2</SUP> of 25%. The weighted mean glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) difference between intervention groups was -0.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.8 to -0.6, P &gt; 0.00001).<BR/>Vildagliptin versus placebo trials also showed substantial heterogeneity.

<P>Only two studies investigated sitagliptin monotherapy versus another hypoglycaemic agent monotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 2007a</LINK>), again demonstrating substantial heterogeneity. A reliable pooled estimate cannot be reported but both trials indicated a more pronounced HbA1c decrease following control interventions.<BR/>Three trials contrasted vildagliptin monotherapy to another hypoglycaemic agent monotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenstock-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenstock 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2007</LINK>).

<P>Combined sitagliptin or vildagliptin treatment versus another combination of hypoglycaemic agents revealed substantial heterogeneities which could not easily explained and were attributed to the great variety in different drugs employed as well as diversity of patients (for example drug-naive and pre-treated participants).

<P>When comparing 12 weeks sitagliptin and vildagliptin versus placebo treatment to 18 to 52 weeks therapy we again observed pronounced heterogeneity.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-06 14:11:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-06 14:11:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Twenty-five good quality studies investigating sitagliptin and vildagliptin treatment were detected, randomising altogether 12.864 people to DPP-4 interventions.<BR/>Sitagliptin and vildagliptin therapy in comparison with placebo resulted in an HbA1c reduction of approximately 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively. Data on comparisons with active comparators were limited but indicated no improved metabolic control following DPP-4 intervention in contrast to other hypoglycaemic agents. Due to pronounced heterogeneity effects of sitagliptin combined with other antidiabetic agents compared with combinations of other hypoglycaemic drugs are difficult to interpret but DPP-4 inhibitors might provide additional improvement in metabolic control. Sitagliptin and vildagliptin therapy did not result in weight gain but weight loss was more pronounced following placebo interventions.<BR/>Unfortunately, so far no data were published on mortality, diabetic complications, costs of treatment and health-related quality of life.<BR/>
<BR/>Diabetes is a strong, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a problem which accounts for approximately 70% of all mortality in people with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Laakso-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laakso 1999</LINK>). Prospective studies show that compared to their non-diabetic counterparts, the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality for men with diabetes is two to three and for women with diabetes is three to four (<LINK REF="REF-Manson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamler 1993</LINK>). The increased cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes is reflected in the observation that middle-aged individuals with diabetes have mortality and morbidity risks that are similar to non-diabetic individuals who have already suffered a cardiovascular event (<LINK REF="REF-Haffner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haffner 1998</LINK>).<BR/>Both epidemiological and prospective data have demonstrated that treatment of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus is effective in reducing the risk of microvascular disease (for example diabetic retinopathy) but is less potent in reducing that of myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Treatment of other cardiovascular risk factors, although by definition less prevalent than hyperglycaemia, appears to be more effective in preventing macrovascular disease than treatment of hyperglycaemia. The University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) study was the first published long-term investigation of people with type 2 diabetes indicating no reduction of cardiovascular endpoints through improved metabolic control but raised cardiovascular mortality after tolbutamide treatment (<LINK REF="REF-UGDP-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">UGDP 1982</LINK>). The study of Ohkubo et al. which included relatively lean Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, was the first to demonstrate prevention of microvascular complications by intensive glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Ohkubo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohkubo 1995</LINK>). This study did not address the question of whether good glycaemic control retards the progression of macrovascular disease. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) tested mainly whether intensive glucose control with either a sulphonylurea or insulin influences the risk of micro- and macrovascular complications compared with conventional treatment (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_33-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-33 1998</LINK>). The 10-year results of the UKPDS evaluated drug treatment in non obese and obese participants with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who were referred to hospital clinics. Over 10 years, HbA1c was 7.0% in the intensive group compared with 7.9% in the conventional group. The 0.9% difference in HbA1c between the intensive and conventional groups over 10 years was smaller than the 1.9% difference (9.0% and 7.1%) in HbA1c in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The DCCT studied younger patients with type 1 diabetes and assessed the effects of intensive versus conventional insulin therapy on the incidence of microvascular complications of diabetes (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) over a mean follow-up of 6.5 years (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1993</LINK>). The risk of retinopathy, for example, was statistically significant reduced by intensive insulin therapy with a number needed to treat (NNT) to benefit of six (six type 1 diabetic patients need to be treated by intensive in comparison to conventional insulin therapy over 6.5 years to avoid one additional patient to develop diabetic retinopathy). The UKPDS had a factorial design meaning that another study investigating intensive versus regular blood pressure control (<LINK REF="REF-HDS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDS 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_38-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-38 1998</LINK>) was imbedded in the main study. Intensive versus conventional glucose control did not result in a statistically significant difference in diabetes related mortality or macrovascular disease endpoints but reduced the relative risk in the 'any diabetes related aggregate endpoint' (<LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 2003</LINK>). Most of this benefit was due to a reduction in microvascular endpoints including the incidence of retinal photocoagulation, which was assessed by ophthalmologists independent of the study. In the UKPDS, the NNT to prevent one patient developing any of the single endpoints over 10 years was 20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 500) patients (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_33-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-33 1998</LINK>). In contrast to these results, publication of the UKPDS-34, which focused on obese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, found several clinically important differences in macrovascular disease endpoints with 10 years of treatment with metformin (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_34-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-34 1998</LINK>). In particular, the absolute risk reduction for the aggregate endpoints was more than 10% and for overall mortality was 7%, giving NNTs of 10 and 14, respectively, over 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-McCormack-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 2003</LINK>).<BR/>The UKPDS was criticised on several grounds especially emphasising hidden biases in interpreting the results of this randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="REF-Ewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewart 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCormack-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 1998</LINK>). Stratton et al. in their UKPDS-35 publication are often cited, who tried to determine the relation between exposure to glycaemia over time and the risk of macrovascular or microvascular complications in the UKPDS patients (<LINK REF="REF-Stratton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratton 2000</LINK>). This publication is an epidemiological re-interpretation of UKPDS data proclaiming that with each 1% reduction in mean HbA1c, reductions in risk of 21% for deaths related to diabetes and 14% for myocardial infarction could be observed. The RCT itself, though, did not show significant differences in this respect. Moreover, the UKPDS-38, investigating tight versus less tight blood pressure control with the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or a b-blocker atenolol as main treatment, showed relative risk reductions (in the group assigned to tight control compared with that assigned to less tight control) of 24% in diabetes related endpoints, 32% in deaths related to diabetes, 44% in strokes and 37% in microvascular endpoints (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS_x002d_38-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS-38 1998</LINK>). Due to the factorial design of the UKPDS with two interventions (improvement in metabolic and blood pressure control) aiming at the same outcomes, a fair interpretation of the data needs investigation of the interaction between the two main treatment strategies (<LINK REF="REF-McAlister-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAlister 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2003</LINK>). UKPDS data should be available to the scientific public to evaluate, among other things, the importance of the individual contribution of improved glucose versus blood pressure control in type 2 diabetes mellitus.</P>
<P>A progressive reduction in beta-cell mass contributes significantly to gradual loss of glycaemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes. A major goal of diabetes research is to restore the beta-cell mass typically lost during the natural progression of type 2 diabetes. Current treatments not only show no ability to reduce beta-cell loss, but some such as the sulfonylureas have been shown to induce beta-cell apoptosis in cultured human islets (<LINK REF="REF-Maedler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maedler 2005</LINK>). The ability of DPP-4 inhibitors to enhance beta-cell survival and stimulate beta-cell growth suggests that these agents may provide a means to preserve or restore functional beta-cell mass in individuals with type 2 diabetes.<BR/>So far, no definite conclusions can be drawn from published data on sitagliptin and vildagliptin effects on measurements of beta-cell function.<BR/>Overall, sitagliptin and vildagliptin were well tolerated, no severe hypoglycaemia was reported in patients taking sitagliptin or vildagliptin. All-cause infections showed a statistically significant increase after sitagliptin treatment but did not reach statistical significance following vildagliptin therapy.<BR/>In the available publications safety laboratory assessments only consisted of standard haematology and biochemistry measurements. However, there is a considerable risk of potential adverse effects of DPP-4 inhibitors, especially on the immune system. It is disturbing to note that in all published randomised controlled trials of sitagliptin and vildagliptin interventions, only routine laboratory safety measurements were reported. The best chance to perform and report elaborate laboratory measurements would have been under well-controlled efficacy studies.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>DPP-4 inhibitors like sitagliptin and vildagliptin have some theoretical advantages over existing therapies with oral antidiabetic compounds but should currently be restricted to individual patients. Long-term data on cardiovascular outcomes and safety are urgently needed before widespread use of these new agents.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More information on the benefit-risk ratio of DPP-4 inhibitor treatment is necessary especially analysing adverse effects on parameters of immune function. Also, long-term data are needed investigating patient-oriented parameters like health-related quality of life, diabetic complications and all-cause mortality.</P>
