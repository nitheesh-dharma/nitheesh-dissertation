This can cause confusion, for example around diagnosis, treatment, lifestyle recommendations, and genetic markers. The correct use of the term atopic eczema should therefore ideally only refer to those with a clinical picture of eczema who are also immunoglobulin E antibody high-responders. The world allergy association's revised nomenclature for allergy also states that what is commonly called atopic eczema is not one specific disease but encompasses a spectrum of allergic mechanisms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore, we then decided to change the term &amp;quot;atopic dermatitis&amp;quot; into &amp;quot;eczema&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-06-26 10:31:18 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">

<TITLE>Topical pimecrolimus for eczema</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-04 13:32:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>This review of clinical trials aimed to find out whether topical pimecrolimus is better than topical corticosteroids or tacrolimus for treating eczema in infants, children and adults by assessing the improvement of eczema and adverse events associated with treatments.</P>
<P>Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a very common and long-lasting skin disease caused by both genetic and environmental factors, and most often begins in infancy and childhood. Corticosteroid creams have been used to treat eczema but may cause unwanted side effects, including thinning of the skin. Pimecrolimus cream was developed as an alternative to topical corticosteroids, but it is much more expensive than corticosteroids. It is also not clear whether pimecrolimus is more effective or better tolerated than corticosteroids or a similar drug called tacrolimus.</P>
<P>This review included data from 31 clinical trials involving 8019 participants. In the short-term (less than six weeks) treatment of eczema, we found pimecrolimus was more effective and well-tolerated when compared against vehicle (cream base not containing any pimecrolimus). Likewise, pimecrolimus was better than vehicle cream in preventing deterioration in eczema based on data from 9 trials involving 3091 participants. However, we found that 3 weeks treatment with pimecrolimus was less effective than a moderate (triamcinolone acetonide, data from 1 trial with 658 participants) and a potent topical corticosteroid (betamethasone valerate, data from 1 trial with 87 participants). Furthermore, 6-weeks treatment with pimecrolimus was less effective and caused more participants to drop out of treatment due to lack of efficacy than tacrolimus based on 2 trials involving 639 participants.</P>
<P>Pimecrolimus caused a similar rate of adverse events to vehicle cream but had a lower overall dropout rate. In contrast, pimecrolimus had higher dropout rates and caused more skin burning than topical corticosteroids. None of the trials reported on key adverse effects, such as thinning of skin. Pimecrolimus caused a similar rate of adverse events to tacrolimus. There were no cancer-related events reported in any of the 31 clinical trials.</P>
<P>This review did not find evidence to support the notion that pimecrolimus was better than moderate or potent corticosteroids or tacrolimus in treating eczema. However, there is a distinct lack of trials comparing pimecrolimus against mild-potency corticosteroids.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-07-04 13:31:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Pimecrolimus was developed as an alternative to topical corticosteroids for treating eczema (atopic dermatitis) but its efficacy and safety compared with existing treatments remains unclear.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of topical pimecrolimus for treating eczema. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (to October 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library Issue </I>3, 2006<I>), </I>MEDLINE (from 2003 to October 2006), and EMBASE (from 2005 to October 2006). We also contacted researchers and manufacturers in the field. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of 1.0% topical pimecrolimus used twice daily compared against other topical comparators for treating eczema.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently examined each retrieved study for eligibility and extracted data for efficacy, tolerability and safety. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-04 13:31:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>We included 31 trials (8019 participants) in the analysis. In short-term (&#8804; 6 weeks) trials, pimecrolimus cream was significantly more effective and well-tolerated than vehicle (cream base, but not containing pimecrolimus). In long-term trials (&#8805; 6 months), pimecrolimus was significantly better than vehicle in preventing flares (9 trials, 3091 participants, RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.64 at six months) and in improving quality of life.<BR/>
<BR/>Pimecrolimus was significantly less effective than two topical corticosteroids, i.e. 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide for investigators' global assessment (1 trial, 658 participants, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83) and 0.1% betamethasone valerate for participants' global assessment (1 trial, 87 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.81) at three weeks. Pimecrolimus was also associated with significantly more overall withdrawals and skin burning. None of the trials reported on key adverse effects such as thinning of skin.</P>
<P>Pimecrolimus was significantly less effective than 0.1% tacrolimus for investigators' global assessment at 6 weeks (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74) and led to more withdrawals due to lack of efficacy (RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.10 to 5.08) based on 2 trials involving 639 participants, but there was no significant difference in proportions of participants experiencing any adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Topical pimecrolimus is less effective than moderate and potent corticosteroids and 0.1% tacrolimus. The therapeutic role of topical pimecrolimus is uncertain due to the absence of key comparisons with mild corticosteroids.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevalence and causes</HEADING>
<P>Eczema (also known as atopic dermatitis) is a chronic, relapsing, intensely itchy, inflammatory skin disease, which typically involves the folds of the elbows or behind the knees (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2004</LINK>). The cause of eczema is unknown but evidence suggests a role for both genetic and environmental factors in determining disease expression. The causes of eczema are probably due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors (<LINK REF="REF-Cookson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cookson 2002</LINK>). Eczema is often present with, or exacerbated by, food allergies, aeroallergens (e.g. house dust mites, moulds, animal danders) and skin colonisation by <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>, which is present in 90% of eczema lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Leung-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 2003</LINK>). However, up to 60% of individuals with eczema may not have specific immunoglobulin E production in response to allergens, which is associated with "atopic dermatitis", i.e. eczema with allergic reaction (<LINK REF="REF-Flohr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flohr 2004</LINK>). To clarify the confusion on diagnosis and treatment, the world allergy association revised nomenclature for allergy and recommended using "eczema" to refer this specific disease (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2004</LINK>). Symptoms of eczema may appear in infants as young as one month old, and in most cases usually appear before the age of two years. Around 60% of cases have cleared (or gone into remission) by early adolescence, although some people will experience continuing eczema into, or relapse in adult life. The prevalence of eczema varies considerably from one country to another, and also within countries (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1999</LINK>). In the UK there has been a steady increase in prevalence, and the condition now affects around 15% of schoolchildren (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neame-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neame 1995</LINK>) and 1% to 3% of adults. Most children who have eczema experience mild or moderate disease. A survey of 1760 children aged one to five years in England found that 84% of cases were mild, 14% moderate and 2% severe (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact of the disease </HEADING>
<P>The social and economic impact of eczema is considerable, especially when the disease is severe, with sufferers experiencing significant limitations of normal social functions. It has a profound impact on the quality of life of both children (<LINK REF="REF-Kiebert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiebert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis_x002d_Jones-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis-Jones 2001</LINK>) and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Kiebert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiebert 2002</LINK>). People with eczema experience itch, sleep loss, bleeding from the skin and interference with nearly all aspects of daily life (<LINK REF="REF-Herd-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herd 2000</LINK>). The emotional impact of visible eczema lesions can be considerable, especially in children, and may contribute to psychological distress. The school or work time interruption caused by sleep loss and the need to take time off work for visits to health care professionals result in considerable family disturbance. (<LINK REF="REF-Herd-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herd 2000</LINK>). In the US, the annual cost of illness for eczema has been estimated to range from $0.9 billion to $3.8 billion when projected across the total number of people younger than 65 years insured by private insurers and Medicaid (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2002</LINK>). Likewise, in the UK, it has been estimated that the annual cost of eczema in children aged one to five years is £47 million, with £30 million spent by the National Health Service and £17 million spent by the families of affected children (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 2001</LINK>). On the basis of an estimated 1.5 million people with eczema in Germany, it has been suggested that the total annual costs to society are as high as US$325 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Gieler-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gieler 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Management of the disease</HEADING>
<P>Traditionally, the treatment of mild-to-moderate eczema has included the frequent use of emollients, and intermittent use of topical corticosteroids to control acute 'flares'. Corticosteroids, though effective, may be associated with a number of local and systemic adverse events, such as skin thinning and suppression of the adrenal glands (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2005</LINK>). To minimise these rare but possible side effects, topical corticosteroids are generally only used to treat flares and occasionally to prevent them (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2003</LINK>). Fears about the safety profile of topical corticosteroids, compounded by inconsistent advice from health professionals, have important implications for adherence to treatment. Parental knowledge on differentiating weak from strong preparations is poor (<LINK REF="REF-Beattie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beattie 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Charman-_x0028_b_x0029_-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charman (b) 2000</LINK>). Systemic treatment, with immunosuppressant drugs such as ciclosporin, may be associated with potentially serious adverse effects and is generally reserved for severe cases that prove resistant to conventional treatment with topical agents.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Topical pimecrolimus </HEADING>
<P>Since eczema is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disorder, it has been considered as a good target for the immunosuppressant properties of substances called macrolides (such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, and pimecrolimus). Pimecrolimus is a non-steroidal immunosuppressant derived from one type of the naturally occurring antimicrobial (macrolactam), called ascomycin. Laboratory experiments have shown that pimecrolimus inhibits the production of inflammatory substances in the body (such as the synthesis and release of inflammatory cytokines from T-lymphocytes, and the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells) that are thought to be important in causing skin lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Stuetz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuetz 2001</LINK>), and hence pimecrolimus is used in treating severe eczema.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-06-26 14:02:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>In recent years, a number of clinical trials have studied the use of topical pimecrolimus in the treatment of eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 2000</LINK>). Most studies have compared topical pimecrolimus against placebo controls. Although the placebo-controlled studies show that topical pimecrolimus clearly has a beneficial effect on eczema, it is not clear how they compare to existing treatments, and doctors and patients are sometimes confused how topical pimecrolimus should be used in relation to other existing therapies such as topical corticosteroids. It is also unclear whether topical pimecrolimus is best used as treatment of second choice after first line treatment has failed and whether it should be used for short-term or long-term control of eczema, or whether it should only be used for "sensitive sites" such as the face or armpits where skin thinning can more easily develop after using topical corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Recently, reports from both US and EU post-marketing surveillance signalled a potential risk of skin cancer and lymphoma associated with pimecrolimus and tacrolimus. In December 2004, the US FDA had received 10 cases (four children and six adults) of cancer-related adverse events associated with pimecrolimus, including lymphoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and granulomatous lymphadenitis. The median exposure time of pimecrolimus in these cases was 90 days, with a range from one week and 300 days (FDA 2005). These alerts on the potential risk of rare dermatological malignancies associated with pimecrolimus have raised concerns about the long-term safety of pimecrolimus.

<P>We have summarised the efficacy results for the different treatment comparisons separately. The efficacy results include Investigator-rated clinical response (IGA), participant- or carer-rated clinical response (PGA) and improvement in pruritus. Global changes in composite rating scales (e.g. Atopic Dermatitis Area Severity Index [ADASI]) or the duration of remission were not routinely reported in the included trials. Of the 31 trials only 2 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Eichenfield-_x0028_a_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eichenfield (a) 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eichenfield-_x0028_b_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eichenfield (b) 2002</LINK>) reported on the clinical signs of eczema (erythema, induration or papulation, excoriation, and lichenification) assessed by a physician as mild or absent. The impact of treatment on QoL is reported separately due to marked differences in the QoL instruments used and the timing of QoL assessments.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">(iv) Improvement in quality of life (three<I> </I>studies)</HEADING>
<P>Information on quality of life (QoL) was patchy, with a lack of common outcome measures (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Only six of the 31 included RCTs reported quality of life outcomes. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Leo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staab-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whalley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whalley 2002</LINK>) compared pimecrolimus against vehicle and the other three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kapp-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kapp 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meurer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meurer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wahn 2002</LINK>) were flare-preventing trials.</P>
<P>One vehicle-controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Whalley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whalley 2002</LINK>) involving 403 children with mild to moderate eczema used the Parent's Index of Quality of Life in Atopic Dermatitis (PIQoL-AD) score to measure QoL. This study included a 6-week RCT period and a 20-week open-label trial period. The PIQoL-AD scores were completed by the parents of a subset of participants (children aged 2 to 8 years) at baseline (241 cases), 6 weeks (193 cases) and 6 months (161 cases) of treatment. At six weeks, those children who received pimecrolimus were judged by their parents to have a significantly improved quality of life compared with those receiving vehicle (P = 0.023). The least-square mean change was 3.20 for the pimecrolimus group and 1.63 for the vehicle group, with an estimated treatment difference of 1.57 (95% CI 0.22 to 2.92). At six months (end of open-label phase), both treatment groups showed a significant within-group improvement (P &lt; 0.001) compared with baseline, but the mean PIQoL-AD scores were similar between the two treatment groups. A reduction of 10% or more in PIQoL-AD score between baseline and 6 months was found in 76.1% of parents of children who had been initiated with pimecrolimus and 77.1% of parents of children who had started with vehicle.</P>
<P>One vehicle-controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Leo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leo 2004</LINK>) involving 19 children with mild to moderate eczema reported a trend towards lower Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) score (a validated measure consisting of 10 questions that inquire about the effect of eczema on a child's QoL, lower score indicates improved QoL) at 2 weeks in the pimecrolimus group, but there was no significant difference detected from baseline (P = 0.12). The mean CDLQI score changed from 7.44 to 3.8 for pimecrolimus 1.0% and from 7.72 to 5.4 for vehicle treatment.</P>
<P>Likewise, another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Staab-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Staab 2005</LINK>) involving 190 infants with mild to severe eczema used the Parents' Quality of Life Index Atopic Dermatitis (PQoL-AD) to measure QoL. At four weeks (end of the double-blind treatment), participants receiving pimecrolimus were judged by their parents to have a significantly improved quality of life from baseline in all five sub-scales of PQoL-AD compared against vehicle (P &lt; 0.05); the mean percentage changes from baseline for all five sub-scales were: psychosomatic well-being 14.6% vs. 6.2%; effects on social life 6.7% vs. 2.3%; confidence in medical treatment 10.0% vs. 3.7%; emotional coping 16.1% vs. 6.5%; acceptance of disease 19.6% vs. 7.0%.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Principal findings</HEADING>
<P>Evidence from short-term (no more than six weeks) vehicle-controlled trials has shown that topical pimecrolimus is effective in controlling the signs and symptoms of eczema or facial eczema with acceptable tolerability and safety profiles. Evidence from long-term (more than six months) flare-preventing trials showed that pimecrolimus is effective in controlling the signs and symptoms of eczema. The long-term quality of life measures gathered from adults, carers of infants and children also suggests that pimecrolimus also improves quality of life more than vehicle alone. It is not surprising that an active treatment shows better efficacy outcomes than vehicle only in eczema. The vehicle controlled studies have been helpful in establishing that short-term efficacy and capability of preventing flares does exist and that the tolerability and short-term adverse effect profile of topical pimecrolimus is acceptable. More vehicle controlled studies are not needed (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2006</LINK>) and may even be considered unethical, especially if children with severe eczema are included (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current evidence for the head-to-head comparisons of topical immunosuppressants (i.e. pimecrolimus vs. tacrolimus) are limited, yet we found some evidence in four trials that 1% pimecrolimus is as effective as 0.03% tacrolimus and less effective than 0.1% tacrolimus in treating eczema. Pimecrolimus presented similar tolerability and safety profiles to both 0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus, but more participants withdrew from pimecrolimus treatment due to the lack of efficacy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Strengths and limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>We comprehensively searched for randomised controlled trials from a wide range of databases in order to avoid the risk of publication bias, used clinically relevant outcome measures, and included direct comparisons with other active treatments, rather than making indirect inferences from placebo controlled trials. However, there are several limitations of this review:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Participants</HEADING>
<P>One limitation of our systematic review is that we failed to analyse the outcome data according to participants' age groups and the severity of eczema due to the enormous discrepancies of definitions for these subgroups within the included trials. Therefore, some caution is needed for the interpretation of results as applied to particular age groups.</P>
<P>We acknowledge the high drop-out (attrition) rates of included trials. Seventeen of the 31 trials have more than 20% dropouts. Although the attrition rate is related to treatment duration, 11 of the 17 trials with inadequate attrition rates are short-term trials (no more than 6 weeks). Participants' severity of eczema and efficacy of treatment may also influence the attrition rates. Therefore, we explored the reasons for attrition in terms of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy or adverse events and found the majority of participants withdrew from the trials due to lack of efficacy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Comparisons</HEADING>
<P>There are very limited data available for the active comparisons (pimecrolimus vs. topical corticosteroids) and head-to-head comparisons of pimecrolimus against topical tacrolimus.</P>
<P>As 1.0 % pimecrolimus is licensed for acute treatment of mild to moderate eczema (including flares), in practice, 1% hydrocortisone acetate (a mild topical corticosteroid) licensed for the same indication is the most relevant comparator to pimecrolimus. However, the comparison of pimecrolimus with existing therapy for such a group is currently not available. Perhaps this is not surprising as 1% hydrocortisone is much less expensive than topical pimecrolimus and topical pimecrolimus would need to be much more effective (or have much fewer adverse effects) than 1% hydrocortisone in order to become cost-effective. Both scenarios seem unlikely given the performance of topical pimecrolimus against stronger topical corticosteroid preparations. Although we found pimecrolimus is more effective in preventing flares than vehicle, the comparative efficacy of pimecrolimus against the early use of mild topical corticosteroids is not known. In the absence of such key comparisons, the therapeutic role of pimecrolimus in treating mild to moderate eczema is unclear.</P>
<P>In addition, there is also a lack of crucial outcome data for other active and head-to-head comparisons. Although topical immunosuppressants (i.e. pimecrolimus and tacrolimus) were developed as an alternative to topical corticosteroids to overcome possible adverse effects of corticosteroids (such as thinning of the skin or adrenal gland suppression), we found no clear evidence that these newer, more expensive products offer better tolerability and safety profiles compared with existing standard practice. Crucially, we found no evidence to show that use of topical pimecrolimus was associated with less skin thinning than topical corticosteroids in long term studies, perhaps because such skin thinning is very rare when topical corticosteroids are used appropriately (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2005</LINK>). One preliminary randomised controlled trial of pimecrolimus applied to normal skin for four weeks found no thinning of the skin (<LINK REF="STD-Queille_x002d_Roussel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Queille-Roussel 2001</LINK>), however, the results are difficult to generalise to people with eczema who apply preparations over the course of a year.</P>
<P>One obvious area of potential use for a new and more expensive product like topical pimecrolimus is in the treatment of eczema that has become "resistant" or that has failed to respond to topical corticosteroids. Only one small-scale study has evaluated such a use, and failed to demonstrate any greater efficacy than vehicle. Another area where topical pimecrolimus might have an important niche is in the treatment of eczema at "sensitive" sites such as the face in people who might have become dependent on inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids at such sites, and therefore at high risk of skin thinning. Although four trials have shown efficacy of topical pimecrolimus when compared with vehicle for facial eczema, we are not aware of any studies that have shown any advantage in terms of less skin thinning when compared against topical corticosteroids for such sensitive site eczema. Nor are we aware of any studies that have shown that pimecrolimus might work when topical corticosteroids have stopped working on facial eczema or in people who have developed topical corticosteroid-related skin thinning. So we have a lot of data on pimecrolimus where it is not needed, and very little to none on the clinical situations where it might be useful.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There are various outcome measures reported relating to different timings from the included trials. No trial reported on QoL data comparing pimecrolimus against tacrolimus. We failed to analyse the global changes in composite rating scales (e.g. ADASI or eczema area and severity index [EASI]) presented in mean or median percentages of improvement from baseline. The use of investigators' global assessments of response to treatment also causes some concern. Despite the fact that these assessments of response to treatment are widely used as outcome measures in clinical trials of eczema further research is needed to fully determine their validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change (<LINK REF="REF-Charman-_x0028_a_x0029_-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charman (a) 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Charman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charman 2003</LINK>). Likewise, it is possible that blinding in placebo controlled trials may have been compromised due to relatively high proportions of participants receiving pimecrolimus experiencing skin burning.</P>
<P>One limitation of our systematic review is that our analyses of withdrawal rates and adverse events were based on data pooled from trials of different durations. We did not find any rare or severe adverse events reported in the included trials. However, in response to the warning from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2006</LINK>) and European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2006</LINK>) in 2006 on the potential risks of skin cancer and lymphoma associated with pimecrolimus and tacrolimus, further population-based, long-term epidemiological studies are needed to assess rare and severe adverse events of topical immunosuppressants. One study has already emerged which suggests that topical pimecrolimus is not associated with a higher risk of lymphoma, but further long term studies are needed (<LINK REF="REF-Arellano-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arellano 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Our systematic review shows that pimecrolimus is effective when compared against vehicle with short bursts of topical corticosteroids for flare-ups of eczema. However, there is limited evidence on the comparative efficacy, tolerability, and adverse events associated with pimecrolimus compared against existing optimal treatments, such as mild topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus. The clinical role of pimecrolimus is therefore uncertain owing to a lack of relevant comparative data. There is no evidence at present to suggest that pimecrolimus is effective in people who fail to respond to topical corticosteroids. Whilst topical pimecrolimus might have a useful role in treating eczema at sensitive sites such as the face where skin thinning may become a problem, no comparative studies have addressed this issue and demonstrated any advantage over existing therapy. Whilst short-term studies on drug safety are reassuring, more long term studies evaluating the possible risks associated with skin immunosuppression are needed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More vehicle controlled studies are not needed and may even be considered as unethical. Pragmatic randomised controlled trials lasting at least 12 months are needed to compare topical pimecrolimus and 1% hydrocortisone acetate in children and adults with mild to moderate eczema. More trials are needed to see if topical pimecrolimus works in people who fail to respond adequately to topical corticosteroids. Trials are needed that evaluate topical pimecrolimus in sensitive sites such as the face. Outcome data should include clearing capacity, relapse, quality of life, adverse events (including skin thinning), and costs. Although several trials have been undertaken on participants who responded poorly to topical corticosteroids, current evidence is insufficient to support using pimecrolimus as a second line treatment of eczema despite recommendation by the UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>) and the US Food and Drug Administration to use it in such circumstances (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2005</LINK>). Experience of long term use of topical pimecrolimus is limited and the risk of rare but more serious adverse effects remains a concern. Further long term surveillance of these agents is needed (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>AD: atopic dermatitis; IGA: investigators' global assessment; PGA: participants' global assessment; WDs: withdrawals; BID: twice daily; QID: four times daily; QD: once a day; EASI: eczema area and severity index. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores is a method to characterize the extent of eczema. It is generally an indicator for the severity of eczema, such as IGA score, and may also be used to follow up the treatment effect. An EASI score of 15 to 20 indicates approximately a 10% to 15% body involvement of eczema (atopic dermatitis). Mild AD is defined by areas of scaling, papulation, erythema, and lichenification of 5 to 10 cm involving less than 15% total body surface area. Typical areas of involvement would include the wrists, antecubital fossa, knees, popliteal fossa, and ankles.; TS: topical corticosteroids; TBSA: total body surface area; ADSI: Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index, uses a 4-point (0-3) scale for erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation, and lichenification, and calculates the sum of these 5 ratings (range, 0 to 15); RCT: randomised controlled trial; ADEs: adverse drug events; flare-free days: the numbers of days on study without topical corticosteroid use; achieving clear or almost clear AD: IGA score 0-1; 95% CI: 95% confidence interval; DLQI: Dermatology Life Quality Index; QoLI-AD: Quality of Life Index- Atopic Dermatitis; CDLQI: Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index; PIQoL-AD: Parent's Index of Quality of Life- Atopic Dermatitis; PQoL-AD: Parents' Quality of Life Index- Atopic Dermatitis</P>
