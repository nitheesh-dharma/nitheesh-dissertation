<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-01 13:59:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterised by problems with social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviours and limited activities and interests. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of antidepressants that are sometimes given to reduce anxiety or obsessive-compulsive behaviours. We found nine trials, involving 320 people, which evaluated four SSRIs: fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, fenfluramine and citalopram. Five studies included only children and four studies included only adults. One trial enrolled 149 children, but the other trials were much smaller. We found no trials that evaluated sertraline, paroxetine or escitalopram. There is no evidence to support the use of SSRIs to treat autism in children. There is limited evidence, which is not yet sufficiently robust, to suggest effectiveness of SSRIs in adults with autism. Treatment with an SSRI may cause side effects. Decisions about the use of SSRIs for established clinical indications that may co-occur with autism, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression in adults or children, and anxiety in adults, should be made on a case-by-case basis.</P>

<P>Nine RCTs with a total of 320 participants were included. Four SSRIs were evaluated: fluoxetine (three studies), fluvoxamine (two studies), fenfluramine (two studies) and citalopram (two studies). Five studies included only children and four studies included only adults. Varying inclusion criteria were used with regard to diagnostic criteria and intelligence quotient of participants. Eighteen different outcome measures were reported. Although more than one study reported data for Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and obsessive-compulsive behaviour (OCB), different tool types or components of these outcomes were used in each study. As such, data were unsuitable for meta-analysis, except for one outcome (proportion improvement). One large, high-quality study in children showed no evidence of positive effect of citalopram. Three small studies in adults showed positive outcomes for CGI and OCB; one study showed improvements in aggression, and another in anxiety.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-08-07 12:11:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterised by qualitative impairment in social interaction and communication skills, as well as stereotypic behaviours and restricted activities and interests. The term ASD has been used commonly in clinical practice, but was only recently introduced into mainstream disease classification systems with the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-5) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2013</LINK>). ASD encompasses conditions previously classified as Infantile Autism (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1980</LINK>), Autistic Disorder (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) and Classical Autism (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>). Also included within ASD are conditions previously classified as Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), 'other pervasive developmental disorders', 'pervasive developmental disorder, unspecified', Asperger syndrome or Asperger disorder and atypical autism.</P>
<P>Estimates of the prevalence of autism using the DSM-III, DSM-IIIR, DSM-IV or International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnostic classification systems, from published literature up to April 2004, vary between 1 and 40 per 10,000 and for any ASD between 3 and 82 per 10,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2006</LINK>). Publications from 2006 have estimated the prevalence of any ASD at between 1.4 and 212 per 10,000 (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elsabbagh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elsabbagh 2012</LINK>). Males are affected about four times more frequently than females. Problems usually present in early childhood and continue throughout life. Autism places a considerable burden of care on the family and society. Follow-up studies have found that only 3% to 10% of people with autism are able to live independently as adults (<LINK REF="REF-Howlin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Billstedt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Billstedt 2005</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Therapies for autism spectrum disorders (ASD)</HEADING>
<P>The heterogeneous nature of problems seen within the autism spectrum means that it is often difficult to be sure which individuals will benefit from the many available therapies. It is also likely that different timing of therapy in relation to age and onset of problems will change outcomes. Many therapies are invasive, time-consuming and/or expensive and little is known about their potential to cause harm. Pharmacological treatments have been used most commonly as adjuncts to behavioural intervention to target specific symptoms and behaviours. These treatments have been associated with reductions in sleep disturbance, mood disorder, poor attention/concentration and self harm or aggression towards others (<LINK REF="REF-Gringras-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gringras 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</HEADING>
<P>While antidepressants were the most commonly prescribed medications for ASD, and the fastest growing therapeutic class for this indication through the early 2000s (<LINK REF="REF-Aman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oswald-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oswald 2007</LINK>), the trend has changed with recent studies finding neuroleptics (<LINK REF="REF-Mandell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 2010</LINK>) and even stimulants (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 2010</LINK>) being prescribed more often. The prescribing of SSRI drugs to children and adolescents for any indication has been curtailed since the Committee on Safety in Medicines (UK) and the Food and Drug Administration (USA) released safety warnings in 2003 and 2004 respectively, concerning an increased risk of suicide-related behaviours associated with these medications (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nemeroff-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nemeroff 2007</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-08-01 09:03:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Increased rates of platelet serotonin transport and levels of whole blood and platelet serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) have been reported in people with ASD (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1996</LINK>). Serotonin is linked to the mediation of several psychological processes, many of which are altered in ASD, including mood, social interaction, sleep, obsessive-compulsive behaviours and aggression (<LINK REF="REF-Saxena-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saxena 1995</LINK>). It is therefore plausible that inhibition of serotonin reuptake will result in improvement of ASD symptoms.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-08-07 15:06:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several studies have reported improvements following administration of SSRIs. However, the participant numbers are small, especially for children, and serious side effects including increases in maladaptive behaviours, urinary retention and seizures are reported (<LINK REF="REF-Branford-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Branford 1998</LINK>). A recent larger study of children showed no improvement from SSRIs (<LINK REF="STD-King-2009" TYPE="STUDY">King 2009</LINK>). To our knowledge, no drug authority has specifically approved the use of SSRIs for autism. The prescribing of SSRIs for autism is therefore either 'off-label' or is directed to an associated indicated disorder such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or depression.</P>
<P>Regarding indications and prescribing for children, there are between-country variations. The FDA has approved (allowed the marketing of) sertraline in children six years and older, fluoxetine in children seven years and older, and fluvoxamine in children eight years and older, for the treatment of OCD. The FDA has approved fluoxetine in children eight years and older and escitalopram in adolescents 12 to 17 years for the treatment of depression. In the UK, the Commission on Human Medicines (formerly the Committee on Safety of Medicines) contraindicates all antidepressants other than fluoxetine for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. In Australia, fluvoxamine has been given a specific indication of OCD in children eight years and over, while prescribers are urged to exercise caution in prescribing other SSRIs for children under the age of 18 years.</P>
<P>A up-to-date systematic review of SSRIs is required to assess the evidence of efficacy and harm when used to treat ASD. This review is an update ,of a previously published review (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>Three pairs of authors [(i) KW and DW, (ii) KW and NS, or (iii) AB and MR] independently assessed each included study using the risk of bias criteria outlined in chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) without blinding to authorship or source. We compared the assessments for inconsistencies and resolved differences in interpretation by discussion and consensus. We assessed risk of bias according to the following five domains with ratings of low, unclear or high risk of bias.</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation</P>
<P>Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>Low risk - computer-generated random numbers, table of random numbers, coin-tossing or similar.<BR/>High risk - day of week, even/odd clinic record number, clinician judgment, participant preference, laboratory test result such as haemoglobin value, or similar.<BR/>Unclear risk - insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgment.</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment</P>
<P>Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>Low risk - central independent unit, sequentially numbered drug containers or sealed envelopes of identical appearance, or similar. <BR/>High risk - alternation or rotation, date of birth, non-opaque envelopes, open table of random numbers or similar.<BR/>Unclear risk - randomisation stated but no information on method used is available.</P>
<P>3. Blinding</P>
<P>Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?</P>
<P>We assessed blinding of participant and personnel and blinding of outcome assessors. We took into account whether the placebo and medication were similar or different and other information provided in the text, such as whether outcome assessors were aware of side effects or participants correctly identified treatment group when available, as well as whether the trialists specifically commented on blinding.</P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data</P>
<P>Were incomplete data dealt with adequately by the researchers?</P>
<P>Low risk - no missing outcome data, missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals described or similar.<BR/>High risk - reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome or similar.<BR/>Unclear risk - number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals not described.</P>
<P>5.      Selective outcome reporting</P>
<P>Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>Low risk - study protocol is available, published reports include all expected outcomes or similar.<BR/>High risk - not all of the study's prespecified primary outcomes have been reported, one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified or similar.<BR/>Unclear risk - insufficient information to permit judgement.</P>
<P>In our coding approach we acknowledge that assessing 'risk of bias' for this issue is very subjective unless trials are available on trial registers. We therefore code as 'unclear' unless trials register information indicates that risk of bias is low or high.</P>
<P>We also explored any other potential sources of bias, such as stopping the study early or extreme baseline imbalance.</P>

<P>The original review, based on searches till December 2009, included seven studies.</P>
<P>The search for this update was run in 2012. From 83 records identified, we found no new published trials. We found one new trial on ClinicalTrials.gov and the author provided methodological information and data when contacted. The most recent search was run in March 2013 from which we identified a further 33 records including one published trial. Thus, we include a total of nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 320 participants in this update.</P>
<P>Of note, we did not search for fenfluramine directly and it is not registered for use as an antidepressant, but was identified as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in electronic searches. We debated its inclusion and chose to retain the two trials that evaluated it to provide a complete clinical picture. The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine was also identified using this search method and is known to have serotonin uptake inhibitor actions, but was excluded because, unlike fenfluramine, it is included in a systematic review of tricyclic antidepressants and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (<LINK REF="REF-Hurwitz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurwitz 2012</LINK>).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Diagnostic criteria</HEADING>
<P>Of the five trials in children, two used DSM-IV-TR diagnoses of Autistic Disorder, Asperger Disorder or Pervasive Development Disorder - Not Otherwise Specififed (PDD-NOS) (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2009" TYPE="STUDY">King 2009</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-King-2009" TYPE="STUDY">King 2009</LINK>) also required at least moderate severity on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) illness severity scale and a moderate or greater score for compulsive behaviour items of the Children&#8217;s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders (CY-BOCS-PDD). Both of these studies included children with an intelligence quotient (IQ) in the normal range, with one having an IQ range of 30 to 132 (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2005</LINK>) and the other reporting 61% of children with a non-verbal IQ over 70 (<LINK REF="STD-King-2009" TYPE="STUDY">King 2009</LINK>). One study included children "diagnosed with autism" using DSM-IV but did not specify how criteria were applied or provide information about intelligence (<LINK REF="STD-Sugie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sugie 2005</LINK>). Two studies used DSM-III criteria for a diagnosis of autism and included children with intellectual impairment with IQ ranges of 16 to 63 (<LINK REF="STD-Leventhal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Leventhal 1993</LINK>) and 30 to 75 (<LINK REF="STD-Barthelemy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelemy 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the four adult studies, one (<LINK REF="STD-Buchsbaum-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Buchsbaum 2001</LINK>) included adults diagnosed using DSM-IV with autism or Asperger Disorders, and all participants were verbal with an IQ score range of 53 to 119. One study included adults diagnosed with autism using the DSM-III-R and ICD-10 criteria, and individuals included were at least "moderate" in severity using the CGI global severity of illness rating. Both intellectually able and disabled adults were included (<LINK REF="STD-McDougle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDougle 1996</LINK>). A third study included adults diagnosed using DSM-IV-TR with autistic disorder, a score of 70 or more on the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and high levels of repetitive behaviours with scores of eight or higher at baseline on the CYBOCS-PDD (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00609531" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00609531</LINK>). The fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2012</LINK>) included adults diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. Individuals were only included if they scored four or higher on CGI Gobal Severity ratings. There was a wide range of intellectual functioning in the participants although the majority (92%) had a full-scale IQ greater than 70.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Prior treatment rules</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Leventhal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Leventhal 1993</LINK>) included participants who had previously been treated with an SSRI. Trial authors conducted a multi-centre non-randomised trial of 30 weeks duration and then extended this trial with a 32 week cross-over RCT. Thus, there was potential for carry-over effects from initial treatment, which could result in an underestimate of treatment effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Eighteen different standardised outcome measures were used in the nine included trials (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Use of a single outcome measure by more than one study was uncommon, but occurred for the clinical global impression (CGI) and the Child's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive (CY-BOCS) scales, albeit using different scales and subsections of existing scales. Different versions of assessment tools were used to measure similar outcomes. For example for CGI, the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I) and the Clinical Global Improvement Scale Adapted to Global Autism (CGI-AD) were used (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>). Similarly, to measure obsessive-compulsive behaviour, the Children&#8217;s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders (CY-BOCS-PDD) (<LINK REF="REF-Scahill-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scahill 2006</LINK>), the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive scale (CY-BOCS) (<LINK REF="REF-McKay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 2003</LINK>) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsion Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodman-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 1989a</LINK>) and a modified version of it were used. The different versions of the CGI used measure different constructs, as do the different versions and sections of the obsessive-compulsion scales used.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study design</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Parallel study design</HEADING>
<P>Four studies used a parallel design (<LINK REF="STD-McDougle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDougle 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2009" TYPE="STUDY">King 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00609531" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00609531</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2012</LINK>). For these studies there were no statistical or clinical differences at baseline between intervention and placebo groups for important outcome measures, including the CGI-severity score (<LINK REF="STD-King-2009" TYPE="STUDY">King 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2012</LINK>), and the obsessive-compulsive scales used (<LINK REF="STD-McDougle-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McDougle 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00609531" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00609531</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cross-over study design</HEADING>
<P>Four studies used a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Barthelemy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelemy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buchsbaum-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Buchsbaum 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sugie 2005</LINK>). No data were available prior to the second phase. One study of fluoxetine observed a wash-out period of four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2005</LINK>) and another study of fluvoxamine for two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Sugie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sugie 2005</LINK>). Different SSRIs have different recommended wash-out periods, ranging from 15 hours (fluvoxamine) to seven to nine days (fluoxetine). Of the four studies that reported using only cross-over methods, no data was extracted from one because data were only presented for genotypes rather than as treatment-placebo comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Sugie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sugie 2005</LINK>) and one study used paired t-test analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Buchsbaum-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Buchsbaum 2001</LINK>) . Two studies reported comparative analyses using ANOVA (<LINK REF="STD-Barthelemy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelemy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2005</LINK>) and one of these also used mixed regression models for comparative analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Barthelemy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelemy 1989</LINK>). Treatment duration ranged from five to 12 weeks (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Barthelemy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelemy 1989</LINK>) used a shortened placebo period, where participants received placebo for only one month and active treatment for three months. The trial authors adopted this method because of parent concerns with a lengthy non-treatment phase. In all studies, follow-up was short term (12 weeks or less).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Mixed study design</HEADING>
<P>One study had two treatment phases: four weeks placebo, 16 weeks fenfluramine, eight weeks placebo, followed by randomisation of 15 children to a cross-over phase (<LINK REF="STD-Leventhal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Leventhal 1993</LINK>).

<P>Outcome assessors were reported as being blind to treatment allocation in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-McDougle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDougle 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2009" TYPE="STUDY">King 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2012</LINK>) with a fifth study stating that "investigators" were blind (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00609531" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00609531</LINK>). In the remaining four studies it was not possible to ascertain if outcome assessors were blinded. Of these four studies, two stated that participants and treating physicians were blinded but did not report blinding of outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Barthelemy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelemy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buchsbaum-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Buchsbaum 2001</LINK>) and two studies used the term "double blind" to refer to all blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Leventhal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Leventhal 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sugie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sugie 2005</LINK>).

<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-01 11:03:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three studies reported no loss to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Barthelemy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelemy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDougle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McDougle 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buchsbaum-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Buchsbaum 2001</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-King-2009" TYPE="STUDY">King 2009</LINK>) reported that 13 of 76 withdrew from the placebo arm and 13 of 73 withdrew from the treatment arm of the trial. Reasons for withdrawal included adverse events (one serious in the treatment group), protocol violation and consent withdrawal. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Leventhal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Leventhal 1993</LINK>) reported one withdrawal prior to the randomised phase and reported no data from this participant. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sugie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sugie 2005</LINK>) excluded one participant due to non-compliance. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2012</LINK>) screened 48 individuals, with 37 being randomly assigned to placebo or treatment group. Thirty-four participants with postrandomisation data were included in the analysis, including four who dropped out after randomisation but for whom postrandomisation data had been collected. Two of these participants did not comply with the study protocol, one participant discontinued due to relocation and one discontinued due to poor toleration of the treatment. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2005</LINK>) reported that, of 62 participants who consented, 18 were excluded for non-eligibility or non-compliance and 44 were randomised. Of these, 39 participants were included and their completed outcome data were published, three were excluded due to non-compliance, one was excluded due to lack of efficacy and one was lost from analysis due to lost records. The exclusion of a participant due to lack of efficacy creates a risk of bias, as does exclusion of those who were not compliant with therapy. One study that had expected to recruit 40 participants only recruited 12, but there was no loss to follow-up of those recruited (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00609531" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00609531</LINK>).</P>

The authors of this study reported that the use of the composite score was a way of "increasing the threshold for positive response".

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2005</LINK>) used a composite score that included the CGI-AD and a measure of change of repetitive behaviour, based on the CY-BOCS.

Negative values on this measure indicate a reduction in repetitive behaviours at post-test whereas positive scores indicate an increase. This raw change measure was then added to the CGI-AD measure to augment the overall change in autism severity".

Continuous outcomes were compared using paired t-tests and reported for 'baseline' and fluoxetine with no significant change (mean difference -1.00; standard deviation (SD) 1.26). However, it is uncertain whether 'baseline' represents the control phase so these data were unsuitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2012</LINK>) reported a significant difference favouring the treatment group over placebo on the CGI-I postintervention as rated by treating clinicians, with seven out of 20 responders in the treatment group (35%) and no responders out of 12 in the placebo group (P = 0.03). In the ratings by the independent raters on the CGI-I improvement was numerically greater in the treatment group (30% versus 0%) compared to placebo group (P = 0.07). The latter data were included in the meta-analysis, because clinician ratings were prone to unmasking as they were also making dosage changes and gathering side effect information.</P>

<P>People with ASD are a heterogeneous group. Studies included in this review included children and adults covering a wide age range, diagnosed using different classification systems and assessment procedures, and with different levels of intellectual ability and problem severity. Despite these differences, there is consistency of findings for the studies conducted in children and for those conducted in adults. There is no evidence of benefit for children, based on one large study of citalopram with low risk of bias and from four smaller studies. In adults, only evidence from small studies with unclear risk of bias is available to date, which report significant improvements in clinical global impression (fluvoxamine and fluoxetine), obsessive-compulsive behaviours (fluvoxamine), anxiety (fluoxetine) and aggression (fluvoxamine).</P>
<P>Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may cause various adverse effects. One study reported significantly more adverse events in children on citalopram compared to placebo and one serious adverse event, a prolonged seizure (<LINK REF="STD-King-2009" TYPE="STUDY">King 2009</LINK>). Both studies of fenfluramine reported adverse effects in children, including withdrawal and sadness that prompted dosage changes (<LINK REF="STD-Barthelemy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelemy 1989</LINK>), and weight loss (<LINK REF="STD-Barthelemy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Barthelemy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leventhal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Leventhal 1993</LINK>). With monitoring, dose adjustment and time, all but one of these adverse effects were resolved. No significant differences were reported for side effects in children in the treatment or placebo group for fluoxetine (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2005</LINK>) and little information was available for side effects in children in the fluvoxamine study (<LINK REF="STD-Sugie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sugie 2005</LINK>). The adult studies (fluvoxamine and fluoxetine) reported that treatment was generally well tolerated.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-08-01 11:52:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To date, only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) each for fluvoxamine and citalopram, and two RCTs for fluoxetine are available for adults. In children, one trial each of fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and citalopram is available and two trials of fenfluramine. Most trials were small and there was considerable variation in type and severity of autism and participant intelligence quotient (IQ) between studies. As such, this evidence is not complete and applicability needs to be assessed for each study individually.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-08-07 01:01:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review again highlights problems with trial methods found in systematic reviews of other treatments for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (<LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2011</LINK>; <A HREF="https://webmail.sesiahs.health.nsw.gov.au/exchange/wheelerda/inbox/local%20settings/temporary%20internet%20files/olk37/selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitors%20for%20the%20treatment%20of%20autism%20spectrum%20disordersv2.htm#ref-williams-2005#ref-williams-2005">Williams 2005</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Jesner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jesner 2007</LINK>). Variations in the clinical profile of ASD trial participants, such as the age of participants, their IQ, the severity of their problems and whether they have the problems that the treatment is suggested to ameliorate, are likely to lead to differences in treatment effectiveness. It is not yet known whether these factors influence the effectiveness of a treatment under investigation independently or as inter-related factors. It is also possible that some measures are suitable for measuring change in participants of some ages and not others, or that they accurately measure an outcome for individuals with one severity of ASD or IQ but not for others. This means that meaningful interpretation of the variations in reported outcomes from the studies included in this review is not straightforward.</P>
<P>This review details the findings of nine RCTs. Two trials each evaluated the effectiveness of fenfluramine and fluvoxamine and citalopram. Three trials have evaluated the effectiveness of fluoxetine. In one multicentre study the sample size was over 100, but the next largest study recruited 39 participants. Small sample sizes increase the likelihood of type II error, that is, that no significant change will be found where one exists. Meta-analysis can address this where sufficient studies use the same outcome measures, but could only used for one outcome in this review. Exacerbating the above problem of small individual trial sample size and the ability to use meta-analyses to overcome this, is the use of a variety of outcome measures. Eighteen different outcome measures were used in studies contributing to this review and variations of measures generated for the same outcome (different tool or different items from a given tool) also occurred.</P>
<P>A further concern with outcome measures is their sensitivity to change, and what magnitude of change individuals and families would perceive as sufficient to warrant therapy. Behavioural outcomes such as sleep disturbance, self mutilation, attention and concentration problems, and gastrointestinal function were not assessed by any of the trials, nor was quality of life. Consumer involvement in outcome measure selection is important to both generate data that are meaningful to those who use them and to facilitate practice change if clear evidence of effectiveness (or a lack of effectiveness) is found.</P>
<P>All studies reported outcomes until trial completion, (maximum duration 12 weeks), with the exception of weight loss, which was monitored for longer in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Leventhal-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Leventhal 1993</LINK>). The lack of medium- and long-term follow-up remains a characteristic problem of trials in ASD.</P>
<P>Other SSRIs are used in clinical practice to treat problems associated with ASD. Our review identified no RCTs of sertraline, paroxetine or escitalopram.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-07 01:38:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-08-07 01:38:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective as a treatment for children with autism. In fact, there is emerging evidence that they are not effective and can cause harm. </P>
<P>For adults, small positive effects have been seen with fewer side effects reported with fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, but the possible risk of bias and small sample size of the trials mean there is not strong evidence to support these treatments. A small study of citalopram in adults with high levels of repetitive behaviours has shown no positive effects.</P>
<P>Decisions about the use of SSRIs for established clinical indications that may co-occur with autism, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression, and anxiety (in the case of adults), should be made on a case-by-case basis.</P>
<P>Not all the SSRIs currently in use have been subject to controlled trials for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). As ASD causes substantial impairment, parents of children with the condition are motivated to try treatments regardless of the evidence. Nevertheless, it is important that prescribing clinicians are explicit with parents and patients about the limited evidence, discuss the risks of treatment, and discuss other pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-01 12:08:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present review has highlighted the significant challenges in researching outcomes in the pharmacological treatment of autism. However, high-quality studies are feasible if adequately resourced, as demonstrated by the <LINK REF="STD-King-2009" TYPE="STUDY">King 2009</LINK> trial of citalopram reported in this review, and the trial of the unrelated compound risperidone (<LINK REF="REF-McCracken-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCracken 2002</LINK>), presented in another review (<LINK REF="REF-Jesner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jesner 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In our opinion, knowledge about the effectiveness and safety of SSRIs for childhood autism would be best served in the first instance by a replication of the citalopram study, which will either confirm or refute the absence of effect on core symptoms. For completeness, an adequately-powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) should be conducted on at least one other SSRI. We would recommend fluoxetine owing to its favourable safety profile. We are aware of one such study that reached primary study completion in 2009 (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00515320" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00515320</LINK>) and another (<LINK REF="STD-ACTRN12608000173392" TYPE="STUDY">ACTRN12608000173392</LINK>) that began in 2010 and is still recruiting. Another study assessing feasibility and safety in preschool children was due to be completed in 2008 (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00183339" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00183339</LINK>). Sufficiently large trials would permit the examination of subgroup differences in responsiveness to SSRIs. Comparisons of interest include pre-puberty versus puberty, and low IQ versus normal IQ.  </P>
<P>Knowledge about the effectiveness and safety of SSRIs for adult autism would be best served by the conduct of at least one adequately powered RCT of a commonly prescribed drug such as fluoxetine.</P>
<P>Comparison between trials in all age groups would be aided by the use of a core battery of standard outcome measures. As a minimum we recommend a measure of global functioning (for example, CGI); a measure of repetitive and stereotyped behaviours (for example, Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised); a measure of disruptive behaviour (for example, Aberrant Behavior Checklist), and a measure of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (for example, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale).</P>
<P>If short-term benefit is established in acute trials in the future for one or more key clinical outcomes, then sustained benefit could be explored through the use of a relapse prevention trial conducted over 12 to 18 months. This is relevant as treatments directed to autism tend to be long-term. A relapse prevention trial also affords the opportunity to obtain systematic adverse event data over a longer period.</P>

<P>Where standardised assessment tools generate a score as the outcome measure, we plan to compare the means of these scores and calculate a mean difference for inclusion in meta-analysis, from data available from trial authors or calculated using methods outlined in Chapters 7 and 9 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>We will assess all included trials to determine the unit of randomisation and whether or not this unit of randomisation was consistent with the unit of analysis.
