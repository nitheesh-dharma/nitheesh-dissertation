<P>Cognitive-behavioural interventions have been shown to be effective for reducing behavioural problems in children, but access to these treatments is limited by factors including the availability of therapists, time and expense. Providing the information required to manage these problems in booklet or other media-based format such as DVDs, cassettes or computer programmes, would reduce the cost and increase access to these interventions. In general, this review found that media-based therapies for behavioural disorders in children had a moderate effect versus no-treatment and as an adjunct to medication.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-11 12:31:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<P>Many approaches are used to address behavioural problems in childhood including medication or, more usually, psychological treatments either directly with the child and/or his/her family. Behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions have been shown to be effective but access to these treatments is limited due to factors such as time and expense. Presenting the information parents need in order to manage these behaviour problems in booklet or other media-based format might reduce the cost and increase access to these interventions.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the effects of media-based cognitive-behavioural therapies for any young person with a behavioural disorder (diagnosed using a recognised instrument) compared to standard care and no-treatment controls.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-11 12:32:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<P>We searched: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2005), EMBASE (1980 to August 2005), PsycINFO (1887 to August 2005), CINAHL (1982 to August 2005), Biosis (1985 to August 2005) and Sociofile (1974 to August 2005). Bibliographies of all selected trials were checked and experts in the field were contacted for additional information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (e.g. trials which used sequential randomisation) of media-based behavioural treatments for behaviour problems in children.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Abstracts and titles of studies identified from searches of electronic databases were read to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria. Full copies of those possibly meeting these criteria from electronic or other searches were assessed by the reviewers and queries were resolved by discussion. Data were analysed using RevMan 4.2.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eleven studies including 943 participants were included within this review. In general, media-based therapies for behavioural disorders in children had a moderate, if variable, effect when compared with both no-treatment controls with effects sizes ranging from -0.12 (-1.65, 1.41) to -32.60 (-49.93, -15.27) and as and adjunct to medication with effect sizes ranging from -2.71 (-5.86, -0.44) to -39.55 (-75.01, -4.09). Significant improvements were made with the addition of up to two hours of therapist time.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>These formats of delivering behavioural interventions for carers of children are worth considering in clinical practice. Media-based interventions may, in some cases, be enough to make clinically significant changes in a child's behaviour, and may reduce the amount of time primary care workers have to devote to each case. They can also be used as the first stage of a stepped care approach. Consequently this would increase the number of families who could possibly benefit from these types of intervention, releasing clinician time that can be reallocated to more complex cases. Media-based therapies would therefore appear to have both clinical and economic implications as regards the treatment of children with behavioural problems.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:00:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:59:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>A number of investigators have suggested that many adult behaviour problems have their origins in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Fischer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patterson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 1992</LINK>). Approximately 10 to 15% of pre-school children have mild to moderate behavioural problems (<LINK REF="REF-Cornely-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornely 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koot-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koot 1991</LINK>) and a growing body of prospective evidence indicates that these problems may persist. In addition, for children ages 7-16, the prevalence rate of borderline or clinical cases of oppositional defiant disorder was 9.3% and of conduct disorder was 6.8% in a sample of 1,641 children, based on parent report on the Child Behavior Checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Achenbach-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achenbach 2003</LINK>). Data from a number of countries collected in different ways show similar rates in the stability of problems over many years (<LINK REF="REF-Bear-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bear 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGee-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGee 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richman-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richman 1982</LINK>). These data indicate that there is a high probability (approximately 50%) that children manifesting behavioural problems at age three or four will continue to have difficulties into adolescence. For example, one study showed that the combination of five variables (parent reports of behaviour problems in children aged five, mother's report of difficulty with the child as an infant, research staff reports of externalising problems, and two motor variables) predicted antisocial diagnoses in 81% of children at age 11, and, to a lesser extent, delinquency in 66% of adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-White-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The importance of behaviour problems (such as sleep problems and conduct disorder) and their significance in long-term difficulties have become a key area of study (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1995</LINK>). Investigations of child behaviour problems have included ratings of internalising behaviours such as anxiety, sadness, social withdrawal and fearfulness, and externalising behaviours such as over-activity, poor impulse control, non-compliance, aggression towards peers and tantrums. In general, studies indicate that parents and teachers express concerns about management difficulties, over-activity, inattention and relationships with siblings and peers (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Earls-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Earls 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richman-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richman 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stallard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stallard 1993</LINK>). Several approaches have been used to treat children with these problems including pharmacological approaches such as methylphenidate (for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder), systemic psychological methods such as family therapy, and individual therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and Kleinian psychotherapy. Of the approaches evaluated, behavioural treatments have been shown to be highly effective in a range of child behaviour problems (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1998b</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:31:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Behavioural treatments typically take the form of parent training when children are living at home with parents or caregivers and are not in residential treatment. Parent training interventions delivered individually or in groups by a therapist have frequently been found to improve children's behaviour and prevent future conduct problems (<LINK REF="REF-Nixon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nixon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Serketich-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serketich 1996</LINK>). However, like many therapeutic interventions, they are costly in terms of resources, particularly therapist time. Media-based CBT is another way of delivering treatment for children with behavioural disorders. Media-based therapy provides information and advice to parents through a range of media, such as audiotape, book, computer programme, leaflet, manual, videotape, website or some combination of these. The information and advice is designed:</P>
<OL>
<LI>to enable the parent or carer better to understand the problem; and</LI>
<LI>to deliver an appropriate programme of intervention (in this case cognitive behavioural), largely independently of a helping professional. In general, most self-help therapy is in written form (bibliotherapy) and over the last three decades there has been an increase in this field both as an adjunct to standard psychological treatment and for purchase in bookshops. Media-based behaviour therapy, if effective, could be a useful low-cost option or adjunct to conventional treatments. In countries facing problems with the cost, accessibility and delivery of health care (<LINK REF="REF-Ham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ham 1997</LINK>), media-based therapies, if effective, could be a useful, low-cost option or adjunct to conventional treatment, providing no other problems prevented this, for example those of literacy or technology.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In 1989, the American Psychological Association estimated that over 2000 self-help books are published each year. Evaluation of the effectiveness of media-based therapies in general is, however, limited, and largely focussed on adults. In a 1993 meta-analysis, it was reported that media-based self-help treatments could be effective for adult mental health problems below the clinical threshold (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 1993</LINK>). This finding was further supported by <LINK REF="REF-Marrs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrs 1995</LINK>. However, the inclusion criteria in the review permitted the assessment of low-grade evidence.</P>
<P>When defining media-based interventions, the level of therapist contact and type of behavioural problem are key issues (<LINK REF="REF-Marrs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrs 1995</LINK>). Further complexity is added to the problems of testing and evaluating treatments when they are mediated through third parties, e.g. parents or carers. A meta-analysis looking at self-directed treatments in adults found that bibliotherapy was less effective in dealing with problems that required delayed gratification than treatments aiming to have immediate impact (<LINK REF="REF-Marrs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrs 1995</LINK>). This might be because of a lack of ongoing support which would be a feature of most face-to-face forms of therapy. It may, therefore, be hypothesised that behavioural treatments for child behaviour problems, where success is not likely to be immediate, may be less effective than, for example, treatments to reduce generalised anxiety disorder. For instance, a behavioural programme to address a child's tantrums may well involve a parent having to correct the child's behaviour many times over a period of days or weeks as the child learns acceptable behaviours. For reasons such as the effects of intermittent schedules of reinforcement, behaviour may well deteriorate before improvement occurs. Face-to-face therapy may provide the parents with considerable support and this may perhaps enhance its effectiveness. Media-based treatments offer little or no such support and, in order to test the efficacy of the media-based delivery alone, minimal contact is defined as being less than two hours contact time; more than this might be considered a form of 'Brief Therapy'.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:00:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Maintenance of treatment gains over time is a major concern in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Marrs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrs 1995</LINK>). In keeping with other studies of the effectiveness of CBT it is hypothesised that there will be some erosion of therapeutic effect at follow- up (<LINK REF="REF-Price-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 2000</LINK>). Some media-based therapies are initiated and monitored by therapists who have varying amounts of contact with parents, either face-to-face or via telephone contact. It is possible that such therapist contact may enhance the effectiveness of media-based therapies (see <LINK REF="REF-Scogin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scogin 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Gould-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 1993</LINK>). Such contact may provide a source of explanation and clarification, it may enhance efficacy expectations, it may enhance compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Glasgow-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasgow 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marrs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrs 1995</LINK>), or it may provide a motivating factor if parents know they are expected to 'report back' on progress. The evidence, however, is not unequivocal (see <LINK REF="REF-Marrs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrs 1995</LINK>) and most is concerned with self-help therapies. This review therefore explores the effectiveness of media-based therapies with or without such contact and examines the effect of varying amounts of therapist contact. However, this review asks the pragmatic, real world question, how well does media-based behavioural therapy work for carers who are trying to manage children with behaviour difficulties? It does not ask how well this intervention can work under ideal circumstances.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:22:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were: <BR/>- randomised controlled trials in which participants were randomly allocated to an intervention group and a control group or comparison treatment group; <BR/>- quasi-randomised controlled trials where, for example participants were randomised following a sequential assignment</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The parent(s) or carer(s) of any young person, adolescent or child, as defined by the trialist, with a behavioural problem (as measured using a psychometrically sound assessment tool).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Only interventions of a behavioural or cognitive behavioural nature were included within the review. Media-based behavioural therapy can also be known as 'bibliotherapy', 'manual', 'videotape', and 'minimal contact' therapy. For the purpose of this review, media-based therapy could be delivered via audiotape, book, computer (including Internet) manual, videotape, or some combination. This review is confined to media-based therapy if it was used by an individual parent or primary carer, largely independent of a helping professional,for the purpose of gaining understanding or solving problems relevant to the young person's therapeutic needs. </P>
<P>The comparison group could be a no-treatment group, a waiting-list group or a standard treatment group. Standard treatment is the 'normal' care given to those children suffering from behavioural disorders in the area concerned. This was usually a series of face-to-face therapy sessions delivered by a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist or social worker.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:22:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Initial searches for all database searching were done in September 2000; searches for this update were run in December 2003, and again in August 2005. The following electronic databases were systematically searched: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2005), EMBASE (1980 to August 2005), PsycINFO (1887 to August 2005), CINAHL (1982 to August 2005), Biosis (1985 to August 2005) and Sociofile (1974 to August 2005). The reference lists of all relevant papers were checked for additional studies and the authors of studies initially selected for inclusion were contacted.</P>
<P>The search strategy in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> was used to search CENTRAL. It was modified where necessary to search the other databases. An RCT filter was also used where necessary. No language restrictions were applied.<BR/>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:13:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>All reports of studies identified as above were inspected by two authors (PM and JD) for the initial version of this review, and by two authors (GB and JD) for the update. Where there was doubt about the possible relevance of the study this was resolved by the acquisition of the paper. Once the full articles were obtained, authors decided whether they met the criteria for inclusion and achieved consensus. No author was blinded to the names of the investigators, institutions or journals of publication of potentially relevant studies.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-11-11 11:26:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Data were extracted by the authors using a data extraction sheet. This covered methods, participants, interventions and outcomes. Where it was not possible to extract data because they were not available or further information was needed, attempts were made to contact primary investigators for clarification. There was a critical appraisal of all included studies which considered the following questions:<BR/>1. Was the assignment to treatment groups really random?<BR/>2. Was allocation adequately concealed?<BR/>3. How complete was follow up?<BR/>4. How were the outcomes of people who withdrew considered? Were they included in the analysis?<BR/>5. Were those assessing outcomes blind to the treatment allocation?<BR/>Available data are presented in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table and in the '<LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>s' (below).</P>

<P>Tests for homogeneity: The reviewer checked whether the differences among results of trials were greater than could be expected by chance alone. This was done by not only by looking at the graphical display of the results but also by using tests of homogeneity e.g. I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). This test yields the percentage of the variability that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance, and a percentage higher than 50 is considered substantially heterogenous (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>At present, too few studies concerning similar behavioural problems have been identified to make the construction of funnel plots informative. In future, if sufficient studies are found, these will be drawn. It may be that asymmetry in the funnel plot could be due to publication bias, but could also be due to a relationship between trial size and effect size. In the event that a relationship is found, clinical diversity of the studies will also be examined (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>In all cases the data were entered into RevMan 4.2 in such a way that the area to the left of the 'line of no effect' indicated a favourable outcome for media-based treatment. The review brings together a diverse collection of studies with regard to range of problems and type of media. As more studies become available, they may need to be divided and analysed according to type of problem. Different approaches e.g. video, booklet and website were analysed together and will continue to be so analysed unless evidence of heterogeneity of effect becomes apparent.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">History of searches</HEADING>
<P>The current version of this review contains eleven included studies (n =943), five of which were added since the original (2001) version of this review.</P>
<P>1089 citations were found using the search strategy at the protocol stage of the original review (1999-2000). Of these, 40 qualified for further inspection and of these, eight fulfilled the initial inclusion criteria. Searches were re-run in December 2003 and a further 791 citations located. Of these, 14 merited further inspection and two met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1999</LINK>) and (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK>), but only the latter presented data suitable for meta-analysis. We are in correspondence with the authors of the older paper in order to obtain data for a media-based arm of the reported trial separately from that reported from a therapist-delivered arm of the same trial.</P>
<P>A new Cochrane review was published (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004</LINK>) which focussed entirely on educational (including media-based) interventions for enuresis. It was decided to exclude this topic from the scope of this review, resulting in the removal of two studies from the original version (Houts and Van Londen).</P>
<P>Searches were again run in August 2005 and a further trial 1475 citations were located, of which 16 merited further inspection. Of these, only a single unpublished PhD dissertation (<LINK REF="STD-Illsley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Illsley 2003</LINK>) was suitable for inclusion and we have also included two unpublished reports of randomised controlled trials that were given to us by one of the authors (<LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005b</LINK>), so that the total number of included studies is now eleven. Specific details of each study are reported in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table (where, for multiple intervention trials, an asterisk (*) indicates which intervention has been used for comparison and "therapist time" is abbreviated to "TT".</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Setting of studies</HEADING>
<P>Studies included within this review span four decades (1977- 2004). Four studies were conducted in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Long-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Long 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1988" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1990</LINK>);one in New Zealand (<LINK REF="STD-Seymour-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 1989</LINK>), four in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK>), one in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Illsley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Illsley 2003</LINK>) and one in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of participants</HEADING>
<P>Two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1977</LINK>) and (<LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 2004</LINK>) involved learning-disabled (mentally retarded) children, the former looking at self-help skills and the latter at sleep problems. Seven studies included children with conduct problems (<LINK REF="STD-Illsley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Illsley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1988" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1990</LINK>). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Long-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Long 1993</LINK> had participants whose children had been prescribed methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The final study focused on sleep problems in children (<LINK REF="STD-Seymour-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 1989</LINK>). Children included within all studies ranged from ages two to fourteen.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Media-based approaches used</HEADING>
<P>There was little variation in the media-based approaches used within the included studies. Written information to convey behavioural skills to parents was the most frequently used method (as in <LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Long-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Long 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seymour-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 1989</LINK>). Webster-Stratton's studies (<LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1988" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1990</LINK>) all used video modelling of behavioural techniques and <LINK REF="STD-Illsley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Illsley 2003</LINK> used Webster-Stratton's videos in the media-based treatment conditions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures and follow-up times</HEADING>
<P>Predictably, studies varied considerably in their chosen outcomes, as would be expected in so broad a review. Studies investigating conduct problems used a variety of validated measures including the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (<LINK REF="REF-Achenbach-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achenbach 1991</LINK>), the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) (<LINK REF="REF-Eyberg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eyberg 1999</LINK>), the Behar Preschool Behaviour Questionnaire - Teacher Report (BPBQ - T) (<LINK REF="REF-Behar-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behar 1977</LINK>) and/or the Parent Daily Report (PDR) (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1987</LINK>), (<LINK REF="STD-Illsley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Illsley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1988" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1990</LINK>), which were used in this review as primary outcome measures. One study investigating a media-based intervention and medication versus medication-only for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder utilised the ECBI, the Conners Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Conners-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 1982</LINK>), the Home Situations Questionnaire (HSQ) (<LINK REF="REF-Barkley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkley 1987</LINK>), and the Behavior Rating Profile - Teacher Rating Scale (BRP-T) (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1983</LINK>). Both sleep studies employed specific measures relating to the number of nights children experienced no problem symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seymour-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 1989</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1977</LINK> considered economic outcomes. Follow-up data suitable for meta-analysis are obviously limited in the case of all trials in which a wait-list control group was part of the original research design as those participants received treatment at post-treatment; the longest period (one year) is reported in <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK>. Measures used in the included studies to assess outcomes not relevant to this review were not considered.</P>

<P>Overall, media-based interventions for child behaviour problems seem to be moderately effective for reducing behavioural problems in children compared to no treatment. The data for 'added value' (when media-based interventions are added to medication and compared to medication alone) are less conclusive (<LINK REF="STD-Long-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Long 1993</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1977</LINK> considered learning-disabled children and the efficacy of media-based behavioural treatments. It reported the relative effectiveness of manuals versus control and many other training formats (e.g. manual plus telephone support, manual plus group sessions and home visits), particularly in terms of the children's gain in self-help skills. This study also reported that the manuals-only condition was equal or marginally superior to the more expensive formats in this area, although the author does not report a formal statistical test to demonstrate this. Heifetz reported data pertaining to cost of conditions (the most expensive condition being 5.6 times more costly than the cheapest (manuals only) condition. Overall, the children in the 'manuals-alone' arm of this study gained 1.78 times more self-help skills than control children according the measurements on the Behavioral Assessment Scales (<LINK REF="REF-Heber-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heber 1961</LINK>) during the 20-week treatment period.

It is striking with this measure that in <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK> (just as for the results of the meta-analysis reported above for the ECBI and the CBCL) fathers consistently view their children's behaviour as having improved less than mothers (WMD -0.12 (95% CI -1.65, 1.41; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>), N=61 treatment, 71 controls).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Long-term follow up</HEADING>
<P>Five trialists looked at maintenance beyond the initial treatment period, however meta-analyses of these outcomes were not possible because all studies utilised waiting list control groups that began treatment at some point before follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1989</LINK> showed that media-based treatments with and without therapist support was maintained at 12 months. The results of the three treatment groups she studied all remained stable over this time period including those families who received no therapist input. Indeed there was further improvement in many measures over time. <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK> found that at one-year follow-up there were no changes on parent report measures of child behaviour from post-treatment, nor were there changes in independent observations of child behaviours in the enhanced behavioural family intervention or the standard behavioural family intervention, indicating that outcomes did not either decline or improve after post-treatment. However, they did find significant improvements in child behaviours from independent observations from post-treatment to one-year follow-up in the self-directed behavioural family intervention condition (p&lt;.01). In addition, <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005a</LINK> found that although there were no changes from post-treatment to six-month follow up on mothers' reports of child behaviour in the enhanced self-directed intervention group, there were significant improvements in that time period for the self-directed intervention group (p&lt;.05). <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005b</LINK> did not find any significant differences between measures at post-treatment and six-month follow-up, and <LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 2004</LINK> showed no significant erosion of effect at their six-month follow up.</P>
<P>Data from <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1999</LINK> cannot currently be used for meta-analysis as they have been published in forms where data from non-equivalent intervention groups (therapist- and self-directed interventions) have been combined, and follow-up data were not analysed due to 'poor sample retention to this phase' (p 10). Overall, the investigators reported that 2-group repeated measure MANOVAs indicated 'statistically significant phase effects... [but] there were no significant main effects for condition and no condition by phase interactions. In light of this lack of group differences, data from families receiving either therapist-directed or self-directed interventions were combined into a single 'active intervention' group for the remaining analyses.' The means and standard deviations were not reported for the separate treatment groups and investigators have not yet responded to requests for data for the self-directed intervention alone. Percentages of children who remained in the clinical range following treatment (whether by therapist or self-directed) were reported and statistically significant differences were reported between treated and wait-list control groups on all outcomes (including CBCL and ECBI) with one exception: the Parent Daily Report (PDR).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Long-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Long 1993</LINK> looked at the additional benefit of providing a booklet containing behavioural advice on management to parents whose children had been prescribed methylphenidate for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder as compared to methylphenidate only. At post-treatment the group with written information added to pharmacological treatment showed significant improvement on measures of the intensity of behavioural problems in the home as measured by the ECBI Intensity subscale (WMD -39.55 (95% CI = -75.01, -4.09; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), N=13 treatment, 9 controls) and the HSQ Intensity subscale (WMD -25.74 (95% CI = -47.84, -3.64; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>)).

However, there were no significant differences in the frequency of behavioural problems as measured by the ECBI Problem subscale (WMD -8.68 (95% CI = -17.25, -0.11; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>)) ; the HSQ frequency subscale (WMD -2.71 (95% CI = -5.86, 0.44; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>)) or the 'Hyperactivity Index' of the CPRS (WMD -4.87 (95% CI = -11.01, 1.27; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>)) - which is to say that the children's oppositional behaviours in the home continued but that the intensity of these problems was reduced in the group that received this form of media-based treatment (booklet). However, in a study as small as this and with seven outcome measures of which only three demonstrated significant differences, no strong conclusions should be drawn.</P>

<P>As <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1995</LINK> has suggested, the efficacy of behavioural interventions with child behaviour problems is often reported to be good. Overall, the interventions were found to have a moderate effect, ranging quite widely, with the most consistently strong effects appearing in mothers' reports of child behaviour. It is important to note that most of the trials in this review utilised interventions designed by Webster-Stratton or interventions from the Triple-P Positive Parenting Programme and that parenting programmes from both research groups have a strong evidence base.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1977</LINK> provided successive increments in professional assistance to the following groups: (1) parents provided with manuals-only; (2) those given manuals and telephone support; (3) those with manuals and group support; and (4) those with manuals, group support and visits. In none of these groups did the increasing amount of assistance prove consistently more effective. In fact the manuals and telephone condition was in some areas less effective than the manuals-only group. This was thought to be because, on the telephone, the participants focused on specific and present-day problems whereas the other groups all had a more general approach. This manuals and telephone condition was the only intervention with one-to-one contact and this may, in fact, have created dependence on the consultant answering questions rather than the parents concentrating on using the manual to resolve general problems. This was the only study which included information on financial benefits of these interventions. Additional groups in his study compared a manual with other groups which had increased amounts of personal support. He expressed these costs-per-family as a ratio of the cost of the training manual he used. His 'Manuals plus Telephone' condition cost two times as much as the manuals alone, the 'Manuals and Groups' condition was 3.1 times more expensive, and the 'Manuals, Groups and Visits' condition was 5.6 times as expensive (see table of included studies). In <LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 2004</LINK>, it was found that health visitors reported spending an average of six hours per week on child sleep problems and it has been estimated that two-thirds of these cases would respond to a booklet costing under 1 (one GBP).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK> similarly delivered interventions with increasing intensity: (1) wait-list control group; (2) self-directed behavioural family intervention; (3) standard behavioural family intervention; and (4) enhanced behavioural family intervention. However, this study showed outcomes that corresponded more reliably with the level of intervention. The results showed that, at post-treatment, parents in the enhanced and standard intervention conditions reported significantly greater improvements in their children's behaviour than parents in the waiting list condition (p&lt;.001). Parents in the self-directed intervention condition also reported greater improvements in their children's behaviour as compared to the waiting list condition, but the level of significance was lower (p&lt;.05). At one-year follow-up, the results indicated that all treatment groups had maintained improvement in child behaviour problems and independent observations showed that children in the self-directed intervention condition had significantly improved behaviour since post-treatment. <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005a</LINK> also compared interventions with increasing therapist involvement: (1) wait-list control group; (2) self-directed behavioural family intervention; and (3) enhanced self-directed behavioural family intervention (with weekly telephone consultation). The results of this study showed that at post-treatment parents in the enhanced self-directed condition reported significantly lower levels of child behaviour problems than parents in the self-directed condition on the ECBI, and that parents in the self-directed condition reported significantly lower levels of child behaviour problems than parents in the wait-list control group. Parents in both treatment conditions reported significantly fewer disruptive behaviours on the PDR than parents in the wait-list control group at post-treatment. At six-month follow-up, the results were similar to those in <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK> in that outcomes were maintained from post-treatment for children in the enhanced self-directed intervention group, but there was additional improvement in the self-directed intervention group, according to parent report on the ECBI. These studies provide valuable information about the relative effectiveness of interventions of increasing intensity and show that added therapist input can yield greater reductions in child behaviour problems than self-directed interventions alone, but that self-directed interventions seem to have further impact in the long term. <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005b</LINK> compared a self-directed behavioural family intervention with a wait-list control group and found that parents in the self-directed intervention condition reported significantly greater improvement in child behaviour problems than parents in the wait-list control group on both the ECBI and the PDR. There were no significant differences in child behaviour from post-treatment to six-month follow-up in the treatment group, indicating no decline or additional improvement in the long term.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">The Incredible Years (WebsterStratton 1988; WebsterStratton 1990)</HEADING>
<P>All studies by Webster-Stratton used videotape examples whereby parents were shown models of appropriate strategies to use with their child. These videotapes were individually administered or delivered with group discussions compared with group discussions only, and a no-treatment control group. A detailed analysis of this work showed that all three active treatment groups reported significantly fewer child behaviour problems, more pro-social behaviours and less physical punishment compared with the control group. There were few differences between the three groups. Those differences that were evident favoured the discussion group in which the videotape was also used. One year post-treatment, when 93% of families were assessed on the basis of teacher and parent reports as well as home observations, all the significant improvements reported immediately post-treatment were maintained. <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1988" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1988</LINK> showed that adding group discussion to a videotape improved child behaviour on some measures. The parents reported greater improvements than did the teachers, who may be considered to be more independent as raters; however, the importance of parental report should not be underplayed. The group with no therapist support required half the time commitment from the parents (one hour per week compared with two hours for the group discussion group) and is likely to be less expensive. When two individual hours of therapist time were added to media-based treatments, as in the <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1990</LINK> study, outcome measured by parental report was unchanged. However, results from independent observations showed that children receiving the extra support showed significantly fewer deviant behaviours (M=24.14, SD=11.5) than children in the videotape-only condition (M=38.0, SD=24.5, p&lt;0.05) when observed interacting with their mothers.</P>

However, in view of the prevalence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder that <LINK REF="STD-Long-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Long 1993</LINK> considered, it is promising to see that the addition of a media-based intervention might improve outcomes for children taking medication. More research is needed to explore this further.</P>

<P>There were no significant differences between the treatment conditions on either child behaviour or child social skills <LINK REF="STD-Illsley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Illsley 2003</LINK>. The authors reported that significant differences were found for all three interventions in child behaviour and child social skills from pretest to posttest, although without a no-treatment control condition with which to compare these outcomes, it is not known how much change was due to the passage of time alone. Other studies have included this comparison; however, those studies were used to address the primary question of whether media-based interventions are effective compared to no treatment. Therefore, those data (for the media-based arm of the studies) cannot be used again for this comparison.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Generalisability</HEADING>
<P>This section will consider the extent to which the results of the review may be generalised to use in practice. Relevant to this matter are the clinical significance of the statistical effects, participation rates in the studies, the methods of recruitment, the quality of the materials used in each study and the economic implications that follow from these types of interventions. In view of the variety of child behaviour problems contained in this review as well as the differing approaches to addressing them with a media-based behavioural approach, this discussion will firstly consider issues that seem common to the entire review. Secondly issues relevant to the individual comparisons will follow.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clinical Significance</HEADING>
<P>Conclusions about the effectiveness of an intervention are often drawn from results, such as those in this review, that show a statistically significant effect of treatment for child behaviour problems, but not necessarily a clinically significant effect. The amount of change as an effect of treatment might be enough to produce a statistical difference but it might not mean that individual children have improved enough to be noticed by parents or clinicians. Few researchers addressed this issue in their studies, however four trials in this review did explore the clinical significance of their findings and comparisons were made between media-based treatments and other interventions for three of these studies. These analyses showed that, according to the ECBI, significantly more participants reliably improved after using self-directed interventions than those who received no treatment, and that these outcomes were maintained at follow-up. The results also indicated that not all participants showed clinically significant improvement and in some cases only approximately one-third of participants reliably improved.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1990</LINK> mentioned that 'approximately two-thirds of parents reported their children as having CBCL scores in the normal range' after treatment in the self-administered videotape intervention condition (p. 488). <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK> examined the clinical significance of outcomes in the three treatment conditions and the waiting list condition using the reliable change index, as designed by <LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 1991</LINK>. This index provides information about the likelihood that participants' change from pre-treatment to post-treatment exceeds that which might be expected by the standard error of measurement. According to these criteria, 47% of participants in the self-directed intervention condition had improved as compared to 24% in the waiting list condition, as measured by the ECBI. This difference was statistically significant (p&lt;0.01). In addition, 56% of participants in the self-directed group moved from the clinical to the normal range on the ECBI, as compared to only 31% in the waiting list condition (p&lt;0.01). However, similar patterns were not found for other measures of child behaviour. <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005a</LINK> also used the reliable change index to examine the clinical significance of participants' scores on the ECBI. Their analyses showed that 69% of children in the enhanced self-directed condition, 60% of children in the self-directed condition, and 0% of participants in the waiting list condition improved from pre-treatment to post-treatment and that these results were maintained at 6-month follow-up. They did not provide data on the clinical significance of outcomes on other measures. <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005b</LINK> also calculated the clinical significance of scores on the ECBI using the reliable change index. They found that 30% of participants in the self-directed condition showed improvement at post-treatment and 23% showed improvement at 6-month follow-up, whereas no children in the waiting list condition showed improvement at either time point.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participation Rates</HEADING>
<P>All participants were children aged 2 to 15. Participation rates were high and dropout rates were low in all studies (Long's rate (31%) was relatively high but within limits for inclusion). The generally low attrition rate may be because potential subjects were warned about the large amount of time and commitment required for success through typical informed consent procedures. It might well be that at a primary care level this would not be the case. In a busy surgery general practitioners may not be able to spend enough time engaging the families sufficiently for them to be able to complete the treatment on their own and that in 'real world' situations a greater proportion of users of these materials would give up before completing them. <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1999</LINK> made some attempt at analysing differences between those who dropped out of self-directed treatments and those who dropped out from other conditions; similar efforts in future research might be informative.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methods of Recruitment</HEADING>
<P>The methods of recruitment used by the trials in this review varied but generally reflect populations that would be found in day-to-day practice. Most studies used some kind of community outreach or advertising campaign (<LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MarkieDadds-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">MarkieDadds 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2000b</LINK>). Other studies recruited through agencies (<LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1977</LINK>), outpatient clinics or therapy referrals (<LINK REF="STD-Long-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Long 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seymour-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 1989</LINK>) or schools (<LINK REF="STD-Illsley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Illsley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 2004</LINK>). Participants in <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1988" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1990</LINK> were either self-referred referred by local clinicians.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of Materials</HEADING>
<P>The efficacy of individual self-help media-based therapies will, to some extent, be dependent on the quality of the individual materials used in each study. At present there is no agreed standardised way of analysing the quality of the material used although 'Discern' (<LINK REF="REF-Charnock-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charnock 1999</LINK>), a set of quality criteria for consumer health information, has been shown to include useful considerations including the sources of the information and biases within it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Type of Materials</HEADING>
<P>It may be that differences in format of the media-based approaches (booklet, video, audiotape, etc.) may explain some of the heterogeneity in the effects of these interventions due to literacy levels and consumer preferences, but it is not possible to tell from the current data. This review has shown the effectiveness of these treatments over a range of child behavioural problems and media-based approaches and cannot discriminate between them.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Contextual Issues</HEADING>
<P>Most studies lack the additional information that would be informative to practitioners. For example, many do not include the results of economic implications of these approaches or of consumer satisfaction measures in ways that make analysis and comparison possible. In addition, practitioners might also seek information about cultural and individual differences when considering the use of these sorts of approaches (taking into account, for example, literacy levels, access to audiovisual equipment, etc). Furthermore, one of the difficulties of doing behavioural programmes with children is that there is usually a delay before the treatment begins to work, whether the programme is delivered by a media-based approach or by another method. This may be a very difficult time for these families and the matter of whether study participants were able to manage without face-to-face support through these times is of interest. However, data from included studies do not allow this question to be fully answered at present.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:22:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of this review suggest that the use of media-based materials to teach parents to use child behaviour management strategies would appear to be worthy of consideration at a primary care level and is likely to be effective at least for moderate cases. All studies show that following the media-based behavioural intervention the child's problems improve, but the confidence intervals are often wide and the use of these approaches clearly requires further work to be certain of their efficacy. There are, also, insufficient data to determine whether one method of delivery is any better than another. While adding some therapist support to these interventions has been found to be worthwhile, it may not justify the additional costs that would be incurred. </P>
<P>These materials may also help to train those working in primary care to be more aware of effective child behaviour management interventions when confronted by parents expressing concern about their children's behaviour. Health care professionals may also want to consider distributing these media-based approaches in addition to their work directly with clients where they feel that the materials themselves may not be sufficient as a stand-alone treatment.</P>
<P>Behavioural interventions will not work with every family and treatments delivered by media-based methods are no exception. This may be because some parents would resist any attempt to change their parenting, or because there are other factors influencing family and individual functioning which may prevent change. These factors may be internal to the family, such as parental alcohol abuse, or external, such as poverty. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-11 10:22:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Media-based self-help materials in general, and parenting books in particular, are a growing industry. Any trip to a bookshop will present the consumer with many new titles most of which claim to be the ideal book to read in order to resolve many child behaviour problems. Most of these books and other methods of presenting self-help strategies are not tested at all. This is unfortunate as the potential for this form of psychological help would appear to be considerable, especially in these times of progressively limited resources. If a proportion of the population could address some of these problems themselves using media-based strategies, considerable time would be released for professionals to attend to cases which might need greater inputs.</P>
<P>Specifically, high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed which have sufficient statistical power to distinguish between different amounts of therapeutic time and style. The issues of different modes of delivery and different child behaviour problems are also important. To date, there are no trials using a placebo to isolate the content from the method of delivery. For example, a comparison of two videotapes, one containing behavioural advice and the other a discussion of the nature of the problem might be helpful. However it must be admitted that this is a difficult area for these sorts of interventions, but such a trial would be a useful exercise. The use of video has not been sufficiently compared to written self-help materials and yet video's potential to model appropriate strategies to parents is greater than most written forms of presentation, with the added advantage that the potential problem of limited parental reading ability would be removed. Over time the internet will present more options for the presentation of psychological treatments which can be more flexible and tailored to the particular profile provided by the client. This exciting area will also require rigorous testing. In addition, issues that future research might aim to address include cost-benefit analyses and consideration of the relationship between face-to-face contact and the optimal use of therapeutic media. Future research might also consider testing relative proportions of media and face-to-face input, as it is not possible to judge this from the information currently available.</P>
<P>None of the studies reviewed here include any outcome measures based on child report. There is now a whole range of self-complete measures which have been designed for use by children in order to assess such aspects as self-esteem and self-concept. Use of such measures would allow the children's opinions to be considered properly and empower them to influence the treatments administered to them. This may, of course, be difficult to do in the case of young children. However it may be that these behavioural problems are an important concern for the children as well as their parents and the child's perception of the success of the treatments might be an important consideration in the search for effective interventions. The inclusion of these would have enhanced quite considerably our understanding of the effectiveness of many of these media-based programmes. Most studies rely on parent reports, and yet there is some conflict in the reports of teachers concerning the improvements in behaviour shown by children in some studies, notably those of Webster-Stratton and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1988" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WebsterStratton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">WebsterStratton 1990</LINK>) and the need for independent report in the measurement of behaviour should be noted.</P>

<P>In late 2003 searches for this review were re-run. During the course of assessing these, a Cochrane review focussing specifically on educational interventions for enuresis was published (Glazener CMA, Evans JHC, Peto RE), and it was decided to exclude this condition from the scope of the present review, and two related trials were therefore removed. Two new trials were identified as suitable for inclusion. In addition, substantive methodological input from the Campbell Collaboration's Methods Group was received and changes were made in response.<BR/>
<BR/>Further searches were run in July 2005 and one study was identified as suitable for inclusion. Two additional unpublished papers were provided by their author and included. The review was substantively updated given the new data and change in the scope of the review.</P>
