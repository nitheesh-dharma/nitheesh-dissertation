<P>Substantive amendment.<BR/>More studies have been included for brushes that work with a rotation oscillation action. The update confirms that these brushes removed more plaque and reduced gingivitis more effectively than manual brushes in the short term. Brushes of this design reduced gingivitis scores over 3 months.<BR/>A refinement of the data analysis for brushes that work with a rotation oscillation action excluded 1 study from the current review for plaque over 3 months. Excluding this study does not substantially change our estimate of the treatment effect. However, because there are fewer studies in the analysis the 95% confidence intervals are wider and the findings are no longer statistically significant for this analysis.<BR/>Trials of ionic brushes that impart a charge to the tooth surface have been included for the first time. The analyses show no benefit from these brushes on plaque or gingivitis in studies lasting 1 to 3 months but effects in studies over 3 months. This inconsistency cannot be explained but only 1 study was included in the long-term analyses.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-05 08:43:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review has been conducted to assess the effects of using a powered (or 'electric') toothbrush compared with using a manual toothbrush for maintaining oral health.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Good oral hygiene, through the removal of plaque (a sticky film containing bacteria) by effective toothbrushing has an important role in the prevention of gum disease and tooth decay. Dental plaque is the primary cause of gingivitis (gum inflammation) and is implicated in the progression to periodontitis, a more serious form of gum disease that affects the tissues that support the teeth. The build up of plaque can also lead to tooth decay. Both gum disease and tooth decay are the primary reasons for tooth loss.</P>
<P>There are numerous different types of powered toothbrushes available to the public, ranging in price and mode of action. Different powered toothbrushes work in different ways (such as moving from side to side or in a circular motion). Powered toothbrushes also vary drastically in price. It is important to know whether powered toothbrushes are more effective at removing plaque than manual toothbrushes, and whether their use reduces the inflammation of the gums (gingivitis) and prevents or slows the progression of periodontitis.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies and the evidence is current up to 23 January 2014. It includes 56 studies published from 1964 to 2011 in which 5068 participants were randomised to receive either a powered toothbrush or a manual toothbrush. Majority of the studies included adults, and over 50% of the studies used a type of powered toothbrush that had a rotation oscillation mode of action (where the brush head rotates in one direction and then the other).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence produced shows benefits in using a powered toothbrush when compared with a manual toothbrush. There was an 11% reduction in plaque at one to three months of use, and a 21% reduction in plaque when assessed after three months of use. For gingivitis, there was a 6% reduction at one to three months of use and an 11% reduction when assessed after three months of use. The benefits of this for long-term dental health are unclear.</P>
<P>Few studies reported on side effects; any reported side effects were localised and only temporary.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence relating to plaque and gingivitis was considered to be of moderate quality.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-08 15:07:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Removing dental plaque may play a key role maintaining oral health. There is conflicting evidence for the relative merits of manual and powered toothbrushing in achieving this. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2005.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-06-02 14:31:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>To compare manual and powered toothbrushes in everyday use, by people of any age, in relation to the removal of plaque, the health of the gingivae, staining and calculus, dependability, adverse effects and cost.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-06-02 14:27:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 23 January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 23 January 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 23 January 2014) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 23 January 2014). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-06-02 14:27:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of at least four weeks of unsupervised powered toothbrushing versus manual toothbrushing for oral health in children and adults.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-06-02 14:28:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Random-effects models were used provided there were four or more studies included in the meta-analysis, otherwise fixed-effect models were used. Data were classed as short term (one to three months) and long term (greater than three months).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-02 15:25:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Fifty-six trials met the inclusion criteria; 51 trials involving 4624 participants provided data for meta-analysis. Five trials were at low risk of bias, five at high and 46 at unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>There is moderate quality evidence that powered toothbrushes provide a statistically significant benefit compared with manual toothbrushes with regard to the reduction of plaque in both the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.70 to -0.31); 40 trials, n = 2871) and long term (SMD -0.47 (95% CI -0.82 to -0.11; 14 trials, n = 978). These results correspond to an 11% reduction in plaque for the Quigley Hein index (Turesky) in the short term and 21% reduction long term. Both meta-analyses showed high levels of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 83% and 86% respectively) that was not explained by the different powered toothbrush type subgroups.</P>
<P>With regard to gingivitis, there is moderate quality evidence that powered toothbrushes again provide a statistically significant benefit when compared with manual toothbrushes both in the short term (SMD -0.43 (95% CI -0.60 to -0.25); 44 trials, n = 3345) and long term (SMD -0.21 (95% CI -0.31 to -0.12); 16 trials, n = 1645). This corresponds to a 6% and 11% reduction in gingivitis for the Löe and Silness index respectively. Both meta-analyses showed high levels of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 82% and 51% respectively) that was not explained by the different powered toothbrush type subgroups.</P>
<P>The number of trials for each type of powered toothbrush varied: side to side (10 trials), counter oscillation (five trials), rotation oscillation (27 trials), circular (two trials), ultrasonic (seven trials), ionic (four trials) and unknown (five trials). The greatest body of evidence was for rotation oscillation brushes which demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in plaque and gingivitis at both time points.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-19 17:06:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Powered toothbrushes reduce plaque and gingivitis more than manual toothbrushing in the short and long term. The clinical importance of these findings remains unclear. Observation of methodological guidelines and greater standardisation of design would benefit both future trials and meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Cost, reliability and side effects were inconsistently reported. Any reported side effects were localised and only temporary.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Periodontal diseases</HEADING>
<P>Periodontal diseases are a diverse family of oral health conditions affecting the periodontium. As the most prevalent periodontal diseases, gingivitis and periodontitis are of major public health importance. Dental plaque is the primary cause of gingivitis (gum inflammation), which is recognised by redness of the gums at the junction with the teeth, together with slight swelling and bleeding from the gingival margin (<LINK REF="REF-Farina-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farina 2013</LINK>). Globally, 80% to 90% of adolescents between 15 and 19 years of age have mild to moderate gingivitis, rising to 92% to 97% in adults between 35 and 44 (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gingivitis can progress to involve the periodontal membrane (periodontitis). A pocket between the gingiva and the tooth forms, and with further destruction bone supporting the tooth is eroded. Eventually the tooth becomes mobile and can be lost. This is a slow process and is related to the amount of plaque and calculus present on the tooth surface, mediated by genetic factors, age, and lifestyle choices such as smoking (<LINK REF="REF-British-Society-of-Periodontology-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Society of Periodontology 2012</LINK>). Severe periodontitis is the sixth most prevalent condition, affecting 11% of the global population (<LINK REF="REF-Marcenes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcenes 2013</LINK>) and tooth loss as a result is found in 5% to 20% of most adult populations worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dental caries</HEADING>
<P>Caries (decay) in permanent teeth is the most prevalent disease worldwide, with a global prevalence of 35% for all ages combined (<LINK REF="REF-Marcenes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcenes 2013</LINK>). Whilst in high-income countries the prevalence of caries has decreased over the past decade, in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) the incidence is increasing due to population growth, an aging population, changing diets and inadequate exposure to fluorides (<LINK REF="REF-Marcenes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcenes 2013</LINK>). In the United Kingdom (UK), 85% of adults have at least one filling (<LINK REF="REF-Steele-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steele 2011</LINK>) and 31% have obvious untreated caries (<LINK REF="REF-White-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2011</LINK>). </P>
<P>The presence of plaque (biofilm) on the tooth is necessary for the development of caries. Like periodontal disease, caries has a complex aetiology, being an interaction between lifestyle, particularly diet and fluoride use, together with host factors. Although the relationship between the presence of plaque and caries is not as clear as with gingivitis, there is clear evidence that the presence of plaque makes teeth more at risk of caries. <LINK REF="REF-Zenkner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenkner 2013</LINK> demonstrated that on erupting teeth with visible plaque accumulation were 14.5 times more likely to have caries than teeth without the presence of visible plaque.</P>
<P>Over twice as many adults who reported not brushing their teeth have caries compared to those who report brushing their teeth twice a day (<LINK REF="REF-White-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2011</LINK>). Almost all people in industrialised countries use fluoride toothpaste. When teeth are brushed with a fluoride toothpaste there is clear evidence that this is effective at preventing caries (<LINK REF="REF-White-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2011</LINK>) and that this is overall more important than brushing per se (<LINK REF="REF-Chesters-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesters 1992</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Powered versus manual toothbrushing for oral health</HEADING>
<P>Good oral hygiene (the removal of plaque or biofilm from the tooth and gums) by effective toothbrushing has a key role in oral health. In general, populations of high-income countries have adopted regular toothbrushing (<LINK REF="REF-Albertsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albertsson 2010</LINK>). There is, however, substantial within-country variation correlating strongly with educational level (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1997</LINK>). Toothbrushing is much less frequent in LMICs but is again associated with social status indicators (<LINK REF="REF-McKittrick-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKittrick 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Effective toothbrushing depends on a number of factors including motivation, knowledge and manual dexterity. Powered brushes simulate the manual motion of toothbrushes with lateral and rotary movements of the brush head. Brushes which operate at a higher frequency of vibration have also been introduced (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Terezhalmy-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terezhalmy 1995b</LINK>). Powered toothbrushes were first introduced commercially in the early 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Chilton-1962a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilton 1962a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cross-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cross 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elliot-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliot 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoover-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoover 1962</LINK>) and have become established as an alternative to manual methods of toothbrushing. In the UK a quarter of adults report using a powered toothbrush (<LINK REF="REF-Chadwick-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadwick 2011</LINK>) and use by children may be even higher (<LINK REF="REF-White-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2004</LINK>). </P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-06-02 15:06:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Dental plaque is the primary cause of gingivitis and is implicated in the progression of periodontitis. Therefore more effective removal of plaque by a powered toothbrush compared to a manual brush will reduce the inflammation of the gums (gingivitis), a benefit in itself, and in the long term may prevent or slow the progression of periodontitis and therefore maintain a functioning dentition for longer (<LINK REF="REF-Aspiras-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aspiras 2013</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is a potential to reduce caries incidence by the effective removal of plaque (<LINK REF="REF-Zenkner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenkner 2013</LINK>) but previous reviews on the effectiveness of powered toothbrushes have not identified any studies reporting this outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Deacon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deacon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2005</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-06-02 15:08:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Powered toothbrushes are popular and expensive compared to manual toothbrushes. However, the question remains, which is better, powered or manual? This is an update of the Cochrane review first published in 2003 and previously updated in 2005 comparing powered and manual toothbrushes (<LINK REF="REF-Heanue-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heanue 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2005</LINK>). There is also a related review comparing the effectiveness of different designs of powered toothbrushes (<LINK REF="REF-Deacon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deacon 2010</LINK>). However, the previous review comparing powered and manual toothbrushes was published in 2005, and there is a requirement to update that review to identify new evidence, and to include any evaluations of new designs of powered toothbrush introduced to the market.</P>

<P>The review is confined to randomised controlled trials comparing manual and powered toothbrushes. It excludes trials only comparing different kinds of powered brushes or those comparing different kinds of manual brushes.</P>
<P>In the current update an agreement was made that cross-over trials were eligible for inclusion if the wash-out period length was more than two weeks. This was particularly important to diminish any carry-over effects of the different toothbrushes on clinical gingivitis. Split-mouth trials were excluded, as these were not considered representative of 'everyday use'.</P>

<P>The toothbrushes included in the review were all forms of manual brushes and all forms of powered brushes. Trials instituting combined interventions, e.g. brushing combined with the use of mouthrinse or irrigation, were excluded. However, trials where participants were permitted to continue with their usual adjuncts to oral hygiene, such as flossing, were included.</P>
<P>Trials were excluded where the brushing intervention was carried out or was supervised by a professional less than 28 days before a follow-up assessment.</P>
<P>Trials of 28 days and over were eligible and a subgroup analysis was carried out on the duration of trials for the different outcome measures.</P>
<P>Powered toothbrushes were divided into seven groups according to their mode of action.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Side to side action, indicates a brush head action that moves laterally from side to side.</LI>
<LI>Counter oscillation, indicates a brush action in which adjacent tufts of bristles (usually six to 10 in number) rotate in one direction and then the other, independently. Each tuft rotating in the opposite direction to that adjacent to it.</LI>
<LI>Rotation oscillation, indicates a brush action in which the brush head rotates in one direction and then the other.</LI>
<LI>Circular, indicates a brush action in which the brush head rotates in one direction.</LI>
<LI>Ultrasonic, indicates a brush action where the bristles vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies (&gt; 20 kHz).</LI>
<LI>Ionic, indicates a brush that aims to impart an electrical charge to the tooth surface with the intent of disrupting the attachment of dental plaque.</LI>
<LI>Unknown, indicates a brush action that the review authors have been unable to establish based on the trial report or confirm with the manufacturers.</LI>
</OL>
<P>An additional group was added in a parallel review of the effectiveness of different powered brushes (<LINK REF="REF-Deacon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deacon 2010</LINK>). This 'multidimensional group' included brushes with two of the above action types. Due to the limited number of trials conducted using this brush type, they were considered as part of the rotation oscillation group in this update.</P>
<P>It was agreed from the earlier reviews that analysis of filament arrangement, orientation, size, shape and flexibility, brush head size and shape along with presence or absence and characteristics of a timer would prove difficult to define across time and brush types.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts identified in the search. If in the opinion of both authors an article clearly did not fulfil the defined inclusion criteria it was considered ineligible. We obtained full reports of all trials of possible relevance for assessment. On receipt of the full article, two review authors assessed each study independently using specifically designed data extraction forms. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with the review team.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2014-06-02 15:27:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>For this update, piloting of data extraction was performed independently by two authors on eight pilot articles. However, all authors reported back on the design of the data extraction forms and their interpretation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria along with their understanding of the outcome measures and new risk of bias (ROB) assessment. On the basis of this feedback the data extraction forms were altered and the inclusion, exclusion, outcome measures and ROB assessment were redefined to avoid misinterpretation. All data extraction for the included studies was then undertaken independently and in duplicate.</P>
<P>The final data extraction protocol considered the following information.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Bibliographic details of the study.</LI>
<LI>Funding source for the trial. A trial was considered to have been funded by a brush manufacturer if it was reported that any material sponsorship from the manufacturer occurred, including the donation of brushes. It was considered unclear, if there was no statement on funding. A trial was only considered to be unsponsored by a manufacturer if it clearly stated so.</LI>
<LI>Inclusion eligibility.</LI>
<LI>Baseline characteristics of the participants in the study, including age, number of participants in the study and gender. Also, specific groups, such as dental students or orthodontic patients were noted, where mentioned.</LI>
<LI>Intervention characteristics including type of brush and its mode of action, duration of use and delivery of instructions.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes including plaque and gingivitis indices.</LI>
<LI>Additional information on a priori calculation of sample size, duration of study, reliability and validity of outcomes measures and monitoring of compliance.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Trials were considered as 'short term' or 'long term'. 'Short-term' data included follow-up between 28 days and three months. 'Long-term' data included follow-up beyond three months. Within each category of long term and short term, where a trial reported multiple end points, only the latest data were extracted.</P>
<P>Data from trials that reported follow-up before and after three months were included in the short- and long-term meta-analyses. Likewise, data from trials that reported both plaque and gingivitis would be included in meta-analyses for both outcomes. These were the only circumstances when data from the same trial were considered more than once.</P>
<P>Many different indices of plaque and gingivitis were used across trials and some trials reported multiple indices. A frequencies table was prepared of the indices used and they were ranked based on common usage and simplicity. For plaque we extracted, where possible, data reported as the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein plaque index (<LINK REF="STD-Quigley-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Quigley 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turesky-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turesky 1970</LINK>). For gingival inflammation we extracted where possible data reported as the gingival index of Löe and Silness (<LINK REF="REF-L_x00f6_e-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Löe 1963</LINK>) or, if unavailable, bleeding on probing (<LINK REF="REF-Ainamo-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ainamo 1975</LINK>). Data for Russell's periodontal index were excluded because this index fails to distinguish between gingivitis and periodontitis (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1967</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where available, data were extracted for whole as opposed to part-mouth scores. Where only part-mouth scores were reported in a study, they were extracted and a sensitivity analysis carried out to consider their impact on the results of the review. Part-mouth scoring was said to have occurred if plaque or gingivitis or both were not recorded around all erupted teeth, except third molars.</P>
<P>Completed data extraction forms were compared. Where there was disagreement between review authors with regard to any part of the extraction details it was resolved by discussion between the authors and a note made on the data collection forms. Any disagreement, unresolved between the two authors, was settled by majority vote of the entire panel of review authors. Authors were contacted for clarification where necessary.</P>

<P>The estimate of effect used was the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). However, different indices for plaque measure the same concept on different scales, with high correlation between the different indices. The same is true for gingivitis. As it is not possible to combine the results from different indices, the effects were expressed as standardised values, which have no units, before combining. The standardised mean difference (SMD) was therefore calculated along with the appropriate 95% CI and was used as the effect measure for each meta-analysis where results were available for more than one index (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>).

<P>This review was originally published in 2003, updated in 2005 and again for this version. Since its first publication to January 2014 a total of 1195 articles have been identified through the search strategy. After removing duplicates, this number falls to 432; titles and abstracts of these 432 articles were screened for eligibility. A total of 200 full-text articles were retrieved as potentially relevant trials. Of these, 134 were excluded (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table) leaving 56 trials, in 66 publications.</P>
<P>In the original review 29 trials, all providing data for meta-analysis, were included. In the 2005 update, an additional 10 trials were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Galgut-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Galgut 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Godoy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Godoy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hickman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hickman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pucher-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pucher 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soparkar-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Soparkar 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sowinski-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sowinski 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toto-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Toto 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Swol-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Van Swol 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zimmer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmer 2002</LINK>).

<P>Some companies are no longer trading or complete details of the relevant toothbrushes are not easily found. The following toothbrushes fall into this latter category: PlaK Trac, GEC, Epident, Touchtronic, Ronson, Dominion, Broxodent, Plaq and White, LPA/Broxo, Sunbeam cordless.</P>
<P>The names and addresses of the manufacturers have changed over the years and those quoted above are correct at the time of the present review. Some of the trials were conducted when another company made the powered toothbrush.</P>
<P>Ten trials recruiting 988 participants compared manual brushing versus side to side powered toothbrushing. Five trials recruited 267 participants and compared manual brushing versus counter oscillating toothbrushing. Twenty-seven trials recruiting 2159 participants compared manual brushing versus rotation oscillation powered brushing. Two trials recruiting 162 participants compared manual brushing versus circular powered brushing and seven trials recruiting 506 participants compared manual brushing versus ultrasonic powered brushing. Four trials recruiting 221 participants compared manual brushing versus ionic brushing. Five trials recruiting 1130 participants compared manual brushing and a powered toothbrush with an unknown action. It should be noted that four trials evaluated two powered brushes (<LINK REF="STD-Costa-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Costa 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khocht-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Khocht 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yankell-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yankell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zimmer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmer 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>Forty trials (2871 participants at the end of the trials) provided data for analysis on plaque at one to three months and 14 trials (978 participants at the end of the trials) provided data at longer than three months. Forty-four trials (3345 participants at the end of the trials) provided data for analysis on gingivitis at one to three months and 16 trials (1645 participants at the end of the trials) provided data at longer than three months.</P>
<P>If it was not stated that a full or partial mouth index was used, we assumed it was full mouth. Fifty-four trials reported plaque data, and of these eight trials reported that a partial mouth assessment was used. Fifty-two trials reported gingivitis data and 10 of these reported using a partial mouth index.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were limited to the data on all types of powered toothbrushes (Comparison 1: <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) as this was the primary analysis for this review.</P>
<P>These were conducted for trials with (1) full mouth indices only, (2) low risk of bias trials, (3) manufacturer funded (reported) and (4) excluding orthodontic patients (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). The effect estimates were similar to those for all trials apart from those for the low risk of bias studies. There are only five low risk of bias trials in total and two to three included in the sensitivity analyses.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Publication bias was assessed for the studies included in the meta-analysis for all powered toothbrushes versus manual for the one to three month assessments. Both funnel plots appear asymmetrical in visual interpretation (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) with some evidence of publication bias. A formal test of small study effects (Egger test) was undertaken for the Quigley Hein (Turesky) index for plaque and the Löe Silness index for gingivitis. The slope was not significant for either index (P value = 0.203; 0.56) and the hypothesis of no small study effects was also not significant (P value = 0.748; 0.15). From the statistical tests there was no evidence of any publication bias.</P>

<P>Therefore, of the 56 studies, there were seven trials that described differences in tissue trauma between participants using manual and powered toothbrushes.

One trial reported seven soft tissue abnormalities in six participants in the manual group and 10 abnormalities in seven participants in the powered group (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1994</LINK>). In the trial by Yukna et al (<LINK REF="STD-Yukna-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Yukna 1993b</LINK>) four cases of abrasion were reported in the powered toothbrush group and one in the manual group. <LINK REF="STD-Khocht-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Khocht 1992</LINK> reported soft tissue changes in four participants using the manual toothbrush, six using the experimental powered toothbrush and one participant using a control powered toothbrush. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-McCracken-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McCracken 2004</LINK>, soft tissue lesion which included abrasion and ulcer were reported in eight of manual toothbrushes group and five in powered toothbrushes group. <LINK REF="STD-Gugerli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gugerli 2007</LINK> reported three cases of abrasion in both manual and powered toothbrushes.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-06-02 17:27:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>We brush our teeth for many reasons: to feel fresh and confident; to have a nice smile; to avoid bad breath and to avoid disease. The selection of one's toothbrush is largely a matter of personal preference, affordability, availability and professional recommendation. Powered toothbrushes may have a particular appeal to some because they represent a 'high tech' solution to an everyday task. There is overwhelming evidence that toothbrushing reduces gingivitis (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1973</LINK>). It may prevent periodontitis and certainly prevents tooth decay if carried out in conjunction with fluoride toothpaste. These benefits occur whether the brush is manual or powered and the results of this review do not indicate that toothbrushing is only worthwhile with a powered toothbrush.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-02 17:21:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>The results of this review demonstrate that powered toothbrushes remove statistically significantly more plaque and gingivitis than manual brushes in both the short and long term. The results of the meta-analyses are presented as standardised mean differences (SMD), which do not relate to tangible differences in clinical indices. To help interpret the magnitude of the effect, the results of the 'all powered toothbrushes' meta-analysis have been back-translated to the most commonly reported plaque and gingivitis indices. An 11% reduction in plaque was shown at one to three months for the Quigley Hein (Turesky) index and a 21% reduction in plaque at longer than three months. The longer term result was based only on 14 trials, compared to 40 trials for the short-term analysis. With regard to gingivitis a 6% reduction was seen at one to three months for the Löe Silness index, based on 44 trials, and a greater reduction of 11% in the long term (16 trials).</P>
<P>When looking at individual modes of action of powered brushes there are inconsistencies with regard to reductions of plaque and gingivitis. Rotation oscillation brushes showed statistically significant reductions in both plaque and gingivitis at both time points. All other brushes, apart from side to side, showed some statistically significant findings but not consistently across both outcomes and time points. It is difficult to explain this inconsistency that a particular toothbrush design could affect plaque or gingivitis at one time but not at another and so the findings of these analyses may warrant further research, particularly given the small number of trials for some modes of action.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-06-02 17:26:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>The effectiveness of powered toothbrushes in removing plaque and reducing gingivitis can be related to destructive periodontal disease (periodontitis) only with some difficulty. Many factors are associated with the occurrence of periodontitis including plaque, tobacco use and individual medical factors. Periodontitis takes many years to develop whereas the trials have much shorter follow-up. There is little compelling evidence that plaque and gingivitis are reliable proxies for long-term destructive disease and it is difficult to estimate a threshold for clinically important reductions in either. We conclude that powered brushes reduce plaque accumulation and gingivitis but the clinical importance of these reductions cannot be assessed. More high quality long-term studies are required to investigate the effectiveness of rotation oscillation brushes in the treatment and prevention of periodontitis.</P>
<P>Some authorities have advocated the use of arbitrary thresholds to make superiority claims for a specific product. For example, Imrey has proposed that a product cannot be claimed to be superior unless it provides a 20% improvement in performance (which was not the case for any types of brush in this review, in terms of long-term plaque removal) (<LINK REF="REF-Imrey-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imrey 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Imrey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imrey 1994</LINK>). However, other authors have criticised the use of arbitrary thresholds and prefer a threshold for clinical significance to be decided in advance and selected on clinical grounds (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Agostino-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Agostino 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Few data were reported on the costs or reliability of the brushes or the side effects of their use. When reported, injuries to the gums were minor and transient.</P>
<P>Many factors may influence the effectiveness of toothbrushes including filament arrangement, orientation, size, shape and flexibility, brush head size and shape along with presence or absence and characteristics of a timer, that not all of them could be isolated and analysed. Whether the brush has a battery or rechargeable power source may also be important. These factors could be considered in subgroup analyses in the parallel review of different powered toothbrushes by Deacon and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Deacon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deacon 2010</LINK>). More recently powered toothbrushes have been introduced with multidimensional actions (for example the filaments on some rotation oscillation brushes now also move in and out towards the tooth). Trials of such designs are yet to be identified.</P>
<P>The funnel plots for the trials of all powered toothbrushes were skewed for both plaque and gingivitis. This observation suggests but does not conclusively demonstrate publication bias. In the review intervention effects were measured by SMDs, which are naturally correlated with their standard error, which can produce spurious asymmetry in funnel plots. Other potential factors that may contribute to asymmetry include poor methodological quality of studies, true heterogeneity and the play of chance.</P>
<P>Publication bias might be expected in the reporting of toothbrush trials as manufacturers would like to have scientific support for the effectiveness of their products. Studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies are more likely to favour the sponsor (<LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>). There was no evidence of this when publication bias was examined statistically, and no evidence of a difference in effect estimates when a sensitivity analysis was conducted for trials which did not mention commercial funding. It should be noted that the methods for detecting publication bias relate effect size to sample size, and in this review the trials tend to be of similar size. Therefore other methods may be required to examine publication bias in short-term, low cost studies.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-06-02 17:27:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>The current review focused purely on truly randomised trials. Five trials were assessed as at low risk of bias (8.9%), five at high risk of bias (8.9%) and the remaining 46 trials (82%) at unclear risk of bias. Only three trials were able to be used in the sensitivity analysis for trials at low risk of bias. These trials were unable to demonstrate statistically significant differences between powered and manual toothbrushes, although the effect estimates for plaque and gingivitis at one to three months were higher than those for all trials.</P>
<P>There was considerable unexplained heterogeneity in the meta-analyses for plaque and gingivitis for the primary analysis of powered toothbrushes versus manual brushes, and for the meta-analyses of individual modes of action. This heterogeneity could not be explained.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-06-02 17:28:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>This review has found that compared with manual toothbrushes, powered toothbrushes are more effective than manual brushes in reducing plaque and gingivitis in the long and short term. An 11% reduction in plaque (Quigley Hein (Turesky) index) was shown at one to three months and a 21% reduction in plaque at longer than three months. With regard to gingivitis a 6% reduction (Löe Silness index) was seen at one to three months and a greater reduction of 11% in the long term. The clinical importance of these findings remains unclear.</P>
<P>Cost, reliability and side effects were inconsistently reported. Any reported side effects were localised and only temporary.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-06-05 09:09:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Trials of longer duration are required to fully evaluate the effects of powered toothbrushes. There are few trials reporting data over more than three months. Data on the long-term benefits of powered toothbrushes would be valuable in their own right and could be used to trial other outcomes such as the adverse effects and benefits in the prevention of periodontitis and dental caries.</P>
<P>This review continued to identify idiosyncrasies in the design of the trials and in some cases data could not be included for this reason. Whilst many of the trials were conducted before the current emphasis on experimental design, even recent trials lacked power calculations and had not been analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Researchers in this field would be advised to study guidance on the design and reporting of clinical trials such as that provided in the CONSORT statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">http://www.consort-statement.org/</A>) and Robinson and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2006</LINK>). Specific guidance exists for trials in the treatment or prevention of periodontal diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Imrey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imrey 1994</LINK>) but greater standardisation of both the follow-up intervals and the indices used would benefit both trials and future meta-analyses. Thought should also be given to when the mouth should be examined in relation to when the teeth were last cleaned. Authors might also seek guidance on the analysis and presentation of cross-over trials.</P>
<P>Some research designs created an artificial research environment that may have undermined the generalis ability of the findings. In particular the external validity was questionable in trials with split-mouth designs where participants were asked to clean each side of their mouth with a different brush, in trials where interventions were used in combination and those where toothbrushing was supervised. Hence their exclusion from this meta-analysis.</P>
<P>More research with improved rigour is also needed on the relative benefits of powered and manual toothbrushes to prevent or remove extrinsic staining of the teeth and calculus.</P>
<P>Finally, empirical data on thresholds for clinically important differences in plaque and gingivitis levels would help to determine whether oral hygiene aids provide important health benefits.</P>
