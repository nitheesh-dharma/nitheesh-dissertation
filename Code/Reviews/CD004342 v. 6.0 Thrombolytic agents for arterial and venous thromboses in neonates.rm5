<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Major blood clots are infrequent, but serious complications that can occur in neonatal intensive care. Most often, blood clots are related to catheters (thin tubes inserted into the body), especially those inserted into the torso, for instance umbilical catheters. These are used in treating or monitoring sick newborn babies. Sometimes blood clots do not cause symptoms, but symptomatic blood clots can impair circulation and result in damage in the arms, legs, lungs, kidneys, heart, brain or intestines. The most common treatments are observation (no treatment), anti-clotting drugs (heparin), or clot-dissolving drugs (streptokinase, urokinase, and TPA). Surgery is also sometimes done. Administration of clot-dissolving drugs (thrombolytics) has a risk of causing severe bleeding. It is important to understand which treatment of blood clots produces the best short-term and long-term results. However, a search of the medical literature found no randomized clinical trials that compared clot-dissolving drugs with other blood clot treatments in newborns. Thus, no conclusions could be drawn.</P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Clinically symptomatic thromboses are infrequent but serious complications in neonates undergoing intensive care. Thromboses tend to occur in very sick neonates, particularly preterm neonates, and most are related to central vascular catheters. Furthermore, symptomatic thrombosis may result in death or severe morbidity due to irreversible organ damage. Incidence of symptomatic thrombosis is approximately 5.1 in 100,000 live births from the German Thrombosis Registry (<LINK REF="REF-Nowak_x002d_Gottl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowak-Gottl 1997</LINK>), or approximately 1 case per centre per year in the Canadian Thrombosis Registry (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1995</LINK>). The incidence of asymptomatic thrombosis associated with indwelling catheters is probably much higher and has been estimated between 10 and 20 % (<LINK REF="REF-Horgan-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horgan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olinsky-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olinsky 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oppenheimer-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheimer 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seibert--1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seibert 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thrombotic disease may occur in any major blood vessel. The most common venous sites are the vena cava (superior and inferior, sometimes associated with renal vein thrombosis), the renal veins (associated with haematuria and enlarged kidneys), cerebral veins (associated with seizures), adrenal veins (associated with adrenal haemorrhage and necrosis), and the portal and hepatic veins. Of the arteries the most commonly affected are the aorta (associated with congestive heart failure, systolic gradient between upper and lower limbs, and decreased femoral pulses), peripheral limb (associated with local ischaemic signs), cerebral (associated with apnoeas and seizures), pulmonary (associated with respiratory distress and pulmonary hypertension), coronary (associated with cardiac ischaemia), renal (associated with systemic hypertension, or congestive cardiac failure) and mesenteric (associated with signs of necrotizing enterocolitis) (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edstrom-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edstrom 2000</LINK>). Risk factors, in addition to indwelling catheters, include high haematocrit, increased plasma viscosity, disseminated intravascular coagulation, infants of diabetic mothers, sepsis, small for gestational age babies, congenital heart disease, maternal antiphospholipid syndrome and inherited prothrombotic disorders such as Protein C or Protein S deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Edstrom-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edstrom 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Invasive procedures such as venous and arterial umbilical catheters, central venous lines and peripheral arterial and venous access may cause thrombo-embolic disease by damaging the vessel wall endothelium, and introducing a potentially thrombogenic surface into the vessel. Thrombus formation in the neonate is most commonly a result of an activated functioning coagulation cascade. Activation of the extrinsic (tissue lesion) or intrinsic pathway (intravascular induction) results in precipitation of fibrin at the site of the lesion. Thrombocytes adhere to and fibroblasts migrate into the initial clot, which constricts by interlinking fibrin molecules.</P>
<P>D-dimers are not particularly useful in diagnosis of thrombosis as there appears to be a wide range of levels in apparently normal infants (<LINK REF="REF-Hudson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudson 1990</LINK>). Contrast angiography gives the most accurate diagnosis but is invasive (<LINK REF="REF-Manco_x002d_Johnson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manco-Johnson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olinsky-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olinsky 1975</LINK>) . Realtime ultrasonography and Doppler studies are good adjunctive measures, but their precision and accuracy in neonatal thrombotic disease are still uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1988</LINK>). </P>
<P> Observation, standard heparin, low molecular weight heparin, thrombolysis, and on occasions, surgical intervention are the available and most commonly used treatment options (<LINK REF="REF-Edstrom-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edstrom 2000</LINK>). Streptokinase and urokinase (non-fibrin specific plasminogen activators) and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) have all been used for symptomatic thrombosis in neonates. Urokinase (a plasminogen activating human enzyme, derived from urine) has a better safety profile compared to streptokinase (a toxin of haemolytic group C streptococcus). TPA is a fibrin-specific human tissue protein which promotes the transformation of plasminogen into plasmin, a proteolytic enzyme which directly digests fibrin and clotting factors (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale_x002c_-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale, 1999</LINK>). Contraindications follow mainly adult practice: recent or ongoing haemorrhage (in particular intracranial or pulmonary haemorrhage), coagulation defects and bleeding diatheses, peptic ulceration, severe liver disease, recent trauma or surgery. The main complication of administration of thrombolytic agents in neonates as in adults is induction of severe haemorrhage. Reported sites of bleeding include local puncture sites or recent catheterisation sites (10.4%), pulmonary haemorrhage (0.6%), gastro-intestinal haemorrhage (0.6%) and intraventricular haemorrhage (2.7%). Only two of a series of 182 infants who received thrombolytic therapy died from a resulting haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Nowak_x002d_Gottl-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowak-Gottl 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data on long-term follow up of neonatal thrombosis are limited. Follow-up data on aortic thrombosis suggest that persistent hypertension, leg-growth discrepancy and renal dysfunction may occur (<LINK REF="REF-Caplan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caplan 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Payne-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seibert-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seibert 1991</LINK>). Heparin infused in low dose (&lt; 200 units/kg/day) via an umbilical artery catheter prolongs the patency of the catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Rajani-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajani 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-David-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bosque-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosque 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horgan-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horgan 1987</LINK>). However, there are no data available so far to show whether continuous low dose heparin via umbilical artery catheters reduces catheter-associated thrombus formation.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective was to assess effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic agents (streptokinase, urokinase or rTPA) for the treatment of clinically manifest arterial or venous thrombosis in newborn infants. We aimed to assess the results of various treatment regimens. In separate comparisons, we planned to compare thrombolytic agents with either no treatment, heparin, or surgery, each used as primary treatment. Secondary objectives were to conduct subgroup analyses within each comparison, in which we planned to assess treatment effects on arterial or venous thromboses; and according to the specific thrombolytic agent tested: streptokinase, urokinase or rTPA.</P>
<P>We aimed to specifically test the following hypothesis: thrombolytic agents to treat symptomatic arterial or venous thrombosis are effective in preventing complications including limb or organ ischaemia.</P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Relevant trials (RCTs and quasi-RCTs) in all languages were collected by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966-2003), EMBASE (1980-2003), CINAHL (1982-2003), The Royal Pharmaceutical Society Databases (ePic, Ceuted, New Products, Discontinued Products) in the 2003 version, HMIC:DH Data and King's Fund Database 2003/1, Serfile 2002 version. We used at first level the individual search terms "neonate" (plus: "neonat*"), "thrombosis" (plus: "thrombos*"), "clot", "blood clot", "thrombolysis" (plus: "thromboly*"), "fibrinolysis" (plus: "fibrinoly*), "Urokinase", "Streptokinase", "recombinant tissue plasminogen activator" (plus: "rTPA"). We then carried out combined searches combining "neonate" (plus: "neonat*") individually with all other search terms. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The two reviewers (CJ and CH) independently planned to select the trials to be included in the review. The methodological quality of each trial was to be assessed by each reviewer. In particular, reviewers planned to examine details of the randomisation method, whether the trial was blinded, whether intention to treat analyses were possible from the available data and if the number of patients lost to follow up or subsequently excluded from the study was recorded. Data were to be independently extracted by each reviewer using standard data acquisition forms. If disagreement arose on the suitability of a trial for inclusion in the review or on its quality, we planned to attempt to reach a consensus by discussion. We planned to rate each of the four elements of methodological quality used by the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We planned to rate blinding of randomisation, blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome assessments (as yes/no/can't tell).</P>
<P>For binary outcome measures, data on the number of patients with each outcome event, by allocated treated group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the patient was later thought to be ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up were to be sought to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. Treatment effect was planned to be analysed using relative risk and risk differences for binary outcomes and either mean and standard deviation for change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment/intervention values and standard deviation for each group for continuous outcomes. We planned to pool trials for meta-analyses if appropriate. For meta-analyses, a fixed effect model was to be assumed. A pooled estimate of treatment effect for each outcome across studies was planned to be calculated as typical relative risk and typical risk differences for binary outcomes, and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. 95% confidence intervals were to be used for each measure of treatment effect. Heterogeneity between trial results was to be tested for using a standard chi-squared test or ANOVA as appropriate. We planned to perform a sensitivity analysis based on the methodological quality of the studies, including and excluding quasi-randomised studies. </P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>We found seven studies which were potentially eligible. There were two RCTs of low molecular weight heparin for treatment or prevention of thrombosis in children (<LINK REF="STD-Massicotte-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Massicotte 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massicotte-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Massicotte 2003b</LINK>). However, they were not eligible as heparin is not a thrombolytic agent. </P>
<P>In another clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>), there were only eight neonates in the study forming a very heterogenous group. The study was neither randomised nor controlled. The authors themselves state that their study cannot form the basis for treatment recommendations.</P>
<P>A study on 76 very low birth weight infants with umbilical catheters in situ showed that four patients had intracardiac thromboses which resolved with an infusion of r-TPA with no systemic side effects observed (<LINK REF="STD-Ferrari-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrari 2001</LINK>). However, the study was not randomised.</P>
<P>A study on the efficacy and safety of r-TPA in 17 children and adolescents with arterial and venous thromboses of varying causes demonstrated complete re-perfusion in 13 patients and partial re-perfusion in two patients. There were no serious side effects in the neonates in the study which numbered only two (<LINK REF="STD-Nowak_x002d_Gottl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nowak-Gottl 1991</LINK>)</P>
<P>Four neonates with caval thrombosis secondary to indwelling central catheters were given r-TPA as a low-dose infusion (0.05 mg/kg/h) directly into the thrombus. Thrombolysis was successful in 3 patients and one neonate suffered an intracranial haemorrhage. This study was not randomised or controlled (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a prospective cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-Cheah-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cheah 2001</LINK>) of 31 neonates with umbilical catheter associated thrombi, 22 had successful thrombolysis with low dose streptokinase (1000 units/h) after a mean interval of 2.2 days. Only one infant developed mild bleeding attributed to streptokinase therapy. This study was not randomised.</P>
<P>We contacted two investigators in the field. Dr Barbara Schmidt who is the author of a major survey of the use of thrombolytic agents was contacted in January 2004 and she was unaware of any unpublished or ongoing trials. Dr U Nowak-Gottl, who is the author of a similar survey of the use of thrombolytic agents in neonates, was contacted in December 2003 and she was unaware of any unpublished or ongoing trials.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No conclusions could be made</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for adequately powered muticentre trials to determine the safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy for major thromboses in the neonate. Such trials may have to be conducted on a mutinational basis because of the rarity of this condition. It is time that a randomised controlled trial was performed comparing thrombolytic therapy with heparin therapy to aid neonatologists in the treatment of this rare but potentially fatal condition.</P>
