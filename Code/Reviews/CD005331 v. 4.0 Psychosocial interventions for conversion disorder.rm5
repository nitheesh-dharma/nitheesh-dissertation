<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Conversion disorder is an alteration or loss of physical functioning suggestive of a physical disorder that is thought to be due to a psychological stressor or conflict. Psychosocial interventions are thought to be helpful for people with conversion disorder. We conducted a review of all relevant randomised trials of psychosocial interventions, but were only able to include three small studies. There were no conclusive results and at present, the benefits or harms of psychosocial interventions for conversion disorder are unclear.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Conversion disorder is an alteration or loss of physical functioning suggestive of a physical disorder that is thought to be due to a psychological stressor or conflict. The fact that many theories about the cause of conversion disorder focus on psychological and social factors would suggest that a psychosocial intervention might be of most benefit. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To investigate the efficacy of psychosocial interventions on people diagnosed with conversion disorder compared with standard care, a biological intervention or another psychosocial intervention.
<BR/>

</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Register (May 2004), various databases on OVID (February 2004), handsearched reference lists and textbooks on conversion disorder and contacted relevant authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial interventions for conversion disorder with standard care or other interventions (biological or psychosocial).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data from the studies. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated a relative risk with its associated 95% confidence interval and a number needed to treat. For continuous data we calculated a weighted mean difference.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The search identified 260 references, 217 were clearly not relevant to this review and excluded on the basis of their titles and abstracts, 40 more were excluded after reading the full papers (the reasons are given in the excluded studies tables) and only three studies (total n =119) met the inclusion criteria. One study was concerned with paradoxical injunction therapy and the other two studied the value of hypnosis. The three studies had different interventions and control groups so the results could not be combined. All of the studies were of poor methodological quality and it is therefore difficult to place much value on the results of the studies. We were unable to include some data because of poor reporting.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Randomised studies are possible in this field. The use of psychosocial interventions for conversion disorder requires more research and it is not possible to draw any conclusions about their potential benefits or harms from the included studies.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Conversion disorder is an alteration or loss of physical functioning suggestive of a physical disorder that is thought to be due to a psychological stressor or conflict. The older term for this disorder is 'hysteria'. The symptoms are not consciously produced but may be maintained by their secondary gain, such as the social support they evoke or the avoidance of unpleasant situations (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). The epidemiology of conversion disorder is complicated by case definition, case ascertainment and identifying a suitable study population but community surveys suggest a minimum prevalence of 50 per 100,000. There is no good evidence to suggest that conversion disorder is becoming less common or that it is more often found in developing countries. Conversion symptoms can occur in both men and women although all case series show a predominance of women (<LINK REF="REF-Akagi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akagi 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are different theories about the cause of conversion disorder, but broadly it can be understood as the result of an interaction among intra-psychic conflicts, cultural beliefs, beliefs about illness and learned maladaptive behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Silver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silver 1996</LINK>). Examples of conversion disorder syndrome are blindness, anaesthesia, aphonia (inability to speak), paralysis and muscle weakness that cannot be explained by a neurological cause. For the purpose of this review conversion disorder will also include dissociative amnesia (loss of memory), fugue (an unexpected journey away from home that is forgotten), stupor, motor disorders, convulsions (non-epileptic seizures), anaesthesia and sensory loss, trance and possession disorders, multiple personality disorder and Ganser's syndrome as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) and the International Classifications of Disease, tenth edition (ICD-10) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). In practice neurologists and psychiatrists do not tend to stick to these classificatory groupings but use the term conversion disorder to cover any loss or distortion of neurological function that cannot be explained by organic disease.</P>
<P>The prognosis for those with conversion disorder is poorly studied but results from a number of studies suggest the prospects for immediate recovery are good but a significant number will relapse. Factors associated with quick recovery are said to be an acute onset and prompt treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Ron-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ron 2001</LINK>). Prognosis may also be influenced by symptom pattern and some studies suggest that non-epileptic attacks and cases presenting with tremor or amnesia have a poorer prognostic outcome than those with hysterical blindness, aphonia and motor disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Toone-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toone 1990</LINK>). One of the most detailed long-term studies (<LINK REF="REF-Ljungberg-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ljungberg 1957</LINK>) showed 43% of males and 35% of females were symptomatic at one year. These figures had dropped to 25% and 22% respectively at five years and were little changed at 15 years.</P>
<P>There are many accounts of many different interventions for conversion disorder dating back to Ancient Greece (<LINK REF="REF-Veith-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veith 1970</LINK>). The majority of the literature consists of case studies. We have found over 100 case reports of different interventions mentioned in the literature including spa treatment, abreaction, family therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, packages of different interventions, surgery, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), physiotherapy and inpatient psychiatric care. To our knowledge there is no existing systematic review of interventions in this area. Therefore a rigorous systematic review is necessary to help clinical decision making with regard to interventions for conversion disorder. In order to focus this review and because many aetiological theories suggest psychological and social factors as being of primary importance we have decided to focus on psychosocial interventions, those that focus on psychological and/ or social factors rather than biological factors. Psychosocial interventions include all psychological interventions specified in the UK Department of Health review of psychological therapies (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2001</LINK>), social interventions such as social skills training and befriending and packages of interventions that have a psychosocial focus (even if they also include some more biological interventions). Pure biological interventions such as medication, abreaction, ECT, other electrical interventions (for example for muscle stimulation), physiotherapy and invasive treatments (such as surgery) or combinations of these will be excluded from this review.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To investigate the efficacy of psychosocial interventions on people diagnosed with conversion disorder compared with standard care (as defined in 'types of interventions'), or another intervention (biological or psychosocial, as defined in 'types of interventions').</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria. We also included trials that used cluster randomisation (different groups randomised to receive different treatments). We excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by alternate days of the week. Studies in any language and with any length of follow up were included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trials were included that specified that the majority (over 50%) of the participants had a disorder that was conversion disorder according to DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria. Trials were not excluded due to age, nationality or gender of participants. Trials were included with participants with any length of illness who were being treated in any treatment setting. If trials were found that contained people with comorbid conditions they were included and the comorbidity was commented on.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials that compared a psychosocial intervention for conversion disorder with another intervention (either biological or psychosocial or mixed) or with standard care.</P>
<P>(1) Any psychosocial intervention (in groups or individually), for any length of time, as a treatment for conversion disorder. We defined 'psychosocial intervention' as being any intervention that focused on psychological and/ or social factors rather than biological factors. This therefore included all psychological interventions specified by the UK Department of Health review of psychological therapies including counselling (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2001</LINK>). Social interventions included for example, social skills training and befriending. We also included packages of treatment aimed at a more psychosocial understanding of the condition even if they included some of the components mentioned under biological interventions. </P>
<P>(2) Standard care<BR/>Standard care is the care that a person would normally receive had they not been included in the research trial. Most commonly in conversion disorder this would consist of no psychiatric input and some general medical care.</P>
<P>(3) Other interventions<BR/>This would include any other intervention, either something focussed on a more biological understanding of the condition (psychiatric care, inpatient stay, medication, ECT, physiotherapy, rehabilitation programmes) or another psychosocial intervention (as described above) or a mixed intervention (combining biological, psychological or social interventions).</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measure was a significant reduction in physical signs. This could be measured by rating scales looking at physical functioning such as the Physical Function dimension of the Short-Form-36 (Jenkinson 1996) or could be measured as a binary outcome such as improvement or no improvement in physical signs.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures of interest were:<BR/>* relapse of previous physical signs or occurrence of other physical signs consistent with conversion disorder; <BR/>* leaving the study early;<BR/>* mental state;<BR/>* adverse events;<BR/>* quality of life e.g. Quality of Life Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Burckhardt-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burckhardt 1989</LINK>);<BR/>* health service resource use e.g. primary care consultation rate, secondary care referral rate, use of alternative practitioners, hospital admission rate;<BR/>* social adjustment e.g. return to full-time employment;<BR/>* patient and carer satisfaction with the intervention as measured by standardised instruments e.g. the Visit Specific Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1988</LINK>), Satisfaction Index-Mental Health (<LINK REF="REF-Nabati-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabati 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trials were included that measured outcomes at the end of treatment. All outcomes were reported for the short term (up to 12 weeks after treatment ), medium term (13 to 52 weeks after treatment), and long term (more than 52 weeks after treatment).</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>(1) Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Register (May 2004) was searched using the terms: <BR/>conversion disorder, hysteria, dissociative disorder, possession disorder, trance disorder, dissociative fugue, dissociative amnesia, dissociative stupor, dissociative convulsions, hysterical, multiple personality disorder, ganser, non-epileptic, pseudoseizures, functional motor disorders.</P>
<P>(2) Database searching:<BR/>OVID MEDLINE (1966- 2004), EMBASE (1980 - 2004), CINAHL (1982-2004), PsychINFO (1872 - 2004), CDSR, ACP Journal Club, DARE, CCTR (1980-2004) were searched in February 2004 for intervention studies using the terms: hysteria, conversion disorder, dissociative disorder, possession disorder, trance disorder, dissociative fugue, dissociative amnesia, dissociative stupor, dissociative convulsions, non-epileptic seizures, pseudoseizures, multiple personality disorder, hysterical.</P>
<P>(3) Reference searching <BR/>References of all identified studies, included or excluded, were inspected for more studies.</P>
<P>(4) Handsearching<BR/>Textbooks on somatisation, conversion disorder and hysteria were searched for references to trials.</P>
<P>(5) Personal contact <BR/>The contact authors of relevant reviews or studies were contacted to enquire about other sources of relevant information.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Selection of trials </P>
<P>Two reviewers (RR, AH) independently selected suitable studies for inclusion in this review as detailed below. Where the two reviewers disagreed about the inclusion of a study, disagreements were resolved by consensus of opinion, and a third reviewer consulted if they could not be resolved. Where resolution was not possible the author was contacted to obtain more information and clarification.</P>
<P>The titles and abstracts of studies identified by searching electronic databases were assessed to determine whether each article met the eligibility criteria. In order to prevent any bias, a list of all titles and abstracts was printed out excluding the author's names, institutions, and journal title. If the title and abstract contained sufficient information to determine that the article did not meet the inclusion criteria, then it was rejected. A record of all papers rejected on the basis of their title and abstract and the reasons for rejection were documented but are not included in the review.</P>
<P>The full papers of all remaining titles and abstracts deemed relevant were then retrieved. In addition, all other potentially relevant articles identified by the various search strategies (reference checking, personal communications etc.) were reviewed. All papers in languages other than English were translated and reviewed by someone who spoke the language (as far as possible). All articles were reviewed independently by two of the reviewers, who completed a form for each study and scored the quality of the research as defined below. The reasons for exclusion for the full papers were documented in the excluded studies table. Where the same study had more than one article written about the outcomes, all articles were treated as one study and the results were presented only once.</P>
<P>2. Data extraction</P>
<P>The two reviewers completed the extraction of data from the papers onto a form eliciting the following information:</P>
<P>* general: published or unpublished, title, authors, source, contact address, country, language of publication, year of publication, duplicate publications;<BR/>* trial characteristics: design, duration, randomisation and method, allocation concealment and method, blinding of outcome assessors, check of blinding, adequate power (evidence of power calculation);<BR/>* interventions (frequency, timing, individual versus group, manual driven versus non-manualised therapies), comparison interventions, comedications;<BR/>* patient characteristics: sampling, exclusion criteria, number of participants, age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, educational status, duration of symptoms, number of complications, similarity of groups at baseline (including any comorbidity), withdrawals or losses to follow up (reasons and descriptions);<BR/>* primary diagnosis consistent with conversion disorder as specified in ICD-10 or DSM-IV;<BR/>* type of medical comorbidity if present;<BR/>* type of psychiatric comorbidity: clinical diagnosis or symptomatology assessed by questionnaire;<BR/>* list of outcome measures with the cut-offs used. Noting whether they are self-report or clinician completed and whether they used validated rating scales;<BR/>* results of study (outcomes in terms of means and standard deviations);<BR/>* timing of follow-up: short-, medium- or long-term (see definition under type of outcomes).</P>
<P>3. Assessment of quality </P>
<P>The assessment of the quality of a particular trial was made in accordance with guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook.</P>
<P>3.1 Assessment of the method and adequacy of randomisation<BR/>To prevent selection bias, someone who is not responsible for recruiting the participants, such as a central trial officer or someone not involved in the trial should conduct the randomisation. The method of randomisation was noted on the data extraction form.</P>
<P>3.2 Assessment of the degree of blinding (treatment and outcome assessment)<BR/>Allocation concealment was assessed as follows, as described in the Cochrane Reviewers Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>(A) Adequate description of the allocation procedure; <BR/>(B) unclear description of the allocation procedure; <BR/>(C) inadequate description of the allocation procedure; <BR/>(D) allocation concealment was not used. </P>
<P>If the reviewers disagreed over which category a trial was allocated to, resolution was attempted by discussion or by obtaining further information. In addition, reviewers were blinded to the author's names, institutions and journal title to prevent any bias.</P>
<P>3.3 Losses to follow up<BR/>The paper should give an adequate description of the loss of its participants in terms of the number of withdrawals, people lost to follow up, and protocol deviations. </P>
<P>3.4 Addressing publication bias<BR/>Data from all identified and selected trials were entered in to a funnel plot (size of study versus effect size) (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>), to attempt to detect the possibility of publication bias.</P>
<P>4. Data analysis </P>
<P>Outcomes were assessed using continuous (for example, changes on physical function scales); categorical (for example, one of three categories on a quality of life scale, such as 'better', 'worse' or 'no change'); or dichotomous (for example, either returned to employment or did not return to employment) measures.</P>
<P>4.1 Continuous data<BR/>The mean and standard deviation (SD) were reported. Where standard deviations were not reported in the paper, attempts were made to obtain them from the authors or to calculate them using others measures of variation that were reported, such as the confidence intervals (CI). </P>
<P>For continuous data we calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD). Many rating scales are available to measure outcomes in psychosocial trials. These scales vary in the quality of their validation and reliability. Therefore, if a rating scale's validation had not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, the data were included but the fact that it is unvalidated was noted. In addition, it is preferable for the rating scale to be either self-report or completed by an independent observer or relative and if this was not the case this was also noted in the discussion. Trials that have used the same instrument to measure specific outcomes were used in direct comparisons where possible. If there were continuous data for the same outcome, but measured in different ways across studies then a standardised mean difference (SMD) instead of WMD was calculated.</P>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data the following standards were applied to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means had to be reported in the paper or be obtainable from the authors, (b) when a scale starts from a finite number (such as zero), the standard deviation, when multiplied by two must be less than the mean (otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution - (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). If data were found to be non-parametric then this was reported in the text but was not used in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>4.2 Dichotomous data<BR/>For dichotomous outcomes, a relative risk (RR) with its associated 95% CI was estimated. As a summary measure of effectiveness, where possible, the number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was also calculated.</P>
<P>4.3 Endpoint versus change data<BR/>Where possible we presented endpoint data and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes then we only reported the former.</P>
<P>4.4 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) and we included these in our review but only analysed them in the sensitivity analysis rather than pooled them with non-cluster randomised trials. </P>
<P>5. Test for heterogeneity <BR/>Differences between the results of each included trial were checked using both the chi squared and I-squared test of heterogeneity. More than 30% in the I-squared test is generally accepted to indicate heterogeneity. As these tests usually have low statistical power, a type I error level of 0.10 rather than the customary 0.05 was used for rejecting the null hypothesis of homogeneity. If there was statistically significant heterogeneity the data were presented separately rather than pooled. Results were analysed using both the fixed-effect and random-effects methods. However, where there was significant heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used and the reviewers attempted to explore the reasons for this heterogeneity in post hoc analyses. </P>
<P>There are many different possible causes for heterogeneity. Clinical heterogeneity may arise from many causes such as different interventions, different treatment settings and group versus individual treatment. Methodological heterogeneity arises out of the study designs and different degrees of control of bias. In order to address possible clinical and methodological heterogeneity we pre-specified the modifiers we thought may be important. These are specified below in the section on sensitivity and subgroup analyses. </P>
<P>6. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses <BR/>Factors, which may lead to differences between the results of individual studies because of the quality of the study, were investigated. Sensitivity analyses were used:<BR/>* differences between studies with more than 50% attrition rate and those with less than 50% attrition rate;<BR/>* differences between studies using intention to treat analyses and those not using intention-to-treat analyses;<BR/>* differences between cluster randomised trials and non-cluster randomised trials (cluster randomised trials will not be pooled with non-cluster randomised trials but just compared in a sensitivity analysis);<BR/>* differences between studies that give self-reported or observer-rated outcomes.</P>
<P>Factors, which may lead to differences between the results of individual studies due to the study design, were investigated in subgroup analyses where appropriate:<BR/>* different symptom groups (for example some studies may focus on people with non-epileptic attacks or functional dysphonia);<BR/>* group versus individual therapy;<BR/>* manual driven versus non-manualised interventions.</P>
<P>We entered data from all included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-Smith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey Smith 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>7. General <BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for the psychosocial intervention.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Please see Excluded and Included Trials table.</P>
<P>1. Search<BR/>The search resulted in 260 references, of which 217 were clearly not relevant to this review. Of the remaining 43 reports, we were able to include three trials but required more information to be able to use all of the results (<LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK>). Attempts are still being made to obtain the rest of the data from <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK>. This review contains data from all of the included studies (N = 119)</P>
<P>2. Excluded studies<BR/>Two hundred and seventeen studies were excluded on the basis of their titles and abstracts as clearly irrelevant to the review (the reasons for exclusion were documented by the reviewers but are not included in the review). The full papers were retrieved for the other 43 studies that were thought to be intervention studies for converison disorder. From these 40, more studies were excluded and the reasons are documented in the excluded studies table. Thirty five studies were excluded (despite being about interventions for people with conversion disorder) because they did not contain a control group (<LINK REF="STD-Behr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Behr 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bellamy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bellamy 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berkwitz-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Berkwitz 1952</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharyya-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharyya 1971</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Binzer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Binzer 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cardenas-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cardenas 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Carter-1949" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1949</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Delargy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Delargy 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dickes-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Dickes 1974</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ellason-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ellason 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fackler-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fackler 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gooch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gooch 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Grattan_x002d_Smith-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Grattan-Smith 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Guida-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Guida 1954</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hafeiz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hafeiz 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Halpern-1944" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern 1944</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoogduin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogduin 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kotsopoulos-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kotsopoulos 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Koufman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Koufman 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Krull-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Krull 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kupper-1947" TYPE="STUDY">Kupper 1947</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lehmkuhl-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmkuhl 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Leslie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Leslie 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pu-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Pu 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ramani-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ramani 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rangaswami-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Rangaswami 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1950</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Speed-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Speed 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Turgay-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Turgay 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Watanabe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Watanabe 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-White-1988" TYPE="STUDY">White 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yaskin-1936" TYPE="STUDY">Yaskin 1936</LINK>).

<P>3. Awaiting assessment<BR/>There are no studies awaiting assessment</P>
<P>4. Ongoing studies<BR/>We know of no ongoing studies.</P>
<P>5. Included trials<BR/>Three studies met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>5.1 Objectives<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> compared paradoxical intention therapy as an inpatient with outpatient follow-up and diazepam for pseudoseizures. <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> compared an inpatient treatment programme for conversion disorder motor type with the same treatment programme and hypnosis. <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> compared outpatient hypnosis with a waiting list control for conversion disorder motor type. Although these studies all looked at conversion disorders they had very different treatment interventions and therefore the results of the studies could not be combined.</P>
<P>5.2 Method<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> was randomised by computer. <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> were block randomised. There is no information about how the block randomisation was done. In <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> the raters were blind to the study group. </P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> the two study groups had a different length of treatment (three weeks for the inpatients and 45 days for the outpatients) but they were all followed up at six weeks. In <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> the inpatient treatment lasted for 12 weeks and they were followed up at eight months. In <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> the treatment lasted for three months with follow up at six months (only the treatment group were followed up as the waiting list group began treatment when the others had finished).</P>
<P>5.3 Setting<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> was conducted in an inpatient and outpatient unit in the Department of Psychiatry in the State Hospital of Kahramanmaras, Turkey. <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> were conducted with patients referred to the outpatient psychiatric departments in Dordrecht and Delft, the Netherlands.</P>
<P>5.4 Participants<BR/>The participants in <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> all had non-epileptic seizures that were consistent with the DSM-IV diagnosis. Eight of the 30 patients were illiterate and only one participant had attended high school. All but one of the participants were female and their average age was 27 years old. There was no information given about their previous history of pseudoseizures. All patients with an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG), organic disease, axis I or II disorders and previous psychiatric treatment were excluded.</P>
<P>The 45 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> had conversion disorder motor type or somatisation disorder with motor conversion symptoms according to DSM-III R. The mean age of the participants was 36.8 years (SD 11.31 years). Thirty four of the participants were female and eleven were male. The mean age of onset of symptoms was 32.6 years (SD 10.9 years). The mean duration of symptoms was 3.9 years (range 2 months to 22 years). Eighteen patients had acute onset of symptoms, 33 had received previous outpatient treatment and 18 inpatient treatment. Thirty two used medication to control symptoms and 37 used technical aids for disability. <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> initially identified 139 patients diagnosed between 1991 and 1996 but after diagnostic procedures 37 were unsuitable (11 had organic disorders; in three patients a definite diagnosis could not be established; one was too heavily invalidated to treat in a psychiatric hospital; 13 did not want treatment; two recovered significantly; two had somatoform pain disorder; one suffered from alcohol dependence and was admitted to an alcohol clinic; one had severe depression and three were too old or too young). The remaining 102 were divided between this study and <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK>. There is no information about how this was done.</P>
<P>The 44 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> had conversion disorder motor type or somatisation disorder with motor conversion symptoms according to DSM-III R. The mean age of the participants was 36.6 years (SD 11 years) and 75% of the participants were female. The mean age of onset of the symptoms was 33.8 years (SD 11.3 years). The mean length of symptoms was 3.7 years (range 2 months to 16.7 years). Twenty participants had suffered the same or other conversion symptoms in the past, 16 had had a sudden onset of symptoms and 12 reported an identifiable stressor. Thirty two had received previous psychiatric care (nine as inpatients). Sixteen of the participants used technical aids to help with their disability and 21 used medication of some kind for symptom control. Seventy five per cent of participants were married. The exclusion criteria were evidence of a neurological disorder explaining the conversion symptom or a severe psychiatric disorder requiring immediate treatment. </P>
<P>If the interventions had been the same it would have been possible to combine the results from <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> because the participants were similar and drawn from the same population, however the symptoms and demographics from <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> meant that it would not have been appropriate to combine all three anyway.</P>
<P>5.5 Interventions<BR/>The two psychosocial interventions being tested were paradoxical intention therapy and hypnosis. However, even the hypnosis interventions were sufficiently different to mean that the results could not be combined.</P>
<P>5.5.1 Paradoxical intention<BR/>Inpatient paradoxical intention therapy (PI) versus outpatient treatment with diazepam (<LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> compared inpatient treatment using PI with outpatient treatment and diazepam. PI encourages the patient to deliberately engage in the unwanted behaviour. The PI therapy took place for two sessions a day for a period of three weeks. They were informed of what the treatment would consist of and given some education about the nature of the relationship between anxiety and conversion disorder. The patient and family members were interviewed separately and special attention was given to noting anxiety provoking situations and experiences that were specific to the patient. During the treatment sessions patients were encouraged to think of anxiety provoking situations in order to bring on pseudoseizures. </P>
<P>The outpatient group had four sessions (10, 20, 30 and 45 days into treatment) with a psychiatrist where the dose of medication was reviewed and the rationale for its use reinforced. They were treated with 5 to 15 mg of diazepam a day. It is not clear in the paper but it seems as though the inpatient group were followed up at six weeks and the diazepam group were followed up at the end of treatment, nine weeks. There are clearly large differences between the treatment of the two groups other than the PI and the diazepam. Firstly the PI group were treated as inpatients and the diazepam group were treated as outpatients. This means that all the other factors, such as removal from the home environment, extra time and attention and being looked after, were not being controlled for. Secondly the length of treatment was different in each group and the follow-up measurements were done at different times. It is therefore impossible to say that any difference between these two groups is necessarily related to the intervention.</P>
<P>5.5.2 Hypnosis <BR/>5.5.2.1 Inpatient comprehensive treatment programme and hypnosis versus inpatient comprehensive treatment programme with attention control (reflection) (<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> compared an inpatient comprehensive treatment programme for conversion disorder motor type with the addition of hypnosis with the programme alone. The treatment programme consisted of admission to a general psychiatric unit and treatment by a multidisciplinary team. It contained a group therapy programme that consisted of group-centred activities such as group psychotherapy, social skills training, a planning group (to formulate and evaluate treatment goals), creative therapy and sports. In addition the conversion disorder patients on the unit received an individual, symptom-directed programme consisting of physiotherapy, individual exercise sessions and bed rest. The additional hypnotic treatment was eight weekly sessions of one hour with an introductory session explaining the role of hypnosis in the treatment of conversion disorder. Each session was manualised (written as a treatment manual to ensure that they were standardised). Two hypnotic strategies were used, symptom oriented and insight oriented. An important part of the treatment was learning self-hypnosis and during the sessions they were trained in self-hypnosis and how to practise the symptom oriented techniques for 30 minutes a day. They were given an audiocassette to help with the self-hypnosis. The control for the hypnotic intervention was the same amount of time (eight weekly one hour sessions and a preparatory session) with a therapist. This treatment aimed at optimising non-specific or common therapy factors. Patients were encouraged to reflect on some of the non-specific aspects of their therapy and also to talk about current stressors. The time used to practise self-hypnosis in the treatment group was used in the control condition to think and write about the themes discussed in the therapy sessions. </P>
<P>It is clear in this study that both groups were receiving a lot of interventions already and that the addition of one extra with such a small sample size may not have been noticeable in the outcomes. It is also possible that the control intervention focussing on non-specific therapy factors and stressors may also have been an active intervention.</P>
<P>5.5.2.2 Outpatient hypnosis versus waiting list control (<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK>)<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> compared an outpatient hypnosis intervention for conversion disorder of motor type with being on a waiting list for the same intervention. The patients received no other treatment or medication changes during the study. The hypnotic intervention was the same as in <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> (although conducted as an outpatient) and consisted of ten weekly sessions of one hour with an introductory session explaining the role of hypnosis in the treatment of conversion disorder. Each session was manualised. Two hypnotic strategies were used, symptom oriented and insight oriented. An important part of the treatment was learning self-hypnosis and during the sessions they were trained in self-hypnosis and how to practise the symptom oriented techniques for 30 minutes a day. They were given an audiocassette to help with the self-hypnosis. It is important to bear in mind that the people on the waiting list were waiting for therapy and therefore may not have wanted to perform well in the assessment at the end of the study because they might have thought it would jeopardise their chances of treatment.<BR/> <BR/>5.6 Outcomes <BR/>For <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> it was possible to use the results from the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HRSA) at six weeks and the dichotomous outcome of whether they had any conversion attacks in the two weeks prior to the six-week assessment. It was also possible to include leaving the study early before the six-week assessment. We were unable to use the frequency of conversion attacks as no data were given in the paper. </P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> it was only possible to include leaving the study early by eight months because there were no means or standard deviations for the results of the Video Rating Scale for Motor Conversion Symptoms (VRMC), the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (ICIDH) or the Symptom Checklist- 90 (SCL-90). The author has been contacted to see if the relevant data are available for inclusion.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> it was possible to include leaving the study early by three months, the VRMC, the ICIDH and the SCL-90 all at three months. It was not possible to include the follow-up data for six months as this was only collected for the treatment group. It was also not possible to include data on patient expectations of treatment outcome as no means or standard deviations were supplied. The baseline results for hypnotisability using the Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale (SHCS) were available and relevant to include even though it is not an outcome measure because differences between the groups in terms of hypnotisability could affect the study outcome. </P>
<P>5.6.1 Rating scales included in this review<BR/>5.6.1.1 Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HRSA) (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1959</LINK>)<BR/>The HRSA is a rating scale developed to quantify the severity of anxiety symptomatology. It consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms. Each item is rated on a five-point scale, ranging from zero (not present) to four (severe). </P>
<P>5.6.1.2 Video Rating Scale for Motor Conversion Symptoms (VRMC) (<LINK REF="REF-Moene-in-press" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moene in press</LINK>)<BR/>This scale was specifically developed for assessment of treatment outcome in patients with motor conversion disorders. Patients are videotaped performing the same motor exercises involving their symptoms and impairments under standardised conditions before treatment, after treatment and at follow up. Raters record change in symptoms on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 'very much deteriorated' (1) to 'unchanged' (4) to 'very much improved' (7). If patients have more than one symptom then each one is rated individually and the average taken. For patients with motor symptoms like paroxysmal outbursts of myoclonic movements or fits the change in frequency of attacks can be converted to a representative score on the rating scale. The scale has been shown to have good reliability and concurrent validity with the ICIDH. </P>
<P>5.6.1.3 International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (ICIDH) (<LINK REF="REF-Jiwa_x002d_Boerrichter1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiwa-Boerrichter1990</LINK>)<BR/>The ICIDH used in the Moene studies (<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK>) was the validated Dutch version (<LINK REF="REF-Jiwa_x002d_Boerrichter1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiwa-Boerrichter1990</LINK>). The instrument contains 27 items covering five groups of activities: physical, daily life, social, mental and communicative activities. The patient is asked to rate the extent to which they are impaired in the area by their handicap on a four point Likert scale: none (0); small amount (1); large amount (2); very large amount (3). In the Moene studies (<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK>) they used a sum of the scores for the impairment of physical activities, daily life activities and social activities. The reliability and validity of using these parts of the scale in isolation are good. </P>
<P>5.6.1.4 Symptom Checklist- 90 (SCL-90) (<LINK REF="REF-Arrindell-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrindell 1981</LINK>)<BR/>The SCL-90 is a self-report symptom inventory measuring the level of psycho-neuroticism. The sum of the subscales representing eight different categories of symptoms yields a general psycho-neuroticism score or global severity index. They used a Dutch translation in the Moene studies.</P>
<P>5.6.1.5 Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale for Adults (SHCS) (<LINK REF="REF-Oyen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oyen 1983</LINK>)<BR/>The study reporting results for this scale (<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK>) used the validated Dutch version of the scale (<LINK REF="REF-Oyen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oyen 1983</LINK>). The scale measured five different hypnotic phenomena relevant to clinical practice. One motor and four cognitive items follow a hypnotic relaxation induction. SCHS scores can vary between zero and five with the higher score indicating more hypnotisability. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> stated that people were randomised by computer between the two interventions but did not state who was running the computer programme. <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> both used block randomisation although the reason for this was not made apparent in the papers.</P>
<P>2. Blindness<BR/>All three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK>) had assessors who were blind to the interventions. As at least some of the scales involved contact between the assesors and the participants it is possible that people may have disclosed the group they were in. </P>
<P>3. Descriptions of people who withdrew before completion <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> has no one leaving either arm of the study before the end. <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> tells us that out of 49 people who intially agreed to take part in the study four were lost to follow up (two in the experimental group and two in the control group) prior to the end of the study. One of these was due to frequent pseudoseizures interfering with the pre-treatment assessment, another refused further assessment after pre-treatment assessment, a third dropped out because he believed his symptoms were due to an organic cause and therefore could not accept the rationale of the offered treatment and the last patient dropped out mid treatment because she did not want to remain in the hospital. In <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> there is information about the number of people who were lost to follow up from each group (see results section) and when they left during the course of treatment but there is no specific information about why they were lost. It does say that there is no difference in demographics between those people who were lost to follow up and those who completed the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> provided data on the number of people originally identified as eligible for the study and the number actually entering the trial. It appears that out of the 139 people identified to potentially take part in the two trials 98 participated. Twenty four did not meet the inclusion criteria (11 had organic disorders; three could not be definitely diagnosed; one was too heavily invalidated to be treated in a psychiatric hospital; two recovered spontaneously; two had somatoform pain disorder; one had alcohol dependence; one had major affective disorder and 3 were too old or too young), 13 refused the treatment offered and four were unaccounted for. So out of a potential 115 who did meet the criteria for the trials only 17 (20%) did not participate. </P>
<P>4. Overall impression<BR/>Currently reports of all studies do not provide reassurance that allocation was fully concealed. Therefore, all studies are categorised as 'B'. Unfortunately none of the studies provided a power calculation to justify that there were enough participants to show an effect even if one exists. Also <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> do not use intention-to-treat analysis but just excluded the results of the people lost to follow up.</P>

<B>1. PARADOXICAL INTENTION THERAPY<BR/>1.1 COMPARISON: Inpatient paradoxical intention therapy (PI) versus outpatient diazepam (Ataoglu 2003)<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>1.1.1 Physical signs (any attacks in last two weeks, high equals poor, short term)<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> one out of fifteen participants in the PI group had seizures in the previous two weeks at the six week assessment compared with six out of fifteen in the diazepam group. This result favours treatment but is not statistically significant. (N=30, RCT 1, RR 0.17 CI 0.02 to 1.22, z=1.76 p=0.08; NNT 4 but 95% CI not statistically significant).</P>
<P>1.1.2 Mental state (endpoint data, short term, HRSA, high equals poor)<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> the anxiety score in the PI group at the end of treatment was 14.47 (SD 5.36) compared with 18.20 (SD 3.47) in the diazepam group. This data are normally distributed. This is a statistically significant difference favouring the PI group. (N=30, RCT 1, WMD -3.73 CI -6.96 to -0.5, z=2.26 p=0.02).</P>
<P>1.1.3 Leaving the study early - short term<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> no participants left the study before the end from the PI group (zero out of fifteen) or the diazepam group (zero out of fifteen). There is therefore no statistically significant difference between the groups. One of the possible reasons for no participants being lost to follow up was because it was inpatient treatment.</P>

<P>
<B>2.2 COMPARISON: OUTPATIENT HYPNOSIS versus WAITING LIST (Moene 2003)<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>2.2.1 Physical signs (endpoint data, short term, observation, VRMC, high equals good)<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> the treatment group scored 5.9 (SD 1.3) on the VRMC compared with the waiting list group who scored 3.8 (SD 1.4) at the end of treatment. This result favours the treatment group and is highly statistically significant. (N=43, RCT 1, WMD 2.1 CI 1.29 to 2.91, z=5.1 p&lt;0.00001). </P>
<P>2.2.2 Mental state (endpoint data, short term, SCL-90, high equals poor)<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> the hypnosis group scored 141.9 (SD 47.5) on the SCL-90 compared with the control group who scored 154.2 (SD 59.4). This result favours the treatment group but is not statistically significant. (N=43, RCT 1, WMD -12.3 CI -44.28 to 19.68, z=0.75 p=0.45). </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>
<B>1. Strengths and weakness of the review</B>
<BR/>This review used a systematic search strategy to identify and review randomised controlled trials of psychosocial interventions for conversion disorder, to attempt to find effective interventions for this condition. Despite the low incidence of this disorder Moene (<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> have shown that randomised controlled trials of interventions for conversion disorder are possible. </P>
<P>Only three studies were found that could be included in the review and poor reporting of data has led to further loss of information. The studies had low sample numbers and are therefore likely to be underpowered to find a clinically meaningful effect. The control group in Atagolu 2003 clearly did not receive a comparable intervention in terms of time and staff input so it is difficult to draw conclusions about paradoxical intention therapy specifically because any difference between the arms of the study could be due to these other factors. It is also, for similar reasons, difficult to draw conclusions about <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> because the control group was a waiting list group who again received no comparable input. However, significant findings in these studies could be the basis for further research. From these three different studies it is difficult to draw any conclusions about the treatment of conversion disorder in clinical practice.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Applicability of psychosocial interventions for conversion disorder</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> provided data on the number of people originally identified as eligible for the study and the number actually entering the trial. It appears that out of the 139 people identified to potentially take part in the two trials 98 participated. Out of a potential 115 who did meet the criteria for the trials only 17 (20%) did not participate. This may suggest that psychosocial interventions are generally acceptable to people with conversion disorder. This is important as people with conversion disorder are often convinced that there is a clear biological cause for their disability and expect a biological intervention to address it.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Discussion of the study findings </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>3.1 PARADOXICAL INTENTION THERAPY <BR/>COMPARISON: INPATIENT PARADOXICAL INTENTION THERAPY (PI) versus OUTPATIENT DIAZEPAM (Ataoglu 2003)<BR/>
</B>3.1.1 Leaving the study early - short term<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> (N equals 30) no participants left the study before the end of therapy from either group. This could suggest that the treatment was acceptable to the participants in terms of addressing their condition or in terms of no intolerable side effects. Another alternative is that it is a function of the fact the participants were inpatients.</P>
<P>3.1.2 Physical signs (any attacks in last two weeks, high equals poor, short term)<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> (N equals 30) there was no statistically significant difference between the number of non-epileptic attacks in the two groups but the result did favour the paradoxical intention therapy group rather than the diazepam group. The fact there is no significant difference could be because there is no difference in treatment but because the study is underpowered the lack of difference may not represent a true result and further investigation may be warranted, particularly as there was a significant difference in mental state (see below).</P>
<P>3.1.3 Mental state (endpoint data, short term, HRSA, high equals poor)<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> (N equals 30) the group receiving paradoxical intention therapy was significantly less anxious at the end of therapy compared with the diazepam group. Although this result is statistically significant, intention-to-treat analysis is used and the data are normally distributed the study is probably underpowered. This result suggests that anxiety in non-epileptic seizures may be better helped with parodoxical intention therapy than diazepam, but further research is needed to confirm this. </P>
<P>
<B>3.2 HYPNOSIS<BR/>3.2.1 COMPARISON: INPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAMME + HYPNOSIS versus INPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAMME + INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS (</B>
<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK>
<B>)<BR/>
</B>3.2.1.1 Leaving the study early - short term<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> (N equals 49) there was no significant difference between the number of people leaving the treatment programme and hypnosis group compared with those leaving the treatment programme and individual sessions group before the end of treatment. This suggests that hypnosis as an additional intervention was not more unacceptable to people with conversion disorder than individual sessions. As only four people (14%) left the study altogether the treatment programme with hypnosis or individual sessions could also be thought of as acceptable interventions for people with conversion disorder.</P>
<P>
<B>3.2.2 COMPARISON: OUTPATIENT HYPNOSIS versus WAITING LIST (</B>
<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK>
<B>)<BR/>
</B>3.2.2.1 Physical signs (endpoint data, short term, observation, VRMC, high equals good)<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> (N equals 43) the hypnosis group had highly significant improvement in physical signs at the end of the treatment period than the waiting list group. The result suggests that hypnosis is highly effective at improving the physical signs of conversion disorder compared with a waiting list group, however the study may be underpowered and they do not use intention-to-treat analysis. Further research is needed to verify this result and it is important to consider that a waiting list group who are waiting to receive therapy may want their symptoms to still appear bad so that they receive treatment and therefore may not be the most appropriate control group. It is also difficult to know whether it was actually the hypnosis or just the time spent with the participants that improved their physical condition and therefore studies comparing hypnosis to interventions where they also recieve therapist time are needed to explore this further. Unfortunately it was not possible to include the six month follow-up data as this was only provided for the hypnosis group, as the waiting list group had by that time begun therapy. </P>
<P>3.2.2.2 Mental state (endpoint data, short term, SCL-90, high equals poor)<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> (N equals 43) there was no statistically significant difference in mental state between the hypnosis group and the waiting list group at the end of treatment. Although the results favour hypnosis treatment this is not statistically significant, the study is probably underpowered and intention-to-treat analysis is not used. Further research is probably indicated to investigate further the value of hypnosis for improving mental state in conversion disorder. Unfortunately it was not possible to include the six month follow-up data as this was only provided for the hypnosis group, as the waiting list group had by that time begun therapy. </P>
<P>3.2.2.3 Physical disability (endpoint data, short term, interview data, ICIDH, high equals poor)<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> (N equals 43) the data at the end of treatment were not normally distributed so no conclusions can be drawn from it. Unfortunately it was not possible to include the six month follow-up data as these were only provided for the hypnosis group, as the waiting list group had by that time begun therapy. </P>
<P>Further research is needed to investigate whether hypnosis has any value for reducing physical disability, especially in view of the highly significant result for reducing physical signs. </P>
<P>3.2.2.1 Leaving the study early - short term<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> (N equals 49) there was no statistically significant difference between the number of people leaving the hypnosis group or the waiting list group. The study may be underpowered to detect a true difference and the waiting list group were waiting for the hypnosis treatment so may be less likely to be lost to follow up than those in active treatment, which is what the results showed (although they were not significant). </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For people with conversion disorder<BR/>The benefits and harms of psychosocial interventions for conversion disorder are not fully established.</P>
<P>2. For clinicians <BR/>If psychosocial interventions are available for people with conversion disorder then at present they should be viewed as experimental with slight evidence in favour of help rather than harm (for hypnosis and paradoxical intention therapy) in terms of engagement, mental state and physical functioning. It is unclear what effects these interventions and other psychosocial interventions have on social functioning, interpersonal relationships, quality of life or satisfaction with care. From the included studies it is unclear what benefit the individual parts of a treatment package including biological, psychological and social components have on the outcome of the disorder. In particular there are no trials comparing rehabilitation programmes to rehabilitation programmes with a psychological intervention. The other question that remains unanswered by these trials is what the long term outcomes of the interventions are.<BR/> <BR/>3. For policy makers<BR/>There is a need for further research to study psychosocial interventions for people with conversion disorder.</P>
<P>4. For funders<BR/>Funders with an interest in psychosocial interventions for conversion disorder should support further adequately powered, and designed studies. In order to be able to think about the cost implications of conversion disorder health services research is needed into the long term outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>If the CONSORT recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) were followed in reporting future studies, we would be more aware of the effects of psychosocial interventions for conversion disorder. Important data from one of the included studies were lost due to poor reporting.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>As psychosocial interventions are used for people with conversion disorder, large, simple, well-designed and reported trials are justified to establish whether they are effective. </P>
<P>Researchers may wish to investigate further the interventions included in this review in the ways suggested or to explore other psychosocial interventions for this disorder. Whatever intervention is studied it is important to have an appropriate control group that is receiving a comparable intervention. Some way of compensating for the additional time spent with people by allocation to a psychosocial intervention, particularly an inpatient one, may be seen as desirable. Further studies of psychosocial interventions for conversion disorder should include clinically meaningful outcomes such as: clinically significant changes in physical functioning, mental state, relapse, admission to hospital, engagement with services, quality of life, leaving the study early, satisfaction with care, social functioning, adverse effects, and economic outcomes (cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit).</P>
