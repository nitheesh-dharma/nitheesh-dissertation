<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>A meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing taxane containing chemotherapy with non-taxane containing chemotherapy for women following surgery for early breast cancer</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Breast cancer is by far the most frequent cancer experienced by women (23% of all cancers in women), with an estimated 1.15 million new cases and over 411,000 deaths reported worldwide in 2002. Early breast cancer is cancer that has not spread beyond the breast or nearby lymph nodes and is potentially curable with surgery alone. There is a risk that following surgery the breast cancer may return. Chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) given after surgery can reduce the risk of breast cancer returning and a combination of chemotherapy drugs (rather than one drug by itself) is typically used. Chemotherapy that includes a taxane drug may improve survival and disease-free survival for selected women with early breast cancer when administered following surgery. Paclitaxel and docetaxel are two of the chemotherapy drugs known as taxanes. Taxanes can inhibit cancer cells dividing and reproducing. Possible associated adverse effects include nausea, vomiting and increased risk of infections. In the 12 studies included in this review, a total of 21,191 women were randomised to treatment groups, 11069 to a taxane containing chemotherapy regimen and 10,122 to a non-taxane containing regimen. This review found that adjuvant chemotherapy which included a taxane drug lowered the risk of death and reduced the number of breast cancer recurrences. Further trials are needed to find the best way to use a taxane drug when it is given in combination with other non-taxane chemotherapy drugs.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in pre- and post-menopausal women with early breast cancer. Taxanes are highly active chemotherapy agents in metastatic breast cancer. Their role in early breast cancer was examined in this review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the randomised evidence comparing taxane containing chemotherapy regimens with non-taxane containing chemotherapy regimens as adjuvant treatment of pre- or post-menopausal women with early breast cancer.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register was searched on 9th January 2007 using the codes for 'early breast cancer' and keywords for taxanes. Details of the search strategy used to create the register are described in the Group's module in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. The reference lists of other related literature reviews and articles were also searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing taxane containing regimens with non-taxane containing regimens in women with operable breast cancer. Women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were collected from published trials and abstracts. Studies were assessed for eligibility and quality and the data extracted independently by two review authors. Hazard ratios (HR) were derived for time-to-event outcomes, and meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model. The primary outcome measure was overall survival (OS); disease-free survival (DFS) was a secondary outcome measure. Toxicity and quality of life data were extracted when reported.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified 20 studies, 12 of these (7 full publications, 5 abstracts) had sufficient data published for inclusion (11 for OS and 11 for DFS) in the review. The weighted average median follow up was 60.4 months. All studies fulfilled quality criteria either adequately or well. Amongst 18,304 women with 2483 deaths, the HR for OS was 0.81 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.88, P &lt; 0.00001) favouring taxane containing regimens. Amongst 19,943 women with 4800 events, the HR for DFS was 0.81 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.86, P &lt; 0.00001) favouring taxane containing regimens. There was no statistical heterogeneity for either OS or DFS.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This meta-analysis of studies supports the use of taxane containing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens with improvement of overall survival and disease-free survival for women with operable early breast cancer. The review did not identify a subgroup of patients where taxane containing treatment may have been more or less effective. Dosage and scheduling of the taxane drug is not clearly defined and we await results of the next generation of studies to determine the optimal use of taxanes in early breast cancer.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2010-08-30 09:04:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Breast cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. In 2002, there were an estimated 1.15 million new cases and over 411,000 deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Globocan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Globocan 2002</LINK>). Approximately 30% of women diagnosed and treated for early breast cancer will go on to die of this disease. <BR/>The primary treatment of early breast cancer is local and surgery with or without radiotherapy is recommended for women with operable early breast cancer (National Comprehensive Cancer Network Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Breast Cancer; Version 2, 2007. www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/PDF/breast.pdf (accessed 30 April 2007)). Adjuvant polychemotherapy following surgery improves survival in pre- and post-menopausal women with early breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Taxanes are cytotoxic chemotherapy agents which affect cellular structures needed for cancer cells to divide, the microtubules. In a normal cell cycle, cells form microtubules at the beginning of cell division and the microtubules are broken down when the cell stops dividing. Taxanes stabilise the microtubules, stopping them from breaking down normally. This causes the cancer cells to stop dividing, potentially slowing the growth of the cancer or killing the cells. There are two taxanes that are commercially available to date: paclitaxel (Taxol®, Bristol-Meyers-Squibb) and docetaxel (Taxotere®, Sanofi-Aventis).<BR/>The most common side effects differ slightly between the two available taxanes. Both agents cause neutropenia (low neutrophil count, a subset of white blood cells) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) as well as fatigue, nausea and vomiting, hair loss, diarrhoea, mouth ulcers, and joint and muscle pains. Paclitaxel also causes hypersensitivity reactions (skin rash and reactions to infusion of the agent) and peripheral neuropathy. Docetaxel also causes skin and nail changes and fluid accumulation (oedema). Both drugs can cause febrile neutropenia (serious infection due to the low neutrophil count) which can occasionally be life threatening or fatal. Supportive therapies can modify many of these side effects.</P>
<P>The taxanes are amongst the most active agents in metastatic breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Bishop-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bishop 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghersi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghersi 2005</LINK>) and are widely used (<LINK REF="REF-Crown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crown 2002</LINK>). Their incorporation into adjuvant regimens for early breast cancer has increased over recent years as mature data from clinical trials has become available, although the possible benefits of taxane containing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens have not been quantified. There is a need to synthesise the results of trials of adjuvant taxanes in early breast cancer in a review, to identify the patient subgroups that may benefit from this treatment, and to identify important unanswered questions for future study.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to compare taxane containing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens with adjuvant regimens not containing a taxane in the management of women with operable early breast cancer.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Unconfounded randomised controlled trials as defined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, excluding quasi-randomised trials.</P>
<P>Studies with full publications and studies published in abstract form only were included. Studies only available as protocols and studies published without the outcome measures of interest in this review were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Women of any age with histologically confirmed operable breast cancer (stages I to IIIA).</P>
<P>Women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. <BR/>Those studies that included both women who received adjuvant chemotherapy plus women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were included if data for the two groups were reported separately.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Intervention: any chemotherapy regimen that contained a taxane.<BR/>Comparator: any chemotherapy regimen that did not contain a taxane.</P>
<P>Comparisons:<BR/>Q1). taxane containing regimen versus the same regimen without a taxane;</P>
<P>Q2). any taxane containing regimen versus any regimen without a taxane; and</P>
<P>Q3). any taxane containing regimen versus the same regimen with another drug or drugs that were substituted for the taxane.<BR/> <BR/>Endocrine therapy was allowed if the same treatment was given to all groups. </P>
<P>The taxane drugs used were paclitaxel and docetaxel.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome measure: overall survival (OS).</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures: <BR/>- disease-free survival (DFS);<BR/> <BR/>- toxicity (as defined by World Health Organisation (WHO)/ National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) toxicity criteria);<BR/> <BR/>- quality of life (using validated or trial-specific instruments);</P>
<P>- cost effectiveness.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register was first searched on the 18th August 2005 and last searched on the 9th January 2007. Details of the search strategy used by the Group for the identification of studies and the procedure used to code references are outlined in the Group's module (www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/BREASTCA/frame.html). Studies coded as 'early breast cancer' and 'chemotherapy' on the Specialised Register were extracted and combined with the keywords taxol, docetaxel, and paclitaxel. A search was carried out for the following text words: taxane, taxol, taxotere, paclitaxel, paxene, nsc-12973, docetaxel, anzatax, taxanes, taxoids, or taxoid. In addition, the reference lists of other related literature reviews and articles were searched. <BR/>A handsearch was performed for abstracts published from 1995 to 2006 for presentations at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Scientific Meeting and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. A copy of the full article for each reference reporting a potentially eligible trial was obtained.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>A. Assessing trials for eligibility</P>
<P>The selection criteria were applied to each trial publication (if full publication available) or abstract (full publication not available) independently by two review authors (AN and TF) who were masked to the study title, authors, and results. A third review author was available to resolve any disagreements regarding eligibility but was not required. </P>
<P>B. Quality control and peer review</P>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed each potentially eligible trial for:</P>
<P>1. inclusion in the review (according to the eligibility criteria);</P>
<P>2. quality.</P>
<P>C. Analysis</P>
<P>The primary outcome was overall survival; disease-free survival was a secondary outcome. The hazard ratios (HR) and variances were extracted from trial publications, where available. If not reported, statistics were extracted from the publications using the methods described by Parmar et al, either using other summary statistics or from data from published Kaplan Meier curves (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>). Numbers at risk were adjusted based on the estimated minimum and maximum follow-up times. Where these were not reported, minimum follow up was estimated from parameters given including date of final accrual, date of study closure, date of submission, and estimated time to complete treatment. Maximum follow-up time was similarly estimated from date of first accrual, date of analysis, date of submission, and the last event on the time-to-event curve. All efficacy analyses used an intention-to-treat population where this was reported. A pooled HR was calculated using the observed (O) minus expected (E) event numbers and the variance from each trial was derived as above in a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1991</LINK>). Chi-square tests were used to check for heterogeneity over all trials (see Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions). Post-hoc subgroup analyses were performed for type of taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel), addition or substitution of a taxane, longer or the same duration of chemotherapy, node positive only or node positive and negative, sequential or concurrent anthracycline and taxane, and less than four or four or more cycles of taxane. A sensitivity analysis was performed for fully published trials or trials published in abstract form only.</P>
<P>Toxicity data were extracted from each trial by a single review author (RV), where possible this was for the treated population rather than the intention-to-treat population. As definitions of toxic events varied between trials, events were extracted and summated to best reflect the clinically important outcomes (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). A pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each toxicity using a random effects model (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) where that toxicity was reported in four or more trials. For this review, toxicity was abstracted only from the primary publication used to report efficacy, even when other published abstracts had reported separately on toxicity. Statistical heterogeneity was considered significant when p&lt;0.10 or I-squared&gt;50%.</P>
<P>Quality of life (QoL) data were collected using different instruments in the different trials, and most have not been fully reported in a full publication. There has been no attempt to statistically synthesise QoL data, which are summarised and reported qualitatively (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).<BR/>Pharmacoeconomic data were not reported in any trial and were not be considered further in this review.</P>

<P>The search terms described above identified 76 references from the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register that were potentially eligible for this review. Additional searching for potentially eligible studies was conducted by assessing relevant review papers and journals, using MEDLINE, and by reviewing conference proceedings from the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Scientific Meeting and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) during the review period. Of the 76 studies identified from the Specialised Register, 46 were excluded based on information in the abstract. The full publication was obtained for the remaining 30 studies, of which three were found to be duplicate publications. Four further studies were excluded as they were ineligible (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Leo" TYPE="STUDY">Di Leo</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunphy" TYPE="STUDY">Dunphy</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kummel" TYPE="STUDY">Kummel</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MD-Anderson-CC" TYPE="STUDY">MD Anderson CC</LINK>) (see Characteristics of excluded studies); one study was confounded by dose dense scheduling (<LINK REF="STD-Kummel" TYPE="STUDY">Kummel</LINK>) and in one study it was not possible to separate efficacy data for participants treated in the neoadjuvant setting from those treated in the adjuvant setting (<LINK REF="STD-MD-Anderson-CC" TYPE="STUDY">MD Anderson CC</LINK>). Of the remaining 23 studies, eight were published in protocol form only or did not have published efficacy results (see Characteristics of ongoing studies). A further three studies await further publication before assessing suitability for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-ADEBAR-Study" TYPE="STUDY">ADEBAR Study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9640" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9640</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICCG-DEVA-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">ICCG DEVA Trial</LINK>). Twelve studies remained eligible for the review and had sufficient results for inclusion in the meta-analysis (see Characteristics of included studies), of which five were in abstract form and seven had full publications. The <LINK REF="STD-NCIC_x002d_CTG-MA21" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC-CTG MA21</LINK> study was identified separately through searching abstracts from the 2006 SABCS and has published interim efficacy results; however, it remains classified as an ongoing study as insufficient information was published to allow efficacy data extraction ( it was lacking patient numbers and event numbers from each arm).</P>
<P>In the 12 included studies a total of 21,191 women were randomised to treatment groups, 11069 to a taxane containing arm and 10,122 to a non-taxane containing arm.</P>
<P>There were 20 eligible studies that were classified as either included or ongoing studies. Of these, seven studies addressing Q1 (taxane containing regimen versus the same regimen without a taxane) were identified (<LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goim-9902-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">Goim 9902 Trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>) and all reported data except the Goim 9902 trial, which was available as a protocol only. Four eligible studies addressing Q2 (any taxane containing regimen versus any regimen without a taxane) were identified (<LINK REF="STD-GONO_x002d_MIG-5" TYPE="STUDY">GONO-MIG 5</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-NCI_x002d_H99_x002d_0038" TYPE="STUDY">NCI-H99-0038</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCIC_x002d_CTG-MA21" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC-CTG MA21</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-TACT" TYPE="STUDY">UK TACT</LINK>) and none of these studies reported data. Eleven eligible studies addressing Q3 (any taxane containing regimen versus the same regimen with another drug or drugs substituted for the taxane) were identified (<LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brain-et-al" TYPE="STUDY">Brain et al</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9805" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9805</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS-04" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 04</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-TACT" TYPE="STUDY">UK TACT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK>) of which seven reported data and four were ongoing studies awaiting publication (<LINK REF="STD-Brain-et-al" TYPE="STUDY">Brain et al</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9805" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9805</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS-04" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 04</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-TACT" TYPE="STUDY">UK TACT</LINK>).<BR/>It is noted that the <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK> study addressed both Q1 and Q3 and the <LINK REF="STD-UK-TACT" TYPE="STUDY">UK TACT</LINK> study addressed both Q2 and Q3.</P>
<P>Five of the 12 included studies used paclitaxel (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>). All studies were designed to answer Q1 except the <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK> study which addressed Q3. The remaining seven included studies used docetaxel (<LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>). These studies were designed to answer Q3, except the <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK> study which addressed Q1.</P>
<P>One study used secondary randomisation to examine the additional question of the addition of trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2 positive patients following adjuvant chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>). Another study randomised patients to four arms, two controls and two containing taxane, to simultaneously examine the question of concurrent versus sequential administration of taxane and anthracycline (<LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>). The analyses used in this review for these two papers were confined to the primary objective.</P>
<P>All studies except one (<LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK>) used an anthracycline in both the taxane containing and non-taxane containing arms. In the <LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK> study docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide was compared to doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide. The taxane and anthracycline were administered sequentially (<LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>) or concurrently (<LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>), noting that the <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK> study contained both concurrent and sequential arms. The total planned dose of anthracycline was the same in both arms in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>) and lower for the taxane containing arm in four studies ( <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK> study administered dose dense chemotherapy in both the taxane containing and non-taxane containing arms. Dose density was, therefore, unlikely to be a confounding factor and the trial was included. The <LINK REF="STD-Kummel" TYPE="STUDY">Kummel</LINK> study was excluded as the taxane containing arm included dose dense chemotherapy whilst the non-taxane containing arm did not. The <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK> study used primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and ciprofloxacin with doxorubicin dosed at 90mg/m² and this was not different between the taxane and non-taxane arms.</P>
<P>Other adjuvant treatments included endocrine therapy and post-operative radiotherapy. Tamoxifen 20mg daily for five years in estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive patients was used in most studies but with the following exceptions. The <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK> study treated all hormone receptor positive pre-menopausal women with a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue for one year in addition to tamoxifen; the <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK> study used tamoxifen in all patients prior to June 2000 but a subsequent protocol amendment mandated tamoxifen only in hormone receptor positive women; in the <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK> study all women older than 50 years of age at the time of surgery received tamoxifen regardless of hormone receptor status, while only those with positive hormone receptor status received tamoxifen if they were less than 50 years of age; the <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK> study initially required tamoxifen treatment post-chemotherapy only in post-menopausal women, with hormone receptor positive or negative tumours and amended the protocol in 1998 to require tamoxifen for pre-menopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumours. The <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK> study also commenced tamoxifen concurrently with chemotherapy. It was not clear from published information if any other included studies also commenced tamoxifen concurrently with chemotherapy. All studies used uniform policies for hormonal treatment in both the control and experimental arms.</P>
<P>Radiotherapy to the breast, where reported, was required when breast-conserving surgery was performed. The information was not specified in the <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK> study reports. Additional radiotherapy was 'as per institution' in the <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK> studies. Axillary or chest wall radiotherapy was given in patients with four or more positive axillary nodes or a primary tumour (T) &gt; 5 cm in the <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK> studies. The <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK> study also gave chest wall radiotherapy in patients with a primary T4 tumour. Radiation to the chest wall, supraclavicular area, and internal mammary chain was recommended following mastectomy in the <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK> study. In the <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK> study, axillary or chest wall radiotherapy was not permitted.</P>
<P>The included studies recruited patient populations with varying risk profiles. Five of the studies included patients both with (node positive) and without (node negative) pathologically involved axillary lymph nodes (<LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK>). The other seven trials required participants to test positive for axillary node metastases prior to inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>). Node negative patients in the <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK> study were required to have a T3 primary tumour in order to be eligible. The <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK> study also included higher risk, node negative patients (T &gt; 2 cm and PR negative) and the <LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK> study required node negative patients to have a primary tumour of &gt; 1 cm. Eligibility criteria for each trial are tabulated in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table.</P>
<P>Both pre- and post-menopausal women were eligible in all included studies. In the <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK> study, post-menopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumours and fewer than four positive axillary nodes were excluded.</P>
<P>This review did not include neoadjuvant chemotherapy studies. The <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK> study enrolled patients prior to surgery and included a neoadjuvant treatment arm. The review only included the two adjuvant chemotherapy arms of this study, one which contained a taxane drug in the treatment regimen and one that did not. The <LINK REF="STD-MD-Anderson-CC" TYPE="STUDY">MD Anderson CC</LINK> study was excluded as the data from the neoadjuvant and adjuvant arms could not be analysed separately.</P>
<P>When considering the taxane containing chemotherapy regimens of the included studies, the number of chemotherapy treatment cycles was either the same or more than for the comparator non-taxane containing regimens. The addition of extra cycles of chemotherapy to the taxane containing regimen has been considered as a potential confounding factor in favour of the taxane containing arms of the studies. Four of the eligible studies used a taxane containing arm which also delivered a longer duration or more cycles of chemotherapy than in the control arm (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK> study combined analysis of the two taxane containing arms, one of which used a longer duration with more cycles of chemotherapy and one that did not.</P>
<P>The median follow up of patients ranged from 36 months (<LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>) to 69 months (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>). The weighted average median follow-up was 60.4 months.</P>
<P>Not all trials reported data on all outcomes. Eleven trials reported on disease-free survival (DFS) although the terminology and definitions used differed slightly between trials (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Definitions were the same in both the experimental and control arms of each trial and, for the purposes of the review, all breast cancer recurrence events under the different definitions were combined.</P>
<P>[<LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>)]The number of events in each arm of the <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK> study for DFS was not reported therefore this study was not included in the DFS analysis. One study did not report data on overall survival (BIG 2-98) and was not included for this part of the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>All trials reported some toxicity data with the exception of two studies that were only reported in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>). One further study published in abstract form reported only symptomatic cardiac toxicity (<LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was limited data collection of quality of life measures, two studies reported quality of life as a secondary endpoint (<LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P> Each study was independently assessed for quality and potential for bias by two review authors (AN and TF) using a structured checklist based on the MERGE criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Liddle-J-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liddle J 1996</LINK>). Quality assessment was based on:<BR/>quality of randomisation (generation of sequence and allocation concealment);<BR/>- blinding;<BR/>- standardisation, validity, and reliability of outcome measures; <BR/>- equal application of follow up and outcome measures to all treatment groups;<BR/>- comparability between treatment arms at baseline;<BR/>- loss to follow up; and<BR/>- inclusion of all randomised participants in the analysis (intention-to-treat analysis).</P>
<P>Each criterion was evaluated as: (a) entirely fulfilled; (b1) mostly fulfilled; (b2) mostly not fulfilled; (c) not at all fulfilled; not described adequately; or not applicable (n/a).<BR/>A code was assigned for overall study quality reflecting: low risk of bias (A); low to moderate risk of bias (B1); moderate to high risk of bias (B2); or high risk of bias (C), based on the MERGE criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Liddle-J-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liddle J 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Allocation concealment is regarded as particularly important in protecting against bias and was graded using the Cochrane approach, as follows (See Characteristics of included studies). </P>
<P>Grade A: clearly adequate concealment. </P>
<P>Grade B: possibly adequate concealment. </P>
<P>Grade C: clearly inadequate concealment .</P>
<P>All included studies were of sufficiently high quality to consider the risk of bias as low, or low to moderate. Nine studies were assigned quality grade A for allocation concealment and quality of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK>). In three studies, reporting of randomisation methods was insufficient to give a grade above b2 (<LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>). No studies were blinded to treatment, a common practice in phase III clinical trials in advanced cancer due to the difficulty of blinding to different infusion times, schedules, and toxicities. This is unlikely to bias the results of any study as the outcome measures were uniformly measured by time to event and were not subject to observer or patient bias in interpretation.</P>
<P>All included studies had a time-to-event primary outcome. Definitions of the primary outcome were specified in detail in all seven full publications (grade a: <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK>). None of the five publications in abstract form defined the outcome measures adequately (grade b1: <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>). Where observation of the outcome measures was described in the different treatment groups, follow up was reported as identical in all treatment arms (grade a). Again, the five trials reported in abstract form did not specify similar follow up between treatment groups and were, therefore, graded as unknown (<LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment groups were well balanced in most studies (grade a: <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK>). Where minor imbalances were reported, these were considered by the review authors to be unlikely to bias the outcome of the trial (grade b1: <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK>). No comment on balance was made in one abstract, although rigorous stratification for balance was described (grade unknown: <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>).</P>
<P>All seven full publications described intention-to-treat analysis and minimal patient loss to follow up, which was accounted for and described (grade a). Only one abstract described intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>), and this aspect of quality was not described in the other abstracts (grade unknown: <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall study quality was high, with all seven full publications obtaining an overall quality rating of A (low risk of bias). All included abstracts received a rating of B1 (low to moderate risk of bias), again due to omissions in reporting that may be attributed to the constraints of the abstract format rather than to study conduct. Quality scores will be updated when full publications become available.</P>

A second group which used paclitaxel contained five studies (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>). Both groups showed a statistically significant HR favouring the taxane treatment groups over control for both OS and DFS. In the analysis of OS, the docetaxel group included 9377 women and the paclitaxel group included 8927 women. The HR for the docetaxel group was 0.76 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.86, P &lt; 0.0001); and the HR for the paclitaxel group was 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.94, P &lt; 0.001).

<P>Taxane treatment was given either concurrently with anthracycline or sequentially and it is unclear whether this scheduling impacts on efficacy. Analysis was performed to examine this question. Toxicity differences between the two schedules are discussed separately.</P>
<P>Overall survival: seven studies (12,004 women) administered the taxane and anthracycline sequentially in the experimental arm (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>).

<I>Lymph node status</I>
</P>
<P>Variations in inclusion criteria between the studies may have impacted on the risk of recurrence. Analysis was performed to examine whether there was any indication that the benefit of taxane ontaining treatment was greater in studies accruing lymph node positive-only women as compared to studies that included both lymph node negative and lymph node positive women. It was identified that studies allowing participation of women without lymph node involvement generally required other high-risk features for inclusion.</P>
<P>Overall survival: six studies included in the analysis required positive axillary lymph node metastasis status for eligibility (11,890 women and 1903 deaths) (<LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>).

<I>Addition of taxane or substitution of taxane</I>
</P>
<P>This analysis separated groups into those where there was the addition of a taxane to the control chemotherapy studies (Q1) and studies where the taxane was substituted for part of the control chemotherapy (Q3). This analysis was performed as it has been postulated that the benefit from taxane treatment could in part be due to addition of an extra non-cross resistant drug rather than superior efficacy due to the taxane itself.<BR/>
<BR/>Overall survival: five studies (8651 women) were designed such that the experimental arm consisted of a taxane administered in addition to the control chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>).

<I>Duration of chemotherapy<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>Studies have been examined post-hoc to examine whether or not a longer duration of chemotherapy in the taxane arm may explain the observed improvement in outcomes. The groups were divided according to duration of total planned treatment rather than total number of planned cycles to account for variation in cycle length between studies.</P>
<P>Overall survival: four studies (7747 women) included a taxane containing experimental arm that was of longer duration than the control arm (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_28" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-28</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK>).

<BR/>This post-hoc analysis examined studies that administered three cycles of the taxane drug in comparison with those studies that used four or more cycles of taxane in the experimental arm. This was to determine if the number of cycles of taxane impacted on efficacy. There were limitations to this analysis due to the heterogeneity between studies with the use of different control regimens and varying doses and scheduling of the taxane drug. The <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK> study included two taxane arms, one administered three cycles of taxane and the other four.

<B>Toxicity</B>
</I>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>Toxic effects of taxane therapy have been well characterised and were expected to be observed in the taxane containing arms. There was heterogeneity between studies with the use of different control chemotherapies and varying doses and scheduling of the taxane drug. This heterogeneity needs to be considered on a trial by trial basis to interpret the tolerability of each taxane containing regimen. Toxicity data were extracted and combined for analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>Of the 12 included studies 10 provided extractable data on toxicity. No toxicity data could be extracted from the <LINK REF="STD-BIG-2_x002d_98" TYPE="STUDY">BIG 2-98</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-Taxit-216" TYPE="STUDY">Taxit 216</LINK> studies. Data were extracted and analysed for cardiotoxicity, febrile neutropenia, grade 3 or 4 nausea and/or vomiting, secondary leukaemia or myelodysplasia, grade 3 or 4 fatigue, and grade 3 or 4 stomatitis. These outcomes are illustrated in comparisons and data 09 and in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. Definitions of toxicity varied between the studies and the specific definitions from each study are reported in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. When toxicity was reported as less than 1% it was treated as 0% for the purposes of the statistical comparison. There were insufficient data reported for other toxicities to analyse them in this manner and these were discussed qualitatively. It was not possible to determine the treated population (that is only those women receiving chemotherapy) in all studies (<LINK REF="STD-CALGB-9344" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB 9344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-E2197" TYPE="STUDY">E2197</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GEICAM-9906" TYPE="STUDY">GEICAM 9906</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK>). In these cases the randomised population was used for the denominator when calculating the odds ratio. It is also noted that the cardiotoxicity events reported in the <LINK REF="STD-ECTO" TYPE="STUDY">ECTO</LINK> study were calculated using the incidence derived from both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant arms.</P>
<P>Six studies provided extractable data on cardiotoxicity. The pooled analysis of these studies did not demonstrate a difference in the risk of developing cardiotoxicity between taxane containing and non-taxane containing regimens (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.55). Where the same dose of anthracycline was used in the taxane containing arm and the control arm, the OR for cardiotoxicity was 1.24 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.86) which was not statistically significant and does not exclude the possibility of increased risk with this treatment scheduling. However, there was a significant reduction in the risk of cardiotoxicity for studies that had a lower planned dose of anthracycline in the experimental arm than the control arm (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98). Only one study was designed with the taxane replacing the anthracycline and this found no statistically significant reduction in cardiotoxicity for the taxane containing arm (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.08). There was no significant heterogeneity accross studies (chi-square = 8.97, df = 5, p = 0.11)</P>
<P>Seven studies provided data on febrile neutropenia. Other myelosuppression toxicity data were reported in multiple studies (grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, grade 3 to 4 infection, and infection requiring antibiotics), however, febrile neutropenia was the most consistently reported outcome. The pooled analysis of these studies found an increase in febrile neutropenia in the taxane containing arms (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.66). The risk was highest for studies that administered the taxane concurrently with an anthracycline (OR 6.80, 95% CI 1.91 to 24.15) rather than sequential taxane and anthracycline treatment (OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.48 to 5.17). There was significant heterogeneity across studies (chi-square = 145, df = 6, p&lt;0.00001).</P>
<P>Five studies were pooled to analyse grade 3 or 4 nausea and/or vomiting and this found a lower risk for the women treated with a taxane containing regimen (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.77). Four studies were pooled to analyse grade 3 or 4 fatigue, with no significant increase in fatigue in the taxane containing regimens (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.89). There were no increase in grade 3 or 4 stomatitis in the taxane containing group from five pooled studies (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.82).</P>
<P>Overall, the incidence of other toxicities was low. Grade 3 or 4 myalgia or arthralgia, or both, were reported in three studies. The incidence of this toxicity was low for both treatment groups but it occurred more frequently in the taxane containing arms (2% versus 0.3% in <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>, 1% v ersus &lt; 1% in <LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK>, and 1.3% versus 0.3% in <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>). Nail changes were reported in three studies and occurred more frequently in the taxane containing arms (0.4% versus 0.1% in <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>, 55% versus 10% in <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>, and 10.3% versus 1.0% in <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK>). Grade 3 or 4 allergy was reported in three studies and occurred more frequently in patients receiving taxanes (3.7% versus 0.3% in <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK>, 1.3% versus 0.1% in <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>, and 2.2% versus 0.0% in the <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK> study). Grade 3 or 4 oedema was an infrequent event. It occurred in &lt; 1% of women in both arms of the <LINK REF="STD-US-Oncology" TYPE="STUDY">US Oncology</LINK> study, and occurred more frequently in the taxane containing arm of three other studies (0.5 versus 0.1% in <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK>, 1.4% versus 0.0% in <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>, and 4.8 versus 0.3% in the <LINK REF="STD-PACS-01" TYPE="STUDY">PACS 01</LINK> study). There was inconsistent reporting of neurotoxicity. The <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK> study reported overall neurosensory effects occurring in 25.5% in the taxane containing arm versus 10.2% in the control arm, however no grade 3 or 4 events occurred in either arm. The <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK> study reported an incidence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity of 1.4% in the taxane containing arm and 2.9% in the control arm (vinorelbine arm).

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review provides strong evidence to conclude that the use of a taxane drug as part of the adjuvant chemotherapy regimen following surgery for early stage breast cancer in women with moderate-to-high risk of recurrence provides a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). In these women the HR for both OS and DFS was 0.81 favouring the use of a taxane as part of the adjuvant chemotherapy regimen when compared to adjuvant regimens that did not contain a taxane.</P>
<P>This review included 12 studies (totalling 21,191 randomised women, 2483 deaths, and 4800 recurrence events), which is an adequate number to establish conclusive results. Some studies remain somewhat short term (immature) in follow up for this population, however, there is no evidence that the HR will change over time. There was no significant statistical heterogeneity between the included studies. We identified at least seven ongoing studies and there may be further unpublished studies which have not been identified in this review. It is possible that publication bias in favour of significant findings may have led to an overestimation of the overall treatment effect however funnel plots do not support this. </P>
<P>Further results from the <LINK REF="STD-NCIC_x002d_CTG-MA21" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC-CTG MA21</LINK> study are awaited as interim results suggest less benefit in a taxane containing arm when compared to the non-taxane containing control arm. The study was unable to be included in this review as the interim efficacy analysis did not publish patient and event numbers in each treatment arm. This study found that six cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil (CEF) was superior to four cycles of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by four cycles of three-weekly paclitaxel; the HR for DFS was 1.49 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.99, P = 0.005) against the taxane containing arm. This analysis was done at a median follow up of 30.4 months and OS data is not yet reported. The review will be updated as further results are published. </P>
<P>The results of this meta-analysis are in accordance with the findings of a previous meta-analysis by Bria et al. Their meta-analysis included nine studies with 15,598 and 15,074 women analysed for DFS and OS, respectively. Bria et al reported the relative risks for DFS and OS to be 0.86 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.90) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.93) in favour of the taxane containing treatment group (<LINK REF="REF-Bria-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bria 2006</LINK>). The meta-analysis by Bria et al included the <LINK REF="STD-MD-Anderson-CC" TYPE="STUDY">MD Anderson CC</LINK> trial that was excluded in this current review as the published efficacy data did not distinguish results for adjuvant patients from those for neoadjuvant patients. Four additional trials were also included in the current review which provides even stronger supporting evidence for the efficacy of taxane containing regimens.</P>
<P>Overall the taxane containing regimens were well tolerated, with acceptable toxicities. There was a difference in toxicity in taxane containing regimens when compared to non-taxane containing regimens. This is not unexpected based on the established toxicity profiles of the taxane drugs. There was an increased rate of febrile neutropenia, neurotoxicity, nail changes, myalgia and arthralgia, allergy, and oedema in the taxane containing regimens . There was less nausea and vomiting in the taxane containing regimens and no significant difference in the risk for cardiotoxicity, stomatitis, fatigue, secondary haematologic or other second cancers, or for treatment-related death. There was less cardiotoxicity seen in taxane containing regimens that employed less anthracycline than in the control arm. Only two studies reported QoL results. The <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG-001" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG 001</LINK> study found that the taxane containing regimen caused a greater reduction in QoL scores than the control arm during chemotherapy which then returned to baseline for both arms. The <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG</LINK> study did not find significant differences in QoL scores. </P>
<P>The side-by-side subgroup analysis looked at the relative efficacy for each type of taxane. For docetaxel and paclitaxel the HR for OS was 0.76 (range 0.67 to 0.86) and 0.85 (range 0.76 to 0.94) respectively; and for DFS the HR was 0.80 (range 0.74 to 0.87) and 0.82 (range 0.76 to 0.89) respectively. Whilst the hazard ratio for docetaxel is numerically superior, at least for overall survival, the confidence intervals of the two comparisons overlap and a test for interaction would not be statistically significant. No conclusions can be drawn about the relative efficacy of the two agents without a direct comparison. Such direct comparisons are ongoing.</P>
<P>Some clinical heterogeneity existed between studies, with variation in choice of control chemotherapy, doses, and scheduling of chemotherapy. Post-hoc analyses in a side-by-side comparison of pooled data were performed for a number of subgroups. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from this exercise. There does not appear to be any less benefit when the taxane is substituted for part of the control regimen as opposed to adding it to the control regimen. This is also the case when comparing taxane regimens of the same duration rather than longer duration than the control regimen, three cycles of taxane treatment rather than four or more, and a sequential anthracycline and taxane combination rather than concurrent scheduling. The choice of taxane, how best to incorporate it, and optimal doses and scheduling are questions which further clinical trials will address and hopefully answer.</P>
<P>The review does not provide any evidence to restrict adjuvant taxane chemotherapy to node positive women, with efficacy appearing equivalent in trials which included both node positive and node negative groups. However, the absolute recurrence risk of an individual patient needs to be considered when making clinical decisions on the use of a taxane containing adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Further questions which are beyond the scope of this review include efficacy in ER positive and negative groups, efficacy in women with more than 4 involved axillary lymph nodes, and the role of HER2 status.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is strong evidence to conclude that the use of a taxane drug as part of the adjuvant chemotherapy regimen following surgery for early stage breast cancer improves both overall survival and disease-free survival in women with moderate to high risk of recurrence. A taxane containing regimen should be considered for women in this situation following assessment of their individual risk of recurrence and comorbidities. There is additional but acceptable toxicity associated with the use of a taxane containing regimen. Toxicity implications should be discussed with individual women who are considering taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimens.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A next generation of studies are required to further define the precise role of taxanes as adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer. Ongoing and future randomised trials comparing docetaxel with paclitaxel; addressing questions of dose density, scheduling, and duration; and looking at how best to combine taxane and anthracycline-based treatment, and how to combine taxanes with trastuzumab in women with HER2 positive disease will help answer these questions.</P>
