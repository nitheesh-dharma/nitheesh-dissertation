High-dose ketamine does not appear to be effective and may be associated with serious side effects.</P><P><B>Background</B></P><P>This review is an update of a review first published in 2003 and updated in 2012.</P><P>Morphine-like drugs (opioids) are frequently prescribed for moderate and severe cancer pain, but in some cases these drugs are not effective. Ketamine, an anaesthetic agent, is used in low doses in palliative care to improve analgesia when opioids alone are ineffective.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>In December 2016 and January 2017, we searched for clinical trials on the addition of ketamine to morphine-like drugs for cancer pain.</P><P>We found one new study, together with the two studies included in the original review. The three studies were very different, using different doses of ketamine, different routes of administration and different durations of treatment and it was not possible to combine the results of these studies.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>The two smallest studies reported that the addition of ketamine to morphine reduced pain intensity and morphine requirements. The third study which used high doses of ketamine reported no clinical benefit of adding ketamine to different opioids. Increased doses of ketamine in some participants caused side effects such as hallucinations. The study which examined high doses of ketamine reported two serious adverse events, which may have been related to ketamine. Although two out of three studies reported reduction in pain, this could be due to chance in such small studies.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>We rated the quality of the evidence using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. The evidence from the studies was of very low quality. There were problems with the design of some studies and there were not enough data to answer some parts of our review question.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-06-27 10:39:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-06-26 10:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rae F Bell"><P>This is an update of a review first published in 2003 and updated in 2012. </P><P>Ketamine is a commonly used anaesthetic agent, and in subanaesthetic doses is also given as an adjuvant to opioids for the treatment of refractory cancer pain, when opioids alone or in combination with appropriate adjuvant analgesics prove to be ineffective. Ketamine is known to have psychomimetic (including hallucinogenic), urological, and hepatic adverse effects.</P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-05-04 11:09:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine"><P>To determine the effectiveness and adverse effects of ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for refractory cancer pain in adults.</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-06-27 10:39:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine"><P>For this update, we searched MEDLINE (OVID) to December 2016. We searched CENTRAL (CRSO), Embase (OVID) and two clinical trial registries to January 2017.</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-06-26 10:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rae F Bell"><P>The intervention considered by this review was the addition of ketamine, given by any route of administration, in any dose, to pre-existing opioid treatment given by any route and in any dose, compared with placebo or active control. We included studies with a group size of at least 10 participants who completed the trial.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-06-26 10:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rae F Bell"><P>Two review authors independently assessed the search results and performed 'Risk of bias' assessments. We aimed to extract data on patient-reported pain intensity, total opioid consumption over the study period; use of rescue medication; adverse events; measures of patient satisfaction/preference; function; and distress. We also assessed participant withdrawal (dropout) from trial. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-26 10:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rae F Bell"><P>One new study (185 participants) was identified by the updated search and included in the review. We included a total of three studies in this update.</P><P>Two small studies, both with cross-over design, with 20 and 10 participants respectively, were eligible for inclusion in the original review. One study with 20 participants examined the addition of intrathecal ketamine to intrathecal morphine, compared with intrathecal morphine alone. The second study with 10 participants examined the addition of intravenous ketamine bolus in two different doses to ongoing morphine therapy, compared with placebo. Both of these studies reported reduction in pain intensity and reduction in morphine requirements when ketamine was added to opioid for refractory cancer pain. The new study identified by the updated search had a parallel group design and 185 participants. This placebo-controlled study examined rapid titration of subcutaneous ketamine to high dose (500 mg) in participants who were using different opioids. There were no differences between groups for patient-reported pain intensity.</P><P>Pooling of the data from the three included trials was not appropriate because of clinical heterogeneity.</P><P>The study examining intrathecal drug administration reported no adverse events related to ketamine. In the study using intravenous bolus administration, ketamine caused hallucinations in four of 10 participants. In the rapid dose escalation/high-dose subcutaneous ketamine study, there was almost twice the incidence of adverse events in the ketamine group, compared to the placebo group, with the most common adverse events being needle site irritation and cognitive disturbance. Two serious adverse events (bradyarrhythmia and cardiac arrest) thought to be related to ketamine were also reported in this trial.</P><P>For all three studies there was an unclear risk of bias overall. Using GRADE, we judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to study limitations and imprecision due to the small number of participants in all comparisons.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-06-26 10:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rae F Bell"><P>Current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for the relief of refractory cancer pain. The evidence was of very low quality, meaning that it does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect, and the likelihood that the effect will be substantially different is high. Rapid dose escalation of ketamine to high dose (500 mg) does not appear to have clinical benefit and may be associated with serious adverse events. More randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining specific low-dose ketamine clinical regimens in current use are needed.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2017-06-27 11:42:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-06-26 10:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rae F Bell"><P>This is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003, Issue 1 (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2003</LINK>)), and updated in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2012b</LINK>) on ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for cancer pain.</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-06-26 10:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rae F Bell"><P>Studies report that moderate to severe pain is common in patients with advanced cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Are-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Are 2017</LINK>). Cancer pain that is refractory to standard treatment occurs in 10% to 20% of these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Afsharimani-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afsharimani 2015</LINK>). Cancer pain is often of mixed aetiology and may have nociceptive, neuropathic and inflammatory components. Neuropathic pain which results from tumour infiltration in nerve plexi and damage of nerve tissue can be especially difficult to treat (<LINK REF="REF-Fallon-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fallon 2013</LINK>). Opioids (for example, morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxycodone, codeine) are frequently prescribed for the relief of moderate and severe cancer pain. However, not all cancer pain is sufficiently relieved by opioids alone.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-06-26 10:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rae F Bell"><P>The usual indication for using ketamine as an adjuvant to opioid in cancer pain is for pain which is unresponsive to opioids and adjuvant analgesics, for example in the case of refractory neuropathic pain or opioid tolerance. Clinical reports indicate that, when added to opioids, low subanaesthetic doses of ketamine may give improved analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Sosnowski-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sosnowski 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1999</LINK>). The practice of using ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids in the treatment of cancer pain that does not respond to opioids alone, or to opioids in combination with adjuvant analgesic drugs, is discussed in several pain and palliative care textbooks (<LINK REF="REF-Stannard-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stannard 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Twycross-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twycross 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cherny-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherny 2015</LINK>). Ketamine is not licensed for this purpose and this is an update of the first systematic review undertaken to establish the evidence base for this practice.</P><P>Ketamine hydrochloride has been used as a general anaesthetic agent for over 30 years, and is commonly given intravenously or intramuscularly for surgical anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2000</LINK>). Ketamine causes dissociative anaesthesia and also has analgesic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Grahame_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grahame-Smith 2002</LINK>); because it increases sympathetic nervous system activity, it is a useful anaesthetic for high-risk patients who require a high degree of sympathetic activity to maintain cardiovascular function. However, the benefits are tempered by the high incidence of hallucinations and other transient psychomimetic sequelae when ketamine is used for anaesthesia in adults (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2012</LINK>). More recently, urological toxicity and hepatic toxicity have been described as adverse effects of ketamine (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2012a</LINK>).</P><P>In the 1980s ketamine was discovered to have N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist properties and acts by blocking excitatory glutamate receptors in the central nervous system. There is an association between nociceptive activity involving the NMDA receptor and hyperalgesia/allodynia, and reduced opioid sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Dickenson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickenson 1994</LINK>). The NMDA receptor plays a role in the development of opioid tolerance (<LINK REF="REF-Trujillo-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trujillo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mao-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mao 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayer 1995</LINK>). Currently, there is much focus on ketamine for the treatment of major depression. A recent paper reports that ketamine metabolites exert antidepressant actions independent of NMDA receptor inhibition (<LINK REF="REF-Zanos-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanos 2016</LINK>).</P><P>Evidence from experimental animal models, human volunteer studies and small clinical trials indicates that subanaesthetic doses of ketamine alleviate various chronic and neuropathic pain syndromes (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2000</LINK>). Ketamine has anti-inflammatory effects and may have an effect in inflammatory pain (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sawynok-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawynok 2014</LINK>). However, the clinical use of ketamine at subanaesthetic dose levels has also been restricted by unpleasant adverse effects, typically sedation, nausea, disagreeable psychological disturbances or hallucinations (<LINK REF="REF-Willetts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willetts 1990</LINK>).</P><P>Racemic ketamine is a mixture of two stereoisomers: R(-) and S(+). More recently, S-ketamine has been introduced. S(+) ketamine produces longer hypnosis than the (-) isomer, and causes a greater rise in blood pressure and heart rate, less locomotor activity, and a shorter recovery time, and it is postulated to have twice the analgesic efficacy of racemic ketamine. S(+) ketamine is also thought to have a safer adverse effect profile (<LINK REF="REF-Grahame_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grahame-Smith 2002</LINK>). The majority of published clinical studies in postoperative and chronic pain have used racemic ketamine. For a review on the pharmacokinetics of ketamine see <LINK REF="REF-Peltoniemi-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peltoniemi 2016</LINK>. The oral bioavailability of ketamine is low and the drug undergoes fast cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated N-demethylation to norketamine. Approximately 80% of ketamine undergoes N-demethylation to norketamine by CYP3A and CYP2B6 enzymes (<LINK REF="REF-Kharasch-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kharasch 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yanagihara-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanagihara 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hijazi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hijazi 2002</LINK>), with a smaller amount being metabolised to 4-and 6-hydroxyketamines (<LINK REF="REF-Woolf-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolf 1987</LINK>). Compared to ketamine, norketamine is an approximately three to five times weaker NMDA receptor antagonist (<LINK REF="REF-Leung-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebert-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebert 1997</LINK>). Being metabolised by CYP3A enzymes, ketamine may have significant interactions with opioids and other drugs. Studies in rodents indicate important interactions between ketamine and opioids. <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2002</LINK> reported that in mice, distribution of ketamine into the brain was increased by low plasma concentrations of alfentanil. Recently <LINK REF="REF-Lilius-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lilius 2015</LINK> found that ketamine co-administration attenuates morphine tolerance and leads to increased brain concentrations of both drugs in the rat.</P><P>Ketamine has multiple routes of administration and is commonly given as an adjuvant to pre-existing opioid treatment. A number of systematic reviews report that ketamine is effective in acute postoperative pain and reduces morphine requirements (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laskowski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laskowski 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Assouline-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assouline 2016</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-06-26 10:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rae F Bell"><P>By blocking activity at the NMDA receptor, ketamine may reduce neuropathic-related cancer pain. Blocking NMDA receptor activity may reduce opioid tolerance thus increasing/restoring the analgesic effect of opioid. Ketamine has anti-inflammatory effects and may be beneficial in inflammatory cancer pain.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-06-26 10:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rae F Bell"><P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2012. Ketamine is routinely used in the palliative care setting for the treatment of refractory cancer pain. Earlier versions of this review found limited and heterogenous data, and there was insufficient evidence to be able to make any conclusions. In recent years the standards used to assess evidence in pain trials have changed substantially, for example there is now particular attention being paid to participant withdrawal from trials, and statistical imputation following withdrawal, which can substantially alter estimates of efficacy. The most important change is the move from using average pain scores, or average change in pain scores, to the number of people who have a large decrease in pain (by at least 50%) (<LINK REF="REF-PaPaS-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">PaPaS 2012</LINK>).

We excluded studies using a non-random process (e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number).</LI><LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). The method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment determines whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); unclear risk of bias (method not clearly stated).

We assessed the methods used to blind study participants and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.

We assessed the methods used to deal with incomplete data as: low risk (&lt; 10% of participants did not complete the study or used &#8216;baseline observation carried forward&#8217; analysis, or both); unclear risk of bias (used 'last observation carried forward' analysis); high risk of bias (used 'completer' analysis).</LI><LI>Selective reporting (reporting bias). We assessed the risk of reporting bias as: low risk of bias (all intended outcomes reported); unclear risk of bias (any anomaly in reporting, such as participants contributing more than one set of data, or some outcomes not participant-reported); high risk of bias (prespecified outcome of interest not reported).</LI><LI>Size of study (checking for possible biases confounded by small size).

Two small early studies <LINK REF="STD-Yang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2000</LINK> report reduction in pain intensity and reduction in morphine requirements. These two studies are of high risk of bias due to small sample size, and incomplete reporting. The new study from <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 2012</LINK> has unclear risk of bias due to size and incomplete reporting. <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 2012</LINK> reports no difference in their primary outcomes between groups. Overall, we cannot provide a reliable indication of the likely effect of ketamine, at any dose, as an adjuvant to opioids in cancer pain. Adverse events such as hallucinations and cognitive disturbance were reported for higher doses of ketamine. Two serious adverse events (bradyarrhythmia and cardiac arrest) reported in the trial examining rapid titration of ketamine to high dose were thought to be possibly related to the study drug.</P><P>There is large body of evidence demonstrating the efficacy of ketamine in acute postoperative pain. While this evidence cannot be directly extrapolated to other patient groups, it is important to note the complex pathophysiology of cancer pain and the difficulties of conducting clinical trials in palliative care. The authors of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 2012</LINK> should be commended for recruiting an impressive number of participants. The data from this trial could potentially provide further information on clinical questions such as whether ketamine has beneficial interactions with specific opioids, since both preclinical and clinical research have suggested that this is the case when ketamine is used as an adjuvant to morphine (<LINK REF="REF-Lilius-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lilius 2015</LINK>). To date, the fact that the participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 2012</LINK> trial used different opioids has not been addressed and the subgroup analyses based on type and dose of opioid have not been reported. We contacted the authors with a request for access to individual patient data, however the request was declined because such analyses were not stated in our original protocol for this review.</P><P>It is worth noting, also, that the dose escalation in the <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 2012</LINK> trial was very rapid, considering the pharmacokinetics of ketamine which has a short &#945; half-life (two to four minutes) and longer &#946; half-life (two to four hours) in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Peltoniemi-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peltoniemi 2016</LINK>), and where steady state is achieved after five elimination half-lives. The metabolite norketamine, which is also active has a much longer half-life than ketamine, and very ill cancer patients would be likely to have a much poorer elimination than young healthy volunteers. Ketamine doses in the <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 2012</LINK> trial were higher than those used in the majority of ketamine regimens described in the literature. It is interesting that ketamine was found to have better effect in patients with high pain scores, however this was not mentioned in the abstract. The same finding is reported in a systematic review of 70 randomised controlled trials of intravenous ketamine for postoperative analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Laskowski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laskowski 2011</LINK>). In clinical practice, ketamine is usually considered to be a third-line drug which is reserved for patients with high pain intensity scores, despite adequate ongoing opioid therapy and co-analgesics. <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 2012</LINK> included patients with a BPI pain intensity score of three at baseline and also patients being treated with comparatively low doses of opioid.</P><P>All three trials used pain intensity scores as the primary outcome. Percentage pain relief may be a more useful and reliable outcome measure (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>).</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Other reports considered in the original review (2003)</HEADING><P>Because of the paucity of data available from RCTs in the original review, we considered information presented in case studies and case series reports of ketamine for chronic cancer pain. In addition to the two RCTs included, the original review (2003) identified 32 case reports or open-label, uncontrolled trials describing improvement of opioid analgesia with ketamine. We did not consider case studies and reports in the updated review.</P><P>Whilst the design of these studies and the issue of publication of positive outcomes preclude the inclusion of any data from these reports in this systematic review, the studies were discussed in the original review and are reported in this update in order to provide a more comprehensive review of the literature on this topic. Case reports cannot provide evidence for efficacy but may provide valuable information on adverse effects. They are, by definition, all of low quality.</P><P>The 32 reports described the use of ketamine to treat refractory cancer pain, frequently described as neuropathic pain. The total number of participants treated with ketamine in these reports was 246. The route of ketamine administration included oral, intramuscular bolus, subcutaneous bolus and infusion, intravenous bolus and infusion, epidural bolus, and intrathecal infusion. Ketamine doses ranged from 1 mg/kg/day subcutaneous infusion to 600 mg/day intravenously and 67.2 mg/day intrathecally. Treatment duration ranged from four hours to one year. Treatment was in most cases adjuvant to opioid and other drugs. Twenty-eight reports described improved analgesia with ketamine. Where ketamine was administered as an adjuvant to opioids, the most commonly used opioid was morphine, but in some cases ketamine was given as an adjuvant to fentanyl (<LINK REF="REF-Ventura-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ventura 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1999</LINK>), hydromorphone (<LINK REF="REF-Fine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 1999</LINK>) or diamorphine (<LINK REF="REF-Garry-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garry 1996</LINK>), or combinations of these. Ketamine was also used as sole analgesic in three reports (<LINK REF="REF-Parada-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parada 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whizar_x002d_Lugo-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whizar-Lugo 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oshima-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oshima 1990</LINK>).

In general, adverse events were not reported as severe and only two studies reported patient withdrawal from treatment because of unacceptable "adverse cognitive effects" (<LINK REF="REF-Garry-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garry 1996</LINK>), and pronounced sedation (<LINK REF="REF-Klahr-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klahr 1997</LINK>). One report described sedation which improved on tapering the opioid dose (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1999</LINK>).

However, the evidence base for ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for the treatment of cancer pain is insufficient to enable us to draw any conclusions.</P></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-06-26 10:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Rae F Bell"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">General implications</HEADING><P>The amount of clinical trial evidence in this review is limited. Studies investigating specific low-dose ketamine treatment regimens commonly used for refractory cancer pain are needed.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Design</HEADING><P>Conducting scientifically sound trials in a population of terminally ill cancer patients is a considerable challenge, and this is perhaps reflected in the small number of published trials available for this review. It is difficult to recruit large numbers of patients from this population. Cross-over designs, as used in the two of the three included studies, may be more appropriate than placebo-controlled parallel group studies. Where there are large trials, planned subgroup analyses should be considered.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Measurement (endpoints)</HEADING><P>Outcomes should be clearly defined, and trial managers should also restrict study outcomes to those that are the most clinically useful, such as which route of administration, relevant dose, co-analgesic effects with specific opioids, and the cost to the patient in terms of adverse events.</P><P>Whether ketamine is more effective in combination with specific opioids is not known, and this is an area for further research. Rapid titration of ketamine to high dose (<LINK REF="STD-Hardy-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 2012</LINK>) had no clinical benefit and was associated with adverse events. Further studies examining this specific treatment regimen are not warranted. Trials with S-ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids might be appropriate.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Other</HEADING><P>Opioid tolerance may also be an issue. It has been suggested that pharmacological tolerance to opioid can develop early (<LINK REF="REF-Laulin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laulin 2002</LINK>), but it is not clear how often it is a clinical problem in cancer patients. It may be difficult in this patient population to distinguish between tolerance and disease progression, both of which require an increase in opioid dose. In patients who appear to have a problem tolerating opioids, ketamine in low dose may be a treatment option. This is a topic for future research.</P><P>More information is needed on whether the route of administration of ketamine has an impact on its effectiveness as an analgesic. If ketamine is used spinally, issues of neurotoxicity should be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Karpinski-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karpinski 1997</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-06-16 13:04:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine"><P>The updated review was supported by the Regional Centre of Excellence for Palliative Care at Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway which funds a part-time research position for RFB.<BR/></P><P>Searches for the current update were performed by Joanne Abbott.

MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine"><P>Name: David Currow</P><P>Email Address: <A HREF="mailto:david.currow@sa.gov.au">david.currow@sa.gov.au</A></P><P>Affiliation: Flinders University</P><P>Role: Professor of Palliative &amp; Supportive Services</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Comment</HEADING><P>The systematic review has suggested that &#8216;Hardy et al. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of subcutaneous ketamine in the management of cancer pain. Journal of Clinical Oncology 2012;30(29):3611-7&#8217; is low level evidence. Using the Cochrane Grade tool, it is not clear how this could be the conclusion given the parameters that are included in the tool. The tool is copied below and the way the design and conduct of the study was undertaken is outlined in detail for each.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Methods of sequence generation</HEADING><P>At each centre, patients were sequentially allocated a patient number on referral to the study. This number was kept within the Patient Master Index, linking the patient name with the number allocated. Strata tables were developed for each site using random number tables, generated at an independent centre (central registry). Treatment for each patient was allocated according to a block randomisation (blocks of 4) schedule held by the central registry in a 1:1 ratio. Block randomisation ensured even allocation to each code. The central registry supplied strata tables to each site pharmacy. Stratification was according to pain type: (neuropathic or nociceptive), according to the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) scale. On notification of a participant, the pharmacist at each site consulted the strata table according to the strata determined by the LANSS scale score, and allocated the next code available according to the supplied strata table and prepared the active or inactive drug delivered in a labeled syringe. The participant ID, allocation code, dates of request, preparation, and dispensing were recorded in a log maintained by the pharmacist.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Allocation concealment</HEADING><P>At all times, from eligibility screening to completion of the study, all study staff are unaware of the treatment allocation. Allocation was concealed from the investigator at the time of the participant inclusion in the trial.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding - Participants</HEADING><P>All syringes were prepared according to the randomisation schedule. Each syringe was numbered according to the pre-determined randomisation code and labelled as ketamine/placebo 100mg, 300mg or 500mg in normal saline according to the prescription from the investigator. All syringes looked identical in volume and colour to preserve the blinding irrespective of the contents. Study syringes were supplied to the inpatient units and stored in a locked cupboard that met state regulations for this schedule of drug.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding - Providers</HEADING><P>Treatment allocation was not disclosed to study staff, treating clinicians or investigators at any stage during the study.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding - Outcome assessors</HEADING><P>There were no cases of extreme emergency where knowledge of the code would have had significant consequences with respect to clinical decision making. Therefore, no unblinding occurred during the study. Adverse events including skin toxicity and psychomimetic events were documented in patients in both arms. Therefore it was not possible to differentiate clinically between arms.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Loss to follow up</HEADING><P>No patient was lost to follow up. Those participants who had completed 24 hours at maximum dose (500 mg/24 hours) without a response were deemed to have completed the study as continuation on ineffective treatment was considered unethical. Similarly, those participants with unacceptable toxicity could complete prior to end day 5.</P><P>Failure to follow intention to treat principles in analyses. All eligible randomised participants were included in the primary ITT analysis. Four patients who were randomised, but withdrew before the commencement of study drug were deemed to have had a negative response.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Selective outcome reporting of outcomes and/or analyses</HEADING><P>There was no difference in oral morphine equivalent doses between arms at baseline. Trial patients continued their current opioid regimen throughout the study period with breakthrough/rescue doses as below. Patients continued all adjuvant analgesics at pre-study dose throughout the duration of the study. Patients who required the addition of a new agent or in increase in co-analgesia during the 5 day study period had the study treatment ceased. A reduction in co-analgesia because of toxicity was acceptable. Any changes in concomitant medication was documented in the Rescue medications. Immediate release oral or subcutaneous opioid of up to 1/6th the total daily dose of morphine or oxycodone were available q2hourly for all patients, preferably by the same route as the regular medication. For patients on transdermal fentanyl, oral /subcutaneous oxycodone or morphine at doses as recommended by the manufacturer (or parenteral/sublingual fentanyl at recommended doses) were used. There was no difference in the use of breakthrough medications between arms.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Other potential sources of bias</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="6">Size of study</HEADING><P>A total of 150 (75 ketamine and 75 placebo) evaluable patients were required to provide approximately 85% power to detect an absolute 25% difference in response rate (30% in the placebo group vs 55% in the ketamine group), at a 2-tailed type 1 error of 0.05. The sample size was reached.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="6">Doses used </HEADING><P>The regimen chosen for our study was based on the largest series reported in the literature at the time (Jackson K, Ashby M, Howell D, et al: The effectiveness and adverse event profile of &#8220;burst&#8221; ketamine in refractory cancer pain: The VCOG PM 1-00study. J Palliat Med 14:1074-1077, 2011).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="6">Rapid escalation </HEADING><P>Dose escalation only occurred if patients failed to respond after 24 hours of the previous dose as per the largest series reported in the literature at the time-Opioid doseThe background opioid dose was 300mg OME/day (range 160-480) and 410 (258-700) in the ketamine and placebo arms respectively.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="6">Last observation carried forward analysis</HEADING><P>The primary analysis was an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The response for participants stopping study drug before day 5 for reasons unrelated to the intervention was imputed from the last recorded assessment of pain. It is to be noted that the placebo group achieved the same response rate of analgesics but with much less toxicity.</P><P>I do not have any affiliation with or involvement in any organisation with a financial interest in the subject matter of my comment.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></FEEDBACK_SUMMARY><FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2017-08-14 12:30:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine"><P>The authors thank Dr. Currow for his feedback regarding the recent update of the Cochrane review entitled "Ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for cancer pain".</P><P>Dr. Currow has requested an explanation of why the paper by Hardy et al. was classified as "low level evidence".</P><P>The paper was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of bias tool. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Re. Risk of bias</HEADING><P>The paper was judged to have unclear risk of bias as follows:</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Detection bias and performance bias</HEADING><P>As is evident from the Risk of bias table, we judged this trial to be at unclear risk of bias re. blinding. The detailed information on blinding that Dr. Currow provides in his email was not included in the published paper which lacks a description of the blinding procedure. We did however note that the protocol mentioned that "<I>All syringes will look identical in volume and colour</I>". The trial involved rapid titration of ketamine to high doses and there was a high rate of adverse events in the ketamine arm. No specific measures were taken to check for blinding. We judged that it was possible that blinding could therefore have been compromised by psychotomimetic adverse effects and skin reactions at the needle site, and a check on fidelity to blinding would have helped reduce uncertainty.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)</HEADING><P>It is unclear how missing data was imputed. The trial was therefore judged to be at unclear risk of bias due to missing outcome data.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Selective reporting</HEADING><P>Assessing "the effect of ketamine on total opioid dose", which is a relevant outcome of interest was mentioned in the protocol as a "secondary objective", but was not reported in the final paper. We judged the study to be at unclear risk of bias due to selective reporting.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Size of study (checking for possible bias confounded by small size)( 1-4).</HEADING><P>We assessed studies as being at low risk of bias (200participants or more in each treatment arm); unclear risk of bias (50-199 participants in each treatment arm; high risk of bias (fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm). We judged the trial by Hardy et al. to be at unclear risk of bias due to size (50 - 199 participants per treatment arm).</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Re. GRADE assessment</HEADING><P>For all three studies there was an unclear risk of bias overall. Using GRADE, we judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to study limitations and imprecision due to the small number of participants in all comparisons.</P><P>We downgraded one level for serious risk of bias and two levels for very serious imprecision due to very small number of participants in two of the comparisons and small number of participants in the third comparison.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Re. the ketamine regimen used in the study by Hardy et al.</HEADING><P>Dr. Currow writes that the ketamine regimen "<I>was based on the largest series reported in the literature at the time" </I>(5). The dose escalation was rapid, for example having a start dose of 100 mg/ 24 hours and tripling the dose after less than 20 hours, considering the pharmacokinetics of ketamine which has a &#946; half-life of two to four hours in humans (6), and where steady state is achieved after five elimination half-lives. The metabolite norketamine, which is also active has a much longer half-life than ketamine, and very ill cancer patients would be likely to have a much poorer elimination than young healthy volunteers.</P><P>The "burst" ketamine protocol developed by Jackson et al. appears only to have been used by that particular group, and subsequently by Hardy and colleagues. Mercadante et al. published two reports of cases treated with a "burst" ketamine regimen, but employed a dose of 100 mg daily for two days, as an adjuvant to opioid (7,8). The ketamine doses and rate of titration in the Hardy trial are higher than those generally reported and recommended in the cancer pain literature (9). The high rate of adverse events in the ketamine arm of the trial suggest that "<I>rapid titration involving such doses of continuous subcutaneous infused ketamine is generally inadvisable</I>" (9). The treatment regimen used in this study cannot be considered representative for ketamine regimens commonly used in palliative care, and the conclusion that "<I>Ketamine does not have net clinical benefit when used as an adjunct to opioids and standard co-analgesics in cancer pain</I>" can only apply to this specific, high-dose, rapid titration treatment regimen.</P><P>Finally, the basic opioid treatment in the Hardy study was not standardized- participants were treated with different opioids and different routes of administration. This lack of standardization may have influenced the results.</P><P><B>References</B></P><OL><LI>Dechartres A, Trinquart L, Boutron I, Ravaud P.
