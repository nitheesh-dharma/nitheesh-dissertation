<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
<BR/>	Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for most patients with end-stage kidney disease. Strategies to increase donor organ availability and to prolong the transplanted kidney's survival have become priorities in kidney transplantation. About 10% to 35% of all kidney transplant recipients will experience one episode of acute rejection in the first year. Options for treating these episodes include pulsed steroid therapy, the use of an antibody preparation, the alteration of background immunosuppression, or combinations of these options.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we do?</B>
<BR/>	This review investigated the role of mono- or polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of acute cellular or acute humoral rejection in kidney transplant recipients. Thirty one studies (1680 patients) were included.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we find?</B>
<BR/>	We identified 31 studies enrolling 1680 people. Any antibody was better than steroid treatment for reversing the first acute cellular rejection episode and preventing graft loss, but showed little or difference in reversing steroid-resistant rejection episodes. Polyclonal antibody-treated patients were more likely to experience an immediate reaction of fever, chills and malaise than those receiving steroid treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<BR/>	Antibody treatment was better than steroid treatment for reversing first acute cellular rejection and preventing graft loss but this treatment was associated with a high incidence of adverse effects. The main limitation of this review is that many of the included studies were performed during the cyclosporin/azathioprine era of kidney transplantation and therefore conclusions cannot necessarily be extrapolated to patients treated with more contemporary immunosuppressive regimens which include tacrolimus/mycophenolate or sirolimus.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-06-15 05:38:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Registry data shows that the incidence of acute rejection has been steadily falling. Approximately 10% to 35% of kidney recipients will undergo treatment for at least one episode of acute rejection within the first post-transplant year. Treatment options include pulsed steroid therapy, the use of an antibody preparation, the alteration of background immunosuppression, or combinations of these options. Over recent years, new treatment strategies have evolved, and in many parts of the world there has been an increase in use of tacrolimus and mycophenolate and a reduction in the use of cyclosporin and azathioprine use as baseline immunosuppression to prevent acute rejection. There are also global variations in use of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to treat acute rejection. This is an update of a review published in 2006.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-06-15 05:23:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to: (1) to evaluate the relative and absolute effects of different classes of antibody preparation in preventing graft loss and resolving cellular or humoral rejection episodes when used as a treatment for first episode of rejection in kidney transplant recipients; (2) evaluate the relative and absolute effects of different classes of antibody preparation in preventing graft loss and resolving cellular or humoral rejection episodes when used as a treatment for steroid-resistant rejection in kidney transplant recipients; (3) determine how the benefits and adverse events vary for each type of antibody preparation; and (4) determine how the benefits and harms vary for different formulations of antibody within each type.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-13 07:56:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 18 April 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-04-05 21:54:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in all languages comparing all mono- and polyclonal antibody preparations, given in combination with any other immunosuppressive agents, for the treatment of cellular or humoral graft rejection, when compared to any other treatment for acute rejection were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-11-20 00:35:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random-effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-03 00:53:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>We included 11 new studies (18 reports, 346 participants) in this update, bring the total number of included studies to 31 (76 reports, 1680 participants). Studies were generally small, incompletely reported, especially for potential harms, and did not define outcome measures adequately. The risk of bias was inadequate or unclear risk for random sequence generation (81%), allocation concealment (87%) and other bias (87%). There were, however, a predominance of low risk of bias for blinding (75%) and incomplete outcome data (80%) across all the studies. Selective reporting had a mixture of low (58%), high (29%), and unclear (13%) risk of bias.</P>
<P>Seventeen studies (1005 participants) compared therapies for first acute cellular rejection episodes. Antibody therapy was probably better than steroid in reversing acute cellular rejection (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.82; moderate certainty) and preventing subsequent rejection (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.99; moderate certainty), may be better for preventing graft loss (death censored: (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.12; low certainty) but there was little or no difference in death at one year. Adverse effects of treatment (including fever, chills and malaise following drug administration) were probably reduced with steroid therapy (RR 23.88, 95% CI 5.10 to 111.86; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 16%; moderate certainty).</P>
<P>Twelve studies (576 patients) investigated antibody treatment for steroid-resistant rejection. There was little or no benefit of muromonab-CD3 over ATG or ALG in reversing rejection, preventing subsequent rejection, or preventing graft loss or death. Two studies compared the use of rituximab for treatment of acute humoral rejection (58 patients). Muromonab-CD3 treated patients suffered three times more than those receiving either ATG or T10B9, from a syndrome of fever, chills and malaise following drug administration (RR 3.12, 95% CI 1.87 to 5.21; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 31%), and experienced more neurological side effects (RR 13.10 95% CI 1.43 to 120.05; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 36%) (low certainty evidence).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of additional benefit from rituximab in terms of either reversal of rejection (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.64), or graft loss or death 12 months (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.23 to 4.35). Rituximab plus steroids probably increases the risk of urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis (RR 5.73, 95% CI 1.80 to 18.21).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-06-15 05:40:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>In reversing first acute cellular rejection and preventing graft loss, any antibody is probably better than steroid, but there is little or no difference in subsequent rejection and patient survival. In reversing steroid-resistant rejection there was little or no difference between different antibodies over a period of 12 months, with limited data beyond that time frame. In treating acute humoral rejection, there was no evidence that the use of antibody therapy conferred additional benefit in terms of reversal of rejection, or death or graft loss.</P>
<P>Although this is an updated review, the majority of newer included studies provide additional evidence from the cyclosporin/azathioprine era of kidney transplantation and therefore conclusions cannot necessarily be extrapolated to patients treated with more contemporary immunosuppressive regimens which include tacrolimus/mycophenolate or sirolimus. However, many kidney transplant centres around the world continue to use older immunosuppressive regimes and the findings of this review remain strongly relevant to their clinical practice.</P>
<P>Larger studies with standardised reproducible outcome criteria are needed to investigate the outcomes and risks of antibody treatments for acute rejection in kidney transplant recipients receiving contemporary immunosuppressive regimes.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-03 00:40:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-06-15 06:05:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Improvements in induction and maintenance immunosuppressive algorithms now mean that most recipients of kidney transplants can expect a greater than 90% chance of a functioning graft at one year. The impact of acute rejection on both graft survival in the short and longer term and on patient morbidity in the short and longer term is widely recognised (<LINK REF="REF-Jalalzadeh-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jalalzadeh 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joseph-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joseph 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koo 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Opelz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opelz 1997</LINK>). The timing, severity, number of episodes of rejection, effectiveness of treatment and degree of recovery of kidney function are all important factors in determining outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Madden-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madden 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Opelz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opelz 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of acute rejection in the first year post-transplant has been steadily falling over the last 20 years. In 1990&#8217;s acute rejection episodes were reported in almost 50% of kidney transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2014</LINK>) More recently, Registry data (<LINK REF="REF-Matas-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matas 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2014</LINK>) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of immunosuppressive interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Masson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masson 2014</LINK>) report the incidence of acute rejection during the first post-transplant year to have stabilized at around 10%.</P>
<P>Clinically, acute rejection is defined as an acute deterioration in graft function associated with specific pathologic changes seen on transplant biopsy. The Banff classification (<LINK REF="REF-Solez-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solez 1993</LINK>
<U>; </U>
<LINK REF="REF-Solez-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solez 2008</LINK>) identifies acute cellular (T-cell mediated) rejection which is classified according to presence and severity of interstitial inflammation, tubulitis and arteritis. Acute cellular rejection is caused by the cell mediated immune response - which occurs when recipient T cells recognize donor antigens, T cells become activated and undergo clonal expansion, lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells then infiltrate the transplant and cause tissue damage (<LINK REF="REF-Ingulli-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingulli 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Issa-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Issa 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nankivell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nankivell 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute humoral rejection is caused by humoral or antibody-mediated responses and is an increasingly recognised cause of acute transplant dysfunction resistant to treatment with steroids and T cell specific immunosuppressive agents. Acute humoral rejection is caused by donor specific antibodies to Class I and Class II HLA antigens although other non-HLA antigens have also been recognized (<LINK REF="REF-Dheda-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dheda 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Banff criteria for classifying acute humoral rejection require the presence of (<LINK REF="REF-Colvin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colvin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haas-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Solez-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solez 1993</LINK>
<U>; </U>
<LINK REF="REF-Solez-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solez 2008</LINK>) (1) histological evidence of acute tissue injury e.g. acute tubular necrosis, capillaritis, tubulitis, arteritis, (2) presence of circulating donor-specific antibodies (DSA), and (3) immunologic evidence of an antibody-mediated process with positive peritubular capillary C4d staining reflecting complement activation via the classical pathway.</P>
<P>The increase in diagnosis of acute humoral rejection maybe due to improved detection techniques e.g. development of C4d staining, improved recognition of DSA and increase in highly sensitized recipients accepted for transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Colvin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colvin 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute cellular and humoral rejection may co-exist. It may be difficult to distinguish between acute humoral rejection and severe acute cellular rejection, and it is not uncommon for treatment for the two conditions to be given concurrently or sequentially.</P>
<P>Histological evidence of acute rejection in the absence of deterioration in kidney function is defined in the Banff classification as subclinical rejection. It is unclear whether treatment of subclinical rejection improves long term transplant outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Nankivell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nankivell 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The histological findings on transplant biopsy have important implications for prognosis and influence the treatment given to treat acute rejection.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-06-15 05:44:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>There have been significant changes in the type of immunosuppressive agents and strategies used over the last 20 years. In 1996, almost 80% patients received cyclosporin (CsA) as first-line calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), whereas in 2012, 92% patients received tacrolimus (TAC) as baseline immunosuppression. Similarly, mycophenolate preparations have replaced azathioprine (AZA) as the anti-metabolite of choice. Registry data shows differing global trends in the use of induction antibodies. In the USA, Interleukin 2 antibody ((IL2a) use has fallen from a peak of 40% in 2002 to 20% in 2011, whilst the use of T-cell depleting antibodies continues to increase (<LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2014</LINK>). Whereas, in Australia, use of IL2 antibodies for induction has remained fairly stable at 81% to 93% and ATG 3% to 4% (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The treatment of acute cellular rejection requires a short course of more intensive immunosuppression, added to baseline immunosuppression therapy. Options include pulsed steroid therapy, the use of an antibody preparation, alteration of background immunosuppression, or combinations of these options, (<LINK REF="REF-Chon-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chon 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Denton-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denton 1999</LINK>). Treatment of acute humoral rejection generally includes plasmapheresis, administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), use of an antibody preparation, modification of background immunosuppression or a combination of these options (<LINK REF="REF-Bartel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartel 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are several different preparations of horse and rabbit-derived polyclonal antibodies against the human lymphocyte or thymocyte - anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG), anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG; horse or rabbit), and T10B9. A mouse monoclonal antibody against the CD3 receptor on activated T-cells (muromonab-CD3) also became commercially available in the late 1980s, but has since been withdrawn from the market in most countries. The integration of these antibodies into acute cellular rejection treatment protocols has developed as newer immunosuppressive agents have become available and immunosuppressive strategies evolved.</P>
<P>Recent studies have illustrated that a significant amount of B-cell infiltrate is identified in T-cell mediated tubulointerstitial rejection (<LINK REF="REF-Mengel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mengel 2007</LINK>) and use of monoclonal antibody preparations which target different aspects of the immune system have been reported as described below.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-07-03 00:40:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>ATG and mouse monoclonal antibodies against the CD3 receptor on activated T-cells are preparations remove the functional T-cell population from circulation, producing powerful saturation immunosuppression. These agents are useful for induction immunosuppression and for the management of acute rejection.</P>
<P>Recent reports describe the use of newer monoclonal antibodies targeting different aspects of the immune system (<LINK REF="REF-Chon-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chon 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halloran-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halloran 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardinger-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardinger 2013</LINK>). For example, alemtuzumab a monoclonal antibody directed against CD 52 (Campath &#8211; 1H) effects T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells. The use of this agent to treat acute cellular rejection has been reported in a few small studies (<LINK REF="REF-Basu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Csapo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Csapo 2005</LINK>)</P>
<P>Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, causes depletion of mature B-cells and has been used in treatment of acute cellular rejection with B-cell infiltrates.</P>
<P>In the treatment of acute humoral rejection plasmapheresis and immunoadsorption are thought to act by physically removing circulating antibodies. IVIg has immunomodulatory properties, and suppresses the production of anti-HLA antibodies and modifies complement activation (<LINK REF="REF-Dheda-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dheda 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jordan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 2011</LINK>). Other treatment strategies for treatment of acute humoral rejection are targeted towards reducing donor specific antibody titres by modifying B cell (rituximab) and plasma cell function (bortezomib), or reducing tissue damage induced by complement activation (eculizumab) (<LINK REF="REF-Dheda-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dheda 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2012</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-05-24 06:07:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>However, these agents especially if used in combination or sequentially can cause profound and prolonged immunosuppression and be complicated by higher rates of infection and malignancy.

These tables present key information concerning the quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the effects of the interventions examined, and the sum of the available data for the main outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011a</LINK>). The 'Summary of findings' tables also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2008</LINK>). The GRADE approach defines the quality of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specific interest. The quality of a body of evidence involves consideration of within-trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011b</LINK>).

<P>In this update, data have been grouped by their treatment for first cellular (T cell) rejection, first humoral (B cell) rejection, or steroid-resistant rejection, and then by the possible outcomes measured, including: failure reversal of acute rejection, recurrent rejection, graft loss (censored and not censored for death), mortality, treatment failure requiring additional treatment, adverse events, occurrence of infections or malignancy, and graft function.</P>
<P>Within these categories, the outcome analysis was further stratified by antibody type. Forest plots were compiled using the Mantel-Haenszel method for dichotomous outcomes, and the generic inverse variance method for continuous outcomes. Additional tables were made to analyse the effect of the intervention for both first cellular and steroid-resistant rejection by the differences in formulation (rabbit-derived ATG versus horse-derived ATG), regimen (3 days versus 10 days ALG), dosage (half dose versus standard dose muromonab-CD3), and non-antibody intervention (IVIg, 15-deoxyspergualin).</P>

<P>In kidney transplant recipients on dual baseline immunosuppressive therapy with either AZA and steroids or CsA and steroids, antibody therapy is 50% more effective at reversing a first acute cellular rejection episode, and 20% more effective at preventing graft loss than further steroid treatment, but significant benefit in patient survival has not been demonstrated.</P>
<P>In kidney transplant recipients on triple baseline immunosuppression with CsA, AZA and steroids, experiencing acute rejection resistant to further steroid treatment, there is no evidence that the effects of muromonab-CD3 and ATG or ALG are different in reversal or recurrence of acute rejection, or patient or graft survival.</P>
<P>Patients treated with an antibody for acute cellular rejection were 23 times more likely to experience an immediate reaction of fever, chills and malaise than those receiving steroid, and muromonab-CD3 treated patients were three times more likely to experience this reaction than those treated with other antibodies for the treatment of first cellular rejection episode. Other adverse effects of antibody therapy for treatment of acute cellular rejection were inconsistently reported and could not be easily summarised because of sparsely reported data.</P>
<P>In treating acute humoral rejection, there was no evidence that the use of rituximab improved graft or patient survival at one year and there were more adverse events, although these were not statistically different adverse events.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-07-03 00:53:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>This systematic review was undertaken with widely inclusive criteria, in order to highlight and summarise the totality of RCT evidence available. This approach led to identification of 31 studies involving 1680 participants, including unpublished and non-English language data sources. This enhances the external and internal validity of our review, as confining a systematic review and meta-analysis to published or English language data alone has been demonstrated to over-estimate positive treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>We did not identify any studies investigating antibody therapy for the treatment of acute cellular rejection where contemporary immunosuppressive agents such as tacrolimus, mycophenolate or sirolimus were employed which may impact upon the applicability of this evidence to modern day practice. One ongoing study investigating the use of Rituximab for treatment of acute cellular tubule-interstitial rejection with B-cell infiltrates will include data from patients receiving modern baseline immunosuppressive regimen (<LINK REF="STD-RIACT-Study-2012" TYPE="STUDY">RIACT Study 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In studies investigating the use of antibody therapy for treatment of acute humoral rejection, patients received contemporary immunosuppressive agents such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate which makes this evidence applicable to current practice (<LINK REF="STD-RITUX_x002d_ERAH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">RITUX-ERAH 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zarkhin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zarkhin 2008</LINK>).

<P>The reporting of key components for evaluating of the validity of RCTs was not comprehensive and not in line with current standards of reporting. In many cases this reflected design features which are sub-optimal such as inadequate or unclear sequence generation (81%), inadequate or unclear allocation concealment (87%), inadequate blinding of either personnel (participants or study personnel) or outcome assessors (25%), incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and bias from other sources. These features are associated with substantial bias in favour of the investigational intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Peduzzi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peduzzi 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1979</LINK>). Many clinically relevant outcomes were not reported at all or only within a very limited time frame; in particular, it is uncertain whether these agents improve graft survival beyond one year. Additionally, the definitions and criteria used to define rejection, steroid-resistant rejection, and other outcomes were not always reported, were not provided in sufficient detail to be reproducible, and when reported were not uniform across studies. Unfortunately these inconsistencies are not limited to studies on this topic, or to the field of transplantation, but are widely recognised by other investigators across diverse medical fields (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loke 2001</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-07-03 00:53:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The relatively low number of small studies published in this area means that there is considerable imprecision around all estimates of effect. For example, our data suggest that antibody therapy for acute rejection may prevent further recurrent rejection episodes by around 25% compared to steroids, a clinically important difference, but the width of the 95% CI are consistent with a 46% reduction or a 0% reduction. We have insufficient data to conclude with reasonable certainty that antibody treatment for acute cellular rejection prevents further rejection, but this possibility is suggested by our data. Imprecision is a particular problem with estimating the harms of the interventions.</P>
<P>Reporting of potential harms of treatment was very limited and inconsistently expressed, so the potential of meta-analysis to increase both power and precision through combining study results to expose significant differences in harmful effects occurring at low frequency in individual studies was not realised. More than half the studies did not report treatment side effects, or other adverse events such as infection or malignancy. It should be recognised that absence of evidence does not equate to evidence of absence of effect, and we recognise that at present, with such scant study data, these outcomes may be better informed by available registry data. The value of increasing available evidence of potential harms associated with interventions (compared with potential benefits alone) has been widely recognised and is also not a problem peculiar to this review, but is common to many RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Cuervo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuervo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tunis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunis 2003</LINK>)</P>

(<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2012</LINK>). However, in this review of RCTs there was no evidence of benefit from treatment with rituximab in treating acute humoral rejection.

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-03 00:53:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-07-03 00:53:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>In treatment of acute cellular rejection, especially where steroids have already failed, clinicians are faced with the option of using antibody therapy. There is no evidence from the pooled world literature of RCTs that muromonab-CD3, ATG or ALG differ in beneficial or harmful effects over a period of 12 months, with limited data beyond that time frame. The most widely available agents in the current era are ATG formulations.</P>
<P>In treatment of acute humoral rejection, there is no evidence that the use of rituximab improved graft or patient survival at one year.</P>
<P>The majority of studies of first acute cellular rejection following kidney transplantation were published 10 to 30 years ago and used dual baseline immunosuppression that is now used very infrequently. All of the seven studies investigating the treatment of resistant rejection used triple baseline immunosuppression with CsA, AZA and steroids and this combination is no longer standard therapy in many countries. In 2012 in the USA, 92% of new transplant patients received tacrolimus, less than 10% CsA and fewer than 2% AZA. The CsA/AZA combination was used in only 3% in Australia and is not recommended in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whether the effects of antibody therapy are different when used with baseline immunosuppression that differs from that of the studies we identified cannot be answered with current evidence, so the results of our analysis may or may not be generalisable to the contemporary clinical practice of many countries.</P>
<P>Patients receiving antibody therapy may be at more at risk of infection and malignancy.</P>
<P>A recent review of adverse effects following use of monoclonal antibody treatment in kidney transplantation highlighted the increased risk of infection during induction therapy and in patients treated for some cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Zaza-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaza 2014</LINK>). However, there was sparse evidence regarding the risk of infection and malignancy in the studies included in our review.</P>
<P>Throughout our analysis there are studies that reported non-significant differences following the various interventions. However, it was unclear as to whether the studies included were adequately powered for such an endpoint. Therefore, we cannot be confident that the negative results are true negatives</P>
<P>This is a particularly important consideration in the modern era, where baseline immunosuppression is more potent and patients may receive one or more kidney transplants in their lifetime. Therefore, the relative risk of adding antibody therapy to treat acute cellular and humoral rejection needs to be carefully weighed against the benefits for a kidney transplant and for the patient. This may be particularly the case with newer antibody agents where profound and prolonged immunosuppression occurs and antibody therapies may be used concurrently or sequentially.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-06-15 06:05:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Our goal was to summarise the evidence for the use of antibody therapy in the treatment of acute cellular and humoral rejection in kidney transplant recipients. Our meta-analysis cannot answer the question of how best to treat rejection, but our systematic review does clearly establish and detail the entirety of study evidence that is available and has demonstrated that there is little evidence on which to base clinical decision making, and in treating acute cellular rejection, no evidence for antibody use in patients treated with tacrolimus, mycophenolate or sirolimus. To our knowledge, no peer-reviewed journal has published data from any RCT of any intervention for the treatment of acute cellular rejection in kidney recipients for a number of years.</P>
<P>There is also sparse evidence to base clinical decision making in treating acute humoral rejection, although studies did include patients receiving tacrolimus and mycophenolate as baseline immunosuppression.</P>
<P>As the preparations for the treatment of acute cellular rejection are not new, there is no economic drive from the pharmaceutical industry to encourage and back new studies. A definitive answer will not arise until studies ask the question. To increase both the amount and the quality of evidence available from RCTs in this area, the drive must come from researchers.</P>
<P>There have, however, been numerous studies of newer immunosuppressive agents in acute humoral rejection and in primary, induction and maintenance therapy regimens designed with diverse primary outcomes.</P>
<P>Future studies investigating different antibody therapies for treatment of acute cellular and humoral rejection, or antibody therapy versus switch in baseline immunosuppression would inform clinical care, but must clearly define outcomes and adequately report harms of treatment to improve on current knowledge and allow more informative cross-trial comparisons. In particular, the potential of antibody therapy to prevent graft loss compared with steroids alone to treat acute cellular rejection needs to be confirmed, as does the role of newer antibodies in the treatment of humoral rejection.</P>
