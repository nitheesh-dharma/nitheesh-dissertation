<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-17 10:56:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adolescent parents face a range of problems. They are often from very deprived backgrounds; they can experience a range of mental health problems and a lack of social support; they often lack knowledge about child development and effective parenting skills, and they have developmental needs of their own. Possibly for these reasons, the children of teenage parents often have poor outcomes.</P>
<P>A range of interventions are being used to promote the well-being of teenage parents and their children. Parenting programmes have been found to be effective in improving psychosocial health in parents more generally (including reducing anxiety and depression, and improving self-esteem), alongside a range of developmental outcomes for children. This review therefore investigated the impact of parenting programmes aimed specifically at teenage parents on outcomes for both them and their children.</P>
<P>The findings are based on eight studies measuring a variety of outcomes, using a range of standardised measures. It was possible to combine results (meta-analysis) for nine comparisons. Results from four of these meta-analyses suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving parent responsiveness to the child, and parent-child interaction, both post-intervention and at follow-up. Infant responsiveness to the mother also showed improvement at follow-up. The results of the other five meta-analyses we carried out were inconclusive.</P>
<P>Further rigorous research is needed that provides both short- and long-term follow-up of the children of teenage parents, and that assesses the benefits of parenting programmes for young fathers as well as young mothers.</P>

<P>We searched to find new studies for this updated review in January 2008 and May 2010 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ASSIA, CINAHL, DARE, ERIC, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts and Social Science Citation Index. The National Research Register (NRR) was last searched in May 2005 and UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database in May 2010.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-17 10:55:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight studies with 513 participants, providing a total of 47 comparisons of outcome between intervention and control conditions. Nineteen comparisons were statistically significant, all favouring the intervention group. We conducted nine meta-analyses using data from four studies in total (each meta-analysis included data from two studies). Four meta-analyses showed statistically significant findings favouring the intervention group for the following outcomes: parent responsiveness to the child post-intervention (SMD -0.91, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.30, P = 0.04); infant responsiveness to mother at follow-up (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -1.25 to -0.06, P = 0.03); and an overall measure of parent-child interactions post-intervention (SMD -0.71, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.11, P = 0.02), and at follow-up (SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.51 to -0.30, P = 0.004). The results of the remaining five meta-analyses were inconclusive.</P>

<P>Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. The findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">The rate of births to teenage parents</HEADING>
<P>Research examining the rate of births to women aged 15 to 19 in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries showed that the lowest birth rates (2.9 to 6.5 per 1,000) were to be found in Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Sweden, and that the highest birth rates (52.1 per 1,000) were to be found in the USA, which has about four times the European Union average, and the UK, which has the highest teenage birth rate in Europe (30.8 per 1,000) (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 2001</LINK>). Although these figures show a fall across many countries (<LINK REF="REF-DCSF-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCSF 2008</LINK>), teenage pregnancy continues to be regarded as a health problem in the Western world (<LINK REF="REF-As_x002d_Sanie-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">As-Sanie 2004</LINK>). While there are cultural contexts worldwide in which it may not be unusual for children to be born to teenage mothers, there is some evidence that teenage pregnancy is also a concern in low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Parekh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parekh 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pyper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pyper 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Save-the-Children-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Save the Children 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes of teenage pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>Although there is some recognition that teenage pregnancy can be a positive experience, particularly in the later teenage years (<LINK REF="REF-Harden-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harden 2006</LINK>), there is also evidence of adverse health and social outcomes from a number of cohort studies that have controlled for selection effects (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Emisch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emisch 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pevalin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pevalin 2003</LINK> cited in <LINK REF="REF-Harden-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harden 2009</LINK>). For example, an overview of the evidence about the impact of teenage pregnancy on a range of aspects of well-being (<LINK REF="REF-HDA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDA 2004</LINK>) found that teenage mothers experienced more socio-economic deprivation, mental health problems (particularly during the first three years following the birth), and drug problems. They had lower levels of educational attainment, were more likely to be living in deprived neighbourhoods, and their partners were more antisocial and abusive. It also showed lower rates of breast feeding in teenage mothers. Younger parents also often lack knowledge of child development and effective parenting skills (<LINK REF="REF-Bucholz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucholz 1993</LINK>), due in part to their inexperience of life more generally (<LINK REF="REF-Utting-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utting 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Young parenthood is often viewed as reinforcing social disadvantage because of the perceived consequences in terms of the teenage mother's life chances (<LINK REF="REF-Social-Exclusion-Unit-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Social Exclusion Unit 1999</LINK> cited in <LINK REF="REF-Duncan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 2007</LINK>), and also because of the estimated cost to society. For example, in the UK, the annual cost to the National Health Service of pregnancy in women under 18 years of age is over £63 million (<LINK REF="REF-HDA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDA 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Research also suggests that the children of teenage parents may have poorer outcomes in terms of educational attainment, emotional and behavioural problems, and higher rates of illness, accidents and injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Moffitt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffitt 2002</LINK> cited in <LINK REF="REF-HDA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDA 2004</LINK>). Some studies point to a higher risk of child maltreatment among younger parents (<LINK REF="REF-Bucholz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucholz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wakschlag-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakschlag 2000</LINK>), although it is recognised that this risk is confounded by the environmental factors experienced by many younger parents, including socio-economic deprivation, lack of social support, depression, low self-esteem and emotional stress (<LINK REF="REF-Utting-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utting 1993</LINK>). Other research has also suggested that poverty and lack of access to services are responsible for the poor outcomes experienced by teenage parents and their children, rather than the age of the mother per se (<LINK REF="REF-Cunnington-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunnington 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Parenting programmes for teenage parents</HEADING>
<P>Services targeting teenage parents remain a policy priority in many Western countries including the UK (<LINK REF="REF-DCSF-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCSF 2007</LINK>) and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Karin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karin 2002</LINK>). A range of interventions have been developed to meet their needs including home visiting and parenting programmes (<LINK REF="REF-HDA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDA 2004</LINK>), and the focus of the current review is the effectiveness of parenting programmes designed explicitly to address the needs of teenage parents.</P>
<P>Standard parenting programmes are focused short-term interventions aimed at helping parents improve their functioning as a parent, and their relationship with their child, and preventing or treating a range of child emotional and behavioural problems by increasing the knowledge, skills and understanding of parents. They typically involve the use of a manualised and standardised programme or curriculum, and are underpinned by a number of theoretical approaches (including Behavioural, Family Systems, Adlerian, and Psychodynamic). They can involve the use of a range of techniques in their delivery including discussion, role play, watching video vignettes, and homework. They are typically offered to parents over the course of eight to 12 weeks, for about one to two hours each week, in a range of settings including hospital/social work clinics and community-based settings such as GP surgeries, schools and churches.</P>
<P>Although parenting programmes that are explicitly designed for teenage parents have much in common with standard parenting programmes, there may be important variations. For example, parenting programmes for teenagers may devote more time to factors that affect this 'hard-to-reach' group in terms of influencing their uptake and continuation with the programme, and in specifically addressing their communication needs. Such programmes may also focus more explicitly on aspects of parenting that research suggests may be difficult for teenage parents, such as understanding the developmental needs of their child.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-02-14 16:47:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence suggests that adolescent parents have unmet developmental needs of their own; that they are often from very deprived backgrounds; that they may be experiencing a range of mental health problems and lack of social support, and that they often lack knowledge about child development and effective parenting skills. The evidence suggests that parenting programmes have learning components that appear to address many of the issues confronting teenage parents. For example, a meta-ethnography of qualitative studies suggests that the acquisition of knowledge, skills and understanding, together with feelings of acceptance and support from other parents in the parenting group, are important in enabling parents to regain control, and in the development of feelings of being able to cope, which then leads to a reduction in feelings of guilt and social isolation, increased empathy with their children, and greater confidence in dealing with their behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 2007</LINK>). Parenting programmes that improve the mental health of the parents (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 2001a</LINK>), and their capacity to regulate their emotions (<LINK REF="REF-Day-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 2010</LINK>), may also help in terms of their functioning as parents. These findings were supported by recent research examining the effectiveness of parenting programmes delivered in disadvantaged areas, which suggested that the key factors in bringing about change were the provision of emotional support, and the development of parenting skills that improve the relationship with the child in ways that support positive behaviour and offer strategies to deal with negative or challenging behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2006</LINK>). The evidence also suggests that parenting programmes are effective in improving a range of outcomes in young children up to three years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 2010</LINK>), and emotional and behavioural outcomes in children aged three to 14 years (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>). Programmes that explicitly target teenagers and the problems that they experience may be even more effective for teenage parents and their children.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-02-11 14:04:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While recent reductions in the rates of births to teenagers may be testament to the success of some of the many prevention initiatives now targeting teenage parents, the prevalence of teenage pregnancy continues to be high. Interventions such as parenting programmes that potentially address some of the aetiological factors involved in the transmission of poor outcomes from teenage parents to their children (for example, by improving parental mental health and maximizing parenting skills) may be crucial in optimising well-being for both teenage parents and their children (<LINK REF="REF-Mental-Health-Europe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mental Health Europe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Social-Exclusion-Unit-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Social Exclusion Unit 1999</LINK>). There is a need to establish the impact of brief, structured parenting programmes, specifically targeting teenage parents, in terms of their benefits both for teenage parents and for their children.</P>

<P>For the first published versions of the review, we reviewed titles and abstracts of studies identified through searches of electronic databases, to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria. Esther Coren (EC) identified titles and abstracts and EC and Jane Barlow (JB) read and reviewed these. Two independent review authors (EC and JB) assessed full copies of those papers which appeared to meet the inclusion criteria. We resolved uncertainties concerning the appropriateness of studies for inclusion in the review by consultation with a third person (Sarah Stewart-Brown). For the updated review produced in 2010, Nadja Smailagic (NS) and Nick Huband (NH) carried out the eligibility assessments in consultation with EC, JB and Cathy Bennett (CB).

<P>Where appropriate, we used meta-analyses to combine comparable outcome measures across studies, using a fixed-effects model.

These were derived from 63 individual study results (40 post-intervention and 23 follow-up). There were some important differences between the studies, and these have been summarised alongside the main study characteristics below (see <A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=40562776396831539650100527182051&amp;format=REVMAN#CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES">Characteristics of included studies</A> table and <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

The randomisation of clusters can result in an overestimate of the precision of the results (with a higher risk of a Type I error) where their use has not been compensated for in the analysis. Neither of the above studies provided information to indicate whether the 'design effect' was adjusted for in the analysis, and their results have therefore been treated with caution (<LINK REF="STD-Wiemann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiemann 1990</LINK>).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Participants comprised primary carer-index child pairs. All the studies targeted primary carers below the age of 20, who were adolescent mothers or were pregnant. The age range was 13 to 20 years. The mean age was 17 years in seven studies. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Truss-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Truss 1977</LINK>) did not report the mean age of mothers. Four studies evaluated the effectiveness of interventions with teenage parents of infants (<LINK REF="STD-Truss-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Truss 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Black-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Letourneau-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Letourneau 2001</LINK>), and the remaining four studies included teenage parents of young children (ages unspecified) (<LINK REF="STD-Wiemann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiemann 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lagges-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lagges 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ricks_x002d_Saulsby-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ricks-Saulsby 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stirtzinger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stirtzinger 2002</LINK>). One study recruited only first-time African-American women less than 20 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies included in this review were largely directed at teenage mothers alone. While one study included two adolescent fathers, their results were excluded from the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Lagges-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lagges 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>

Three of the included studies evaluated the effectiveness of much briefer interventions that mostly comprised observation of videotape interactions over a brief period (i.e. one to two sessions) (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lagges-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lagges 1999</LINK>) or more extended period (i.e. six to seven weeks) (<LINK REF="STD-Wiemann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiemann 1990</LINK>), and that focused primarily on improving parent-infant interaction.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The included studies used a range of instruments to measure outcomes, using a wide range of scales, and sub-scales. Many of these could not be combined because they were not measuring sufficiently similar underlying conditions. For example, although depression and self-esteem are both aspects of psychosocial well-being, we did not consider that it was appropriate to combine them (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>While the use of randomisation should in theory ensure that any possible confounders are equally distributed between the arms of the trial, the randomisation of small numbers may result in an unequal distribution of confounding factors.

<P>The included studies reported data that had been collected using a range of outcome instruments. We were unable to combine much of the reported data using meta-analysis because of the following: i) a wide range of divergent outcomes were measured; ii) the outcomes were not measured at comparable time points; iii) assessments were reported for the same group of participants using a number of subscales (i.e. which would have led to double counting of the participants).</P>
<P>The results presented in the <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK> tables comprise individual study results and the nine meta-analyses that were possible.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> provides full details of the individual outcomes reported in each of the included studies, and the results of the meta-analyses. This table also lists the outcome measures that we combined using meta-analysis and directs the reader to the relevant analysis. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> also provides additional information about the time-point at which measurement was undertaken, and the direction of the scales used (i.e. whether a high score represents improvement or deterioration).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Individual study results - parent training versus control</HEADING>
<P>The eight included studies provided data on a total of 47 comparisons of outcome between intervention and control conditions. Nineteen of these comparisons were statistically significant, either at post-intervention or follow-up, each favouring the intervention. These are organised by outcome and by time point in Analyses 1 to 7.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Meta-analyses - parent training versus control</HEADING>
<P>We were able to carry out meta-analyses of parent-training versus control for four outcomes:</P>
<P>1. Parent psychosocial outcomes - sense of competence in parental role;</P>
<P>2. Parent psychosocial outcomes - parent interaction with child;</P>
<P>3. Child health and development outcomes - child interaction with parent;</P>
<P>4. Combined parent-child relationship - any combined parent-child interaction.</P>
<P>The results presented below are organised by outcome and measurement time-point (Analyses 8 to 11). The results are presented as effect-sizes with 95% confidence intervals. A minus sign indicates that the result favours the intervention group. We used post-intervention scores and follow-up scores to calculate effect sizes rather than change scores (i.e. pre- to post-scores for each group). This reflects the fact that a change standard deviation is required to calculate change scores, and these data were not available for any of the included studies.</P>
<P>We combined data for three outcomes assessing different aspects of parent-infant interaction (for example, parent responsiveness; infant responsiveness; combined interaction) derived from two studies, producing a total of five meta-analyses. We also combined data from two further studies assessing parenting competence in four meta-analyses, producing nine meta-analyses in total. Four of five meta-analyses using data from the two studies <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Letourneau-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Letourneau 2001</LINK> produced statistically significant findings favouring the intervention for the following: parent responsiveness to the child post-intervention (SMD -0.91; 95% CI -1.52 to -0.30; P=0.04; <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>); infant responsiveness to mother at follow-up (SMD -0.65; 95% CI -1.25 to -0.06; P=0.03; <LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>); and overall parent-child interaction both post-intervention (SMD -0.71; 95% CI -1.31 to -0.11; P=0.02; <LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>) and at follow-up (SMD -0.90; 95% CI -1.51 to -0.30; P = 0.004; <LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The fifth meta-analysis using data from <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Letourneau-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Letourneau 2001</LINK> produced statistically significant findings favouring the intervention for parent responsiveness to the child at follow-up when a fixed effect model was used; however, there was significant hetereogeneity and the confidence interval we found when using a random-effects model (SMD -6.11; 95% CI -16.99 to 4.77; P=0.27; <LINK REF="CMP-009.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.2</LINK>) did not allow us to conclude whether or not the intervention has an effect on parent responsiveness to the child at follow-up.</P>

We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of clustering using plausible values of ICC (i.e. an ICC from a similar study was not available). Based on possible cluster size at randomisation and the drop-out pattern, the ICC would have had to be between 0.015 and 0.025 (Design Effect 1.06) to overturn the statistical significance. The effect of clustering on the width of the confidence interval would be small because the size of the clusters is small, and we have therefore concluded that this result is reliable.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-17 11:26:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the addition of four studies to the four included in the original review has increased the overall number of participants, we could not combine many of the data in a meta-analysis due to the diversity of the outcomes measured. Furthermore, there was considerable diversity amongst the parenting programmes in terms of their duration and content (see below for further discussion).</P>
<P>It was only possible to combine data for a limited number of outcomes from four studies, producing a total of nine meta-analyses (Analyses 8 to 11). Four meta-analyses assessed parental attitudes to child rearing using the Adult-Adolescent Parenting Inventory and were not able to establish if parent training was effective or not. The remaining five meta-analyses assessed parent interactions with infants, using a number of sub-scales of the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS), and, while it is difficult to draw conclusions from one of these due to high heterogeneity, four found large effect sizes (ranging from 0.65 through to 1.07) favouring the intervention group.</P>
<P>Of the remaining 47 individual study assessments of outcome, 19 produced statistically significant effect sizes favouring the intervention group. These results suggest that parenting programmes directed specifically at teenage parents may be effective in improving important infant and child outcomes such as the infant's response to the parent, the clarity of the infant's cues and the child's ability to understand and respond to language. One study reported large significant changes in maternal sensitivity, maternal identity, maternal self-confidence, and the cognitive growth-fostering capacities of the mother (<LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 1992</LINK>), and a further study reported significant differences post-intervention in maternal attitudes to mealtimes and maternal mealtime communication (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1997</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:32:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included studies reflect the wide range of settings in which interventions for teenage parents are provided, including schools (<LINK REF="STD-Lagges-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lagges 1999</LINK>), health settings (<LINK REF="STD-Truss-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Truss 1977</LINK>), residential maternity homes (<LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 1992</LINK>), community health clinics and family support centres (<LINK REF="STD-Truss-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Truss 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Black-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1997</LINK>), and the participant's home (<LINK REF="STD-Wiemann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiemann 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Black-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1997</LINK>). The mechanisms of delivery of programmes were varied and included video-tape modelling (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Black-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1997</LINK>), use of booklets, alone and in combination with other components (<LINK REF="STD-Truss-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Truss 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiemann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiemann 1990</LINK>), home visiting (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Black-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Letourneau-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Letourneau 2001</LINK>), and were delivered by a range of personnel including nurses (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Koniak_x002d_Griffin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Koniak-Griffin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Letourneau-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Letourneau 2001</LINK>), with differing foci such as feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1997</LINK>) or maternal depression (<LINK REF="STD-Stirtzinger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stirtzinger 2002</LINK>). For more detail see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>The generalisability of the results obtained from the included studies is limited for a number of reasons. Some studies targeted teenage parents experiencing very specific problems (for example, teenage parents with depressive symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Stirtzinger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stirtzinger 2002</LINK>), or living in poverty (<LINK REF="STD-Truss-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Truss 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stirtzinger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stirtzinger 2002</LINK>). With one exception (which did not report the results for teenage fathers) (<LINK REF="STD-Lagges-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lagges 1999</LINK>), the included studies were all directed at teenage mothers only, and the findings of this review cannot therefore be generalised to adolescent fathers. One study was specifically directed at African-Caribbean mothers (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1997</LINK>), and a number of other studies included a mixed ethnic profile. This suggests that the findings are relevant to parents from a range of ethnic groups. However, all of the studies were conducted in the USA or Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Letourneau-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Letourneau 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stirtzinger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stirtzinger 2002</LINK>), and caution should therefore be exercised before the findings are generalised to other social and cultural contexts.</P>
<P>Although the interventions were delivered using both individual and group-based formats, it was not possible to examine the impact of individual or group format on outcomes for parents and their children. Peer group relations may be an important component of such interventions for teenage parents, and although the potential role of the group process in interventions with teenage mothers has been acknowledged, there is very little research available to date that addresses its impact (<LINK REF="REF-Schamess-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schamess 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parekh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parekh 1997</LINK>). The group facilitator/leader may also have an important part to play in helping parents not only to persist with a particular programme (<LINK REF="REF-Frankel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frankel 1992</LINK>), but in facilitating an atmosphere of openness and trust between the participating parents, and in helping parents to feel respected, understood, and supported. Facilitators can play an important role in modelling positive attributes including empathy, honesty and respect, and personal qualities such as a sense of humour, enthusiasm, flexibility, and warmth.</P>
<P>All of the included studies involved parents who had volunteered to take part in the study. Parents who volunteer to take part in parenting programmes may not be representative of the wider group of parents, perhaps most importantly due to the fact that volunteers are very often better motivated than parents who have been referred by professional agencies. This, once again, limits the generalisability of the results.</P>
<P>Although there is some recognition that parenting programmes can have adverse effects such as increasing the tension between parents when only one parent attends the programme (<LINK REF="REF-Mockford-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mockford 2004</LINK>), research from qualitative studies has not to date identified any other adverse outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>The wider evidence with regard to parenting programmes for parents generally suggests that they are largely effective with diverse populations of parents, and to that extent the largely positive, albeit statistically non-significant, findings of the current review, are consistent with the broader evidence base on this topic. However, teenage parents are a highly vulnerable group with very specific needs relating to their age and stage of development. Home visiting programmes, which comprise a more intensive intervention (i.e. often beginning ante-natally and continuing for up to two years postnatally), and that target much broader outcomes aimed explicitly at addressing the issue of social exclusion (i.e. parental education, training and return to work), may be better suited to meeting their needs. Parenting programmes may therefore have a more limited role in terms of providing support to teenage parents, and should possibly be used alongside more intensive forms of provision.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:34:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the included studies suggest some benefits of parenting programmes for teenage parents and their children, particularly those that focus on improving early parent-infant interaction, the methodological quality of the included studies was poor, and there was significant clinical heterogeneity in terms of the focus and duration of the interventions, and indeed the age of the children targeted. As such, it is not possible at the current time to be clear what the necessary ingredients of successful parenting programmes for teenage parents comprise or which outcomes they have most impact on, and further research is required.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:35:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review shows that the available evidence on the effectiveness of parenting programmes for teenage parents is wide ranging (for example, varying widely in content, duration and format), and there is a need for further evidence that explicitly evaluates the impact of different programmes. For example, the evidence suggests that brief video-interaction guidance can help improve the interactions of teenage parents with their babies and further research should be undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of this particular format of provision.</P>
<P>The conclusions that can be reached at the current time are limited by the lack of consistent measurement across the various studies both in terms of the outcomes measured, and also the time points at which measures were assessed. This review points to the need for more consistent measurement of the effectiveness of both individual and group-based parenting programmes in improving both parental and infant/child outcomes. There is also a need for studies that recruit larger numbers of teenage parents thereby improving the external validity of the research. Future studies should include parents other than volunteers, i.e. parents who have been referred to parenting programmes. There is also a need to include teenage fathers or fathers of the children of teenage mothers in studies of the effectiveness of parenting programmes targeting teenage parents.</P>
<P>None of the included studies discussed the role of process factors, for example, group processes and facilitator skills, and future research should address their impact on the effectiveness of these programmes for teenage parents.</P>

<P>We defined the inclusion criteria to state more clearly we included manualised, short-term (i.e. less than 12 week) parenting programmes, which are delivered on a one-to-one basis in the home. This reflects the fact that home visiting programmes are qualitatively different interventions (for example, broad based support which is provided on a frequent basis over an extended period of time) to parenting programmes which are delivered in the home (for example, brief, structured programmes with a specific focus on parenting). This is not a departure from protocol but we have clarified it because in the protocol and previously published versions of the review we implied but did not state clearly the conditions under which parenting programmes are delivered.</P>
<P>The upper age limit of 20 years was also clarified in terms of its consistency with the WHO definition of adolescent parents, thereby enabling the inclusion of international studies.</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria originally stated that the intervention should be "offered ante- or post-natally to pregnant or parenting teenagers, to teenage mothers or teenage fathers". The wording was changed to state "offered ante- and post-natally or just post-natally to teenage mothers and/or teenage fathers", to make it clear that ante-natal parenting programmes would be excluded because they may have pregnancy care components rather than being focused on parenting outcomes (such as improvement of parenting attitudes, practices, skills or knowledge).</P>
<P>Previously published versions of the review did not specify that studies aimed at parents of disabled infants or infants with long-term health problems or pre-term infants were excluded, although such studies appear in the excluded studies list (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Field-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Field 1980</LINK>). Studies involving parents of these children may involve clinically different populations from studies aimed at the general population of teenage parents, and the inclusion criteria now make it clear that studies focusing on these parents are excluded.</P>
<P>We also specified the primary outcomes more clearly, and the outcome 'knowledge of parent child development' was changed to 'knowledge about parenting skills', and parent and child interactions were also defined as a primary outcome. We also added combined parent-child interaction as an outcome category.</P>
<P>In the first published version of the review, the reporting of outcomes or mode of reporting (validated scales) was an inclusion criterion. In this version of the review we did not exclude any study solely<B> </B>on the basis of the outcomes reported or the absence of standardised measures (we provide all reasons for the exclusion in the Excluded studies table).</P>
<P>We added the methods for analysing cluster randomised trials in this updated version of the review.</P>

<P>The investigators note that although the demographic data from the 14 interview non-completers did not differ significantly from that from the 74 interview completers, a greater proportion of non-completers were black (35.7% versus 16.2%) and fewer had been pregnant at the first interview (0% versus 6.8%) (page 45). While there is information about the demographic characteristics of those who remained in the study, compared with those who dropped out, there is no information about any imbalance between the baseline characteristics in the intervention or control groups.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:12:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Margaret Anderson">
<P>We modified the search terms used to meet the requirements of individual databases as regards differences in fields. Preliminary searches indicated that a narrowing of the search strategy using terms designed to identify RCTs, resulted in the exclusion of many potentially relevant studies. As a result we adopted a wide search strategy without any specific methodological terms, to ensure we did not miss any relevant studies.</P>
<P>The following search terms were used for the Cochrane Library and other databases:<BR/>(PARENT* near PROGRAM*)<BR/>(PARENT* near TRAIN*)<BR/>(PARENT* near EDUCAT*)<BR/>(PARENT* near PROMOT*)<BR/>PARENT-PROGRAM*<BR/>PARENT-TRAIN*<BR/>PARENT-EDUCAT*<BR/>PARENT-PROMOT*<BR/>HEALTH-EDUCATION*:ME<BR/>HEALTH-PROMOTION*:ME<BR/>EDUCATION*:ME<BR/>ADOLESCENT-HEALTH-SERVICES*:ME<BR/>(((((((((((#1 or #2) or #3) or #4) or #5) or #6) or #7) or #8) or #9) or #10) or #11) or #12)<BR/>(ADOLESCEN* near PARENT)<BR/>(ADOLESCEN* near MOTHER*)<BR/>(ADOLESCEN* near PARENT*)<BR/>(ADOLESCEN* near FATHER*)<BR/>(TEEN* near MOTHER*)<BR/>(TEEN* near FATHER*)<BR/>(TEEN* near PARENT*)<BR/>PREGNANCY-IN-ADOLESCENCE:ME<BR/>(((((((#14 or #15) or #16) or #17) or #18) or #19) or #20) or #21)<BR/>(#13 and #22)</P>
<P>We searched the following electronic databases:</P>
<P>1. Biomedical sciences databases</P>
<UL>
<LI>MEDLINE Journal articles (1970 to 2000)</LI>
<LI>EMBASE 1980-2000)</LI>

<P>2. Social Science and General Reference databases:</P>

<LI>CINAHL (1982-2000)</LI>
<LI>PsychLIT Journal Articles and Chapter/Books (1970 to 2000)</LI>
<LI>Sociofile (1980-2000)</LI>

<UL>
<LI>The Cochrane Library including SPECTR, CENTRAL</LI>
<LI>National Research Register (NRR)</LI>
<LI>ERIC (1970-2000)</LI>
</UL>
<P>We examined reference lists of articles identified through database searches to identify further relevant studies. We also examined bibliographies of systematic and non-systematic review articles, to identify relevant studies</P>
