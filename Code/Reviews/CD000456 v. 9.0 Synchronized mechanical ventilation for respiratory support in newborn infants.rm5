<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-06-28 18:00:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The majority of newborn babies in need of mechanical assistance to support them also breathe to some degree. If the baby's attempts to breathe are synchronised with the mechanical breaths from the ventilator, less pressure may be needed. This could reduce the chance of air leak or variations in blood flow to the brain. The review of trials found, when compared to conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV), high-frequency positive pressure ventilation (HFPPV) reduced the risk of air leak and triggered ventilation was associated with a shorter duration of ventilation. Compared to high-frequency oscillation, however, certain triggered modes of ventilation resulted in a greater risk of moderate to severe chronic lung disease and a longer duration of ventilation. Newer forms of triggered ventilation have only been evaluated in small randomised trials and have not been demonstrated to have advantages in important clinical outcomes.</P>

<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to June 5 2016), EMBASE (1980 to June 5 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to June 5 2016).

<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials comparing synchronised ventilation delivered as HFPPV to CMV, or ACV/SIMV to CMV or HFO in neonates. Randomised trials comparing different triggered ventilation modes (ACV, SIMV, SIMV plus PS, PRVCV and PSV) in neonates.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-06-28 15:59:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were collected regarding clinical outcomes including mortality, air leaks (pneumothorax or pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE)), severe intraventricular haemorrhage (grades 3 and 4), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (oxygen dependency beyond 28 days), moderate/severe BPD (oxygen/respiratory support dependency beyond 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) and duration of weaning/ventilation.</P>
<P>Eight comparisons were made: (i) HFPPV versus CMV; (ii) ACV/SIMV versus CMV; (iii) SIMV or SIMV + PS versus HFO; iv) ACV versus SIMV; (v) SIMV plus PS versus SIMV; vi) SIMV versus PRVCV; vii) SIMV vs PSV; viii) ACV versus PSV. Data analysis was conducted using relative risk for categorical outcomes, mean difference for outcomes measured on a continuous scale.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-06-28 16:07:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-two studies are included in this review. The meta-analysis demonstrates that HFPPV compared to CMV was associated with a reduction in the risk of air leak (typical relative risk (RR) for pneumothorax was 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.93). ACV/SIMV compared to CMV was associated with a shorter duration of ventilation (mean difference (MD) &#8722;38.3 hours, 95% CI &#8722;53.90 to &#8722;22.69). SIMV or SIMV + PS was associated with a greater risk of moderate/severe BPD compared to HFO (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.65) and a longer duration of mechanical ventilation compared to HFO (MD 1.89 days, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.74).</P>
<P>ACV compared to SIMV was associated with a trend to a shorter duration of weaning (MD &#8722;42.38 hours, 95% CI &#8722;94.35 to 9.60). Neither HFPPV nor triggered ventilation was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of BPD. There was a non-significant trend towards a lower mortality rate using HFPPV versus CMV and a non-significant trend towards a higher mortality rate using triggered ventilation versus CMV. No disadvantage of HFPPV or triggered ventilation was noted regarding other outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-06-28 18:00:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Compared to conventional ventilation, benefit is demonstrated for both HFPPV and triggered ventilation with regard to a reduction in air leak and a shorter duration of ventilation, respectively. In none of the trials was complex respiratory monitoring undertaken and thus it is not possible to conclude that the mechanism of producing those benefits is by provocation of synchronised ventilation. Triggered ventilation in the form of SIMV ± PS resulted in a greater risk of BPD and duration of ventilation compared to HFO. Optimisation of trigger and ventilator design with respect to respiratory diagnosis is encouraged before embarking on further trials. It is essential that newer forms of triggered ventilation are tested in randomised trials that are adequately powered to assess long-term outcomes before they are incorporated into routine clinical practice.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-08-03 09:44:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-07-01 16:55:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>The majority of neonates breathe during mechanical ventilation. Those that actively exhale against positive pressure inflation develop pneumothoraces; whereas if positive pressure inflation and spontaneous inspiration coincide (synchrony), oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination improve. If synchrony occurs, it should be possible to achieve adequate gas exchange at lower inflating pressures, reducing barotrauma, a known risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Active expiration is more common if infants have non-compliant lungs and are ventilated with long inspiratory times or relatively slow ventilator rates (30 to 40 bpm), or both. Increasing ventilator rate and reducing inspiratory time, mimicking more closely the preterm infant's respiratory pattern, has been shown in a proportion of infants to stop them actively expiring.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-07-13 05:09:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Synchronised ventilation can be achieved by HFPPV during which the ventilator rate more closely resembles the spontaneous respiratory rate of very prematurely born infants, and this is more likely to be associated with synchronous ventilation. It can also be achieved by PTV (ACV, SIMV, PRVCV or PSV), during which the infant's respiratory efforts exceeding a critical level trigger a positive pressure inflation. In SIMV only a preset number of the infant's respiratory efforts trigger positive pressure inflations.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-07-14 06:53:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Thomas Rossor">
<P>During mechanical ventilation, infants actively exhale against positive pressure inflation and develop pneumothoraces. Theoretically, by increasing synchronous ventilation, either HFPPV or PTV could reduce air leaks and associated intraventricular haemorrhage and BPD. Indeed, 'triggered ventilation' compared to conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) has been shown to improve tidal volume (<LINK REF="STD-Jarreau-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jarreau 1996</LINK>) and oxygenation (<LINK REF="STD-Cleary-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cleary 1995</LINK>) and reduce blood pressure fluctuations (<LINK REF="STD-Hummler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hummler 1996</LINK>). Synchronised mechanical ventilation might also reduce baro trauma and hence BPD.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-07-01 16:57:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>The aim of this review was to determine whether HFPPV or triggered ventilation were associated with positive outcomes for prematurely born neonates. This review updates the existing review of synchronised ventilation which was published in the<I> Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> Issue 1, 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Greenough-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>For the 2016 update we used the criteria and standard methods of Cochrane and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (see <A HREF="http://neonatal.cochrane.org/resources-review-authors">the Cochrane Neonatal Group search strategy for specialized register</A>).</P>
<P>We conducted a comprehensive search including: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 5) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>; MEDLINE via PubMed (1996 to June 5 2016); EMBASE (1980 to June 5 2016); and CINAHL (1982 to June 5 2016) using the following search terms: (mechanical ventilation[MeSH] OR respiration, artificial[MeSH] OR mechanical ventilation OR triggered ventilation OR SIMV), plus database-specific limiters for RCTs and neonates (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for the full search strategies for each database). We did not apply language restrictions.<BR/>
<BR/>We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing or recently completed trials (<A HREF="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">clinicaltrials.gov</A>; the World Health Organization&#8217;s International Trials Registry and Platform <A HREF="http://www.whoint/ictrp/search/en/">www.whoint/ictrp/search/en/</A>; and <A HREF="http://www.isrctn.com/">the ISRCTN Registry</A>).</P>
<P>For the previous version of this review we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, 2008); Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials; MEDLINE from 1966 to 2008; and EMBASE 1996 to 2008 (MeSH terms: mechanical ventilation; triggered ventilation; artificial respiration; newborn infant).</P>

<P>Three of the review authors (AS, TR, VM) identified trials that might be included. Each trial was then assessed independently by each review author who completed data collection forms that the review authors had previously agreed upon. The results were then compared and if there was disagreement a fourth and fifth review author (AG, ADM) assessed the results independently. For each included trial, we collected information regarding the method of randomisation, blinding, stratification, number of centres participating in the study, trial inclusion and exclusion criteria and sample size. We also collected demographic data of the trial participants (e.g. gestational age, birth weight, postnatal age, primary diagnosis). We analysed information on clinical outcomes including death, air leaks, intraventricular haemorrhage, chronic lung disease, duration of ventilation or weaning, ventilation mode failure and extubation failure. The denominator for each outcome was the number randomised. In the meta-analyses involving comparison with CMV or HFO, either HFPPV or ACV/SIMV was designated the experimental therapy. In the meta-analyses of ACV or PRVCV versus SIMV, then ACV or PRVCV was designated the experimental therapy. In the meta-analyses of SIMV with PS versus SIMV, SIMV with PS was designated the experimental therapy, and in the meta-analysis of ACV versus PSV, ACV was designated the experimental therapy.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-06-28 16:20:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Physiological studies have demonstrated in prematurely born neonates that both high-frequency positive pressure ventilation and triggered ventilation are more likely to provoke a synchronous respiratory interaction; that is, the infant's inspiratory efforts coincide with positive pressure inflations. When compared to CMV, those ventilation modes were shown to be associated with improved ventilation. Unfortunately, in none of the subsequent randomised trials is it reported whether synchronous ventilation was achieved and few outcome measures are consistently reported in all relevant trials. Nevertheless, the meta-analyses demonstrate a significant decrease in air leak and a shorter duration of ventilation with HFPPV and triggered ventilation respectively. However, no significant effect on the incidence of BPD or death has been shown using either HFPPV or trigger ventilation modes.</P>
<P>No deleterious effects of those two ventilatory modes were highlighted. Some positive effects have been demonstrated of the newer triggered modes PRVCV and SIMV plus PS, but both modes have each only been examined in one randomised trial; further trials are required which incorporate long-term outcomes.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of the studies comparing SIMV or SIMV + PS with HFO show a significant decrease in moderate or severe BPD, and significantly shorter duration of mechanical ventilation with HFO. Whether other trigger modes such as ACV have similar results to HFO requires investigating.</P>
</DISCUSSION>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-08-03 09:43:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Comparative trials of assisted ventilation in neonates demonstrate that, compared to CMV, HFPPV is associated with a reduced risk of air leak and triggered ventilation with a shorter duration of ventilation. On clinical grounds, those ventilatory modes would seem preferable for preterm neonates to 'conventional' ventilation delivered at rates of less than 60 bpm. In addition, HFO resulted in a reduced risk of BPD and duration of ventilation compared to SIMV with or without pressure support. It is important to determine if other triggered modes such as ACV have similar poor results compared to HFO.</P>
<P>Comparative trials demonstrated that in preterm infants in the recovery stage of respiratory distress, ACV compared to SIMV is associated with a shorter duration of ventilation; thus, ACV would seem the more desirable mode of weaning for preterm neonates. There are insufficient randomised trials of PRVCV or pressure support versus SIMV to make any conclusions to their efficacy with regard to long-term efficacy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further trials are encouraged to assess whether ventilation modes likely to provoke synchronous ventilation will have other benefits and whether the mechanism of such effects is by provoking synchrony. Optimisation of trigger and ventilator performance with respect to respiratory diagnosis is essential. Randomised trials of the newer triggered modes with long-term outcomes are essential to determining their efficacy. </P>
