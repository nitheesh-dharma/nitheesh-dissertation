<P>Conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma, a tumour of the thin membrane that covers the white of the eye, is becoming more common, more aggressive, and affecting more young people, especially women. This pattern is associated with the HIV/AIDS pandemic, exposure to solar radiation, and infection with human papilloma virus (HPV). Various treatment modalities exist, but the recurrence rate is high and the cosmetic outcome of late disease unsightly (<A HREF="01">Figure 1</A>). Death may occur when the disease spreads to the surrounding structures and the brain. This review was conducted to evaluate the effects of the current interventions. No randomised controlled trials of any interventions for this cancer were found. Current clinical practice appears to be based on case series and case reports. These are weak sources of evidence for the effectiveness of a treatment. Randomised controlled clinical trials are needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-12-11 18:55:48 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva is described in the ophthalmic literature as a rare, slow-growing tumour of the eye, normally affecting elderly men around 70 years of age. In Africa, however, the disease is different. The incidence is rising rapidly, affecting young persons (around 35 years of age), and usually affecting women. It is more aggressive, with a mean history of three months at presentation. This pattern is related to the co-existence of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, high HPV exposure, and solar radiation in the region. Various interventions exist, but despite therapy, there is a high recurrence rate (up to 43%) and poor cosmetic results in late disease. This review was conducted to evaluate the interventions for treatment of conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma in HIV-infected individuals.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-12-11 18:56:36 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Definition<BR/>
</B>Squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva (SCC) is the end stage of a spectrum of conditions called ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). Histologically, OSSN varies from a benign form that includes papilloma, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and benign hereditary intraepithelial dyskeratosis, through a pre-invasive form called conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) graded as I,II or III depending on depth of involvement and finally the invasive form that includes squamous cell carcinoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Basti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basti 2003</LINK>). When the dysplastic changes are confined to the basal one third of the epithelium, this is termed CIN I or mild dysplasia, when they extend into the middle third of the epithelium this is termed CIN II or moderated dysplasia and when they extend into the superficial third of the epithelium this is termed CIN III or severe dysplasia. Full thickness dysplasia is also referred to as carcinoma-in-situ (CIS). Invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva refers to the infiltration through the basement membrane to involve the underlying stroma (<LINK REF="REF-Basti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basti 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2004</LINK>). Clinically, these stages may be indistinguishable except by histology.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Clinical features</B>
<BR/>The tumour may be asymptomatic or present with redness, irritation, severe pain, and visual loss (<LINK REF="REF-Tunc-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunc 1999</LINK>). It commonly affects the visible area between the upper and lower eyelids (interpalpebral conjunctiva), usually on the nasal side at the margin of the conjunctiva and the cornea (limbus). This slow-growing tumour can present as a solitary or diffuse growth. Solitary tumours can be nodular or gelatinous and may have a whitish plaque (leukoplakia). The lesion mimics benign conjunctival degenerations such as pterygium and pinguecula. Most cases are unilateral(<LINK REF="REF-Cervantes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cervantes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chisi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chisi 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The morbidity from squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva relates to the effects of the disease and its treatment. It may extend into the eyeball, orbit, regional lymph nodes, surrounding paranasal sinuses and the brain. Death may result from regional or distant metastases, as well as intracranial spread.</P>
<P>
<B>Aetiology</B>
<BR/>The aetiology of SCC has been associated with HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Ateenyi_x002d_Agaba-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ateenyi-Agaba 1995</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1996</LINK>), human papilloma virus (HPV) infection (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakamura-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakamura 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton 2002</LINK>), immunosuppression in organ transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Macarez-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macarez 1999</LINK>), and exposure to ultraviolet B rays of the sun (<LINK REF="REF-Ateenyi_x002d_Agaba-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ateenyi-Agaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2008</LINK>; ). Chronic conjunctival diseases, such as allergic conjunctivitis and trachoma, have also been implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Poole-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of affected persons in Africa are HIV-positive; 71% in Uganda, 86% in Malawi (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1996</LINK>) ,70.6% in South Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 2002</LINK>) and 75% in Nigeria (<LINK REF="REF-Osahon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osahon 2011</LINK>). In a smaller study in Zimbabwe, 12 out of 13 persons with SCC or CIS (92.3%) were HIV-positive (<LINK REF="REF-Porges-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porges 2003</LINK>). Many ophthalmologists in Africa now consider SCC in young adults to be a marker for HIV infection. The relationship between SCC and HPV is less clear. Some case-control studies have found an association (<LINK REF="REF-Moubayed-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moubayed 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Koning-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Koning 2008</LINK>) while some have not (<LINK REF="REF-Sen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guthoff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guthoff 2009</LINK>). Among HIV-infected people with SCC, cutaneous types of HPV are detected more frequently than the mucosal types (<LINK REF="REF-de-Koning-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Koning 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ateenyi_x002d_Agaba-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ateenyi-Agaba 2010</LINK>). In another Ugandan study, HPV was detected more frequently in the low-grade conjunctival neoplasias than in more advanced disease (<LINK REF="REF-Tornesello-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tornesello 2006</LINK>). Ultraviolet solar radiation causes tissue damange mediated through mutation of the tp53 tumour-suppressor gene and tissue matrix metalloproteinases (<LINK REF="REF-Ateenyi_x002d_Agaba-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ateenyi-Agaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is plausible that the aetiology involves an interaction of these factors in a yet to be determined model.</P>
<P>
<B>Epidemiology</B>
<BR/>The epidemiology of SCC has transformed in the last few decades. It used to be an uncommon slow-growing tumour found in elderly males (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKelvie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKelvie 2002</LINK>), but in Africa it is becoming more common, more aggressive, and more likely to affect young persons, especially females (<LINK REF="REF-Ateenyi_x002d_Agaba-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ateenyi-Agaba 1995</LINK>). This pattern is related to the co-existence of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, high HPV exposure, and solar radiation in the region. The HIV pandemic is mainly centered in Africa. In 2009 22.5 million of the 33.3 million infected people worldwide were living in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2010</LINK>). Africa also has the highest prevalence of HPV infection in the world, with an age-adjusted prevalence of 25.6% in women of age 15 to 74 years, followed by South America (14.3%), Asia (8.7%) and Europe (5.2%). (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2005</LINK>). The equator bissects the continent and over 75% of the continent is within the tropics with consequent high ambient solar exposure all year round.</P>
<P>The Kampala Cancer Registry in Uganda recorded a six-fold increase in the incidence of conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma, from an average of six per million per year between 1970 and 1988, to 35 per million per year in 1992 (<LINK REF="REF-Ateenyi_x002d_Agaba-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ateenyi-Agaba 1995</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>A study in Australia found that 78.5% of affected persons were elderly males with a mean age of 60 years (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1997</LINK>). Similarly, in Britain, 77% were males and 69% of them were more than 60 years old (<LINK REF="REF-McKelvie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKelvie 2002</LINK>). In contrast, a study in Zimbabwe found that 70% of patients were young females with a median age of 35 years (<LINK REF="REF-Pola-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pola 2003</LINK>), while in South Africa the mean age was 37 years (<LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 2002</LINK>). In Tanzania the tumour has been observed to be more aggressive than it was previously. The mean length of history on presentation is three months (<LINK REF="REF-Poole-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>SCC is a common tumour of the ocular surface among adults in Africa. <LINK REF="REF-Pola-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pola 2003</LINK> In Tanzania 45.8% of 168 conjunctival biopsies seen between 1996 and 1997 were squamous cell carcinomas, while 35% were pingueculum or pterygium (<LINK REF="REF-Poole-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prevalence of SCC in a hospital-based HIV-positive population in Kenya was 7.8% (<LINK REF="REF-Chisi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chisi 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Diagnosis</B>
<BR/>Most cases are diagnosed on clinical impression after a person presents with a growth on the eyeball, which is then excised and sent for histology to get a definitive diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1997</LINK>). Histopathology is the commonest mode of diagnosis in practice. Although regarded as the gold standard, histopathological diagnoses are subject to discordant interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Margo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margo 2002</LINK>). Cytology has also been used, especially for the follow-up of people treated using chemotherapy or immune therapy to monitor recurrence, since malignant cells are poorly adherent to each other (<LINK REF="REF-McKelvie-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKelvie 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other methods include the use of DNA cytometry to identify tumour-cell regression (<LINK REF="REF-Nadjari-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nadjari 1999</LINK>); immunostaining for certain molecular genetic markers, such as proliferating cells nuclear antigens (PCNA), Ki67 expression, tp53 gene mutations, and argyrophilic nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs) (<LINK REF="REF-Aoki-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aoki 1998</LINK>); and toluidine blue staining to mark tumour margins for surgical excision (<LINK REF="REF-Kaji-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaji 2006</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Treatment options</B>
<BR/>The treatment of this condition since the pre-HIV era has been simple: surgical excision alone or with additional adjunctive therapy. The main objective of surgical excision is complete removal of the tumour to minimise recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1997</LINK>). The resulting surface defect may need reconstruction using amniotic membrane transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Espana-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Espana 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gunduz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunduz 2005</LINK>) or limbal autografts (<LINK REF="REF-Copeland-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Copeland 1990</LINK>). Adjunctive therapies augment surgical excision. These include cryotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immune therapy, and amniotic membrane transplants. They work by killing residual malignant cells at the excision margins or any that may be seeded during excision, although there are also reports of their use as primary therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cerezo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cerezo 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karp-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karp 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barbazetto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbazetto 2004</LINK>). Cidofovir, an antiviral active against human papilloma virus, has been described as a primary therapy, and was reported to cause tumour regression (<LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2002</LINK>). It undergoes phosphorylation to active diphosphates independent of viral enzymes, which act as both inhibitors and alternative substrates of viral DNA polymerase, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Safrin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safrin 2004</LINK>). A list of these interventions is shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Cryotherapy kills malignant cells by repeated cycles of freezing and thawing (<LINK REF="REF-Peksayar-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peksayar 1989</LINK>). Chemotherapy involves using a class of drugs called antimetabolites. They act by interfering with the enzymes involved in the intermediary metabolism of replicating cancer cells. An example is 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C. The former (5-FU), is a prodrug, which means it is converted to active molecules. One of them, 5- fluoro-2'- deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP), binds to the enzyme thymidylate synthetase critical for the synthesis of thymidylate, which results in the inhibition of DNA synthesis. Another one, 5-fluorouridine-5'-triphosphate (FUTP) interferes with RNA synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Chu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chu 2004</LINK>). It is cell-cycle specific and acts in the S phase of the cell cycle. In one study, 1% 5-FU eyedrops were used alone without concurrent surgery or radiotherapy to treat a recurrent tumour (<LINK REF="REF-Midena-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Midena 2000</LINK>). Mitomycin C is an antibiotic which acts by interfering with the DNA of tumour cells. It undergoes metabolic activation, which generates an alkylating agent that cross-links DNA, making the cell unable to replicate (<LINK REF="REF-Chu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chu 2004</LINK>). It is a cycle-non-specific agent that is most effective in the G1 and S phases. Radiotherapy destroys the DNA and RNA of dividing cells (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1963</LINK>). The source of beta radiation is strontium 90 (<LINK REF="REF-Cerezo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cerezo 1990</LINK>). Photodynamic therapy combines a drug (called a photosensitizer or photosensitizing agent) with light of a specific wavelength to produce activated oxygen species that promote tumour destruction (<LINK REF="REF-Castano-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castano 2005</LINK>). Another treatment option is amniotic membrane transplantation. It is one of the layers of the placenta and is obtained after elective Caesarean section. It has anti-angiogenic, anti-scarring, and anti-inflammatory properties (<LINK REF="REF-Hao-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hao 2000</LINK>). Immune therapy for this condition involves the use of interferon alpha. Interferon alpha is part of a group of proteins called cytokines. It has three-pronged action with antiviral and oncostatic effects and also activates natural killer cells, which are cells of the immune system that are able to recognise and destroy tumour cells (<LINK REF="REF-Lake-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lake 2004</LINK>). The exact mechanism of action is not known. Cidofovir, an antiviral that is active against human papilloma virus, has been reported to cause regression of this tumour (<LINK REF="REF-Sherman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 2002</LINK>). It undergoes phosphorylation to active diphosphates independent of viral enzymes, which act as both inhibitors and alternative substrates of viral DNA polymerase, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Safrin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safrin 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Advanced disease where the tumour has spread requires removal of the eyeball (modified enucleation) or the entire orbital contents (exenteration) in an attempt to save life (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite therapy, up to 43% of treated patients experience recurrence at variable times (but usually within two years) (<LINK REF="REF-Peksayar-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peksayar 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tabin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeatts-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeatts 2000</LINK>). Simple excision has a higher rate of recurrence. A study in Australia reported 23% (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1997</LINK>). In the USA, it was 28.5%, but was 7.7% when combined with cryotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Sudesh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudesh 2000</LINK>). In one series of 17 cases treated with mitomycin C eye drops, 15 of them had undergone one to four surgical procedures before the mitomycin C treatment and six (35%) recurred within six months (<LINK REF="REF-Frucht_x002d_Pery-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frucht-Pery 1997</LINK>). The efficacies of treatment reported in the literature need to be interpreted cautiously, since some of the treated cases have recurrences from prior surgical excision (<LINK REF="REF-Frucht_x002d_Pery-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frucht-Pery 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Midena-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Midena 2000</LINK>). The recurrence rate may be higher in Africa due to late presentation, exposure to solar radiation, and lack of many of the adjunctive therapies. Only cryotherapy and chemotherapy are likely to be found in advanced centres.</P>
<P>It is not clear whether the efficacy of these interventions is different in people with HIV infection. The effect, if any, of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on this condition is also not clearly known.</P>
<P>
<B>Clinical and public health importance of this review</B>
<BR/>Although the number of people living with HIV infection worldwide seems to have stabilized Africa remains the global epicentre of the AIDS pandemic (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2010</LINK>). The region also has the highest prevalence of HPV in the world and high solar ultraviolet exposure year-round (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2005</LINK>). If this triad of risk factors remains, the number of cases of conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma is expected to remain high. The effect of HPV vaccination in children on OSSN if any will take a long time to determine.</P>
<P>Recurrences still occur after surgical excision. Most of the current adjunctive therapies described are not readily available in low-income countries. They are expensive and inconvenient to use. Cryotherapy requires special probes and canisters of liquid nitrogen gas that need refilling. Amniotic membrane transplantation requires tissue banks to process and preserve the transplant material. Medications for chemotherapy are not widely available, but are probably the easiest to obtain and use in such settings, since they are packed in small vials and do not require stringent storage conditions.</P>
<P>The cosmetic outcome of advanced disease and its treatment is very poor and leaves patients with an empty socket (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Patients who undergo orbital exenteration often experience social problems because of their facial disfigurement leading to limited social interaction (<LINK REF="REF-Bonanno-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonanno 2010</LINK>). Facilities for cosmetic surgery and orbital implants in low-income countries are often unavailable.</P>
<P>With antiretroviral therapy, HIV-infected people can now enjoy an improved physical appearance and quality of life, but unsightly lesions on the face such as those caused by conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma unmask what would otherwise be a 'hidden' HIV infection. This potentially exposes the affected persons to the stigma and discrimination associated with HIV infection.</P>
<P>Effective evidence-based interventions that allow early diagnosis and treatment are therefore needed.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-11-22 22:27:42 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review no randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of interventions against conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma in HIV-infected individuals were identified. No randomised controlled trials were found, even in the HIV-uninfected populations. Current practice is based on the results of interventional case series and case reports (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The quality of evidence from these study designs ranks low by various systems for grading evidence. It is graded level four by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OECBM) recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2001</LINK>) and low-grade by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>). According to GRADE, low means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. These studies are also mainly from western countries, where the participants are usually elderly males, who have a different disease profile from participants in developing countries. They have a less aggressive form of the disease and few are HIV-infected (<LINK REF="REF-Ateenyi_x002d_Agaba-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ateenyi-Agaba 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poole-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKelvie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKelvie 2002</LINK>). We could not explain why there are no trials, but postulate that perhaps it reflects differences in research priorities, since the prevalence of this tumour is low among HIV-infected individuals living in the western world.</P>
<P>There is a need to conduct randomised controlled trials to provide unbiased evidence for the effectiveness of currently used interventions for treating conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma. Ideally, the disease would be studied in its early stages, before it has spread, since in the later stages the treatment is more costly, can only be provided in tertiary care centres, and would tend to be individually tailored depending on the extent of spread. Studies are needed in the setting where the greatest burden of disease is found. The typical setting involves young HIV-infected individuals, mostly females with aggressive disease and HIV co-infections, in the context of high HIV prevalence, high solar exposure, and limited resources.</P>
<P>Investigating the effectiveness of simple surgical excision versus wide excision with or without adjunctive antimetabolite eye drops would be relevant as these are relatively simple interventions that can be easily translated in developing countries. The effect of new health technologies used in the developed world, such as cryotherapy, amniotic membrane transplants, and photodynamic therapy, should also be assessed in RCTs.</P>
<P>Preventive interventions directed against the mutagenic effects of solar ultraviolet B radiation and the oncogenic viruses associated with this disease also need to be identified.</P>
<P>There is also an important implication for diagnostic tests for early disease. Ethical issues that may arise include, for instance, whether participants should be subjected to the application of potentially dangerous cytotoxic antimetabolites as an adjunct to excision biopsy before there is histological confirmation of tumour. Treatment of conjunctival squamous cell carcinomas with topical mitomycin C and/or radiation has been associated with induction of atypical cell changes, such as conjunctival DNA-polyploidy afterward (<LINK REF="REF-Cartsburg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cartsburg 2001</LINK>). More sensitive diagnostic tests, such as cytology or immunostaining, may thus need to be used pre-operatively.</P>
<P>Treatment of opportunistic tumours in HIV/AIDS, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva, is part and parcel of HIV care. Untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva threatens survival. Not paying attention to this disease may compromise the gains from other care availed to affected individuals.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Current clinical practice in treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva is based on case series and case reports. This is a weak evidence base.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>RCTs for treatment of this disease are needed in the settings where it occurs most frequently. Preventive interventions, such as HPV vaccination, also need to be identified once scientific knowledge of the serotypes involved is established. HIV/AIDS research has not focused on treatment of this tumour.</P>

<P>Alcohol epitheliectomy for the corneal component and partial lamellar scleroconjunctivectomy with 3 to 4mm margins for the conjunctival component. Frozen sections may be used to ensure tumour-free margins. Modified enucleation involves removing the affected conjunctiva with a 4mm margin together with the eyeball. Exenteration involves complete removal of orbital tissue including the periosteum of the bony walls. The eyelids may or may not be spared.</P>

<P>Study selection</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The titles and abstracts of search results are scanned and compared to predetermined selection criteria for studies. Articles written in foreign languages are translated to English. Two authors working independently select trials. The authors are blinded to the trial uthors and institutions by asking the trial search co-ordinator to block this out when sending abstracts. Where there is uncertainty about inclusion, the full text of the article is obtained and read. If additional information is needed about the trial in question, it is categorized as awaiting assessment until this is obtained. If differences arise regarding trial inclusion, they are discussed and if still unresolved, Dr Taryn Young at the South African Cochrane Centre is asked to take a decision.</P>

<P>Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies is assessed to determine validity. Selection bias is checked by assessing whether the generation of a random allocation sequence and allocation concealment were performed. Randomization is considered adequate if the allocation sequence is generated from a table of random numbers or by computer. Allocation concealment is deemed adequate if undertaken by means of sequentially prenumbered sealed opaque envelopes, a centralised system or prenumbered coded identical containers. In addition, assessment of blinding, losses to follow-up and whether the analysis was by intention-to-treat (ITT) is undertaken. The definition of ITT is the requirement that participants be analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized, regardless of which intervention they actually received.</P>

<P>Assessment of heterogeneity: To identify statistical heterogeneity we look at the forest plot for overlapping confidence intervals and test it using the Cochrane Q test with a p-value of 0.10. The impact of heterogeneity on the meta-analysis is measured using the I-squared test. If I-squared is greater than 70% we will investigate by checking the trials for data entry errors and looking for existence of subgroups. Subgroup analysis by age, sex, geographical location and diagnostic method will be done. These factors have been shown to influence the occurrence of OSSN and we anticipate that they may also influence treatment effects. If no explanation for heterogeneity is found or its correction is not possible, meta-analysis will not be done.</P>

<TD>
<P>Meta-analysis: A fixed-effect model is used for meta-analysis but when there is heterogeneity that cannot be readily explained, a random-effects model is incorporated.</P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P/>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Sensitivity analysis: We examine how the magnitude of effect differs according to study quality or trial size and also the results of per-protocol analysis with those of intention-to-treat analysis.</P>

<P>Assessment of reporting bias: Publication bias is assessed by using a funnel plot to look for asymmetry.</P>
