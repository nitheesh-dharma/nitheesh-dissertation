<P>Antidepressant drugs may be useful in treating depression after stroke, but also cause side effects. Depression is common after stroke and may be treated with antidepressant medication or psychological therapy. This review of 16 trials, including 1655 participants, found that antidepressant drugs may produce recovery or improve depression symptoms. However they also increase side effects. These drugs should be used with caution in people with persistent depressive symptoms after stroke, as little is known about the risks, especially of seizures, falls, and delirium. We found no evidence for the benefit of psychotherapy. Future research should include a broader group of stroke patients.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-02 11:28:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Depression is an important consequence of stroke that impacts on recovery yet is often not detected or inadequately treated. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether pharmaceutical, psychological, or electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) of depression in patients with stroke can improve outcome.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-07-02 11:28:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group (last searched October 2007) and the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group (last searched February 2008). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006), EMBASE (1980 to May 2006), CINAHL (1982 to May 2006), PsycINFO (1967 to May 2006) and other databases. We also searched reference lists, clinical trials registers, conference proceedings and dissertation abstracts, and contacted authors, researchers and pharmaceutical companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-06-23 19:10:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing pharmaceutical agents with placebo, or various forms of psychotherapy or ECT with standard care (or attention control), in patients with stroke, with the intention of treating depression.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-23 19:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors selected trials for inclusion and assessed methodological quality; three review authors extracted, cross-checked and entered data. Primary analyses were the prevalence of diagnosable depressive disorder at the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included depression scores on standard scales, physical function, death, recurrent stroke and adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-23 15:27:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Sixteen trials (17 interventions), with 1655 participants, were included in the review. Data were available for 13 pharmaceutical agents, and four trials of psychotherapy. There were no trials of ECT. The analyses were complicated by the lack of standardised diagnostic and outcome criteria, and differing analytic methods. There was some evidence of benefit of pharmacotherapy in terms of a complete remission of depression and a reduction (improvement) in scores on depression rating scales, but there was also evidence of an associated increase in adverse events. There was no evidence of benefit of psychotherapy.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>A small but significant effect of pharmacotherapy (not psychotherapy) on treating depression and reducing depressive symptoms was found, as was a significant increase in adverse events. More research is required before recommendations can be made about the routine use of such treatments.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-02 11:48:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Depressive and anxiety disorders are important sequelae of stroke. These mood disorders occur in at least one third of patients in the first year after onset of stroke, although estimates differ between trials due to varying definitions, populations, exclusion criteria, and the timing of assessments (<LINK REF="REF-Hackett-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackett 2005a</LINK>). Inconsistent research findings are also due to the complexity of recognition, assessment and diagnosis of an underlying mood disorder associated with acute stroke, due to cognitive, language and other impairments. In addition, patients with stroke may experience a variety of behavioural syndromes that are more specific to brain injury, including indifference reaction, emotional lability, disinhibition, unawareness of illness (anosognosia) and difficulties with emotional expression (aprosody). In particular, much of the controversy surrounding 'stroke-associated depression' as a specific type of depressive syndrome hinges on concern about whether the tools normally used for the diagnosis of major depression and other depressive illnesses may misattribute features of ischaemic brain injury to depression (<LINK REF="REF-House-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">House 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1991</LINK>). Moreover, results will depend on whether subjects are categorised on the basis of psychiatric interview using standard diagnostic criteria such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (e.g. DSM-IIIR, DSM-IV) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) or psychiatric rating scales such as the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1979</LINK>), or based on self assessment using a rating scale of mood.</P>
<P>Although there is continued controversy about whether this illness is predominantly caused by physical factors (such as stroke lesion location) or by the patients' psychological response to stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2000</LINK>), evidence suggests that clinically diagnosed stroke-associated depression has a similar frequency and nature to depression among older people with other chronic illnesses (<LINK REF="REF-Burvill-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burvill 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burvill-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burvill 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharpe-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharpe 1990</LINK>). While it was previously thought that the period of greatest risk appeared to be within the first few months of stroke onset (<LINK REF="REF-Burvill-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burvill 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herrmann-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrmann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-House-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">House 1991</LINK>) this was not apparent in a systematic review of high-quality observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Hackett-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackett 2005a</LINK>). While some patients recover spontaneously, up to one third of patients have depression that persists during the first year or longer after the onset of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Astrom-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astrom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herrmann-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrmann 1998</LINK>). Patients with 'anxious depression' and those with more severe symptoms at presentation appear less responsive to treatment and have a worse long-term prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Astrom-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astrom 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence of a causal relationship between stroke-associated depression and adverse outcomes is complicated by potential confounding factors such as age, gender, social class, physical disability and co-morbid conditions. However, the evidence suggests that abnormal mood may impede rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Parikh-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parikh 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinyor-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinyor 1986</LINK>) by impairing physical and cognitive function (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1986</LINK>), and contributing to stress on carers (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1995a</LINK>). Furthermore, stroke-associated depression may also be associated with an increased risk of death (<LINK REF="REF-House-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">House 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-1993b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1993b</LINK>) including death by suicide (<LINK REF="REF-Stenager-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stenager 1998</LINK>). Depressive illness among older people, in general, is associated with greater morbidity and dependency, higher use of drugs and alcohol, increased use of healthcare resources, and poor compliance with treatment of co-morbid conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Katona-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katona 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although depression may influence recovery and outcomes following stroke, many, perhaps most, patients do not receive effective treatment because their mood disorder is undiagnosed or inadequately treated. <LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1987a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1987a</LINK>, for example, found that few patients with stroke-associated depression had been given antidepressants following discharge from hospital, while House et al (<LINK REF="REF-House-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">House 1989</LINK>) reported that both general practitioners and hospital doctors had a passive attitude to therapy. While this invariably reflects the problems with the diagnosis of a 'significant' mood state among older people with disability, it may also reflect uncertainty among clinicians as to the balance of benefits and risks (including side effects) of therapies in this setting. Indirect evidence of the effectiveness of pharmacological and psychological treatments for depression (and anxiety) for older people in general, and in those with associated physical illness, are available in several published reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Gill-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lima-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lima 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCusker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCusker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mittmann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittmann 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 1997</LINK>). However, because of the possibility that depression after stroke differs in important ways, it may be inappropriate to extrapolate these data to patients with stroke.</P>
<P>We undertook a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (published and unpublished) of pharmaceutical agents, psychological therapies or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for the treatment of depression associated with stroke.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether treatment of depression in patients with stroke improves outcome in terms of reduction in the proportion of patients with diagnosable depressive disorder. Secondary objectives were to determine whether treatment of depression improves mood scores, physical functioning, and health related quality of life, and reduces dependency either in patients or principle caregivers. We also aimed to determine the safety of and adherence to such treatments.</P>

<P>We restricted the review to all relevant RCTs in patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke, where a pharmaceutical agent, psychological therapy, or ECT, used for the treatment of depression, was compared with placebo or standard care. We excluded trials using a cross-over design, or in which two or more of the interventions were compared with each other rather than with a placebo or standard care group. There was no restriction on eligibility of RCTs on the basis of language, sample size, duration of follow up, or publication status.</P>
<P>Trials that met all the inclusion criteria, but in which no outcome data were available (either from the report of the trial or from the authors), could not contribute meaningfully to a pooled estimate of effect. These trials were regarded as 'drop outs' rather than ineligible, and are listed in an Additional Table (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), to indicate that they have not been overlooked.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-07-03 08:50:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We defined stroke according to clinical criteria. These include cerebral infarction, intracerebral haemorrhage and 'uncertain' pathological subtypes. This review excludes trials of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) only, as this entity has a different natural history and management strategy from other stroke subtypes. However, we did include trials with mixed stroke subtypes, including small numbers of SAH patients. There were no restrictions on the basis of age, sex or other characteristic. Participants were required to have depression (diagnosed by psychiatric interview, mood scale, or treating clinician) on recruitment. We excluded trials with participants who were not depressed at recruitment, but that measured depression as the primary outcome at follow up. These trials were included in a review of interventions for preventing depression after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Hackett-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hackett 2008</LINK>). </P>
<P>The diagnostic categories of depression considered were:<BR/>(1) depressive disorder, as defined by symptom scores on a standard screening instrument;<BR/>(2) major depression, as defined by the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IIIR, DSM-IV; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) or similar diagnostic criteria;<BR/>(3) dysthymia or minor depression, as defined by DSM or other standard diagnostic criteria.</P>
<P>Trials that included mixed populations (such as stroke and head injury or other central nervous system disorders) were excluded unless separate results for the stroke patients could be identified. Patients were excluded if they were being treated primarily for a stroke-associated pain syndrome, even if depression was measured as a secondary outcome.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-06-23 19:26:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included any trial that attempted to evaluate the following.<BR/>(1) A comparison between a pharmacological agent and placebo for the treatment of depression associated with stroke. Specific pharmacological agents included tricyclic antidepressants (for example nortriptyline, imipramine, and clomipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (for example fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram and paroxetine), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (for example moclobemide), and other antidepressant medications. Trials of an agent that was being evaluated for other reasons (for example neuroprotection or to facilitate neuro-regeneration) with a mood endpoint were excluded. We found no trials of psychostimulants (for example methylphenidate), mood stabilisers (for example lithium) or benzodiazepines. We found one trial of a combined preparation (Deanxit) which was included but analysed separately.<BR/>(2) A comparison between ECT and standard care for the treatment of depression associated with stroke. We found no trials of ECT. Any future trials will be included but analysed separately.<BR/>(3) A comparison between a psychological therapy and standard care for the treatment of depression associated with stroke. We included any psychological therapy that involved direct patient-professional interaction. The content of the interaction could vary from counselling to specific psychotherapy provided it was directed at helping patients develop their social problem-solving skills and adjustment to the emotional impact of stroke. All interventions had to have a psychological component - talking, listening, support, advice; be based on a theory of talking therapy; be structured and timetabled as a talking therapy; and be delivered by somebody with some explicitly stated training and supervision in therapies. Exclusions included interventions whose sole purpose was to educate or to provide information, occupational therapy (including leisure therapy and other rehabilitation services), and visits from stroke support workers, unless there was a clearly defined psychological component.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-07-02 11:30:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The primary analyses focused on the proportion of patients who could no longer be diagnosed according to diagnostic categories of depression that were applied by the trial authors at the end of the follow-up period (remission). These included:<BR/>(1) no longer meeting the criteria for depression or dysthymia as defined by DSM or similar standard diagnostic criteria;<BR/>(2) scoring below cut points for depressive disorder, as defined by symptom scores on standard rating scales.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes were as follows.<BR/>(1) Depression, as measured on scales such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS, <LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>), Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS, <LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1979</LINK>), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS, <LINK REF="REF-Gompertz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gompertz 1993</LINK>), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, <LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS Depression sub-scale, <LINK REF="REF-Zigmond-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zigmond 1983</LINK>).<BR/>(2) Psychological distress, as measured on composite scales such as the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ, <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1972</LINK>).<BR/>(3) Anxiety, as measured on scales such as the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS Anxiety sub-scale, <LINK REF="REF-Zigmond-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zigmond 1983</LINK>).<BR/>(4) Cognition, as measured on scales such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE, <LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>).<BR/>(5) Activities of daily living, as measured on scales such as the Barthel Index (BI, <LINK REF="REF-Mahoney-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahoney 1965</LINK>).<BR/>(6) Disability, as measured on scales such as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM, <LINK REF="REF-Deutsch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deutsch 1997</LINK>).<BR/>(7) Disadvantages of treatment were recorded as adverse events, grouped by death, all, and leaving the study early (including death).</P>

In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), EMBASE (1980 to May 2006), CINAHL (1982 to May 2006), PsycINFO (1967 to May 2006), Applied Science and Technology Plus (1986 to May 2006), Arts and Humanities Index (1991 to September 2002), Biological Abstracts (1969 to September 2002), BIOSIS Previews (2002 to May 2006), General Science Plus (1994 to September 2002), Science Citation Index (1992 to May 2006), Social Sciences Citation Index (1991 to May 2006), SocioFile (1974 to May 2006) and ISI Web of Science (2002 to February 2008). Biological Abstracts has now been superseded by BIOSIS Previews and ISI Web of knowledge includes the Arts and Humanities Index. We have not updated the searches on General Science Plus as this electronic database is not available for the current authors.</P>
<P>(1) We searched Dissertations and Theses (previously called Digital Dissertations), a database of abstracts from doctoral theses from within the United States, Canada, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom (1980 to August 2007).<BR/>(2) We searched the proceedings of the European Stroke Conferences (2000 to 2007) and the Stroke Society of Australasia Annual Scientific Meetings (1999 to 2007).<BR/>(3) In 2002 we contacted by letter several of the researchers active the area of stroke-associated mood disorders in the previous 10 years. We identified these researchers by scanning author lists of the relevant published trials, reviews and conference proceedings. We asked them to verify that all relevant trials had been identified and also if they had knowledge of any other relevant published or unpublished trials. We have not contacted them for this review update.<BR/>(4) In 2002 we contacted major pharmaceutical companies by letter and asked if they knew of any relevant unpublished trials. We did not contact them for this update. However, we searched the online Clinical Trial Results and Clinical Trial Registries for Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Forest, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Organon, Pfizer, Roche, and Wyeth (to August 2007).<BR/>(5) We searched the online clinical trials and research registers www.strokecenter.org/trials, www.ClinicalTrials.gov, www.Clinicalstudyresults.org and www.anzctr.org.au (to August 2007). The compulsory registration of clinical trial protocols on these sites before recruitment of the first patient, enabled us to elect not to contact researchers and pharmaceutical companies.<BR/>(6) We reviewed chapters in books on the prevention and treatment of depression and management of stroke, including but not limited to, reviews of the management of stroke, books specifically directed at the treatment or prevention of depression, and those on stroke and old age.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-01 21:36:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (MH and CH) reviewed all citations and discarded those that were irrelevant, based on the title of the publication and its abstract. In the presence of any suggestion that an article was possibly relevant, we retrieved the full-length article for further assessment. MH and CH independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review from the culled citation list. Potentially relevant Chinese articles were translated by JX. We resolved disagreements by discussion, and CA confirmed the final list and adjudicated any persisting differences of opinion.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>MH, CH and JX independently extracted, cross checked and entered the data on forms designed for the purpose. We discussed and resolved any discrepancies before we entered the data into the Review Manager software, RevMan 4.2.</P>
<P>We collected data on:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the report: author, year, and source of publication;</LI>
<LI>the study: sample characteristics, social demography, definition and criteria used for depression;</LI>
<LI>the patients: stroke sequence (first ever versus recurrent), social situation, time elapsed since stroke onset, prior history of psychiatric illness, current neurological status, current treatment for depression, and a history of coronary artery disease;</LI>
<LI>the research design and features: sampling mechanism, treatment assignment mechanism, adherence, non-response, and length of follow up;</LI>
<LI>the intervention: type, duration, dose, timing, and mode of delivery;</LI>
<LI>the effect size: sample size, nature of outcome, estimate and standard error.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To allow for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, we sought the data irrespective of their adherence, and regardless of whether the patients were subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow up.</P>
<P>We checked all the extracted data for agreement between review authors. We obtained missing information from the primary investigators whenever possible. To avoid introducing bias, this unpublished information was obtained in writing, on forms designed for the purpose, and entered into RevMan.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Although there are a number of scales devised for assessing the quality of RCTs, there is no convincing evidence that complex and time-consuming scales are more effective than simple scales (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2001</LINK>). As we extracted data, we documented specific details about the following five points.</P>
<P>(1) Generation of the randomisation sequence: the method used; was the study described as randomised, and a genuine randomisation process described; was this adequate, inadequate, or unknown? If the randomisation was blocked, was the size of the blocks known to those entering patients. Adequate randomisation = 1, inadequate/unknown randomisation = 0.<BR/>(2) Concealment of the random sequence from those entering patients into the trial: the method used; was it one that ensured tamper-free concealment of allocation; was it adequate, inadequate or unknown? Concealed randomisation = A, not concealed/unknown = B, and insecure = C.<BR/>(3) Who was blinded and how successful was blinding? Was the patient, health worker treating the patient, or the follow up raters blinded, and were attempts made to check blinding was successful?<BR/>(4) How many participants in each treatment group who were initially randomised were not included in the analysis? Was an ITT analysis possible on all participants from the published data (were there any exclusions from the trial after randomisation, or for cross over treatment groups)?<BR/>(5) How many patients were withdrawn from the trial, crossed-over treatment groups, or were lost to follow up (including when the proportion of patients who were lost to follow up was less than 20%)?</P>
<P>MH and CA independently assessed the methodological characteristics of each trial using the above checklist. The two review authors then met for a consensus meeting. They resolved disagreements by discussion, and a third review author (AH) resolved any persisting differences of opinion. For each included trial, we described features that influenced the degree of bias, as well as differences in baseline prognostic variables that might invalidate the results. One or more of these variables could be used to undertake sensitivity analyses in subsequent reviews.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analysis</HEADING>
<P>The main outcome of interest was the proportion of participants who met the diagnostic, or scoring, categories for depression at the end of follow up. For all dichotomous outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) where appropriate using fixed-effect analyses.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, if ordinal scale data appeared to be approximately normally distributed or if the analysis suggested parametric tests were appropriate, we treated the outcome measures as continuous variables. If there were at least two trials that reported the same outcomes, we reviewed the data for appropriateness of pooling. If there was definite evidence of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50%), we explored the potential reasons for the differences by performing subgroup or sensitivity analyses. If the heterogeneity could not be explained, we combined the trials using random-effects analyses with cautious interpretation, or did not combine them at all.</P>
<P>We used the RevMan software (RevMan 4.2) where possible; we used Excel and SAS for other analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup and sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>If there was definite evidence of heterogeneity, we explored potential reasons for the differences by performing subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, and meta-regression (<LINK REF="REF-Normand-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Normand 1999</LINK>). Where possible, we had planned to perform subgroup analyses to examine the impact of treatment type and duration, and of stroke severity. We were to undertake sensitivity analyses to explore the influence of date of publication, sample size, method of diagnosing depression, duration of follow up, high (greater than 20%) number of drop outs, and blinded versus unblinded outcome assessors. The sensitivity of the combined estimate to individual trials was to be explored by leaving one study out, calculating the combined effect of the remaining trials, and comparing the results with the combined effect based on all the trials. If meta-analyses are undertaken in updates of this review, funnel plots will be used to detect the presence of publication bias and the Trim and fill technique will be used to determine whether our results are sensitive to publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Duval-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duval 2000</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-03 08:43:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Seven new trials, four of pharmacotherapy (five interventions, <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lai-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Lai 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ponzio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ponzio 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rampello-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rampello 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2002</LINK>) and two of psychotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Watkins-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Watkins 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2004</LINK>), meeting our review criteria have become available since this review was first published in 2004. The addition of the new pharmacotherapy trials altered the results of the previous review and while there is now some evidence to support the use of pharmacotherapy to treat depression after stroke there is also stronger evidence of more adverse events for those receiving antidepressants. The results of this meta-analysis should also be considered in light of the recent meta-analysis showing a small benefit of SSRIs only in those with severe depression, with that benefit possibly being explained by fewer in this group responding to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Kirsch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirsch 2008</LINK>). The addition of the psychotherapy trials (<LINK REF="STD-Watkins-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Watkins 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2004</LINK>) did not change the previous review finding that there is no evidence of the effectiveness of psychotherapy for the treatment of depression after stroke.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the results of the trials in this review did not allow for pooling of some key endpoints, so we have provided a predominantly narrative review of the evidence. However, this evidence of benefit must be considered alongside several basic methodological limitations of many of these trials, including the short duration of many interventions, variation in the types of trial participants recruited and the methods used to diagnose depression, lack of an a priori measurable endpoint, and the generally poor design, outcome assessment, analysis and interpretation of results. Of particular concern is the evidence of harm (more adverse events) given the small number of trials that systematically recorded and reported adverse events, making reliable the assessment of the benefits and risks of treatments impossible.</P>
<P>For pharmacotherapy trials, a key requirement is to achieve a therapeutic dose of the medication for an adequate period of time. The guidelines for the American College of Physicians suggest that antidepressants should be continued for at least four months beyond initial recovery, and that treatment should be changed if no response has been shown by six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Snow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2000</LINK>). In this review, the interventions in most pharmacotherapy trials were probably not given for an adequate length of time to show a maximal or sustained response. Therefore, we are unable to comment on the long-term effects of antidepressant therapy, or provide information on the most appropriate duration or dose of treatment, if one group of antidepressants is more efficacious, or provide stopping rules for antidepressant therapy in this group.</P>
<P>For psychotherapy trials, there is also good evidence that efficacy is linked to delivery of an adequate exposure to the intervention. This means that therapists should be trained and supervised in the therapy they are delivering, and use a standardised, pre-specified, framework for therapy. To achieve this in psychotherapy trials, the therapy is determined using a manual and the research therapists are trained and supervised in the use of the manual. Success in brief therapy is linked to adherence to the therapeutic model as well as to the therapists' characteristics. Future stroke psychotherapy trials should also adhere to these standard psychotherapy research guidelines if there is to be any probability of demonstrating consistency and response.</P>
<P>The trials in this review included participants with depression occurring several days to more than two years following stroke. However, depression occurring in the early phase of stroke is likely to be different from that occurring several months or years after the event. Survivors in the first weeks following stroke are coping with the consequences of experiencing a potentially life-threatening event, as well as recovering from the disabling effects of the stroke itself. In the medium to long-term, survivors of stroke are more likely to be adjusting to the prospects of permanent disability and changes in social and financial circumstances. It is difficult to summarise the evidence from such mixed populations, and even in doing so, whether it could be considered meaningful, especially given the high risk of relapse of depression in the first few months of recovery, which declines over time (<LINK REF="REF-Snow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In contrast to the wide range in the length of time between stroke onset and entry into the trial, many trials included patients with narrow demographic and clinical characteristics, in particular, they excluded patients with communication problems, cognitive loss, or previous psychiatric illness. This reinforces a common criticism of depression research, that the trial participants are not representative of those requiring treatment in the 'real world' (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmerman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmerman 2002</LINK>). It would appear that this criticism is also applicable to trials of depression following stroke, where up to half of survivors may be excluded using such criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Turner_x002d_Stokes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner-Stokes 2003</LINK>). Given the high age of most patients with stroke, and the frequent presence of neurological impairments, aphasia and co-morbid medical conditions, the fact that up to half of all survivors of stroke are excluded limits the external validity (generalisability) of the results. The use of a large list of exclusions means that the results are applicable to only a small proportion of stroke survivors who have a narrow range of co-morbidities and other characteristics. Such exclusions may be justifiable for trials of psychotherapy, where participants are required to actively participate in therapy by talking, but seem inappropriate for the pharmacotherapy trials. Ideally, patients should be heterogeneous with regard to stroke diagnosis, which requires the use of standard diagnostic criteria and neuroimaging in a high proportion of cases. Given differences in the natural history and management of SAH it could be argued that this form of stroke should be examined separately.</P>
<P>The lack of a consistent method to diagnose depression, both for entry and outcome, in the included trials is a concern and a reflection of the general lack of a standard definition for a 'healthy state' among people with mood disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Keller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keller 2003</LINK>). Few trials stated whether the primary goal of therapy was remission (no longer meeting the baseline criteria for depression), response (a 50% reduction in mood scores from baseline), or simply a greater reduction in mood scores (or difference in scores) in one of the randomised groups. The complete remission of symptoms is arguably the most meaningful endpoint for the patient, whereas the significance of a small reduction in mood scores on a continuous scale is generally difficult to interpret for the patient and the treating physician. These problems with outcome assessment were further confounded by the frequent use of multiple scales both between and within trials. Because multiple scales were used in each trial, selective reporting of findings was also common. Any one scale was used across only eight trials at most, and significantly different cut-points were used to determine depression at entry and trial end. Given the practical difficulties and high cost of conducting psychiatric interviews in clinical trials it seems appropriate to adopt a pragmatic approach to determine depression on the basis of a validated mood questionnaire or semi-structured interview. Hopefully the compulsory registration of trial protocols on publicly available databases will reduce, if not eliminate, the opportunity for selective reporting of results. It has been suggested that more than one third of efficacy outcomes and half of harm outcomes are inadequately reported (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several other methodological deficiencies in trials further limit the conclusions that can be drawn from this review. Many trials were small, less than half reported adequate concealment of the randomisation sequence, and drop-out rates were high in several trials. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1994</LINK>) excluded patients randomised before 28 days from their analyses, co-incidentally this group of patients experienced large responses in the placebo group. Additionally, blinding of investigators and outcome assessors was seldom stated. Reporting and analysis of results varied, with most (eight) trials presenting per-protocol analyses only or not specifying whether analyses were per protocol or ITT. For trials with high drop-out rates, ITT analysis of the data is very important. Researchers need to specify how missing data are handled (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>). If ITT (giving missing data both the best possible and worst possible outcome) and per-protocol analysis indicate similar trends, the findings are likely to be interpreted as being clinically more robust. It continues to seem pertinent to recommend that researchers consult the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guidelines for statistical principles for clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-ICH-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH 1999</LINK>) and the revised CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2003</LINK>) when designing, and reporting findings of, future trials.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is evidence from trials in stroke patients to tentatively support the use of prescription antidepressants to treat depression but this must be considered in light of the evidence of an associated increase in harm and of a lack of efficacy of SSRIs generally except in those with severe depression. Antidepressants may produce a remission or a response in terms of lower scores on mood rating scales, but also increase adverse events. It is recommended that these agents are used with caution in those with a persistent depressive disorder after stroke, as little is known about the risks, especially of seizures, falls and delirium, especially in older people and those on concomitant medication. We found no evidence for the benefit of psychotherapy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We recommend the need for further research in this area. Future trials investigating the effect of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in the treatment of depression in people after stroke should address the following:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>review and refine the methods for trials of psychological endpoints in people with physical illness;</LI>
<LI>recruit an adequate number of participants so that variables such as time passed between stroke and recruitment, and inclusion of patients with dysphasia, and SAH can be controlled, and modest but clinically important effects can be detected;</LI>
<LI>recruit a representative 'real world' sample of patients to enable results to be generalised to the majority of stroke survivors;</LI>
<LI>provide treatment for a sufficient duration and follow up, so that rates of relapse or maintenance of remission can be assessed;</LI>
<LI>psychotherapy interventions need to be carefully specified and monitored;</LI>
<LI>include careful, prospective assessment and complete reporting of adverse events;</LI>
<LI>define a priori an unambiguous, measurable, primary endpoint; </LI>
<LI>limit the number of secondary outcomes to three or four and report results for all outcomes.</LI>
