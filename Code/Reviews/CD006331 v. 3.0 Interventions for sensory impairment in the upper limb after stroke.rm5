<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-15 15:15:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Up to 80% of people who have a stroke experience sensory loss in their affected arm. This sensory loss puts the arm at risk for injury and impacts functional use of the arm and the survivors' level of independence during daily activities. We found 13 studies involving 467 participants that tested different treatments for sensory loss. There is limited evidence that these treatments may be effective. No more than one study examined each particular intervention, frequently the studies were of poor quality and lacked sufficient information. Further research is needed before clear recommendations can be made.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-03-24 11:00:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 8 October 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2009), EMBASE (1980 to January 2009), and six further electronic databases to January 2009. We also handsearched relevant journals, contacted authors in the field, searched doctoral dissertation databases, checked reference lists, and completed citation tracking.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-03-04 11:12:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomized controlled trials and controlled trials comparing interventions for sensory impairment after stroke with no treatment, conventional treatment, attention placebo or with other interventions for sensory impairment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-03-24 11:00:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors selected studies, assessed quality and extracted data. We analyzed study data using mean differences and odds ratios as appropriate. The primary outcome we considered was sensory function and secondary outcomes examined included upper limb function, activities of daily living, impact of stroke and quality of life as well as adverse events.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-24 10:59:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included 13 studies, with a total 467 participants, testing a range of different interventions. Outcome measures included 36 measures of sensory impairment and 13 measures of upper limb function. All but two studies had unclear or high risk of bias. While there is insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the effects of interventions included in this review, three studies provided preliminary evidence for the effects of some specific interventions, including mirror therapy for improving detection of light touch, pressure and temperature pain; a thermal stimulation intervention for improving rate of recovery of sensation; and intermittent pneumatic compression intervention for improving tactile and kinesthetic sensation. We could not perform meta-analysis due to a high degree of clinical heterogeneity in both interventions and outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-15 15:10:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Multiple interventions for upper limb sensory impairment after stroke are described but there is insufficient evidence to support or refute their effectiveness in improving sensory impairment, upper limb function, or participants' functional status and participation. There is a need for more well-designed, better reported studies of sensory rehabilitation.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-24 11:45:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-03-24 11:45:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is the leading cause of disability and the third or fourth leading cause of death both in the USA and many developed countries around the world (<LINK REF="REF-Eaves-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eaves 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HSAO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSAO 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HSFC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSFC 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NSFA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSFA 2005</LINK>). Pendlebury et al concluded that approximately one million strokes occur each year in Europe, making it the most common neurological disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Pendlebury-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pendlebury 2004</LINK>). There are three million permanently disabled stroke survivors in the USA. In the USA in 2006 the American Stroke Association estimated the costs of stroke (both direct and indirect) to be USD 57.9 billion (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 2006</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, stroke accounts for approximately 6% of total National Health Service and social services expenditure, with most of the cost associated with the resulting chronic disability (<LINK REF="REF-Pendlebury-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pendlebury 2004</LINK>). Approximately 25% of chronic disability in Australia is due to stroke, costing the Australian economy over AUD 1.3 billion annually (<LINK REF="REF-ASPSC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASPSC 2004</LINK>). There are 300,000 Canadians living with the effects of stroke costing the Canadian economy about CAD 2.7 billion per year (<LINK REF="REF-HSFC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSFC 2005</LINK>). Recognition of the importance of rehabilitation services in the management of conditions that affect people's functional abilities is growing. In Canada and the USA, those who require rehabilitation after stroke make up the largest category of rehabilitation patients and have the third longest length of inpatient stay (<LINK REF="REF-Hopman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopman 2003</LINK>). The cost of stroke is expected to continue to grow worldwide over the next two decades due to the increasing age of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Pendlebury-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pendlebury 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common deficit after stroke is hemiparesis of the contralateral upper limb, with more than 80% of those with stroke experiencing it acutely and more than 40% chronically (<LINK REF="REF-Cramer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cramer 1997</LINK>). Upper limb impairments continue to limit the functional independence and satisfaction for 50% to 70% of stroke survivors, and only 5% of survivors who initially experienced complete paralysis achieve functional use of their arm (<LINK REF="REF-HSAO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSAO 2001</LINK>). Exploration of the environment and mastery and participation in daily occupations are intimately associated with both movement and sensation. Deficits in somatic sensations (body senses such as touch, temperature, pain and proprioception) after stroke are common with prevalence rates variously reported to be 11% to 85% (<LINK REF="REF-Yekutiel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yekutiel 2000</LINK>), 65% (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1993</LINK>), 60% to 74% (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2002</LINK>), and 100% ( <LINK REF="REF-Rand-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rand 2001</LINK>). This variability among the studies is thought to be related to differences in assessment and definition of sensory impairment, and study design (<LINK REF="REF-Yekutiel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yekutiel 2000</LINK>). The sensory deficits do not appear to be confined to the contralateral upper limb, with several studies noting significant impairment in the ipsilateral upper limb after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nowak-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowak 2007</LINK>). While the level of impairment in the ipsilateral upper limb is generally considered less than that of the contralateral upper limb, in some cases moderate to severe deficits have been reported and deficits have also been noted to persist for a period of years after stroke. The incidence of ipsilateral impairment generally cited varies from 12% to 26% (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are many different sensory modalities affected by stroke. The loss of detection of touch sensation has been noted in up to 65% to 94% of all stroke survivors (<LINK REF="STD-Acerra-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Acerra 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carey-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1993</LINK>). Impairment in proprioception (ability to sense the position and orientation of parts of the body) (17% to 52%), vibration (44%), light touch (32% to 89%), and loss of pinprick sensation (35% to 71%) have also been noted (<LINK REF="STD-Acerra-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Acerra 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyson 2008</LINK>). Disturbance of other sensory modalities including two-point discrimination, stereognosis (recognition or identification of objects by use of touch), kinesthesia (detection of bodily position, weight, or movement of the muscles, tendons, and joints), graphesthesia (recognition of writing on the skin by the sensation of touch) and pain are found (<LINK REF="REF-Connell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1996</LINK>). Tactile extinction (where people with unilateral damage do not detect touch given to the contralateral side when a symmetrical touch stimulus is given to the ipsilateral side) has been considered to be attentional in nature (tactile neglect) by some authors but is described by other authors as a higher order or cortical tactile sensation along with two point discrimination, stereognosis and graphesthesia and as such is often reported with sensory modalities in medical texts (<LINK REF="REF-Blumenfeld-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenfeld 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bohannon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohannon 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilroy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilroy 2000</LINK>). It is therefore included in this review but considered separately.The quality of sensory deficits experienced after stroke include delayed perception, uncertainty of responses, changes in sensory thresholds, fatigue, altered time for sensory adaptation, sensory persistence, and altered nature of the sensation (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Functionally, the problems resulting from sensory deficits after stroke can be summarized as (1) impaired detection of sensory information, (2) disturbed performance of motor tasks that require somatosensory information, and (3) diminished rehabilitation outcomes for the upper limb (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2002</LINK>). Sensation is essential for safety even if there is adequate motor recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Yekutiel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yekutiel 2000</LINK>). The development of secondary complications such as sores, abrasions, and shoulder-hand syndrome has been associated with the impairment of sensation (<LINK REF="REF-Rand-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rand 2001</LINK>). Sensory impairment has also been found to be directly associated with the development of shoulder pain and subluxation (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gamble-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gamble 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suethanapornkul-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suethanapornkul 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>When impairment in the ability to detect and process sensory data occurs, the stroke survivor will have difficulty exploring and relating to his environment (<LINK REF="REF-Dannenbaum-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dannenbaum 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yekutiel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yekutiel 2000</LINK>). It was postulated by van der Lee et al that stroke survivors who have sensory impairments do not use the affected limb to their fullest motor potential (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Lee-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Lee 1999</LINK>). The spontaneous use of the upper limb has been noted to significantly decrease when cutaneous sensory processing is impaired (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rand-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rand 2001</LINK>). This continued disuse of the affected extremity leads to a further decrease in skilled movement, particularly for functional skills that require a constant sustained muscle contraction (<LINK REF="REF-Dannenbaum-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dannenbaum 1993</LINK>). This further contributes to the pattern of learned non-use. The quality of upper limb movements is also impaired in the presence of sensory impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Nowak-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowak 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rand-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rand 2001</LINK>). Stroke survivors were found to have impairments in force control, fine motor manipulation of objects, sensory ataxia, decreased grasp, and changes in prehension patterns, all of which have been found to be associated with sensory impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Aruin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aruin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blennerhassett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blennerhassett 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nowak-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowak 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Welmer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welmer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yekutiel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yekutiel 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sensory deficits have been shown to predict poor functional outcome after stroke, including increased length of hospitalization, lower levels of discharge home, lower numbers of home discharges, and increased mortality rates (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rand-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rand 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yekutiel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yekutiel 2000</LINK>). Tyson et al found that impairment of sensation was significantly associated with mobility, independence in activities of daily living and recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Tyson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyson 2008</LINK>) while Desrosiers et al found a significant association with long-term participation (<LINK REF="REF-Desrosiers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desrosiers 2006</LINK>). While proprioceptive status soon after stroke has been reported to be a reliable predictor of long-term motor recovery, other studies have shown no association between functional status at discharge and somatosensory impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1995</LINK>). For example, Rand et al found no significant difference in functional outcomes six weeks post-stroke between individuals with both motor and proprioceptive deficits and those with pure motor deficits (<LINK REF="REF-Rand-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rand 1999</LINK>). Tactile extinction on the left side of the body (of double simultaneous stimulation) was shown to be the single most important predictor of functional outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1994</LINK>). Many factors contribute to the varied outcomes among these studies, including how sensory impairment is defined and measured, and the time post-stroke and stage of recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although sensory impairments significantly limit the ability to use the upper limb after stroke and increase the risk of secondary complications, to date little is known about the effectiveness of interventions that address this issue. This systematic review examines the effectiveness of interventions for sensory impairment after stroke.<BR/>

<P>The objectives of this review were to determine if interventions for upper limb sensory impairment are more effective at improving:</P>
<OL>
<LI>sensory function than no treatment, control or placebo interventions;</LI>
<LI>upper limb function than no treatment, control or placebo interventions;</LI>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2010-03-24 11:00:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included controlled trials of sensory interventions to improve function or remediate sensory impairments of the upper limb following stroke where participants were randomly or quasi-randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups. We also included trials with or without blinding of the participants, therapists, or evaluators. We also included randomized cross-over trials that met the above criteria.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2010-03-04 11:29:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included adults (18 years and over) with a clinical diagnosis of stroke, either hemorrhagic or ischemic, that did not necessarily need to be confirmed using imaging studies. The stroke resulted in the participants initially experiencing a disturbance in sensory function of the upper limb. We defined a disturbance in sensory function as any impairment that impacted on sensory registration, perception, or discrimination, resulting from a cerebral vascular accident and where the primary sensory receptors are intact. We included studies with mixed etiology groups if at least 50% of participants were diagnosed with stroke.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-03-22 20:38:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Included studies addressed the recovery of function or remediation of sensory impairments in the upper limb by specifically focusing on interventions hypothesized to remediate sensory impairments after stroke, or both.These interventions included: sensory re-education, tactile kinesthetic guiding, repetitive sensory practice, or desensitization. We also examined studies that explored novel intervention strategies if they were relevant to upper limb functional use and included an outcome measure for sensory function or impairment. These interventions were delivered as stand-alone or as an adjunct to conventional therapy.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-03-24 11:00:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The primary outcome of interest was sensation. There are many distinct sensory modalities identified in the literature and defined in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> above. We considered measures of the following sensory modalities in this review (and will consider these in review updates):</P>
<OL>
<LI>light touch;</LI>
<LI>mechanical sensation;</LI>
<LI>temperature detection;</LI>
<LI>two-point discrimination;</LI>
<LI>depth sense;</LI>
<LI>vibration sense;</LI>
<LI>sustained pressure;</LI>
<LI>kinesthesia;</LI>
<LI>position sense;</LI>
<LI>stereognosis;</LI>
<LI>graphesthesia;</LI>
<LI>pain (pressure pain, temperature pain, pain intensity);</LI>
<LI>combined sensory modality assessment.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Some controversy surrounds the inclusion of tactile/proprioceptive extinction as a sensory modality. We have included it in this review and will look at the data separately. In addition, we considered somatosensory evoked potentials. Measurement of these modalities may be from modality specific measures, global sensory measures, or sensory subscales of larger scales such as the Motor Assessment Scale and the Fugl-Meyer, which are impairment-based measures and address sensation. We also included the perceived level of impairment or discomfort by the stroke survivor.</P>
<P>The secondary outcomes of interest were upper limb functional use, activity limitations, and participation. Each of these is explained in more detail below.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Functional use of the upper limb. This outcome included:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>specific components of upper limb function such as dexterity or hand function (using measures such as the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test);</LI>
<LI>upper limb motor functioning (using measures such as the Fugl Meyer, Modified Motor Assessment scale);</LI>
<LI>upper limb functioning (using measures such as Chedoke or the Motor Activity Log);</LI>
<LI>scales that identified the survivors' perceived level of use and satisfaction with level and quality of upper limb use.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Activity limitations measures focus on performance of activities of daily living. This outcome included:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>basic activities of daily living (using measures such as the Barthel Index or the Functional Independence Measure);</LI>
<LI>instrumental activities of daily living (using measures such as the Frenchay Activites Index);</LI>
<LI>global dependency scales.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Participation measures focus the level of participation in life roles and satisfaction levels with that participation. This outcome included:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>measures of the impact of a stroke on participation (using measures such as the Stroke Impact Scale);</LI>
<LI>quality of life measures.</LI>
</OL>
</OL>
<P>We also included death from any cause during the treatment, adverse effects and economic data, if available.</P>
<P>We recorded outcome measures based on these categories, extracted the appropriate data from the studies, and came to a consensus as to which to include in the final analysis.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, which was last searched by the Managing Editor on 8 October 2009. In addition, we searched the following electronic bibliographic databases; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2009), EMBASE (1980 to January 2009), CINAHL (1982 to January 2009), AMED (1985 to January 2009), PsycLIT (1974 to January 2009), Science Citation Index (1945 to January 2009), Social Science Citation Index (1956 to January 2009) and LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) (1982 to January 2009). The MEDLINE Search strategy (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), developed with assistance from the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Search Co-ordinator, was used as the basis for the above literature searches (with the last updated search completed 19 January 2009). We also searched the following specialist occupational therapy and physiotherapy databases: PEDro (<A HREF="http://www.pedro.org.au/">http://www.pedro.org.au/</A>) and OTseeker (<A HREF="http://www.otseeker.com">www.otseeker.com</A>) (last searched January 2009).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors rated the risk of bias of the studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) and in the Review Manager software RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). If there was disagreement, we asked the third review author to rate the study and used the rating that two of the three review authors selected. Where this did not occur all three review authors discussed the decision further until we reached agreement. Where there were items that were unclear, we attempted to contact the study authors by email or telephone to obtain the information needed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>We entered data into RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) using the double data entry facility to allow for error checking. We used RevMan 5 for data entry, analysis, and display.</P>
<P>We undertook the following analyses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>specific treatment for sensory impairment versus no treatment (or with conventional treatment in both study arms);</LI>
<LI>specific treatment for sensory impairment versus conventional upper limb therapy;</LI>
<LI>specific treatment for sensory impairment versus placebo sensory treatment or attention placebo;</LI>
<LI>comparisons between different types of treatments for sensory impairment.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We placed studies in which both the treatment and control group received conventional therapy and the only difference was that the treatment group also received specific treatment for sensory impairment in the first group above. We defined attention placebo as a type of comparison group in which the participants met with the clinician for the similar duration and frequency as those in the experimental group but did not receive the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Nock-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nock 2007</LINK>), or received some input designed to provide attention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity and subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>We planned to undertake a meta-analysis for this review and to examine heterogeneity prior to completing a meta-analysis. We planned to do this for all included studies and then for each individual subgroup, following the recommendation in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> that there should be at least 10 studies in a group for analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). If there were fewer than 10 studies, we would not do further analysis and would provide narrative information. We planned to calculate heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2 </SUP>test. If I<SUP>2</SUP> was greater than 50%, indicating that significant heterogeneity was detected, we would do a sensitivity analysis. We planned to test the sensitivity of the review to key decisions made by recalculating the analysis in the following manner: (1) excluding studies of lower methodological quality, and (2) excluding unpublished studies. We were to undertake subgroup analysis based on the intervention technique used. We also planned to do intention-to-treat analysis for all studies included in the review if possible. However, due to significant clinical diversity amongst the studies found in terms of both interventions and outcomes, and in many instances, lack of available data, it was not possible to undertake a meta-analysis or sensitivity analyses for this review.</P>
<P>We have expressed dichotomous outcomes as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We have expressed continuous outcomes, if possible, as mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs.</P>

<P>We identified 1554 references in initial searches. Initial screening by one of the review authors reduced this to 662 references whose abstracts were then screened by two review authors to see if they met the inclusion criteria. Two review authors reviewed full copies of the references to 48 studies. At the end of this process 13 studies met the inclusion criteria and study design requirements (randomized controlled trial or controlled clinical trial) (<LINK REF="STD-Acerra-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Acerra 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burridge-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Byl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Byl 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cambier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cambier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Feys 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heldman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jongbloed-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Jongbloed 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poole-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Poole 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posteraro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Posteraro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolny-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolny 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yozbatiran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yozbatiran 2006</LINK>). We limited excluded studies listed in the review in accordance with section 7.2.5 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) and 32 studies that met all the inclusion criteria except study design were not included.

<P>Sample sizes in the included studies ranged from 10 (<LINK REF="STD-Posteraro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Posteraro 2001</LINK>) to 100 (<LINK REF="STD-Feys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Feys 1998</LINK>) for a total of 467 participants. The participants ranged in age from 22 to 87 years. The sample included 173 females and 184 males. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poole-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Poole 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posteraro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Posteraro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolny-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolny 2003</LINK>) did not provide information on the gender of their participants. All studies required that the participants had had one stroke that impacted their upper limb with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Byl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Byl 2003</LINK>, which included three participants with more than one stroke. Each study varied in the specific definition of sensory impairments, how they were measured, and the level of impairments experienced by their participants. Not all the studies consistently reported if the upper limb impaired was right or left, or dominant or non-dominant. Time since stroke varied between participants and between studies, with eight studies including participants within three months of their stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Acerra-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Acerra 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cambier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cambier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Feys 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jongbloed-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Jongbloed 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posteraro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Posteraro 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yozbatiran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yozbatiran 2006</LINK>), three studies including participants from four to 20 months (<LINK REF="STD-Heldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heldman 2000</LINK>), one to 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Burridge-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 2002</LINK>), and one with a mean of 5.1 years post-stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Byl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Byl 2003</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Poole-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Poole 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolny-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolny 2003</LINK>) did not provide any data related to the time post stroke. The exact setting of included studies was only described for six of the studies: inpatient rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Acerra-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Acerra 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cambier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cambier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK>), combined inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Burridge-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cambier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cambier 2003</LINK>), and acute care (<LINK REF="STD-Jongbloed-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Jongbloed 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yozbatiran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yozbatiran 2006</LINK>). The 13 studies were completed in 11 different countries as outlined in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>In general interventions could be considered as taking either a sensory retraining approach or sensory stimulation approach. Only three studies had a sensory retraining focus (<LINK REF="STD-Acerra-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Acerra 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Byl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Byl 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posteraro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Posteraro 2001</LINK>). The remaining studies provided some sort of stimulation intervention including compression, electrical stimulation, thermal stimulation, sensory integrative treatment, magnetic stimulation, or tensive mobilizations. Many different intervention techniques were examined by the studies with most providing clear descriptions of the interventions. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolny-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolny 2003</LINK>) provided few details of the intervention even when we contacted the authors.</P>
<P>A sensory retraining program was used by three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Acerra-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Acerra 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Byl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Byl 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posteraro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Posteraro 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Acerra-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Acerra 2007</LINK> used mirror therapy in addition to therapy as normal, asking participants to complete sensory motor tasks inside a mirror box that provided visual feedback of bilateral simultaneous hand movements. <LINK REF="STD-Byl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Byl 2003</LINK> compared two different sequences for fine motor and sensory retraining programs. They had clear guidelines for a fine motor program that included stress free hand activities, practising repetitive specific fine motor tasks, general aerobic, strengthening and flexibility training, and reinforcement with mental rehearsal. The sensory component involved using stress free hand strategies, graded and repetitive sensory discrimination activities, nervous and sensory system quieting activities, and reinforcement with mental imagery. <LINK REF="STD-Posteraro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Posteraro 2001</LINK> used a graded program that focused on tactile recognition starting with simple recognition and progressing through simultaneous stimuli recognition and progressing to complex stimuli recognition.</P>
<P>Electrical stimulation was used by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Burridge-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yozbatiran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yozbatiran 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Burridge-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 2002</LINK> used a two channel neuromuscular electrical stimulation unit to stimulate the triceps brachialis and the second channel to stimulate extensor digitorum communis, extensor carpi radialis, and if possible extensor pollicis longus. This was a synchronized contraction with a duty cycle of eight seconds on and eight seconds rest and a ramp up and down time of two seconds. The pulse width was set at 300 &#956;s and had a frequency of 40 Hz. <LINK REF="STD-Yozbatiran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yozbatiran 2006</LINK> used a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (TENS) machine and 2.5 cm electrodes placed on the extensor digitorum communis and extensor carpi radialis muscles at 2 HZ, pulse width 260 &#956;s symmetrical biphase square pulse, with the amplitude adjusted to elicit wrist and finger extension.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cambier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cambier 2003</LINK> used intermittent pneumatic compression with an automatic intermittent pattern over three minutes, with a 90-second inflation and 90-second deflation cycle at 40 mmHg pressure while the patient was positioned in supine with 45 degrees shoulder vertical abduction and forearm, wrist and fingers extended. The sham treatment consisted of the same positioning with a shortwave machine positioned over the hemiplegic shoulder but not turned on. <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK> used thermal stimulation via monitored hot and cold packs. After 15 and 30 seconds application, respectively, the participants were encouraged to actively withdraw from the stimulus. This was repeated 10 times per cycle with at least a 30-second pause between applications and two alternating cycles of hot and cold for each session.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Feys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Feys 1998</LINK> used sensory motor stimulation that involved pushing a rocking chair with the affected arm in an inflatable splint, designed to provide motor, proprioceptive and exteroceptive (pressure) stimulation. <LINK REF="STD-Heldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heldman 2000</LINK> used repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation produced by a figure of eight coil placed over the innervation zone for forearm and finger movement. The stimulator was able to generate instantaneous intensity of 1500 J and at a rate of 40/s-1. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK> used early intensive task training emphasizing unimanual and bimanual functional activities, while <LINK REF="STD-Poole-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Poole 1990</LINK> used an inflatable pressure splint with positioning at 90 degrees shoulder flexion, full elbow extension and as much external rotation as possible. <LINK REF="STD-Wolny-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolny 2003</LINK> examined tensive mobilizations of the peripheral nerves of the affected upper limb. <LINK REF="STD-Jongbloed-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Jongbloed 1989</LINK> compared sensory motor integrative treatment with functional treatment. The sensory motor integrative treatment focused on patient preparation, tone normalization, functional activity, giving verbal and visual cues and following a developmental sequence while the functional treatment emphasized compensation and adaptation.</P>
<P>The duration of the studies ranged from one treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Heldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heldman 2000</LINK>) to 12 weeks, though five studies used a six to eight-week intervention period (<LINK REF="STD-Byl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Byl 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Feys 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jongbloed-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Jongbloed 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posteraro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Posteraro 2001</LINK>) and the others less. Only two studies had long-term follow-up time periods, <LINK REF="STD-Feys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Feys 1998</LINK> with six and 12-month follow-ups and <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK> with a three-month follow-up. The dose frequency varied considerably with <LINK REF="STD-Heldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heldman 2000</LINK> providing a single dose. The most common dose frequency was 30 to 40 minutes five days per week (<LINK REF="STD-Cambier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cambier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Feys 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jongbloed-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Jongbloed 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poole-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Poole 1990</LINK>) while <LINK REF="STD-Yozbatiran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yozbatiran 2006</LINK> was 60 minutes and <LINK REF="STD-Byl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Byl 2003</LINK> was 90 minutes daily. <LINK REF="STD-Burridge-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 2002</LINK> was the only study to use a dose frequency of 30 minutes two times daily. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Posteraro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Posteraro 2001</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Wolny-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolny 2003</LINK> did not provide details of their dose frequency, though <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK> did state daily.</P>
<P>Sensory impairment modalities tested in the studies included: light touch, mechanical sensation, two-point discrimination, sustained pressure, kinesthesia, position sense, form perception, stereognosis, graphesthesia, pain (pressure pain, temperature pain, pain intensity) and combined sensory modality assessment. Tactile/proprioceptive extinction was also tested. The 13 studies in this review used 36 different outcome measures for sensory impairment. Two-point discrimination and the Nottingham Sensory Assessment two-point discrimination subtest were used the most frequently (<LINK REF="STD-Burridge-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cambier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cambier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolny-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wolny 2003</LINK>). Kinesthesia was measured by <LINK REF="STD-Byl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Byl 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yozbatiran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yozbatiran 2006</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Cambier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cambier 2003</LINK> used the Nottingham Sensory Assessment Kinesthesia subtest. Other standardized outcome measures for sensory impairment included the Nottingham Sensory Assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Cambier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cambier 2003</LINK>), Semmes Weinstein Monofilaments (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK>), Bickerstaff Sensory Protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Feys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Feys 1998</LINK>), Sensory Motor Integration Tests (<LINK REF="STD-Jongbloed-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Jongbloed 1989</LINK>), the QST (<LINK REF="STD-Acerra-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Acerra 2007</LINK>), Byl-Cheney Boczai Sterognosis Test (<LINK REF="STD-Byl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Byl 2003</LINK>), and components of the Brunnstrom Fugl Meyer Assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Cambier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cambier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Feys 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poole-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Poole 1990</LINK>). Two forms of extinction tests were also employed: the Quality Extinction Test used by <LINK REF="STD-Heldman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heldman 2000</LINK>, and the Tactile Extinction Test that included both tactile and proprioceptive extinction used by <LINK REF="STD-Posteraro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Posteraro 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>Eleven of the 13 studies addressed functional use of the upper limb, using 13 different outcome measures.

<P>The aim of this review was to examine the effects of interventions for sensory impairment on upper limb sensation, upper limb function, activities limitations and participation in participants who have experienced a stroke. We included 13 studies. Meta-analyses were not possible due to considerable clinical and methodological diversity and lack of data. Lack of data also limited the calculation of individual study effect size for a large number of the studies. </P>
<P>In summary there is insufficient evidence to reach conclusions on the effectiveness of any interventions for sensory impairment of the upper limb. Only preliminary evidence exists from individual studies for the effectiveness of some specific interventions for sensory impairment in the upper limb. With respect to the primary outcome of interest, upper limb sensation, there was some limited evidence for:</P>

<LI>the effects of mirror therapy for improving detection of light touch, pressure and temperature pain;</LI>
<LI>a thermal stimulation intervention for improving rate of recovery of sensation; and</LI>
<LI>intermittent pneumatic compression for improving tactile and kinesthetic sensation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is possible that other interventions reporting statistically significant results may be beneficial (repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation, early intensive task-orientated training and graded sensory rehabilitation) but data were not available to determine effect sizes. Similarly there is insufficient evidence to reach conclusions on the effectiveness of any interventions for sensory impairment to make a difference to upper limb function, activity limitations, and participation.</P>
<P>Overall there were limited studies on each of the interventions, inadequate data available in many instances to determine effect sizes, and unclear or high risk of bias for most of the studies, limiting the ability to draw significant conclusions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness and availability of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>Most studies did not provide adequate descriptions of the study design to allow for accurate assessment of risk of bias. It was difficult to obtain adequate data to complete statistical analysis of the results. It was difficult to track down several of the authors to try to obtain adequate data. Several authors did assist with providing further data when contacted though one set did state they were going to publish the study and did not want to release any of the data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>Overall the sample size for the studies was small, with no mention of power calculations for sample size in most of the studies. There were some exceptions with a larger sample size of 100 and 90 used by <LINK REF="STD-Feys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Feys 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jongbloed-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Jongbloed 1989</LINK>; otherwise, all other samples sizes were under 40 with some as low as 10 participants. The considerable clinical and methodological diversity impacted on the study conclusions. The risk of bias was unclear or high for all but two studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential biases in the review process</HEADING>
<P>When designing this review, we made the decision to include only studies that were directly aimed at improving sensory impairments. We found several studies that were focused on motor outcomes but used sensory motor stimulation and had some sensory outcome measures. These were not included. It is possible that these studies may have added to the evidence available. Tactile extinction was included in this review as it remains contentious in the literature as to how to separate sensation from the attention (<LINK REF="STD-Yekutiel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Yekutiel 1993</LINK>) and is included as a disorder of sensation in a number of medical texts.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Agreements or disagreements with other studies or reviews</HEADING>
<P>There was one other review of sensory retraining after stroke found in the literature search during completion of this review, carried out by Schabrun and Hillier (<LINK REF="REF-Schabrun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabrun 2009</LINK>) titled <I>Evidence for the retraining of sensation after stroke: a systematic review</I>.  Our review is different from Schabrun's review in several ways. <LINK REF="REF-Schabrun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabrun 2009</LINK> included both sensory retraining for the upper and lower limb in the review. They also included non-randomized studies. <LINK REF="REF-Schabrun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabrun 2009</LINK> also included some studies where the stated aim was not to improve sensory function but to improve motor function although sensory outcome measures were used. Our review focused clearly on studies that were aimed specifically at improving sensory function.  </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Schabrun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabrun 2009</LINK> (page 36) concluded that 'the results of this meta-analysis suggest that there is some evidence to support the use of passive sensory training to improve hand function and dexterity in those with stroke.'.  <LINK REF="REF-Schabrun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabrun 2009</LINK>&#8217;s term passive sensory training referred to electrical stimulation interventions. Our results for the effectiveness of studies that involved electrical stimulation are mixed. <LINK REF="STD-Yozbatiran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yozbatiran 2006</LINK> compared electrical stimulation with NDT-Bobath therapy with NDT-Bobath therapy alone and found no differences on the sensory impairment outcome measures of kinesthesia and position sense though they did find an effect in favor of the control group on the Hand Function Test. <LINK REF="STD-Burridge-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Burridge 2002</LINK> compared electrical stimulation with a placebo of passive stretching. In this study no effect was found on the sensory impairment outcome of two-point discrimination but upper limb function as measure by the Action Research Arm Test demonstrated an effect in favor of the treatment group. In <LINK REF="REF-Schabrun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabrun 2009</LINK>'s review the electrical stimulation was compared to sham or low current electrical stimulation. This may explain the differences in the results from the <LINK REF="STD-Yozbatiran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yozbatiran 2006</LINK> study in which the comparison was with a more active and dynamic treatment that espoused to incorporate active and guided movement that incorporates sensory input.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Schabrun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabrun 2009</LINK> (page 36) also reported the following finding: "A number of single studies report positive effects on function, sensation and proprioception following active sensory training. However, the lack of sufficient data to perform meta-analysis and insignificant effect sizes mean it is not yet possible to determine the effectiveness of active sensory training in stroke rehabilitation.". <LINK REF="REF-Schabrun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabrun 2009</LINK>&#8217;s definition of "active sensory retraining" included interventions that were generally a graded sensory re-education program. This review found similar findings in that there was a lack of sufficient data to perform a meta-analysis. In our review we identified three studies that used a sensory retraining program. <LINK REF="STD-Acerra-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Acerra 2007</LINK> used mirror therapy and found improvements in detection of light touch and pain. <LINK REF="STD-Byl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Byl 2003</LINK> compared a graded sensory re-education program for four weeks followed by a graded fine motor program for four weeks with the reverse order for the other treatment group and found no significant differences between the groups for graphesthesia, kinesthesia, and stereognosis. Significant gains were reported for upper limb function outcome measures (digit reaction time, Purdue pegboard, Wolf Motor function test) but there were insufficient data available to calculate effect sizes. <LINK REF="STD-Posteraro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Posteraro 2001</LINK> used a graded sensory re-education program to address tactile and proprioceptive extinction. <LINK REF="STD-Posteraro-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Posteraro 2001</LINK> found no difference in the tactile and proprioceptive extinction scores of the Motricity score for upper limb function between the control and the intervention group. The authors reported significant differences in favor of the intervention group on the functional performance outcomes of Katz ADL &amp; IADL, and Barthel Scales although inadequate data were provided for effect sizes to be calculated. These findings tend to support the findings found by Schabrun.</P>
<P>Our review also found some single studies that reported positive effects on sensory impairment, upper limb function and functional performance and participation for interventions not addressed by Schabrun&#8217;s review such as intermittent pneumatic compression, repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation, early, intensive task oriented training, and thermal stimulation.</P>
<P>Overall, our review was specifically directed at the sensory rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke versus the more general approach of the <LINK REF="REF-Schabrun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabrun 2009</LINK> review. While the results were generally consistent with the findings of the <LINK REF="REF-Schabrun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabrun 2009</LINK> review, this review found a larger number of randomized controlled trials relevant to the upper limb, that addressed a wider range of interventions and outcomes. Similar issues related to the number and quality of the studies remain and similar conclusions related to single studies that may support specific interventions were found but there were inadequate data to allow effective analysis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-03-04 15:09:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There are a large number of techniques that show promise for addressing sensory impairments in the upper limb after stroke but we do not at this stage have adequate high quality trials to be able to make recommendations that support or refute the use of specific interventions. Since few studies mentioned adverse effects, the clinician should be conscious of monitoring adverse affects when using any interventions for sensory impairment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-03-24 11:11:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This review was based on a small number of trials, generally only one, for each of the types of interventions. Most of the trials included a small number of participants and had high to unclear levels of bias. Addressing these issues should be priorities in research design in the stroke rehabilitation area. Some interventions identified in this review have potential to prove beneficial to those with sensory impairment of the upper limb after stroke but need further high quality studies to assess their effectiveness. When searching for studies for this review it was evident there are also many non-randomized studies that addressed these and other interventions that could be investigated with randomized controlled trials to ascertain the value of these treatment techniques in this field.</P>
<P>The large number of outcome measures used was another significant factor that contributed to the clinical diversity of this review. Diagnostic test accuracy reviews to look at the effectiveness of these outcome measures for measuring sensory impairments, upper limb function and functional performance and participation after stroke would also be a priority.</P>
<P>Improved reporting of trials of rehabilitation interventions would assist with the ability to determine risk of bias and contributions of these trials. Compliance with the CONSORT guidelines is recommended. Researchers should include outcome measures that address participants&#8217; functional performance and quality of life and any possible adverse reactions should be actively screened for in both experimental and control groups. Improved descriptions of the intervention would assist with reviewing the study and with replicating the study.</P>
<P>There was inadequate descriptions of the settings in which the interventions occurred and no studies addressed cost effectiveness of the different delivery options, dosages available, or the timing of the intervention after stroke. Further, no studies addressed the effectiveness of any of these interventions against usual care. These would be factors to address in further studies.</P>

<P>When completing the review we made several minor changes. We do not anticipate that these changes impacted the quality of the review or the outcomes. The changes are listed as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>At the end of the second paragraph under the heading 'Data collection and analysis' we have added the following: Where articles referred to the same primary study, they would be listed under one study in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For this review, the authors will use one data extraction form for all the linked reports of the one study.</LI>
<LI>Under the 'Data retrieval' subheading we have deleted item 5 and adjusted the numbering accordingly. This was deleted because no information was found in any study and it was felt it did not contribute to the review quality sufficiently to leave in. '(5) Theoretical perspective: extract details the identified theoretical perspective if stated'.</LI>
<LI>Under the 'Data retrieval' subheading we have deleted item 12 and adjusted the numbering accordingly. This was deleted because no information was found in the studies and it was felt it did not contribute sufficiently to the quality of the review to leave in. '(12) Clinical reasoning decision making indicators identified, for example, movement, edema, pain, sensation level, subluxation, cognitive levels, perceptual issues, contraindications, exclusions from the study, complications reported or listed, inclusion criteria for the study, including time post stroke'.</LI>
<LI>In Item 10 of the 'Data collection and analysis' section we had originally stated that '(10) Effect size: if not reported and sufficient information is provided, this will be calculated using the methodology outlined in Rosenthal (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1991</LINK>). These will be calculated as r values and then will be displayed in binomial effect size display (BESD).'. This was removed with description of calculations in RevMan 5 added in 'Data analysis'.</LI>
<LI>Under the 'Data retrieval' subheading the following item was changed from '(3) Sensory return group, as per the Heart and Stroke Association of Ontario definitions (<LINK REF="REF-HSAO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSAO 2001</LINK>):</LI>
<OL>
<LI>early stage low level return;</LI>
<LI>early stage high level return;</LI>
<LI>late stage low level return;</LI>
<LI>late stage high level return. If information was not available to make this classification with all of the studies, studies were then classified using the time period since the stroke occurred for the participants. The categories were defined by time since stroke of zero to three months, more than three months to six months, more than six months to 12 months, and more than 12 months. If groups had less than 10 participants, then groups were defined as zero to six months, and more than six months.' to 'Time since stroke'. This was changed to be consistent with the data available in the studies and does not impact the quality of the review.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Under 'Data analysis', the third comparison was altered by adding 'attentional placebo' after placebo and a definition was included in the following paragraph.</LI>

Post-treatment outcome measures were taken by one of two experienced physiotherapists with at least five years of clinical stroke experience ... Post-treatment outcome measures were performed by the same assessors who were blinded to the experimental group; outcome measures were taken after the intervention (i.e. after two weeks of treatment)"</P>
