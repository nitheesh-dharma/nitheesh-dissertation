<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-29 14:29:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon D French">
<P>Imaging is the production of a clinical image of the human body using medical techniques such as x-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance (MRI). Imaging is commonly performed for musculoskeletal conditions and is an important aspect of the management of these conditions. In some instances, imaging may not be appropriate, for example x-rays for acute low back pain, and in other instances, imaging is under utilised, for example bone mineral density testing to diagnose people at risk for osteoporosis. The identification of interventions that improve the appropriate use of imaging (either decreasing inappropriate use or increasing appropriate use) for musculoskeletal conditions would be of great value, potentially resulting in improved health outcomes for patients and reduced healthcare costs. The aim of this systematic review was to identify those interventions that improve appropriate use of imaging and to quantify their effects.</P>
<P>Twenty eight studies met our inclusion criteria. The majority of studies evaluated interventions designed to change health professional behaviour, for example, the distribution of educational materials, reminders to health professionals and patient education. For improving the use of imaging in osteoporosis, most interventions aimed at health professionals demonstrated benefit, and patient mediated, reminder, and organisational interventions appeared to have most potential for benefit. For low back pain studies, the most common intervention evaluated was distribution of educational materials and this showed varying effects. Other interventions in low back pain studies showed variable effects. For other musculoskeletal conditions, distribution of educational materials, educational meetings and audit and feedback were not shown to be effective for changing imaging ordering behaviour. Across all conditions, increasing the number of intervention components did not result in a larger effect of interventions.</P>

<P>Twenty eight studies met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies were for the management of osteoporosis or low back pain, and most evaluated interventions aimed at health professionals. To improve the use of imaging in the management of osteoporosis, the effect of any type of intervention compared to no-intervention controls was modest (absolute improvement in bone mineral density test ordering +10%, IQR 0.0 to +27.7). Patient mediated, reminder, and organisational interventions appeared to have most potential for improving imaging use in osteoporosis. For low back pain studies, the most common intervention evaluated was distribution of educational materials and this showed varying effects. Other interventions in low back pain studies also showed variable effects.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-12 12:42:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Imaging is commonly performed for musculoskeletal conditions and is an important aspect of the management of these conditions. Whether or not imaging is appropriate varies for different musculoskeletal conditions; in some conditions the evidence-based recommended practice is to undertake imaging, however for other conditions imaging may not be recommended. For example, current evidence concludes that lumbar spine plain x-rays for uncomplicated acute low back pain are not indicated and this is the recommendation of many back pain clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2004</LINK>). However, contrary to this, many studies have demonstrated an over utilisation of lumbar spine plain x-rays for this indication (<LINK REF="STD-Freeborn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freeborn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isaacs-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacs 2004</LINK>). In other instances, imaging is under utilised. For example, in people with fracture due to minimal trauma or long-term use of glucocorticoids, bone mineral density testing is indicated to diagnose osteoporosis, but there is evidence that this test is being under utilised (<LINK REF="REF-Feldstein-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldstein 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inappropriate overuse and under use of imaging in musculoskeletal disorders has a number of potential adverse outcomes. There may be poorer health outcomes due to inefficient diagnosis and subsequent inappropriate management and also a significant impact on health service resource utilisation. In addition, inappropriate use of imaging may result in unnecessary radiation exposure of patients. For example, lumbar spine radiographs result in one of the highest cumulative doses of radiation to the reproductive organs of any radiological study (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenstein-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstein 1988</LINK>). In the case of not performing imaging when it is recommended, for example, a woman may sustain a hip fracture because decreased bone density was not detected and subsequent preventive management was not instituted.</P>
<P>Many different interventions can be used to target improved imaging ordering behaviour of healthcare professionals. The Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2007</LINK>) has classified these intervention types with a taxonomy of professional, organisational, financial and regulatory interventions. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> provides details of the relevant interventions for this review from the EPOC taxonomy. Two previous systematic reviews have examined the effect of various interventions directed at health professionals to improve the use of bone mineral density test ordering in osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Elliot_x002d_Gibson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliot-Gibson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2004</LINK>). However, the authors of these reviews were unable to determine which interventions were most effective. We are unaware of any other systematic reviews that examine the use of interventions to improve the appropriate use of imaging in musculoskeletal conditions.</P>
<P>The identification of interventions that improve the appropriate use of imaging for musculoskeletal conditions would be of great value, potentially resulting in improved health outcomes for patients and reduced health care costs. The aim of this systematic review was to identify those interventions that improve appropriate use of imaging and to quantify their effects.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-10-28 11:42:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effects of interventions that aim to improve the appropriate use of imaging for musculoskeletal conditions. The following questions were addressed.</P>
<OL>
<LI>What are the effects of interventions that aim to improve the appropriate use of imaging for people with musculoskeletal conditions (on all outcomes including use of imaging, cost, and clinical outcomes)?</LI>
<LI>Do modifications in the characteristics of the interventions (for example, timing, content, etc) modify the effects?</LI>
<LI>Do the effects of interventions vary depending on the setting, type of professionals targeted, type of behaviour (decreasing use, increasing use or modifying use) or whether or not the intervention is based on theory?</LI>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2009-01-14 14:58:16 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon D French">
<P>We included studies of interventions to improve the use of imaging for musculoskeletal symptoms, such as neck pain, back pain and other regional pain, possible or known arthritis (including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and spondylo-arthropathies) or osteoporosis. We excluded studies where the people included had musculoskeletal injuries and trauma.</P>
<P>Interventions to improve the appropriate use of imaging may have been directed toward health professionals, policy-makers and the general public, or a combination of these groups of people.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-13 14:19:53 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon D French">
<P>We included studies that evaluated any intervention designed to improve the appropriate use of imaging for diagnostic, screening or monitoring purposes, including assessing the response to treatment. We considered any type of educational, organisational, financial or regulatory intervention. Studies were only included where the primary objective, or one of the primary objectives, was to determine the efficacy of an intervention to improve the appropriate use of imaging. Specifically, we excluded studies that were designed to examine the accuracy of imaging as a diagnostic test.</P>
<P>We classified interventions implemented in the included studies according to the taxonomy of professional, organisational, financial and regulatory interventions developed by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> provides details of the relevant interventions for this review from the EPOC taxonomy. Under the EPOC category of "Professional Interventions", we added an intervention type of "Patient Mediated". A patient mediated intervention is one where the intervention is directed at the patient with the aim of changing the behaviour of the patient's healthcare provider, for example patient education (materials or verbal).</P>

<P>See: Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group methods used in reviews.</P>
<P>The following electronic databases were searched:<BR/>(a) The EPOC Specialised Register (and the database of studies awaiting assessment) was reviewed in June 2007 (see SPECIALISED REGISTER under GROUP DETAILS)<BR/>(b) The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2007,<I> </I>Issue 2)<BR/>(c) MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2007), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2007) and CINAHL (January 1982 to June 2007).</P>
<P>The search strategy for the MEDLINE database is shown in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. The search strategy shown in the Appendix was added to the standard EPOC search terms (see: Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group methods used in reviews) in order to capture relevant studies. This search strategy was adapted for the other electronic databases searched (CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL and the EPOC Specialised Register) using the appropriate controlled vocabulary where applicable.</P>
<P>In addition to the electronic searches, we searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews identified, we undertook citation searches of all included studies, we contacted authors of included studies regarding any further published or unpublished work, and we contacted other experts in the field of effective professional practice for any relevant studies that they may be aware of.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-11-12 12:42:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2009-11-12 12:42:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (SF and HB) independently screened all titles and abstracts of retrieved studies. We ordered the full text of studies that met the initial selection criteria or those for which we could not determine eligibility from the title and abstract. SF and HB then independently assessed the full text for inclusion status. Any disagreements on inclusion status were resolved with discussion with the other two review authors (SG and RB). If any studies were located in the search strategy that were carried out by one of the authors of this review, the paper was sent to an independent review author to assess whether it met the inclusion criteria for this review.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2009-03-10 12:14:12 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon D French">
<P>SF undertook data abstraction of each of the included studies using a modified EPOC Data Collection Checklist. The data extraction form was pilot tested on two included studies to minimise misinterpretation. A second review author (HB) independently assessed the methodological quality and extracted results of included studies as recommended by the EPOC group (<LINK REF="REF-Bero-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bero 2008</LINK>). When necessary, we approximated results from graphical representations in the reports of the included studies. If SF and HB disagreed in their assessment of methodological quality or data extraction, this was resolved by discussion and consensus, followed by discussion with a third review author if necessary.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-03-10 12:14:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon D French">
<P>We used two methods to undertake risk of bias assessment of the included studies; the EPOC recommended method (<LINK REF="REF-Bero-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bero 2008</LINK>) and the method outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (version 5.0.0). In order to be consistent, for included parallel group trials (cluster RCTs, individual RCTs and non-randomised CCTs) we renamed the EPOC classification for the overall quality rating from &#8216;protection against bias&#8217; to &#8216;risk of bias&#8217;, and assigned an overall quality rating of &#8216;high&#8217;, &#8216;moderate&#8217; or &#8216;low&#8217; risk of bias (criteria as outlined in the protocol). As planned, we undertook a separate assessment of interrupted time series (ITS) studies according to the EPOC criteria, but did not assign an overall rating for these.</P>
<P>The Cochrane Handbook risk of bias assessment was not proposed in the published review protocol because this methodology was not developed at that time. We carried out this assessment for parallel group trials using the criteria: (1) sequence generation; (2) allocation concealment; (3) blinding; (4) incomplete outcome data; (5) selective outcome reporting; and, (6) other potential sources of bias, for example, protection against contamination of the intervention or significant baseline differences between groups. Each of the risk of bias criteria were judged as &#8216;Yes&#8217; (indicating low risk of bias), &#8216;No&#8217; (indicating high risk of bias), or &#8216;Unclear&#8217; (indicating either lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias).</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-11-12 12:42:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although we planned to pool the results of studies if possible, we were unable to undertake any formal meta-analysis because no two studies were sufficiently similar in terms of condition studied, interventions evaluated and outcomes measured. Hence, we used statistical methods proposed by Grimshaw and colleagues to guide our data analysis and presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>We reported the primary results for each study in natural units extracted from the reports of included studies. We attempted to present a consistent method of reporting results of included studies by calculating standardised effect sizes. In cases where there were insufficient data to calculate effect sizes, we presented results of studies in the form reported by the original study authors. The desired direction of effect differed between studies. Some aimed for an increase in a behavioural outcome (for example, increase in bone mineral density (BMD) test ordering for suspected osteoporosis), while others aimed for a decrease in a behavioural outcome (for example, decreased ordering of lumbar x-rays for low back pain). To avoid confusion, we have standardised the effect size so that a positive difference between post-intervention percentages represents an increase in compliance with appropriate use of imaging, regardless of the desired direction of effect.</P>
<P>For studies reporting dichotomous outcomes we calculated a standardised effect size, which is the difference between the intervention group and the control group post-intervention percentage compliance with evidence-based recommended imaging. If baseline levels were available, we calculated an absolute adjusted risk difference (ARD) which adjusts for important differences in baseline measures between groups. We defined an important difference in baseline levels where the absolute difference between the groups before the intervention was more than 10%, or where the baseline difference was similar to that found post-intervention.</P>
<P>We calculated the ARD as follows:</P>
<P>Adjusted risk difference (ARD) = [risk of non-compliance (intervention control) pre-intervention] minus [risk of noncompliance (intervention control) post-intervention]</P>
<P>A positive ARD means that compliance improved more in the intervention group than in the control group, for example an ARD of 0.10 indicates an absolute improvement in appropriate imaging of 10%. This method of calculating the ARD has been used previously in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Doumit-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doumit 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jamtvedt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamtvedt 2006</LINK>), and is adopted by the Cochrane EPOC group as recommended methodological practice. For studies that reported more than one outcome measure related to musculoskeletal imaging, we calculated the ARD for all musculoskeletal imaging outcomes and then identified the value that represented the median ARD between measures (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>For studies reporting continuous outcomes we calculated the relative percentage change, that is, the percent improvement relative to the post intervention average in the control group. We also calculated standardised mean differences (SMD), as defined by EPOC, for continuous outcomes where possible. We calculated the SMD as follows:</P>
<P>SMD = [mean of intervention group post-intervention minus mean of control group post-intervention] divided by control standard deviation pre-intervention</P>
<P>In many previously published cluster RCTs, practitioners or practices were randomised but the statistical analyses were of individual patient data. Analysis of a cluster RCT that does not account for the clustering effect of patients attending the same practitioner or practice has what is termed a &#8216;unit of analysis error&#8217; (UAE) (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999a</LINK>). In these studies, the point estimate of effect is unlikely to be biased, but confidence intervals are likely to be overly narrow and P values are likely to be artificially low, increasing the chance of misleading conclusions due to spurious statistically significant findings (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). If we judged a cluster RCT included in this review as having a UAE, we reported the relevant point estimate of the study but not the statistical significance, and indicated in the data tables that a UAE was possible.</P>
<P>In many previously published interrupted time series (ITS) studies, inappropriate statistical analyses were performed leading to spurious statistical significance (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2003</LINK>). When we judged that incorrect analysis of an included ITS study had been performed, we reanalysed ITS comparisons using time-series regression methods as recommended by Ramsay and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2003</LINK>) and calculated, where possible, the difference in slopes (pre- and post-intervention) or a level effect, or both. Data were derived from tables of results or from graphics presented in the original studies. Where information on individual values was reported graphically, we derived the data by importing a digital image of the graph into a graphics software package and measuring each data point manually by applying grid lines and reading off the corresponding values. </P>
<P>We reported the synthesis of results of the included studies classified by condition (osteoporosis, low back pain, knee pain, other musculoskeletal conditions) in the following structured format:</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies for inclusion</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> describes the process from searching to study inclusion. We identified a total of 4072 non-duplicate potentially relevant citations from electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL and the EPOC Register). Reference lists and contact with experts yielded an additional 22 potentially relevant citations and citation searches of included studies an additional 25 potentially relevant citations, for a total of 4119 records. After two researchers (SF and HB) independently screened the title and abstract of these studies, we excluded 3923 records and obtained 196 studies for full text review. Twenty eight of these studies met our inclusion criteria and their details are described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Twelve (43%) of the studies included in this review were not identified by our search of electronic databases, highlighting the need to use multiple searching methods when undertaking a review in this area. Studies initially appearing to meet the eligibility criteria but which we subsequently excluded are reported in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table along with our first reason for exclusion. Three ongoing studies were identified; one from a published trial protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Bessette-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bessette 2008</LINK>) and two are being undertaken by some of the review authors (<LINK REF="STD-McKenzie-2008" TYPE="STUDY">McKenzie 2008</LINK>). These studies are described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> table.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of study design and setting</HEADING>
<P>Sixteen included studies were cluster RCTs, six were individual RCTs, one was a non-randomised CCT and five were ITS studies. Sixteen of the 22 RCTs were two arm trials and six had more than two arms: two compared three arms and four compared four arms.</P>
<P>All of the included studies were based in developed countries, with 15 based in the USA, seven in the UK, four in Canada and two in The Netherlands. All of the studies evaluating interventions directed at healthcare providers were targeted at medical practitioners, with no other healthcare providers represented, for example allied healthcare providers. Twenty four (86%) of the included studies evaluated interventions delivered in primary care settings alone, one study described an intervention delivered in both primary care and a specialist rheumatology setting, two studies delivered interventions in a hospital setting (one in-patient care, one out-patient care), and one study delivered an intervention in a specialist rheumatology setting alone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Conditions managed and targeted imaging behaviours</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen included studies involved the management of osteoporosis, or patients at risk of osteoporosis, and the targeted imaging behaviour was to increase BMD test ordering. Six studies involved the management of low back pain; in four of these studies the targeted behaviour was the reduction of ordering of lumbar x-rays and in two the targeted behaviour was the reduction of ordering of all types of imaging of the lumbar spine (that is, CT scan, MRI, as well as plain x-rays). Two studies involved the management of low back pain and knee pain; the intervention in one of these studies targeted the behaviour of a reduction of ordering lumbar and knee x-rays and the other study targeted the reduction of lumbar and knee MRI. The remaining five included studies involved the management of multiple conditions and the targeted behaviour in all of these was reduced ordering of different types of imaging (for example, plain x-rays of the chest, spine, limbs and joints; abdominal, renal, pelvic and testicular ultrasound examinations).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of interventions delivered</HEADING>
<P>The 28 studies evaluated 36 separate comparisons covering a wide range of intervention types, including professional, organisational and patient mediated interventions. <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> summarises the different types of interventions evaluated in each study. Twenty three studies evaluated professional interventions alone, two studies evaluated organisational interventions alone, one study evaluated a professional intervention in combination with an organisational and a financial intervention, and two studies evaluated a combination of professional and organisational interventions. More detail of the interventions delivered in each study is provided in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies comparing an intervention to 'no-intervention' control</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-two of the included studies (representing 26 comparisons) evaluated an intervention versus a 'no-intervention' or 'usual care' control, and <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> describes the different components of these interventions. Distribution of educational materials was the most frequent single intervention evaluated against a no-intervention control, included in four comparisons, followed by patient-mediated interventions included in three comparisons, and reminders used in two comparisons. Distribution of educational materials was also the intervention strategy used most frequently as part of multifaceted interventions compared to a no-intervention control, followed by patient mediated interventions and audit and feedback.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies that compared an intervention to a different intervention control</HEADING>
<P>Five included studies (representing ten comparisons) evaluated interventions versus a control comprising a different intervention type and <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> describes these interventions. Two of these interventions were single component interventions and there were seven different combinations of multifaceted interventions. All of the comparison interventions were single component interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention rationale and fidelity</HEADING>
<P>Only a few of the included studies reported a rationale for the choice of intervention evaluated. Nineteen (68%) provided no rationale. Four studies included reference to previous studies of effectiveness of interventions as the only rationale for the intervention chosen (<LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lafata-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lafata 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verstappen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Verstappen 2003</LINK>). Three studies reported that the intervention was designed to address barriers to change (<LINK REF="STD-Lafata-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lafata 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2007</LINK>), but only limited information was provided of the methods used to measure these barriers, what the barriers were, and how the interventions were matched to these barriers. In one study, reference was made to interviews conducted with healthcare professionals to direct the choice of the intervention evaluated (<LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2007</LINK>), however details of the results of these interviews were not reported and no related publication could be identified. Four studies indicated that the intervention, or a component of the intervention, was based on theory (<LINK REF="STD-Curtis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Curtis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2007a</LINK>) (details of the reported theories are provided in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table).</P>
<P>Twenty three (82%) of the included studies provided no details on whether or not intervention fidelity was evaluated, that is, whether or not the intervention was implemented as planned. Five studies provided limited information on intervention fidelity (<LINK REF="STD-Curtis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Curtis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eccles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2007a</LINK>).

<P>Our assessment of risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for each of the parallel group trials can be found in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> demonstrates a graphical representation of the judgements about each of the risk of bias items, presented as percentages across all included studies. ITS studies are represented by the blank spaces on the graph because these studies were not judged according to these criteria. Just under half of the included trials addressed incomplete outcome data and reported adequate sequence generation. Blinded outcome assessment was undertaken in approximately one quarter of the trials, approximately one fifth reported adequate allocation concealment and one quarter were judged to be free of other bias. Only approximately 10% of the trials were judged to be free of selective reporting.</P>
<P>Our assessment of methodological quality according to the EPOC method of each of the RCTs and the CCT is outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>, with studies ordered by the degree of risk of bias. We judged four studies to be 'low' risk of bias, 16 'moderate' risk of bias and three 'high' risk of bias.</P>
<P>The assessment of methodological quality for the included ITS studies is outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>. In none of the ITS studies was the intervention clearly independent of other changes, that is, it was not clear whether other events during the study period could have affected the results. In two out of the five included ITS studies was an appropriate statistical analysis undertaken. None of the reports of these studies described the reason for the number of pre- and post-intervention data points measured. Only two studies reported that blinded assessment of outcomes was undertaken. No overall score is calculated for ITS studies, however considering that the majority of the quality items were judged as 'not clear' or 'not done', we judged the overall quality of the included ITS studies as poor.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-11-12 12:42:06 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We were unable to undertake any formal meta-analysis because no two studies were sufficiently similar in terms of condition studied, interventions evaluated and outcomes measured. We have presented some of the results as forest plots to allow visual interpretation of the size of effect for the comparisons, but no pooling of results was undertaken for these. In many studies there was no reporting of baseline imaging performance, and hence for these studies we were unable to calculate ARD for dichotomous measures and SMD for continuous measures (as defined by EPOC; see <LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK> for formulae).</P>
<P>Although originally planned, we did not undertake a meta-regression analysis to estimate the effects of different interventions. Consistent with the findings of a previous systematic review of guideline implementation strategies, we found the number of different combinations of multifaceted interventions evaluated precluded this type of analysis <LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2004</LINK>. In addition, this analysis was not possible due to the number of studies with unit of analysis errors. After further advice from the EPOC group we concluded that this analysis would not be informative above and beyond the methods we were already using. However, we did perform an analysis of the &#8216;dose-response&#8217; effect of an increasing number of components in multifaceted interventions. For this analysis we could only utilise dichotomous outcomes because data were commonly missing for continuous measures.</P>
<P>We originally planned an examination of whether the effects of interventions varied depending on different study factors. For the factors of type of healthcare professional targeted and the setting of the study these analyses were not possible because only medical practitioners were targeted in all of the included studies, and 25 of the 28 included studies were in a primary care setting, with insufficient studies in the non-primary care setting to compare these results against. We were able to perform some exploratory analyses of varying effects if the intervention was based on theory, the type of behaviour targeted (decreased or increased use of imaging) and by degree of risk of bias in the study.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Osteoporosis studies</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen studies (involving 19 comparisons) included patients with osteoporosis or people at risk of developing osteoporosis. Seven of these studies were for secondary prevention of osteoporosis, that is, included patients had a pre-existing fracture, and eight studies were for primary prevention of osteoporosis. Twelve of these studies were conducted in the USA and three in Canada. Eight of these studies were cluster RCTs, five were individual RCTs, one was a non-randomised CCT and one was an ITS study. Twelve studies were conducted in primary care alone, one was conducted in both primary care and rheumatology practice, one in rheumatology practice alone and one in an inpatient care setting. The desired imaging outcome in all of these studies was an increase in BMD test ordering.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Osteoporosis: evaluations of interventions compared to no-intervention control groups</HEADING>
<P>Of the studies that included patients with osteoporosis, or people at risk of developing osteoporosis, 12 studies (involving 16 comparisons) evaluated single or multifaceted interventions compared to a no-intervention control. The majority of these studies evaluated professional interventions and most reported significant improvements in BMD test ordering.</P>

<I>Dichotomous imaging outcomes:</I> Fourteen comparisons reported dichotomous imaging outcomes, including six cluster RCT comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Curtis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Curtis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lafata-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lafata 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prihar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Prihar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2007a</LINK>), three individual RCT comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gardner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2007</LINK>) and one CCT comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> shows the range of interventions that were evaluated and the imaging outcome data reported in each of these studies. All but one of these comparisons were of professional interventions versus control, with an organisational intervention evaluated in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effect of any type of intervention versus a no-intervention control in osteoporosis studies ranged from &#8211;1.9% to 51.0%, with a median absolute improvement in BMD test ordering, of any type of intervention to change practice, of +10% (interquartile range (IQR) 0.0 to +27.7). Five of the comparisons (three from one study) reported a non-significant deterioration in BMD test ordering (<LINK REF="STD-Curtis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Curtis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2007</LINK>), the significance of one comparison was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Gardner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 2005</LINK>) and seven comparisons reported a significant improvement in BMD test ordering (<LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lafata-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lafata 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2007a</LINK>). The remaining comparison had a potential unit of analysis error (<LINK REF="STD-Prihar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Prihar 2008</LINK>). Two comparisons reported baseline BMD test ordering levels (<LINK REF="STD-Prihar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Prihar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2004</LINK>). Both were cluster RCT comparisons and the difference in absolute change from baseline was 7.7% improvement in BMD test ordering in one comparison (distribution of educational materials plus patient mediated intervention versus control) and 3.8% deterioration in BMD test ordering in the other comparison (audit and feedback, distribution of educational materials, plus educational meeting versus control).</P>
<P>
<I>Continuous imaging outcomes: </I>One comparison of reminders versus a no-intervention control reported a continuous imaging outcome, the number of BMD tests ordered per month (<LINK REF="STD-Stock-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stock 1998</LINK>). Baseline levels were not reported so SMD could not be calculated. The comparison reported a significant improvement in BMD test ordering of +81% (P value = 0.002) with use of a reminder. <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> shows the data from this study.</P>
<P>
<I>Exploratory analysis of different intervention components: </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK> presents an exploratory analysis of the comparisons of the three most common components included in interventions to improve the use of BMD test ordering in the osteoporosis studies, compared to no-intervention control groups that reported dichotomous imaging data. These results should be interpreted with caution considering the small number of comparisons available and the indirect nature of the comparisons. The median effect for interventions that included a patient mediated component was a moderate absolute improvement in BMD test ordering, whereas the median effect of those that did not include a patient mediated component was small. Also, six of the seven comparisons that reported a significant improvement in BMD test ordering included a patient mediated component in their intervention whereas only one of the five comparisons that showed a non-significant effect included a patient mediated component. For reminder interventions, the median effect was a large improvement in BMD test ordering if included, but small if not included. This suggests that the effect was more likely to be positive and larger if patient mediated or reminder interventions were a component of the intervention. When interventions included a component with distribution of educational materials the effect was small and the IQR range extended to both a negative and positive effect. It is not clear if the effect varies whether distribution of educational materials are a component of the intervention or not.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Osteoporosis: results from ITS comparison</HEADING>
<P>One ITS comparison evaluated a multifaceted intervention consisting of an organisational and reminder intervention, then an additional financial intervention in Phase 2 of the intervention period (<LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 2007</LINK>). The study report provided time-series regression of the change in slope of improvement of osteoporosis management (composite outcome including BMD testing and osteoporosis medication prescription). The comparison reported a significant improvement, with the probability of appropriate osteoporosis management increasing on average 3.1% (P value &lt;0.001) every 2 months during the post-intervention period, but reported that the additional financial intervention did not produce added benefit. Reanalysis of the imaging data only showed a significant improvement in the slope for BMD test ordering, but not for change in level, suggesting the intervention had no immediate effect but there was an effect over time.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Osteoporosis: evaluations of interventions compared to another intervention</HEADING>
<P>Three comparisons evaluated interventions compared to another intervention and all outcomes for these were dichotomous. The range of interventions that were evaluated and the data from these studies are provided in <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>. One of the comparisons was a cluster RCT and the other two comparisons were individual RCTs. All three comparisons observed improvements in BMD test ordering compared to the control intervention. The cluster RCT comparison of two types of reminders found an absolute improvement in BMD test ordering of +7.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) &#8211;8.0 to 22.0) but had a potential unit of analysis error (<LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2002</LINK>). The other two comparisons were reported as statistically significant. One compared a multifaceted intervention consisting of professional interventions (including a patient mediated intervention) to a patient mediated intervention alone, and found an absolute improvement in BMD test ordering of +34.0% (95% CI 23.0 to 45.0) (<LINK REF="STD-Majumdar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Majumdar 2008</LINK>). The remaining study compared an organisational intervention to distribution of educational materials and found an absolute improvement in BMD test ordering of +62.0% (95% CI 41.0 to 83.0) (<LINK REF="STD-Rozental-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rozental 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Osteoporosis studies: summary</HEADING>
<P>The majority of the 12 studies that evaluated interventions versus no-intervention controls to improve the management of people with osteoporosis, or people at risk of osteoporosis, observed significant improvements in BMD test ordering. However, it is not clear which intervention, or intervention combination, is likely to have the largest effect. The effect of any type of intervention (consisting primarily of professional interventions) compared to no-intervention controls was modest (absolute improvement in BMD test ordering +10%, IQR 0.0 to +27.7).</P>
<P>For comparisons of interventions compared to another type of intervention for osteoporosis management, one RCT comparison of a multifaceted intervention consisting of professional interventions (including a patient mediated intervention) versus a patient mediated intervention alone demonstrated a large effect (+34.0%, 95% CI 23.0 to 45.0, absolute improvement in BMD test ordering). Another RCT comparison of an organisational intervention versus distribution of educational materials also demonstrated a large effect (+62.0%, 95% CI 41.0 to 83.0, absolute improvement in BMD test ordering).</P>
<P>Evaluation of individual intervention components revealed some suggestions for future research. It appears that interventions for the management of osteoporosis that included a patient mediated or reminder component tended to show larger effects than interventions that did not include these components. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to their indirect nature. The effect of the intervention distribution of educational materials is unclear.</P>
<P>Two RCTs that evaluated an organisational intervention for improved BMD testing in osteoporosis observed large effects. One was a RCT of an organisational plus a patient mediated intervention compared to no-intervention control, and one was a RCT of an organisational intervention compared to distribution of educational materials. These findings were supported by an ITS study of an organisational, reminder and financial intervention which also demonstrated an improvement in BMD test ordering.</P>

<P>Twelve studies (involving 16 comparisons) included people with low back pain. Six of these studies included only people with low back pain, two studies included people with low back pain or knee pain and four studies included people with low back pain or other numerous conditions, for example, neck pain, or patients referred for an x-ray of the chest or limbs and joints. Seven of these studies were conducted in the UK, three in the USA, one in Canada and one in The Netherlands. Seven of these studies were cluster RCTs, one was an individual RCT and four were ITS studies. Eleven out of the 12 studies were conducted in primary care and the other in outpatient care. In 11 of these studies, lumbar radiography was one of the imaging outcomes, and in one study the imaging outcome was lumbar MRI. The desired imaging outcome in all of these studies was a decrease in imaging.</P>

<P>
<I>Dichotomous imaging outcomes: </I>Three comparisons reported dichotomous imaging outcomes, including the proportion of low back pain participants to receive a lumbar x-ray or the proportion of lumbar x-rays that were concordant with evidence-based guidelines. The range of interventions that were evaluated and the available data for these comparisons are reported in <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>. Two of these comparisons were cluster RCT comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Dey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oakeshott-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Oakeshott 1994</LINK>) and one was an individual RCT comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 2000</LINK>). The effect of any type of intervention aiming to change professional practice compared to a no-intervention control for low back pain imaging behaviour ranged from &#8211;1.4% to +11.3% and the median effect was +9.3% absolute improvement in the appropriate ordering of lumbar imaging. Two of the three comparisons reported a non-significant effect, and for the comparison with four imaging outcomes, three of these outcomes reported a non-significant effect and one a significant improvement in lumbar imaging, but the sample sizes were small.</P>
<P>
<I>Continuous imaging outcomes: </I>Three low back pain comparisons of an intervention versus a no-intervention control reported continuous imaging outcomes, the number of spinal x-rays ordered. <LINK REF="APP-09" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 9</LINK> shows the range of interventions that were evaluated and the available imaging outcome data reported in each of these studies. Two of the comparisons were cluster RCTs from the same research group (<LINK REF="STD-Kerry-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kerry 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oakeshott-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Oakeshott 1994</LINK>).

It was not possible to abstract comparable data for the two other cluster RCTs. One was a comparison of audit and feedback plus distribution of educational materials versus no-intervention control and only total numbers of x-rays were reported rather than mean and standard deviation data. This study reported a significant 20% absolute improvement in the use of appropriate imaging of the lumbar spine (95% CI 3 to 37) (<LINK REF="STD-Kerry-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kerry 2000</LINK>). The remaining cluster RCT comparison of audit and feedback versus no-intervention control did not report musculoskeletal imaging outcome data separate to non-musculoskeletal outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Winkens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Winkens 1995</LINK>).

The range of interventions that were evaluated and the data from these comparisons are presented in <LINK REF="APP-10" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 10</LINK>. One ITS study was correctly analysed with time-series regression and found no significant difference in lumbar spine radiography referrals, neither in absolute change in referral or in change in referral trend after distribution of a guideline (<LINK REF="STD-Matowe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Matowe 2002</LINK>). An additional comparison reported that there was no evidence that referrals for radiography of the lumbar spine had decreased with distribution of clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="STD-Hollingworth-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hollingworth 2002</LINK>) and reanalysis of this comparison using time-series regression observed no significant change in both the level and slope. Another comparison reported no evidence of a trend in increasing compliance after distribution of a guideline (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2005</LINK>). Reanalysis observed no significant change in level, and a significant deterioration in lumbar imaging, indicated by an increase in slope (P value = 0.1). The remaining comparison reported a 47% decrease in the number of lumbar radiographic examinations after a reminder intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1987</LINK>). Reanalysis of this comparison using time-series regression observed a significant change in level (P value = 0.001) but not in slope (P value =0.251), indicating a sustained effect of the reminder intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low back pain: summary</HEADING>
<P>The majority of the 12 studies concerning low back pain included distribution of educational materials as an intervention component and the majority observed no significant improvement in appropriate imaging. Only one of the included low back pain studies reported healthcare outcomes and this observed a non-significant change in pain at three and six months follow-up for an organisational intervention.</P>
<P>Three studies (representing three comparisons) evaluated various interventions versus no-intervention controls and reported dichotomous outcomes. The median effect of any intervention versus a no-intervention control was +9.3% (range &#8211;1.4% to +11.3%) absolute improvement in the appropriate ordering of lumbar imaging, with the majority of the outcomes observing a non-significant effect. For studies reporting continuous outcomes, one cluster RCT comparison of distribution of educational materials versus a no-intervention control observed a significant improvement in use of appropriate imaging with a +45.2% relative improvement and a SMD of +0.40, but the authors of this study recommended caution in the interpretation of these data due to baseline imbalance between the study groups. One cluster RCT compared audit and feedback plus distribution of educational materials to no-intervention control and reported a 20% absolute improvement in the use of appropriate imaging of the lumbar spine (95% CI 3 to 37). One cluster RCT comparison observed a significant improvement in appropriate lumbar imaging (P value = 0.004), but the size of this effect was not reported and appropriate data could not be extracted.</P>
<P>One out of four ITS studies observed a significant improvement in imaging outcomes, but the other three observed no effect. The study that showed a significant effect evaluated reminders and was undertaken in the 1980s, whereas the non-significant ITS comparisons evaluated distribution of educational materials and were undertaken in the 2000s.</P>
<P>Seven cluster RCT comparisons reporting dichotomous outcomes evaluated interventions versus a different intervention control. Five of the seven comparisons reported a non-significant deterioration in low back pain imaging outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Eccles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robling 2002</LINK>), and one comparison had a potential unit of analysis error. For all comparisons of an intervention versus a different intervention reporting dichotomous outcomes, the<I> </I>absolute deterioration in lumbar imaging behaviour ranged from &#8211;8.3% to +1.0% (IQR &#8211;8.0% to &#8211;0.7%). Three cluster RCT comparisons of interventions versus a different intervention from the same study reported continuous outcomes. All comparisons observed significant improvements in lumbar imaging outcomes, but baseline imbalance precludes confident conclusions from this data.</P>
<P>Overall, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the most effective interventions to improve imaging behaviour for the management of low back pain. The most common intervention evaluated, distribution of educational materials, showed varying effects when compared to no-intervention controls, and it is currently unclear whether this intervention is effective or not for changing low back pain imaging behaviour. For other interventions, no conclusions can be drawn due to only a few studies available showing variable effects.</P>

Both of these studies were conducted in primary care settings in the UK. Three of these comparisons of different combinations of professional interventions (including audit and feedback, educational meetings and distribution of educational materials) versus distribution of educational materials were from one study that reported low back pain and knee pain outcomes combined, and these have already been discussed in the low back pain section of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Robling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robling 2002</LINK>). Data from this study are presented in <LINK REF="APP-12" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 12</LINK>.

<P>The three other cluster RCT comparisons were from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Eccles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 2001</LINK>). Some data from this study has already been discussed in the low back pain section of this review, but because data were reported separately for low back pain and knee pain, the knee pain data are discussed in this section. These comparisons were of  multifaceted interventions (including audit and feedback, reminders and distribution of educational materials) versus distribution of educational materials and the interventions evaluated and data from these comparisons are reported in <LINK REF="APP-14" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 14</LINK> (dichotomous outcomes) and <LINK REF="APP-15" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 15</LINK> (continuous outcomes). None of the dichotomous outcomes of the proportion of knee x-rays concordant with guidelines were significant.</P>
<P>The same cluster RCT also reported continuous outcomes of the number of knee radiographs requested per 1000 patients. All comparisons observed a statistically significant improvement in imaging behaviour. The range of relative percentage improvement was +10.0% to 25.8%, and the range of SMD was +0.18 to 0.46.

<P>One cluster RCT was an incomplete block design and compared a multifaceted intervention (including distribution of educational materials, educational meetings and audit and feedback) for a group of conditions (including degenerative joint diseases as the only musculoskeletal condition) to a no-intervention control (<LINK REF="STD-Verstappen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Verstappen 2003</LINK>). Improved ordering of imaging for degenerative joint diseases was reported via two continuous outcomes, the number of x-rays ordered and the number of inappropriate x-rays ordered. Change in both outcomes was not significant, with an average relative percentage improvement of 25.4% and an average SMD of +0.31.</P>
<P>One cluster RCT was a comparison of distribution of educational materials versus a no-intervention control (<LINK REF="STD-Oakeshott-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Oakeshott 1994</LINK>). The dichotomous outcome of the percentage of limb and joint x-ray requests conforming to a guideline was an absolute change from baseline of 6.7%, and the absolute improvement was 5.2% (not significant).

<P>One cluster RCT comparison of audit and feedback plus distribution of educational materials versus no-intervention control reported a non-significant +10% (95%CI &#8211;5.0 to +25.0) improvement in ordering of the number of limb and joint x-rays requested (mean and standard deviation not reported) (see <LINK REF="APP-15" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 15</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Kerry-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kerry 2000</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Do the effects of interventions vary with different aspects of study characteristics?</HEADING>
<P>We performed exploratory analyses to determine whether different study characteristics varied the effects of the interventions. The results of these analyses are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>.</P>
<P>Some studies targeted a decreased use of imaging (for example, decreased number of lumbar x-rays ordered) and other studies targeted an increased use of imaging (for example, increased use of BMD test ordering). We examined whether this different type of targeted behaviour modified, on average, the effect of the interventions. The median effect size for comparisons that targeted a decreased use of imaging was &#8211;2.4 (IQR &#8211;8.0 to 0.0), compared to +10.6 (IQR +0.7 to 34.0) for comparisons that targeted an increased use of imaging. It appears that, on average, if the intervention targeted an increase in the use of imaging, then effects tended to be larger than if the intervention targeted a decrease in the use of imaging but this result should be interpreted with caution due to the analysis being dominated by the osteoporosis and low back pain studies.</P>
<P>We also attempted to determine if the effects of interventions varied depending on whether or not the intervention was based on theory and also compared studies that had a high risk of bias to those that did not. For these two exploratory analyses, due to the imbalance between the proportion of studies that did and did not have the characteristics of interest, these analyses should be interpreted with caution and no firm conclusion can be drawn. It cannot be determined if the effect varies with the use of theory to develop interventions, or between studies with a high or low risk of bias.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-12 12:42:06 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 28 studies assessing a range of interventions. Twenty three studies evaluated professional interventions alone, two studies evaluated organisational interventions alone, two studies evaluated a combination of professional and organisational interventions and one study evaluated a professional intervention in combination with an organisational and a financial intervention. Fifteen studies involved the management of osteoporosis, six studies the management of low back pain, two studies the management of low back pain and knee pain, and five studies involved the management of multiple conditions, including various musculoskeletal conditions.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-10-13 11:08:52 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon D French">
<P>In order to improve appropriate imaging for osteoporosis, it is not clear which intervention, or intervention combination, was most effective. Our exploratory analyses observed that patient mediated, reminder, and organisational interventions have most potential, however these interventions require more testing in high quality studies. For low back pain studies, no intervention evaluated to date produced convincing effects for improving the use of lumbar imaging. There were insufficient studies of high quality for improving imaging behaviour in the management of low back pain that evaluated patient mediated or reminder components. Interventions rigorously tested to improve the use of imaging for low back pain have been predominantly distribution of educational materials and few observed significant benefit. No conclusions can be made about other interventions for improving the use of imaging in low back pain. For other musculoskeletal conditions no firm conclusions can be drawn.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-11-12 12:42:06 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We were unable to determine, under what circumstances and contexts, which interventions to improve the use of imaging in musculoskeletal conditions are most effective. Multiple problems precluded this analysis including poor reporting, inadequate intervention detail, heterogeneity among interventions and inappropriate primary analyses. We were therefore unable to conduct robust subgroup analyses of the potential effect modifiers of different interventions for different musculoskeletal conditions. The diversity of interventions, outcomes and conditions make overall conclusions about the effects of interventions evaluated difficult to draw. When grouped by condition, pooling by intervention type was not possible because very few studies evaluated the same intervention combination. Only conclusions about intervening in general can be made. Further, most of the included studies were conducted in well resourced developed countries, and in primary care settings, so conclusions drawn may only apply to similar settings.</P>
<P>Contemporary implementation research is increasingly recognising the need for interventions to be designed with consideration of theory and barriers to change (<LINK REF="REF-Eccles-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccles 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ICEBeRG-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICEBeRG 2006</LINK>). Very few studies in this review evaluated theory-based interventions or interventions directed at specific barriers to change. Also, fidelity evaluation of interventions in the included studies was rare but is essential to ensure that intervention effects can be fully understood (<LINK REF="REF-Bellg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellg 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only three included studies reported clinical outcomes. Although the main topic of the review was a process outcome, imaging ordering behaviour, we reported healthcare outcomes where available. There is some debate about the need to measure healthcare outcomes in evaluative implementation research in instances when there is a high degree of certainty that the targeted behaviour will lead to the healthcare outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Hakkennes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakkennes 2006</LINK>). Future studies should include healthcare outcomes when evidence is not available to support that the change in practitioner behaviour will lead to improved patient outcomes. This will require larger studies for longer follow-up periods, and greater resources would be needed.</P>
<P>Only three included studies considered cost outcomes, and none of these studies reported a cost-effectiveness analysis. Future studies in this area should include a well designed economic analysis.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-03-12 14:44:51 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon D French">
<P>Perhaps the most important limitation of the review is the quality of the included studies, many of which had methodological weaknesses and poor reporting that diminish the certainty of our conclusions. Although only three studies were judged as having &#8216;high&#8217; risk of bias, many studies had methodological weaknesses. Common methodological omissions in the conduct or reporting of these studies included lack of adequate allocation concealment, lack of blinded outcome assessment and lack of protection against intervention contamination. We judged the overall quality of the five included ITS studies as poor. Future studies should be of high quality and well reported to address previous methodological shortcomings.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-10-13 15:45:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon D French">
<P>Formulating a search strategy for a review with such broad condition and intervention inclusion was challenging, highlighted by almost half of the included studies not identified by our initial electronic database search. This highlights the importance of not relying solely on electronic databases for reviews in this field. While our search strategy of using multiple search methods identified further studies, it is possible that other important studies were not located. In addition, only one of the included osteoporosis studies was published pre-2002. Although we only identified one ongoing osteoporosis study, this appears to be an area of research with more studies being conducted more recently and for this review to remain relevant it will need to be updated relatively soon. In light of this we will update the search of this review within 12 months of publication, and update the review with any new studies we identify.</P>
<P>There were four included studies where the conditions included were not specified, because the focus was radiographs ordered of the spine, limbs and joints rather than any specific musculoskeletal condition (<LINK REF="STD-Kerry-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kerry 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matowe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Matowe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oakeshott-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Oakeshott 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Winkens 1995</LINK>). We assumed that the imaging tests were for musculoskeletal conditions, although it was not possible to determine this from the study report. One of these studies did not contribute data to the review because appropriate data could not be extracted from the study report (<LINK REF="STD-Winkens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Winkens 1995</LINK>). The other three studies contributed data to the low back pain and the other musculoskeletal conditions section, so it is possible that this limitation could have an impact on the conclusions of the review for these conditions.</P>
<P>At the protocol stage we planned to include CCTs and ITS studies because, for some interventions in this context, a RCT is not feasible. If feasible to conduct, RCTs are the strongest research design to evaluate intervention effects for the improvement of imaging behaviour, but data from non-RCTs can provide useful information. However, it has been argued that if a well conducted RCT is available to answer an intervention research question then non-RCTs should not be included in a systematic review of interventions due to their high risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2008</LINK>). In this review, an ITS study for osteoporosis management provided data on a financial intervention that was not evaluated in any RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 2007</LINK>). If we excluded non-RCTs at the protocol stage we would not have included this study in the review and this data would have been overlooked. Also, other included non-RCTs evaluated instances when guidelines had been disseminated to all health practitioners in a geographic region and a RCT would not have been possible (<LINK REF="STD-Kerry-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kerry 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matowe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Matowe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollingworth-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hollingworth 2002</LINK>). This argument also extends to CBA studies, which we did exclude from the review. It is possible that a review that included CBA studies would have different conclusions.</P>

This review found educational materials had moderate effects, patient mediated (or directed) interventions observed moderate to large effects, especially when targeting preventive services, and reminder interventions had moderate effects. Our targeted review has supported these findings for the effectiveness of reminder and patient mediated interventions, in the context of appropriate imaging in osteoporosis. Grimshaw and colleagues&#8217; conclusion that the intervention distribution of educational materials had a modest effect across all conditions differs to our findings for the included low back pain studies where we found no significant improvement for this intervention. Another more recent Cochrane systematic review examined printed educational materials across all clinical conditions, and included 23 studies (<LINK REF="REF-Farmer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farmer 2008</LINK>). Only one study was included that evaluated printed educational materials for low back pain management, but this study did not report imaging outcomes so we did not include it in our review (<LINK REF="REF-Hazard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazard 1997</LINK>). This other review concluded that when compared to no intervention, printed educational materials slightly improved process outcomes. It appears from our review that clinician imaging behaviour with respect to low back pain does not readily change with dissemination of educational materials alone. Further studies to improve the use of imaging in low back pain management should consider evaluating other types of professional or organisational interventions, and have a strong rationale for the intervention choice.</P>
<P>Previous reviews have drawn different conclusions about the cumulative effect of increasing number of intervention components. Our review is in agreement with Grimshaw et al who found no increased effect with increasing number of intervention components (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2004</LINK>), although three previous systematic reviews have found multifaceted interventions to be more effective than single interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wensing-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wensing 1998</LINK>). In the conduct of these other reviews, how the review authors coded the included interventions and the analytical methods used were not explicitly reported. In our review, and that of Grimshaw et al (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2004</LINK>), we coded all intervention components and used explicit methods to determine the effect size for each study, where possible. However, our analysis about the cumulative effect should be interpreted with caution because many of the comparisons were indirect. There were few head-to-head comparisons of the different interventions and it would not be appropriate to conclude that an intervention, single or multifaceted, is more effective than another based upon an indirect comparison unless appropriate methods were used. Considering that many of the included studies did not provide details on the reasons for the interventions chosen, it is not clear if the investigators chose intervention components for specific reasons or due to an assumption that &#8216;the more that is done the greater the chance of effect&#8217;. Our findings, and that of Grimshaw et al (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2004</LINK>), support a hypothesis that careful planning to overcome specific barriers to change is needed to design effective interventions in this area. A Cochrane systematic review including 15 studies of tailored interventions to overcome identified barriers to change concluded that more research is needed in this area (<LINK REF="REF-Cheater-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheater 2005</LINK>), so this hypothesis needs further testing in well designed studies.</P>
<P>For the study characteristics of interest (the use of theory and degree of risk of bias), due to the imbalance between the proportion of studies that did and did not have the characteristics, no firm conclusions can be drawn. However, for the analysis of type of imaging behaviour targeted, there was reasonable balance in the number of studies that aimed for an increase in imaging and the number that aimed for a decrease. Our analysis suggests that it may be more difficult for an intervention to reduce an imaging behaviour that is already established than it is to increase an imaging behaviour that is underused. This may explain some of the results where we found that osteoporosis studies (aiming for an increase in imaging behaviour) most often demonstrated a positive effect, whereas low back pain studies (aiming for a decrease in imaging behaviour) most often demonstrated no effect. On the other hand, this analysis is driven primarily by the osteoporosis and low back pain studies so this finding may be due to factors inherent in the management of osteoporosis and low back pain rather than due to increasing or decreasing behaviours <I>per se</I>.</P>
<P>Two previous systematic reviews examined the effect of interventions to improve the use of BMD test ordering in osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Elliot_x002d_Gibson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliot-Gibson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2004</LINK>). Both reviews were unable to determine which intervention was most effective for improving BMD test ordering in osteoporosis. These reviews were undertaken prior to the publication of the majority of the osteoporosis RCTs we have identified. Therefore, there is very little overlap in included studies between our review and the previous reviews and it is difficult to make comparisons between findings. Further, these two reviews included CBA studies, which we excluded from our review, and one review included an RCT which we excluded for methodological reasons (<LINK REF="STD-Wroe-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wroe 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>Interventions which can improve imaging practices in musculoskeletal conditions could have great benefit and result in both improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. This review identified 28 studies that evaluated a range of interventions including multiple combinations of complex interventions designed to improve imaging in musculoskeletal conditions. For osteoporosis, most professional interventions were found to result in a modest improvement of bone mineral density test ordering of approximately 10%. If a patient mediated or reminder component was part of the intervention the effect tended to be larger. Firm conclusions about other intervention types, for example, organisational interventions or audit and feedback, were not possible due to the small number of studies identified. For low back pain, the majority of the 12 included studies evaluated distribution of educational materials and most observed no significant improvement in appropriate imaging. No recommendations for practice can be made about other musculoskeletal conditions.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-10-28 12:19:38 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future research is needed to identify interventions that are effective in improving imaging for musculoskeletal conditions in particular settings. Our review has identified some interventions that show some promise. For osteoporosis, it is not clear which intervention, or combination of interventions, will be most effective. To date, patient mediated, reminder, and organisational interventions have each demonstrated promising results, but require further evaluation in rigorous studies. For low back pain, it appears that distribution of educational materials alone is not effective for improving imaging behaviour, while studies evaluating other interventions were few. Only a few studies evaluated theory-based interventions directed at specific barriers to change, and further research should be directed towards evaluating these approaches in high quality studies. Further work is also needed to determine the most effective and cost-effective combination of intervention components for particular settings and conditions and fidelity evaluation of interventions is essential to ensure that intervention effects can be fully understood.</P>
