<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-22 12:44:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Several million people world-wide are infected with hepatitis B virus. The infection may cause serious short-term and long-term effects including portal hypertension, liver failure, liver cancer, and death. Hepatitis B vaccination is reported to be beneficial in some specific groups of people such as babies born to women infected with hepatitis B, health-care workers, and people with long-standing kidney failure. Whether hepatitis B vaccine is beneficial in people who have not been exposed to hepatitis B infection or those whose exposure status is not known is assessed in the present review.</P>
<P>Twelve randomised clinical trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review. Primary analysis of the data based on criteria described beforehand (intention-to-treat model assigning unfavourable outcome for missing data) showed that hepatitis B vaccination has an unclear effect on the risk of developing hepatitis B infection. Analysis of data of available participants in the various trials showed that as compared to not vaccinating, hepatitis B vaccination reduces the risk of developing hepatitis B infection; by 88% for hepatitis B surface antigen marker and 62% for anti-core antibody marker. One should note, that these findings are based on only four randomised clinical trials of poor methodological quality involving 1230 participants. When compared with other vaccines or placebo, hepatitis B vaccination results in comparable risk of developing adverse events. This includes serious adverse events such as admission to hospital and convulsions, as well as less serious events such as fever, local redness, and pain. This shows that the risk of developing these adverse events is not more than with other vaccinations. There was not enough data to draw definite conclusions on the effect of hepatitis B vaccination on compliance and cost-effectiveness.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-05-23 13:13:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Randomised clinical trials comparing hepatitis B vaccine versus placebo, no intervention, or another vaccine in persons not previously exposed to hepatitis B (HBsAg negative) or with unknown exposure status.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-22 12:39:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>The primary outcome was hepatitis B infection (detecting HBsAg, HBeAg, HBV DNA, or anti-HBc). Secondary outcomes were lack of sero-protection, antibody titre, clinical complications, adverse events, lack of compliance, and cost-effectiveness. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using intention-to-treat analysis assuming an unfavourable event for missing data. Sensitivity analyses based on methodological quality (risk of bias), available data analysis, intention-to-treat analysis assuming a favourable event for missing data, best-case scenario, and worst-case scenario were conducted.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-23 13:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Twelve trials were eligible. All had high risk of bias and reporting was inconsistent. Hepatitis B vaccine did not show a clear effect on the risk of developing HBsAg (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03, 4 trials, 1230 participants) and anti-HBc (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.07; 4 trials, 1230 participants, random-effects) when data were analysed using intention-to-treat analysis assuming an unfavourable event for missing data. Analysis based on data of available participants showed reduced risk of developing HBsAg (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.44, 4 trials, 576 participants) and anti-HBc (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.76, 4 trials, 576 participants, random-effects). Intention-to-treat analysis assuming favourable outcome for missing data showed similar reduction in risk. Hepatitis B vaccination had an unclear effect on the risk of lacking protective antibody levels (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.27, 3 trials, 1210 participants, random-effects). Development of adverse events was sparsely reported.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-05-22 12:41:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>In people not previously exposed to hepatitis B, vaccination has unclear effect on the risk of developing infection, as compared to no vaccination. The risk of lacking protective antibody levels as well as serious and non-serious adverse events appear comparable among recipients and non-recipients of hepatitis B vaccine.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-13 16:15:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-23 13:14:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global problem. Current estimates suggest that over two billion people all over the world have been infected, of whom approximately 350 million have chronic infection (<LINK REF="REF-Beasley-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beasley 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maddrey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maddrey 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rizzetto-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizzetto 2002</LINK>). About one million deaths each year are attributable to hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, related to chronic hepatitis B virus infection (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinically, hepatitis B can result in a spectrum of clinical problems ranging from asymptomatic infection to symptomatic infection (<LINK REF="REF-McMahon-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMahon 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2001</LINK>). The long-term danger is that some infected persons develop persistent infection, of whom a fraction develop chronic liver disease and associated complications such as cirrhosis, portal hypertension, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular failure (<LINK REF="REF-Liaw-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liaw 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rehermann-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rehermann 2003</LINK>). The risk of developing persistent infection and its complications is inversely proportional to the age at infection; the younger the person at the time of initial infection, the greater is the risk of persistence, and vice versa (McMahon 1985; <LINK REF="REF-Moyer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hyams-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyams 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gall 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aggarwal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggarwal 2004</LINK>). Therefore, children infected at the time of birth have the highest risk of persistent hepatitis B infection. Persons with persistent infection, even if asymptomatic themselves, can still transmit the infection to others. The major routes of transmission are through sexual contact, sharing contaminated objects such as needles, razors, etc, and transfusion of infected blood or blood products. Another important route is from an infected pregnant woman to her child before or during delivery, ie, perinatal or vertical transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Gitlin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gitlin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vaccination against hepatitis B is expected to protect people from infection. If we assume that hepatitis B vaccine is safe and efficacious, every individual residing in geographical regions with high incidence of infection should receive hepatitis B vaccination early in life. This is often not feasible due to logistic and economic considerations. Therefore, to obtain maximum cost-benefit two strategies are possible (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aggarwal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggarwal 2004</LINK>). The 'high risk strategy' focuses on people believed to be at highest risk of infection, eg, health-care professionals, recipients of blood products, intravenous drug abusers, babies born to infected mothers, etc. This strategy depends on identification of all high-risk people and vaccination compliance. The high risk strategy is less cost intensive, but likely to work only in areas of low population prevalence of hepatitis B infection.</P>
<P>This contrasts the strategy of universal immunisation, wherein all individuals are vaccinated, irrespective of individual risk. Universal immunisation can be used in populations with high prevalence of hepatitis B infection and where it is difficult to identify individuals at highest risk (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1996</LINK>). This is economically and logistically more demanding and its success also depends on vaccination compliance. Individuals at high risk frequently refuse vaccination or fail to complete the vaccination series (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nystrom-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nystrom 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Previous systematic reviews have shown the benefit of hepatitis B immunisation in newborns of mothers with hepatitis B infection (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2006b</LINK>) and other high risk groups such as health-care workers (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2005</LINK>) and patients with chronic renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Schroth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroth 2004</LINK>). However, no meta-analyses or systematic reviews have addressed the issue of immunisation in persons who are not at high risk of hepatitis B exposure or individuals in the general population whose hepatitis B exposure status is not known. As the majority of the world's population fits into either of these categories, this review was undertaken to assess whether hepatitis B vaccination protects against hepatitis B virus infection in such persons.</P>

<P>We included trials that recruited participants of any age who were either hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative or whose status was not known. Absence of HBsAg suggests absence of hepatitis B infection, although this may not always be the case. We excluded trials on newborns who were born to mothers known to be infected with hepatitis B, and also trials on participants suspected to be at high risk of hepatitis B infection (health-care workers, intravenous drug abusers, homosexual persons, patients undergoing haemodialysis, those with haemato-oncological malignancy, frequent recipients of blood or blood products, participants with immune compromised status, and those who were receiving immunoglobulins for any reason). These groups were excluded because they constitute "high-risk groups" and there already exist Cochrane reviews on some of these groups of people (<LINK REF="REF-Schroth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroth 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2006a</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-05-23 13:19:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We analysed hepatitis B vaccine versus placebo, or no intervention, or another vaccine. We considered hepatitis B immunisation with either type of vaccine (plasma derived or recombinant), administered by any route (intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or intradermally), using any schedule, with or without simultaneous administration of other vaccines, administered singly or as a combination vaccine. Trials that only compared different doses, schedules or types of hepatitis B vaccine, without a comparator group who received placebo or another vaccine or no vaccination were excluded.</P>

<P>We followed the instructions given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>) and <I>The</I> <I>Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Module</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007a</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Searching for trials</HEADING>
<P>RED conducted searches of all electronic databases; this was coordinated with The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Review Group. RED conducted additional searches in <I>LILACS</I> and <I>Science Citation Index</I> <I>Expanded</I>. JLM contacted the corresponding authors and first authors of the included trials by e-mail requesting for unpublished data. This was done on 20 July 2007 through the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group. Vaccine manufacturing companies were jointly identified by JLM and The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group through an Internet search on www.google.com using the search terms 'hepatitis B vaccine' and 'hepatitis B vaccine manufacture# 'on 18 July 2007. Ten companies with correspondence addresses were identified in this manner in addition to the seven identified by The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group. Postal and/or fax communication was sent to these manufacturers on 25 July 2007. RED searched reference lists of eligible trials for additional trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of trials</HEADING>
<P>The initial results of the search were independently screened by JLM and PJM, and potentially relevant trials were identified on the basis of title, abstract, and key words/MeSH headings. Those that appeared eligible for inclusion were obtained in full. JLM read through these and assessed the eligibility for inclusion in the review. RED validated the list of included and excluded trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>JLM and RED extracted the following data from the selected trials: characteristics of the trial design, participant characteristics, interventions (dosage, type, schedule), primary and secondary outcome measures, assessment of methodological quality (risk of bias), and sub-groups into which the trial could be included. We also marked the additional information sought from the authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of bias risk</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality (and hence risk of bias due to the methodology) of the trials was assessed following the Cochrane methodology (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>) and as per the recommendations of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007a</LINK>). This was done by assessment of each trial as given below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">
<I>Generation of the allocation sequence</I>
</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. Drawing of lots, tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice were also considered as adequate if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers were used for the allocation of patients.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">
<I>Allocation concealment</I>
</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation of patients involved a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, identically appearing numbered drug bottles or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator, or sealed envelopes.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants or if the study was quasi-randomised.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">
<I>Blinding</I>
</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the trial was described as double blind and both the investigator assessing outcomes as well as participants were blinded to the nature of intervention. Blinding was also considered adequate if trials reported single blinding of the investigator assessing outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as double blind, but the method of blinding was not described.</LI>
<LI>Not performed, if the trial was not double blind.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials were assumed to have low risk of bias if at least two of the three quality components were adequate. Otherwise, trials were classified as having high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Data from trials were combined for meta-analysis using Review Manager 4.2. (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). We used relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data were analysed by the fixed-effect model. If there was significant heterogeneity interpreted as defined below, the data were also analysed using the random-effects model and both analyses are presented. We performed intention-to-treat analysis for dichotomous data assuming an unfavourable outcome for participants whose data were not reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We qualified inconsistency among the pooled estimates using the I<SUP>2</SUP> = [(Q - df)/Q] x 100% test, where Q is the chi-squared statistic and df is its degrees of freedom. This illustrates the percentage of the variability in effect estimates resulting from heterogeneity rather than sampling error. We assumed significant heterogeneity when I<SUP>2</SUP> is more than 50% and analysed such outcomes using both a fixed-effect model and random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We performed the following sub-group analyses on the primary outcome (markers of hepatitis B occurrence) .<BR/>

<UL>
<LI>Age of participants at initiation of vaccination, ie, newborns (within first 28 days of birth), children (28 days to 10 years), adolescents (11 to 18 years), and adults (more than 18 years).</LI>
<LI>Presence or absence of first dose of vaccine at birth.</LI>
<LI>Prevalence of HBsAg among the population from which the trial participants originated. This was categorized as low (less than 2%), moderate (2% to 7%), and high (more than 7%) prevalence of hepatitis B (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Damme-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Damme 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahoney-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahoney 1999</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Follow-up periods less than 1 year, from 1 to 5 years, and more than 5 years.</LI>
<LI>Schedule of vaccination, ie, three doses with conventional 0,1,6 months schedule, three doses with any accelerated schedule, and four doses by any schedule.</LI>
<LI>Administration of hepatitis B vaccine alone versus administration as part of a combination or along with other vaccines in the same syringe.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We used the test for interaction to estimate the difference between two subgroups (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We performed sensitivity analyses whenever appropriate in order to explore causes of heterogeneity and the robustness of the results of the primary outcome. We separated studies according to:<BR/>
</P>
<P>1. Risk of bias: including only trials with low risk of bias.<BR/>2. Attrition bias: including only trials with low drop-out rate (less than 10%).<BR/>3. Follow-up:<BR/>(a) available data analysis, ie, including only data of those participants who were followed up and ignoring those whose data were not reported. For this analysis, the total number at follow-up was used as the denominator;<BR/>(b) intention-to-treat analysis assuming favourable outcome for those whose data were not reported, ie, none of the drop-outs in the experimental (hepatitis B vaccine) and control group had the primary outcomes;<BR/>(c) best-case scenario favouring hepatitis B vaccine, ie, none of the dropouts in the experimental (hepatitis B vaccine) group had the primary outcome, but all dropouts from the control group had the primary outcome;<BR/>(d) worst-case scenario favouring control, ie, all the dropouts from the experimental (hepatitis B vaccine) group had the primary outcome, but none from the control group had the primary outcome.</P>

<P>Search of the electronic databases identified 2964 citations. Of these 328 were considered relevant for this review. Of these, 66 publications were considered potential trials for inclusion. Full text of these was obtained and 14 publications describing 12 trials met the inclusion criteria for this review (<I>see</I> Included studies references); 52 publications were excluded (<I>see</I> Characteristics of excluded studies table). One of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Xueliang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Xueliang 2000</LINK>) had three publications. Forty-eight experts were contacted by e-mail on 20 July 2007 and one response was received; however, the trial details supplied had already been included in the review. Seventeen vaccine manufacturers were contacted by post or fax in the last week of July 2007; one was returned owing to incomplete address. However, no responses were received from the manufacturers.

<BR/>Nine of the twelve trials included HBsAg as an outcome. However, five trials did not clearly report the exact number of events and/or participants in each intervention group. Of these, two (<LINK REF="STD-Bassily-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bassily 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giammanco-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Giammanco 1991</LINK>) did not report findings in either arm of the trial, in two trials the outcome was assessed in a fraction of participants, but the relationship of the fraction to the original number enrolled was not clear (<LINK REF="STD-Coursaget-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Coursaget 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 1991</LINK>). One trial did not specify the denominator (<LINK REF="STD-Perrin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Perrin 1986</LINK>). Thus, only four trials reported data, which could be included in the meta-analysis. Hepatitis B vaccination had no significant effect on the risk of HBsAg presence in the intention-to-treat analysis (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03, 4 trials with 1230 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Justification for this systematic review</HEADING>
<P>Hepatitis B vaccination has become increasingly popular, especially because it is recommended both for universal vaccination and protection of high-risk groups by the World Health Organization and many professional bodies. Therefore, the very idea of performing a systematic review to assess the benefits and harms of this vaccine may appear strange to some people. Some critics could suggest that this review was undertaken for the purpose of 'proving a foregone conclusion in favour of the vaccine', making it an unnecessary exercise. Skeptics of the concept and process of evidence-based medicine may also argue that irrespective of the conclusions of the review, one cannot but continue with hepatitis B vaccination; hence such a review is nothing more that a frivolous scientific exercise. The authors of this review may even be (mis) labelled as evidence-based medicine fanatics demanding proof for 'the obvious'.</P>
<P>We must emphasize that despite being aware of such opinions, we have undertaken this review for three important reasons. The first aim was to test whether the popular belief in the beneficial effects of hepatitis B vaccine can be proven (or otherwise) in a scientifically rigorous manner. Second and more important, we have tried to assess whether there is evidence to answer a central question that is missed in most trials on hepatitis B vaccine, namely, whether hepatitis B vaccine prevents the occurrence of hepatitis B, in other words the protective efficacy of the vaccine. Numerous trials have implied this conclusion through the use of surrogate outcome measures, especially sero-protection (development of a 'protective' titre of antibodies) within a limited time frame (usually four weeks after the last vaccine dose), but this review shows that only a limited number of trials have evaluated protective efficacy measuring relevant outcomes. We believe that this is an important issue to resolve before recommending whether or not hepatitis B vaccine should be used in people not previously exposed to the infection. Thirdly, we have tried to assess the benefits and harms of hepatitis B vaccine with reference to several other outcome measures such as adverse events, cost effectiveness, and compliance pattern among recipients. These issues also are important when hepatitis B vaccination is being considered in a country or region.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Explanation of the methodology used in this systematic review</HEADING>
<P>This review is primarily focused on assessing the benefits and harms of hepatitis B vaccination in people who are either hepatitis B surface antigen negative, or have unknown exposure status; because these groups comprise the vast majority of the world's population. We have deliberately excluded trials in 'high-risk' groups since their response to the vaccine could be different from the so-called 'low-risk' patient group. Therefore this review is likely to be helpful for countries planning to initiate hepatitis B vaccination for 'low risk people'.</P>
<P>Many vaccination trials recruit and randomise a reasonably large number of participants, but fail to follow all of them. Some trials report results in only a small fraction of those randomised, failing to account for the missing participants. Since vaccination cannot be assumed to have only beneficial effects, ignoring the participants whose data is not reported can affect the results of the systematic review. There are a number of ways of dealing with this problem, the least appropriate being to ignore it and use only the data of available participants during data analysis. Other analysis models are intention-to-treat analysis assuming unfavourable or favourable outcomes for all participants whose data are missing, in both arms of trials. Another possible analysis could be the best-case scenario and worst-case scenario models. Yet other analysis could be done, by assuming that a proportion of dropouts (in each arm of the trials) had favourable outcomes, while the rest had unfavourable outcomes. However it is not clear how the correct proportion can be calculated, hence this was not a realistic option. We also felt that intention-to-treat analysis merely carrying forward last-reported data is inaccurate because the primary outcomes considered in this review can change with time. It is difficult to judge which of these analysis models is likely to give the most correct result that represents the 'true' effect. Therefore, we decided <I>a priori</I> to use an intention-to-treat analysis assuming unfavourable outcomes for all missing data and undertake two sensitivity analyses, ie, analysis of data of available participants at follow-up and intention-to-treat analysis assuming that all participants in either arm whose data were not reported had a favourable outcome.</P>
<P>At the time of initiating this review, we did not realize that most of the trials eligible for inclusion had a large number of participants whose data was neither reported nor its absence explained. Since most trials reported outcomes in only a small fraction of randomised participants, the Contact Editors of this review opined that our original analysis using the intention-to-treat model (assuming unfavourable outcome for all participants whose data were not reported) and the two sensitivity analyses (available data analysis and intention-to-treat analysis assuming favourable outcomes for all missing data) would not be appropriate because the pooled effect could vary depending on the number of participants whose data are missing, in either arm of the trials. They therefore suggested that the data of available participants be presented as the primary analysis and the analysis described in the published protocol of this review be reported as a sensitivity analysis. However, this suggestion has not been accepted by us for two reasons. First, the published protocol specified the analysis performed by us <I>a priori</I> and second, we believe that it is inappropriate to change the reporting format after the results are evident. However, on the suggestion of the Contact Editors, two additional sensitivity analyses have been conducted and reported, ie, the best-case scenario and worst-case scenario. Although these have not been mentioned in the protocol, the Handbook describes both these analyses as methods to deal with data that is not reported. The four sensitivity analyses are presented only for the primary outcome, ie, occurrence of hepatitis B infection.</P>
<P>Since it is not clear which of the analysis models is closest to the 'truth', we recommend that all systematic reviews on vaccine efficacy report results using all these analysis models.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Conclusions that can be drawn from this review</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review demonstrates that hepatitis B vaccination has an unclear effect on the risk of developing hepatitis B virus markers of infection (HBsAg and anti-HBc antibodies) in participants without previous knowledge about exposure to hepatitis B infection. However, alternate methods of analysis using the data of available participants shows a clear and dramatic reduction in the risk of developing hepatitis B infection. A similar result is observed with an analysis assuming favourable outcomes for all those whose data are missing and the best-case scenario. Although it is clear that none of these analyses represents the perfect method of analysis, it is difficult to specify which of these gives the most accurate result. Whichever method of analysis is chosen to represent the truth, one must realize that the findings are based on a small number of methodologically poor, randomised clinical trials. Therefore, based on the findings in this review, countries planning investments in a vaccination programme should exercise individual judgement on the expected magnitude of benefit vis a vis the cost of a vaccination programme. Although this is unintentional, this review cannot provide any further guidance on this subject.</P>
<P>It should further be noted that the methodological quality of the included trials was generally low and hence the risk of bias is high. Furthermore, a number of trials did not report relevant outcomes or reported outcomes unclearly which raises the risk of outcome measure reporting bias (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2007</LINK>) although, these observations usually increase the risk of positive bias. Yet another point to be considered is that the trials in this review recruited participants who were HBsAg negative and not necessarily those with unknown status. Since a vaccination programme will also include participants in the latter category (who may be HBsAg positive unless proven through a screening programme and excluded from vaccination), the overall benefit of a vaccination programme may not be similar to that expected from the findings of this review.</P>
<P>It is worth remembering that clinical trials are not the only way to determine vaccine efficacy. For many vaccines, data from clinical trials may need to be considered along with other important information over a period of time, such as the change in morbidity and mortality statistics with the inception of a vaccination programme, observation(s) of disease epidemiology when vaccination programmes are suspended or discontinued for any reason, the relationship between attack rate of disease and the proportion of vaccinated individuals in a community, etc. These important assessments were outside the scope of this review.</P>
<P>This review has also shown that there is an unclear effect on the presence of protective level of anti-HBs antibodies following vaccination. One way of interpreting this finding could be to assert that it supports the theory that protection depends on immunological memory and not on the presence of protective antibody levels (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1993</LINK>). The counter argument is that immunological memory itself depends on the development of a protective level of antibodies after vaccination (sero-protection), that may later decline or become undetectable. Therefore, some experts may consider the lack of sero-protection as unacceptable. Since this review is not designed to demonstrate whether sero-protective antibody levels decline with time (or otherwise), we suggest caution in interpreting results of anti-HBs antibodies. This is another reason why trials should report occurrence of infection based on clinical or laboratory measurements rather than surrogate outcomes such as antibody levels (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007b</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is lack of robust data to demonstrate whether or not hepatitis B vaccination is associated with higher or lower risk of serious adverse events as well as non-serious adverse events. Caution must be exercised because trials reporting adverse events administered other childhood vaccines in addition to hepatitis B. However, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bassily-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bassily 1995</LINK>) that used concomitant childhood vaccines showed a lower risk of fever among hepatitis B vaccinees, indirectly suggesting a protective effect of the vaccine. However, such an interpretation needs verification.</P>
<P>The impact of hepatitis B vaccine on vaccination compliance is difficult to judge since only two trials reported this and showed very different results.</P>
<P>It is disappointing that there are no randomised trials to determine development of clinical complications of hepatitis B as well as cost effectiveness; both these are important issues in deciding vaccination guidelines at the local, national, and regional levels. However, such information may not be available through randomised trials and could be evaluated through other study designs that are outside the scope of the present review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strengths and limitations of this review</HEADING>
<P>Some of the strengths of this systematic review are that we assessed the effect of hepatitis B vaccine on multiple outcome measures, the most important being protective efficacy. We did this by considering whether vaccination can prevent infection, rather than merely evaluating antibody levels or sero-conversion following vaccination. For this, we planned to analyse all serological markers of hepatitis B infection. Protective efficacy is the real proof of the beneficial effect of any vaccine; all other potential surrogate measurements are only indirect proof (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007b</LINK>). Another strength of this review is that we evaluated the effect of vaccination at the longest follow-up reported. This is important because hepatitis B can result in persistent infection with risk of chronic liver disease and its complications. Therefore, the real test of the vaccine is whether or not it can prevent infection in the long term and not only the short term (in contrast to some other vaccines where the infection predominantly affects children). We also determined the safety profile in terms of serious and non-serious adverse events. Besides these, we made efforts to determine cost effectiveness of vaccinating versus not vaccinating.</P>
<P>We performed a comprehensive search that included contacting experts and vaccine manufacturers, and unlike most Cochrane reviews, we have reported the process and outcome of these additional searches. At least two authors worked independently at all stages of the review.</P>
<P>We also performed a rigorous intention-to-treat analysis assuming unfavourable outcome for participants whose data were not reported in the various trials. This was done in order to avoid the bias that could be created by ignoring the number of drop-outs from the trials. The importance of this has been described above. Besides this, we also performed four sensitivity analyses besides analysis of subgroups of importance. Our methodology has been explicit and transparent.</P>
<P>Nevertheless we acknowledge that this review has some important limitations, particularly that all included trials had low methodological quality, ie, had high risk of bias. Furthermore, the risk of bias is further increased by the fact that many of the included trials did not report on outcomes that seemed highly relevant to report on. This could lead to outcome reporting bias (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2007</LINK>), which may also lead to significant overestimation of intervention effects.</P>
<P>We did not include publications that reported non-randomised trial design, some of which may be relevant, despite the high risk of bias.<B> </B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Paucity of high quality data</HEADING>
<P>This review highlights the paucity of methodologically sound trials (trials with low risk of bias) to address the central issue of whether or not hepatitis B vaccination protects against hepatitis B. As is the case with many vaccine trials, most hepatitis B vaccine trials also report limited outcomes such as antibody levels one month after vaccination along with recording a few adverse events. It has already been emphasised that post-vaccination antibodies are only a surrogate outcome that is believed or expected to correlate with protective efficacy.</P>
<P>Our review highlights several gaps in existing knowledge about hepatitis B vaccine. Some of these include information about serious adverse events, the concentration of antibodies generated by vaccination, duration of protective effect, the risk of developing infection if exposed during the vaccination series and the nature of long-term protection afforded by vaccination. A major missing piece is the cost-effectiveness as compared to not vaccinating a cohort of individuals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Design of future trials</HEADING>
<P>This review gives information that can help to design future trials in order to enhance knowledge about hepatitis B vaccine and its benefits or harms. Ideally, future trials should be conducted on low risk people by including those with unknown exposure status who form the vast majority of the population as well as those already known to be hepatitis B surface antigen negative, without resorting to a screening programme. This would make the participants in the trial similar to the population where a vaccination programme is proposed (should beneficial effect be demonstrated). Furthermore, the participants should be recruited consecutively without resorting to very strict exclusion criteria as is often the case with randomised trials. Such a trial (assuming the usual alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.80) in a population with low prevalence (2%) would require 861 participants in each arm, to demonstrate a reduction in HBsAg by 75%, ie, to 0.5%. Demonstration of a similar reduction in a population of intermediate prevalence (4%) would require 424 participants in each arm; 279 participants would be required in a population with 6% prevalence. For a high prevalence population of 8%, 206 subjects in each arm will be sufficient to demonstrate 75% reduction in risk. Trials should address protective efficacy by measuring clinical and serological outcomes that suggest hepatitis B infection indisputably (HBsAg, anti-HBc, HBV DNA), rather than limiting to surrogate measures of efficacy (sero-protection, GMT of antibodies, etc). These measurements should be performed serially, for the longest duration possible making effort to restrict drop-outs and carefully accounting for any that do occur. However, it is difficult to spell out for how long such trials must be conducted, since it depends on resources available. Intention-to-treat analysis and calculation of numbers needed-to-treat and numbers needed-to-harm will help to get a clearer picture of the effects of hepatitis B vaccination. It need not be emphasised that future trials ought to be conducted and reported according to the recommendations of the CONSORT Statement (www.consort-statement.org). However, it should be recognised that the practicalities of actually undertaking and completing such a trial, especially in the low-risk population, are substantial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Issues that need to be resolved</HEADING>
<P>Certain issues were outside the scope of this review. These include comparison of various doses of hepatitis B vaccine, ideal number of doses, best vaccination schedule, comparison of different routes of vaccination, comparison between vaccinating separately versus combining with other vaccines, relevance of a birth dose in infancy, duration of protection, impact on event-free survival, etc. These could become the topic of future trials and reviews.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Updating this review</HEADING>
<P>We believe (and hope) that this review will generate considerable interest and correspondence from various quarters, particularly industry. We also recognise that it might bring to light some relevant trials that have not been disclosed so far. Recognising that additional data will be very useful to get a clearer understanding, we propose to submit the first update of this review, one year following its initial publication, instead of the more common practice of waiting for two to three years.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-23 14:01:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Current evidence suggests that hepatitis B vaccination has an unclear effect on the risk of developing hepatitis B infection in persons not previously exposed to hepatitis B or with unknown exposure status.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There are several gaps in the knowledge about hepatitis B vaccination including serious adverse events, systemic adverse events, best dose, best vaccination schedule, and long-term protective effect. The low methodological quality of available data argues strongly in favour of designing new randomised trials that can cover the lacunae in existing data. </P>
