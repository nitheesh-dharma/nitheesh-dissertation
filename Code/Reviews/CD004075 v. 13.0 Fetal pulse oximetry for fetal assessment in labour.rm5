<P>Search updated in November 2006. We identified and included four new trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bloom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-East-2006" TYPE="STUDY">East 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klauser-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Klauser 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuhnert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhnert 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The original version of this review concluded that the addition of fetal pulse oximetry to cardiotocography decreased the caesarean section and operative delivery rates for nonreassuring fetal status, with no difference in overall caesarean section rates. The addition of the four new trials confirmed these conclusions when nonreassuring fetal status was identified prior to study entry. When nonreassuring fetal status was not present prior to study entry, knowledge of fetal pulse oximetry values made no difference to caesarean section rates for nonreassuring fetal status or for all indications.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-08-09 15:58:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Using fetal pulse oximetry to assess the baby's well-being during labour does not change overall caesarean section rates.</P>
<P>During labour, the well-being of the baby can be assessed intermittently using a Pinard stethoscope or hand-held monitor to listen to the heart rate, or continuously using cardiotocography (CTG), sometimes called electronic fetal monitoring (EFM). There are also additional tests that can be used if the baby is thought to be getting short of oxygen, like testing the baby's blood in a sample taken from the baby's head or bottom, or through the recording of the electrical activity of the heart using an electrocardiogram (ECG). Fetal pulse oximetry measures how much oxygen the baby's blood is carrying. It uses a probe that sits on the baby's head whilst in the uterus and vagina during labour. The probe is said not to interfere with the woman's mobility during labour. This review looked at fetal pulse oximetry and found trials that used it in conjunction with a CTG. We compared the outcomes for this combined oximetry and CTG, with outcomes where only the CTG had been used, or a combination of CTG and fetal ECG had been used. </P>
<P>The review identified seven trials involving 8013 women. Fetal pulse oximetry plus CTG showed no difference in caesarean section rates overall, nor any difference in the mother's or newborn's health, compared with CTG alone. If there was concern about the baby's well-being before the fetal pulse oximetry probe was placed, the use of fetal pulse oximetry reduced caesarean sections performed for the baby's well-being. The one trial of oximetry with CTG compared with CTG and fetal ECG showed an increase in the caesarean rate in the oximetry group. In two of the trials, the company making the fetal pulse oximetry machines provided some funding. A better method than fetal pulse oximetry is needed for checking on the well-being of the baby during labour.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-09 15:57:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The use of conventional cardiotocographic (CTG) monitoring of fetal well-being during labour is associated with an increased caesarean section rate, compared with intermittent auscultation of the fetal heart rate, resulting in a reduction in neonatal seizures, although no differences in other neonatal outcomes. To improve the sensitivity of this test and therefore reduce the number of caesarean sections performed for nonreassuring fetal status, several additional measures of evaluating fetal well-being have been considered. These have demonstrated some effect on reducing caesarean section rates, for example, fetal scalp blood sampling for pH estimation/lactate measurement. The adaptation of pulse oximetry for use in the unborn fetus could potentially contribute to improved evaluation during labour and therefore lead to a reduction in caesarean sections for nonreassuring fetal status, without any change in neonatal outcomes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-06-23 15:14:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>To compare the effectiveness and safety of fetal intrapartum pulse oximetry with other surveillance techniques.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-08-09 15:57:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2014), contacted experts in the field and searched reference lists of retrieved studies. In previous versions of this review, we performed additional searches of MEDLINE, Embase and Current Contents. These searches were discontinued for this review update, as they consistently failed to identify any trials that were not shown in the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-08-09 15:52:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials that compared maternal and fetal outcomes when fetal pulse oximetry was used in labour, (i) with or without concurrent use of conventional fetal surveillance, that is, cardiotocography (CTG), compared with using CTG alone or (ii) with or without concurrent use of both CTG and other method(s) of fetal surveillance, such as fetal electrocardiography (ECG) plus CTG.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-08-09 15:58:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>At least two independent review authors performed data extraction. We sought additional information from the investigators of three of the reported trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-09 15:58:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We included seven published trials: six comparing fetal pulse oximetry and CTG with CTG alone (or when fetal pulse oximetry values were blinded) and one comparing fetal pulse oximetry plus CTG with fetal ECG plus CTG. The published trials, with some unpublished data, were at high risk of bias in terms of the impractical nature of blinding participants and clinicians, as well as high risk or unclear risk of bias for outcome assessor for all but one report. Selection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other sources of bias were of low or unclear risk. The trials reported on a total of 8013 pregnancies. Differing entry criteria necessitated separate analyses, rather than meta-analysis of all trials.</P>
<P>Systematic review of four trials from 34 weeks not requiring fetal blood sampling (FBS) prior to study entry showed no evidence of differences in the overall caesarean section rate between those monitored with fetal oximetry and those not monitored with fetal pulse oximetry or for whom the fetal pulse oximetry results were masked (average risk ratio (RR) 0.99 using random-effects, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.86 to 1.13, n = 4008, I² = 45%). There was evidence of a higher risk of caesarean section in the group with fetal oximetry plus CTG than in the group with fetal ECG plus CTG (one study, n = 180, RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.29). Neonatal seizures and neonatal encephalopathy were rare in both groups. No studies reported details of long-term disability.</P>
<P>There was evidence of a decrease in caesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status in the fetal pulse oximetry plus CTG group compared to the CTG group, gestation from 34 weeks (average RR (random-effects) 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90, n = 4008, I² = 63%). There was no evidence of differences between groups in caesarean section for dystocia, although the overall incidence rates varied between the trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-27 08:53:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The addition of fetal pulse oximetry does not reduce overall caesarean section rates. One study found a higher caesarean section rate in the group monitored with fetal pulse oximetry plus CTG, compared with fetal ECG plus CTG. The data provide limited support for the use of fetal pulse oximetry when used in the presence of a nonreassuring CTG, to reduce caesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status. A better method than pulse oximetry is required to enhance the overall evaluation of fetal well-being in labour.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-28 08:36:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-28 08:36:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Cardiotocography (CTG) was introduced in the 1960s with the aim of improving neonatal outcomes by improving intrapartum fetal surveillance. The uterine contractions and the fetal heart rate, variability, decelerations and accelerations influence the way these patterns are classified. Terms in use include normal, reassuring, nonreassuring, indeterminate, suspicious, abnormal, pathological and preterminal (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FIGO-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">FIGO 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RANZCOG-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RANZCOG 2014</LINK>). In this review, we refer to the terms reassuring, nonreassuring or abnormal. Reassuring patterns require no specific action. Nonreassuring patterns occur in about 15% to 19% of labours monitored by CTG (<LINK REF="STD-East-2006" TYPE="STUDY">East 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Umstad-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Umstad 1993</LINK>) and may prompt clinical actions ranging from simple manoeuvres, such as a change of maternal position, through to expedited birth of the baby (vacuum, forceps, caesarean section). Abnormal patterns usually prompt expedited birth with the aim of preventing or minimising hypoxia in the fetus. The positive predictive value of CTG for adverse outcome is low and the negative predictive value high (<LINK REF="REF-Nonnenmacher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nonnenmacher 2010</LINK>), although this is improving with computerised interpretation of CTGs (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 2010</LINK>). Thus, while a normal CTG usually indicates reassuring fetal status, a nonreassuring or abnormal CTG does not necessarily equate with 'fetal distress'. These features, combined with marked inter-observer variation in CTG interpretation by midwives (<LINK REF="REF-Devane-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devane 2005</LINK>) and doctors (<LINK REF="REF-Palomaki-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palomaki 2006</LINK>), result in variable but inappropriately high operative birth rates for nonreassuring fetal status in many hospitals. Electronic fetal monitoring rapidly gained widespread acceptance for monitoring the fetal heart rate during labour, but it was not until the 1970s that randomised controlled trials were conducted to assess the benefits of this technology. A Cochrane systematic review found that the use of electronic monitoring increased the odds of having a caesarean section, compared to intermittent auscultation of the fetal heart (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2013</LINK>). Despite these shortcomings, cardiotocography remains a widely used means of assessing fetal well-being during labour. One conclusion of the systematic review of CTG monitoring was to consider how best to convey the uncertainty of the benefits of such monitoring to enable women to make an informed choice, while not compromising labour normality (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2013</LINK>). The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>) suggested that, as for all aspects of care, the woman herself should be involved in decision-making for choice of fetal monitoring, with adequate access to evidence-based information; and recommended that electronic monitoring be offered where there is an increased risk of perinatal death, neonatal encephalopathy or cerebral palsy, and during labours induced or augmented by oxytocin.</P>
<P>Once a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern has been identified, a number of additional assessments of fetal well-being may be considered. These do not replace the CTG, but are usually used as complementary to it, either intermittently or continuously. One example is fetal scalp blood sampling for pH or lactate analysis. A low pH (for example, less than 7.20) or a high lactate (for example greater than 4.8 mmol/L) may be considered abnormal (<LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1999</LINK>). The addition of fetal scalp blood sampling to standard electronic monitoring reduces the odds for caesarean section, although the odds are not significantly different compared to intermittent auscultation of the fetal heart (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2013</LINK>). Another example is fetal electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures fetal ST interval and the changes in the T/QRS ratio. An elevation of the ST segment and the ratio between the T wave and QRS amplitudes (T/QRS), identifies fetal anaerobic myocardial metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Ros_x0117_n-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ros&#279;n 2004</LINK>). A Cochrane systematic review of the addition of fetal electrocardiogram monitoring reported no evidence of a difference in overall caesarean section rate when compared to electronic monitoring only (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Dokus-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dokus 2013</LINK> considered the potential impact of the declining clinical use of fetal ECG and fetal pulse oximetry (described below), noting that the overall caesarean section rate increased when either fetal ECG or fetal pulse oximetry were no longer available for use (total n = 13,413). Cochrane systematic reviews of vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) or fetal scalp blood sampling for lactate measurement as additional fetal assessments in labour were unable to identify randomised controlled trials that compared these interventions with no intervention (<LINK REF="REF-East-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-East-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-08-09 15:59:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Fetal pulse oximetry aims to improve the accuracy of the evaluation of fetal well-being during labour (<LINK REF="REF-Colditz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colditz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coldtiz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coldtiz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-East-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2007a</LINK>). It is generally reserved for use when a nonreassuring CTG has been recorded, to assist in identifying those fetuses that may benefit from further intervention (<LINK REF="REF-East-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-East-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2008</LINK>) and as an adjunct to, rather than replacement of, the CTG monitor. This method has two potential advantages over conventional fetal heart rate monitoring: (i) it directly measures the proportion of haemoglobin that is carrying oxygen: thus, oxygenation, the primary variable underlying the tissue damaging effects of hypoxia/ischaemia is being monitored; and (ii) it relies on an established, safe, noninvasive, widely-used technology found in every modern intensive care unit and operating theatre. Inaccurate oxygen saturation readings can occur with conditions that decrease arterial blood perfusion, for instance, they can occur with venous pulsations, excessive movement, intravenous pigmented dyes, and abnormal haemoglobin (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2013</LINK>). A variety of fetal pulse oximetry sensors has been studied. These are placed during a vaginal examination to attach to the top of the fetal head by suction (<LINK REF="REF-Arikan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arikan 2000</LINK>) or clip (<LINK REF="REF-Knitza-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knitza 2004</LINK>), lie against the fetal temple or cheek (<LINK REF="REF-Mallinckrodt-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mallinckrodt 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nellcor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nellcor 2004</LINK>), or to lie along the fetal back (<LINK REF="REF-Prothia-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prothia 2014</LINK>). The sensor remains in situ and fetal pulse oximetry values are recorded for approximately 81% of the monitoring time (<LINK REF="REF-East-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 1997</LINK>). Women have rated their experience with fetal oximetry during observational studies. One survey included questions about the woman's perceived level of comfort during sensor placement, mobility with the sensor in place and ongoing comfort with the sensor in place: these factors were all rated favourably by the women (<LINK REF="REF-East-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Arikan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arikan 1998</LINK> reported that the majority of women did not consider that a fetal oximetry sensor restricted their movement during labour.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-09 15:59:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Results of animal and human research suggest that when using sensors calibrated for the fetal environment, fetal oximetry values greater than or equal to 30% are considered reassuring, even when the CTG is nonreassuring, while values less than 30% warrant consideration of interventions, ranging from maternal position change, through to urgent birth via caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Kuhnert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhnert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nijland-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nijland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seelbach_x002d_Gobel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seelbach-Gobel 1999</LINK>). A prospective, observational cohort study investigating relationship between oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry and umbilical cord arterial pH values in healthy newborns during the first 15 minutes of life found a significant correlation between both preductal and postductal oxygen saturation levels and umbilical arterial blood pH values (<LINK REF="REF-Uslu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uslu 2012</LINK>). A prospective observational study found a low pulse oximetry oxygen saturation &lt; 30% for at least 10 minutes correlates highly with fetal acidosis in cases of nonreassuring fetal heart rate (<LINK REF="REF-Nonnenmacher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nonnenmacher 2010</LINK>). A novel fetal phantom based on actual fetal parameters showed that the wireless oximeter was capable of identifying 4% and 2% changes in diameter between the diastolic and systolic point in arteries of over 0.2 and 0.4 mm inner diameter, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Stub_x00e1_n-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stubán 2009</LINK>). One manufacturer recommends this technology for singleton pregnancies only (<LINK REF="REF-Nellcor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nellcor 2004</LINK>). Consideration for monitoring multiple pregnancies by monitoring the first fetus during labour, then the second or subsequent fetuses following birth of the preceding fetus may be possible.</P>
</THEORY>

<P>The value of any fetal monitoring system during labour, including the CTG or any additional surveillance, is usually expressed by its ability to predict which fetuses are hypoxic or acidotic. Measures of this may include umbilical cord blood gases (including base excess values less than or equal to 12 mmol/L and pH values less than 7.00 (<LINK REF="REF-Sehdev-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sehdev 1997</LINK>), or less than 7.10 (<LINK REF="REF-Arikan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arikan 2000</LINK>) or lactate values &gt; 6.1 mmol/L (<LINK REF="REF-White-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2010</LINK>); or clinical outcomes including Apgar scores (an assessment of neonatal condition shortly after birth, usually at one and five minutes: Apgar scores of less than seven at five minutes or later are nonspecific but may be associated with hypoxia (<LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sehdev-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sehdev 1997</LINK>)); or abnormal neurological status of the baby, possibly caused by lack of oxygen or blood supply (hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy), or both. Other outcomes of interest may include fetal/maternal infections, for example of the membranes (chorioamnionitis), or the uterine lining (endometritis). Interventions resulting from such tests are also important. For example, it is important to note not only overall modes of birth following different forms of monitoring, but also specific interventions, such as operative birth (vacuum, forceps and caesarean section) for the indication of nonreassuring fetal status, since nonreassuring fetal status is what the monitoring is intended to discern. In the longer term, such interventions may also impact on future pregnancies. For example, the likelihood of a successful vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) in a subsequent pregnancy is improved for women whose previous caesarean was performed for the indication of nonreassuring fetal status, compared with those where the previous caesarean was performed for dystocia (<LINK REF="REF-Grinstead-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grinstead 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shipp-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shipp 2000</LINK>). Successful VBAC in a subsequent pregnancy will also have economic benefits, with vaginal births costing the health system considerably less than caesarean sections (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petrou-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrou 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>We planned to include cluster-randomised trials identified in the searches in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. If cluster-randomised trials are included in future updates, we will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we will synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-08-09 16:02:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trials with nonreassuring fetal status not required prior to study entry</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bloom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 2006</LINK> reported a multicentre trial conducted in the USA (n = 5341), which enrolled nulliparous women with CTG monitoring in labour. All participants had a fetal pulse oximetry sensor placed and were then randomly allocated to the 'open' arm with fetal pulse oximetry values displayed or the 'masked' arm with fetal pulse oximetry values stored to computer disk and not displayed to the woman or clinician. These results were analysed separately from the other studies, as the study population, labouring women with a CTG, could not be considered in the same manner as those with a nonreassuring CTG (<I>see belo</I>w). The report included limited outcomes for a separate analysis of those with a nonreassuring CTG prior to study entry.The study reported by <LINK REF="STD-Caliskan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Caliskan 2009</LINK> enrolled women from 34 weeks' gestation undergoing induction of labour by oral misoprostol in Turkey. All participants had misoprostol administered and were then randomised to either intermittent fetal pulse oximetry + electronic fetal monitoring, or electronic fetal monitoring only.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trials with nonreassuring fetal status required prior to study entry</HEADING>
<P>The trial published by <LINK REF="STD-Garite-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 2000</LINK> was conducted in the United States of America (USA) and compared caesarean section rates for nonreassuring fetal status when conventional fetal monitoring (CTG) was used, versus when fetal pulse oximetry was used in addition to CTG, with reported data on 1010 cases. An unpublished report included some pilot data for a total of 1189 cases.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kuhnert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhnert 2004</LINK> reported a trial from Germany that compared operative birth and fetal scalp blood sampling for nonreassuring fetal status in two groups: those with CTG monitoring and those with fetal pulse oximetry added to the CTG, for a total of 146 cases. Fetal blood sampling (FBS) was required prior to study entry. Whilst not stated in the report, it is appropriate to consider that if the scalp pH was nonreassuring, intervention would have been undertaken to correct this or to deliver the baby prior to enrolment in the study. It can therefore be considered that this represents, at least in part, a different study population to that of the other studies.</P>
<P>A single-centre trial from the USA, reported by <LINK REF="STD-Klauser-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Klauser 2005</LINK>, included 327 women with gestation from 28 weeks onward. This study compared caesarean birth for nonreassuring fetal status in women with and without fetal pulse oximetry added to CTG monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Klauser-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Klauser 2005</LINK>). Interpretation of fetal heart rate monitoring is different in premature babies, compared with term babies. The report did not allow the reader to distinguish outcomes by gestational age. It may therefore be appropriate to consider that this represents a heterogenous population. This would make subsequent combination with other trials inappropriate.

<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Bloom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 2006</LINK> involved fetal pulse oximetry and cardiotocography in both of the study groups, with one group having the oximetry results displayed for clinical use and the other group having the oximetry results masked. For the purposes of this meta-analysis, the 'masked' group of this trial has been treated in this review as 'cardiotocography-only', since the fetal pulse oximetry values did not influence clinical decisions.</P>
<P>All trials were included, where outcome data were reported, in the meta-analysis to allow a comprehensive representation of the findings. The use of a summary measure of effect for some combinations of trials was appropriate. However, we did not use a summary measure of effect for combining all trials, as the appropriateness of combining studies with differing entry criteria and significant heterogeneity if separate analyses were not used, remained uncertain. For example, we created subcategories within analyses based on differing study entry characteristics/requirements: (i) gestation from 34 weeks, FBS not required prior to study entry; (ii) gestation from 36 weeks, FBS prior to study entry; and (iii) gestation from 28 weeks, FBS not required prior to study entry. We then reported the summary effect for each subgroup, rather than a combined summary effect for all studies. The subcategories could have been considered in terms of subgroup analyses, although the different study entry characteristics were not specified as subgroups a priori in the original protocol. The findings as presented in subcategories provide a good measure of clinical realities, although the possibility of converting these to subgroups may be considered in a future update of this review.</P>
<P>Inclusion of the trial reported by <LINK REF="STD-Valverde-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Valverde 2011</LINK> in the 2014 review update prompted careful deliberations related to whether or not to consider the fetal ECG + CTG group in the same manner as the CTG-only group used for the remaining studies.The latter may be a reasonable judgement, given that there is a lack of evidence of effect of adding fetal ECG, on caesarean section rates (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2013</LINK>). Adding the <LINK REF="STD-Valverde-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Valverde 2011</LINK> findings to the main analysis of the primary outcome, caesarean section, did not change the overall direction of the summary effect, although the I<SUP>2</SUP> test result did increase from 45% to 61%, making it likely that this heterogeneity was of some importance. In support of treating fetal ECG separately, withdrawal of fetal pulse oximetry and fetal ECG from a clinical service, as compared with their use in a research setting, has been reported to influence a rise in caesarean sections (<LINK REF="REF-Dokus-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dokus 2013</LINK>). On the balance of these considerations, a decision was made to create distinct comparison analyses for fetal ECG, rather than include the findings from <LINK REF="STD-Valverde-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Valverde 2011</LINK> in the initial meta-analysis and then attempt subgroup analysis.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-08-09 16:05:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-25 14:48:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When systematically reviewed, five of the seven published trials (with some unpublished data available), comparing fetal intrapartum pulse oximetry with CTG or fetal electrocardiography or masked fetal pulse oximetry, reported no difference in the overall caesarean section rate between the fetal pulse oximetry group and the CTG group. One smaller study did note a significant difference in favour of the fetal pulse oximetry plus CTG group. A study comparing fetal pulse oximetry plus CTG and fetal electrocardiography plus CTG reported less caesarean section births in the fetal electrocardiography plus CTG group.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of the four studies with nonreassuring fetal status from 34 weeks' gestation prior to randomisation demonstrated a reduction in caesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status, with no differences in neonatal outcomes. That is, a decision not to perform a caesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status in the fetal pulse oximetry group did not result in worse outcomes for those babies (but a larger sample would be required to demonstrate a difference in such low-prevalence outcomes). There were no between-group differences in caesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status when all participants in the largest study were considered, when analysed without consideration of fetal status at study entry.</P>
<P>The findings from more than 8000 participants provide substantial evidence to suggest that knowledge of fetal pulse oximetry values does not reduce overall caesarean section rates. However, several issues warrant consideration. Firstly, does the indication for caesarean section matter if the overall incidence of caesarean section is the same, given than there is limited support from the findings of this review, for the use of fetal pulse oximetry when used in the presence of a nonreassuring CTG, to reduce caesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status? An additional area of importance is whether or not the presence of a fetal oximetry sensor contributes to dystocia.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-06-27 08:49:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The decision pathway leading to performing a caesarean section may be important. The additional information that fetal pulse oximetry can provide, when a nonreassuring fetal heart rate trace has been identified, may translate to avoidance of a caesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status, with its associated stress levels for the mother and resource implications for the health service providers. An 'inevitable' caesarean section may still be performed for other indications, when the woman has had more time to consider her options. Staffing levels can also be adjusted over a number of hours, rather than the immediate and potentially costly provision of staff for an emergency operation. One trial reported that the addition of fetal pulse oximetry to CTG monitoring was cost effective in reducing operative birth for nonreassuring fetal status (<LINK REF="STD-East-2006" TYPE="STUDY">East 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women's reports of satisfaction with their labour and with fetal monitoring were similar when fetal pulse oximetry was added to CTG monitoring, compared to CTG monitoring alone. This is an important consideration, given that the use of technology may impact on women's perceived control over their labour experience (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2001</LINK>). Although an ideal study would compare women's satisfaction with fetal pulse oximetry and without any technology, such a study is not feasible. It can be considered, however, that once continuous CTG monitoring is in use during labour, the addition of fetal pulse oximetry technology does not adversely affect women's perceptions of their labour experience or of fetal monitoring overall. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcome has not been measured.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-06-03 15:04:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the evidence (for the primary outcomes) was of moderate to high quality. The impractical nature of blinding participants and clinicians in the intervention arm of each study was not viewed as something that could be overcome and was consistent across studies, meaning that any impact of this potential bias was essentially the same for each study. The findings from the smallest of the included studies (n = 146, <LINK REF="STD-Kuhnert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhnert 2004</LINK>) were considerably more positive for the primary outcome of caesarean section than was noted in any of the remaining studies. This inconsistency in findings is worthy of consideration when interpreting overall results. The addition in this update of another small study (n = 180, <LINK REF="STD-Valverde-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Valverde 2011</LINK>) resulted in an increase in caesarean section rates for those in the fetal pulse oximetry group, compared with CTG plus fetal ECG. Where meta-analysis was appropriate, there was considerable heterogeneity, even when using random-effects, meaning that larger sample sizes may be necessary to address the outcomes of interest.</P>

<P>The authors are not aware of potential biases that have not already been addressed through the rigorous methods adopted in this review in line with those of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. The search strategy is believed to be robust in its ability to identify all trials. The evaluation of the study that two of the review authors had conducted (CE and PB: <LINK REF="STD-East-2006" TYPE="STUDY">East 2006</LINK>) by an independent author (LB) in the 2007 update of this review aimed to minimise any potential reporting bias for that trial. </P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-08-09 16:05:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>European clinicians published guidelines for fetal pulse oximetry use (<LINK REF="REF-Kuhnert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhnert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saling-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saling 1996</LINK>) that were consistent with the management of fetal pulse oximetry in <LINK REF="STD-Garite-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 2000</LINK> and prior to its results being known. Only two small randomised controlled trials of fetal pulse oximetry have since been reported from Europe to test these guidelines (<LINK REF="STD-Kuhnert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhnert 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valverde-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Valverde 2011</LINK>). These trials reported divergent findings (an increase in one and decrease in the other) for overall caesarean section rates.</P>
<P>The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) reviewed the results of the trial reported by <LINK REF="STD-Garite-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 2000</LINK> and recommended further trials before the introduction of fetal pulse oximetry into clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2001</LINK>). Their recommendation was based mainly on the increase in dystocia reported with the use of fetal pulse oximetry and the potential to increase fetal monitoring costs without improving clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2001</LINK>). One trial reported that the addition of fetal pulse oximetry to cardiotocography was cost effective in reducing operative birth for nonreassuring fetal status (<LINK REF="STD-East-2006" TYPE="STUDY">East 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>When the findings of the first trials of fetal pulse oximetry became available, there was debate about why the incidence of caesarean section for dystocia more than doubled from 9% in the CTG-only group to 19% when fetal pulse oximetry was added. The investigators explored several possible causes for the increase in dystocia in the fetal pulse oximetry group, including potential mislabelling of dystocia and the presence of the oximetry sensor slowing the labour (<LINK REF="STD-Garite-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 2000</LINK>). The authors concluded that mislabelling of the indication for caesarean section had not occurred and the presence of the sensor did not result in a longer labour. They suggested that the nonreassuring CTG may indicate an underlying risk for dystocia (<LINK REF="STD-Garite-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 2000</LINK>). To test this hypothesis, <LINK REF="REF-Porreco-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porreco 2004</LINK> conducted a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study of fetal pulse oximetry in nulliparous labouring women, with a standardised labour management protocol and a specific focus on the management of dystocia (defined). The investigators concluded that the presence of persistent, progressive and moderate to severely nonreassuring CTGs may predict the need for birth by caesarean section for dystocia, despite adequate fetal oxygenation (<LINK REF="REF-Porreco-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porreco 2004</LINK>). No other trials in this systematic review demonstrated a difference in caesarean section for dystocia. However, the incidence of dystocia in each trial varied: from 11% in the fetal pulse oximetry group and 14% in the CTG-only group (<LINK REF="STD-East-2006" TYPE="STUDY">East 2006</LINK>) to 19% for all women in both the open and masked groups, where all participants had a fetal oximetry sensor placed (<LINK REF="STD-Bloom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 2006</LINK>), which was similar to that of the fetal pulse oximetry group of <LINK REF="STD-Garite-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 2000</LINK>.The incidence of dystocia was much lower in the study reported by <LINK REF="STD-Caliskan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Caliskan 2009</LINK> (2.6% in the fetal oximetry group and 3.4% in the CTG-only group). These researchers considered that the intermittent use of the fetal oximetry probe may have avoided an over representation of dystocia in the oximetry group. It remains possible that the presence of a fetal oximetry sensor alongside the fetal head contributes to dystocia.</P>
<P>The use of CTG has some parallels. Current clinical practice recommendations are that the clinician and the individual woman should consider the appropriateness of CTG to enable an informed choice for each case (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). Given the high quality of evidence from several of the reported fetal pulse oximetry trials and the reduction in caesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status (but not for overall caesarean section rates) in those for which a nonreassuring CTG was required prior to study entry, it may be prudent when developing recommendations to encourage the individual woman and her clinicians to make the decision to use or not use fetal pulse oximetry. Unlike CTG, however, the randomised controlled trials of fetal pulse oximetry have been conducted prior to widespread clinical acceptance and medico-legal expectation of fetal pulse oximetry usage where there is concern about fetal well-being.</P>
<P>Commercial availability of the fetal pulse oximetry system used in the studies was discontinued during 2006. Other systems that have not yet been subject to trials may still remain available commercially.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-08-09 16:05:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This systematic review, comparing fetal intrapartum pulse oximetry with CTG or fetal electrocardiography or masked fetal pulse oximetry, provided evidence of no effect on the overall caesarean section rate between the fetal pulse oximetry group and the CTG group. There was evidence of some effect in reducing caesarean section rates for the indication of nonreassuring CTG when fetal pulse oximetry was added to CTG. Therefore, the evidence suggests that fetal pulse oximetry does not contribute to overall clinical practice. A better method to evaluate fetal well-being in labour is required.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-21 06:48:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further trials could address: entry criteria related to the severity of nonreassuring CTG patterns; action levels for fetal pulse oximetry values, such as a decline by 10% or 20%, rather than an absolute cut-off value; and the endpoint of long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. The ideal study to address the issue of dystocia when a fetal pulse oximetry sensor is placed alongside the fetal head would compare caesarean section for dystocia in three groups: those with fetal oximetry displayed, those with fetal pulse oximetry masked and those without fetal pulse oximetry. Further studies using fetal oximetry sensors attached to the fetal scalp, rather than placed alongside the fetal head, could also be considered.</P>

<P>Three authors (C East, FY Chan, P Colditz) were chief investigators in the Australian multicentre randomised controlled trial of fetal intrapartum pulse oximetry (<LINK REF="STD-East-2006" TYPE="STUDY">East 2006</LINK>). That trial was supported in part by a research grant and equipment loan from Nellcor Inc, manufacturers of a fetal pulse oximetry system. An additional co-author who was not an investigator in that trial, L Begg, joined the review team to evaluate that trial for incorporation in the 2007 update of the review.</P>

<P>The 2010 and 2014 updates have incorporated the current standard methods used by the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group at the time, which have been modified since the original protocol was published (<LINK REF="REF-East-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2003</LINK>). In the 2014 update, the use of additional searching was discontinued, as the comprehensive search through the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group has identified every publication used in the successive updates of this review, with no additional studies identified in the additional searches.</P>
<P>For the planned subgroup analyses, we added lactate measurement as a parameter for fetal scalp blood sampling (following randomisation), given that this is often used instead of blood gas analysis in contemporary clinical practice.</P>

<P>Data were not available to allow subgroup analysis in this review by term/preterm. Similar numbers of term (total n = 195)/preterm (total n = 35) were randomised to the control and intervention groups, with the larger proportion being term in each group. There were similar neonatal outcomes (including birthweight and admission to NICU), both between the groups and compared with other studies enrolling over 36 weeks. We have therefore included these participants in the analyses of later gestations, renaming the analyses that include participants from this study as "... gestation from 34 weeks ...".</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The abstract states 'Use of fetal pulse oximetry with CTG decreased operative delivery (caesarean section, forceps, vacuum) for nonreassuring fetal status (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93) compared with CTG alone.'</P>
<P>The results text also states 'There was a statistically significant decrease in operative delivery (caesarean section, forceps or vacuum birth) for nonreassuring fetal status (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93). </P>
<P>But the results tables show a Relative Risk (Fixed) 95% CI 1.07 [0.95, 1.21]. Am I missing something, or has there been a mistake? </P>
<P>(Summary of comment from Jim Thornton, July 2006)</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>The data in the text are correct. The data quoted from the results table refer to the outcome 'operative delivery (caesarean section, forceps or vacuum birth)', which is for all indications; the data quoted in the text are for 'operative delivery (caesarean section, forceps or vacuum birth) for nonreassuring fetal status' and are correct.</P>
<P>To help clarify this, the outcome in the review now includes the wording 'for all indications'. </P>
