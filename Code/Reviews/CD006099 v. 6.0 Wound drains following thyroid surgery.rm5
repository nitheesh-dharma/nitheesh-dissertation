<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Drains are often used after thyroid operations.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>People who undergo thyroid surgery are thought to be at risk of respiratory distress, wound infections, excessive fluid accumulation and increased stay in hospital stay. Concerns about these complications lead surgeons to insert drains after the procedure. This review found no evidence of benefit in the use of drains for improving patient outcomes, but their use may be associated with an increased length of hospital stay. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-05-14 11:44:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The nature and indications for thyroid surgery vary and a perceived risk of haemorrhage post-surgery is one reason why wound drains are frequently inserted. However when a significant bleed occurs, wound drains may become blocked and the drain does not obviate the need for surgery or meticulous haemostasis. The evidence in support of the use of drains post-thyroid surgery is unclear therefore and a systematic review of the best available evidence was undertaken.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of inserting a wound drain during thyroid surgery, on wound complications, respiratory complications and mortality.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the following databases: Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 1, 2007); MEDLINE (2005 to February 2007); EMBASE (2005 to February 2007); CINAHL (2005 to February 2007) using relevant search strategies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Only randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. Quasi randomised studies were excluded. Studies with participants undergoing any form of thyroid surgery, irrespective of indications, were eligible for inclusion in this review. Studies involving people undergoing parathyroid surgery and lateral neck dissections were excluded. At least 80% follow up (till discharge) was considered essential.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies were assessed for eligibility and data were extracted by two authors independently, differences were resolved by discussion. Studies were assessed for validity including criteria on whether they used a robust method of random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Missing and unclear data were resolved by contacting the study authors. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-14 11:44:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>13 eligible studies were identified (1646 participants). 11 studies compared drainage with no drainage and found no significant difference in re-operation rates; incidence of respiratory distress and wound infections. Post-operative wound collections needing aspiration or drainage were significantly reduced by drains (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97), but a further analysis of the 4 high quality studies showed no significant difference (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.51 to 6.46). Hospital stay was significantly prolonged in the drain group (WMD 1.18 days, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.63).</P>
<P>Eleven studies compared suction drain with no drainage and found no significant difference in re-operation rates; incidence of respiratory distress and wound infection rates. The incidence of collections that required aspiration or drainage without formal re-operation was significantly less in the drained group (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92). However, further analysis of only high quality studies showed no significant difference (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.44 to 7.17). Hospital stay was significantly prolonged in the drain group (WMD 1.20 days, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.63).</P>
<P>One study compared open drain with no drain. No participant in either group required re-operation. No data were available regarding the incidence of respiratory distress, wound infection and pain. The incidence of collections needing aspiration or drainage without re-operation was not significantly different between the groups and there was no significant difference in length of hospital stay. One study compared suction drainage with passive closed drainage. None of the participants in the study needed re-operation and data regarding other outcomes were not available. Two studies (180 participants) compared open drainage with suction drainage. One study reported wound infections and minor wound collections, both were not significantly different. The other study reported wound collections requiring intervention and hospital stay; both were not significantly different. None of the participants in either study required re-operation. Data regarding other outcomes were not available.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no clear evidence that using drains in patients undergoing thyroid operations significantly improves patient outcomes and drains may be associated with an increased length of hospital stay. The existing evidence is from trials involving patients having goitres without mediastinal extension, normal coagulation indices and the operation not involving any lateral neck dissection for lymphadenectomy. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-14 11:51:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The prevalence of thyroid swellings (goitre) as measured either by palpation or ultrasound varies between 9.8% to 51.3% depending on age, sex (more common in females) and prevalence of iodine deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Brander-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brander 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knudsen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knudsen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riehl-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riehl 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teng 2002</LINK>). This may be due to benign conditions such as cyst, adenoma or iodine deficiency. Occasionally cancer of the thyroid can present as a goitre. A combination of clinical examination and investigations can assist in diagnosis. However removal of the goitre by surgery (thyroidectomy) is frequently used to achieve a definitive diagnosis. Goitres are also removed for cosmetic reasons.<BR/> <BR/>About 8,500 thyroid operations were done in England in the financial year ending 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-HES-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">HES 2006</LINK>). Benign diseases confined to one lobe such as cysts or adenoma are treated by hemi-thyroidectomy which consists of the removal of one lobe with the adjacent isthmus (<LINK REF="REF-Farquharson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquharson 2005</LINK>). The extent of thyroid surgery varies depending on indication and the experience of the surgeon (<LINK REF="REF-Affleck-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Affleck 2003</LINK>). A sub-total thyroidectomy is the removal of most of the anterior thyroid tissue leaving behind a posterior cuff of thyroid tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Shaheen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaheen 1997</LINK>) and is generally undertaken for benign indications such as Grave's disease and multinodular goitre. The amount of thyroid tissue left behind varies (<LINK REF="REF-Affleck-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Affleck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott_x002d_Coombes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott-Coombes 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaheen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaheen 1997</LINK>). A total thyroidectomy is the complete removal of the thyroid gland, whereas in near-total thyroidectomy about 2 to 4 gm of thyroid tissue is left behind (<LINK REF="REF-Affleck-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Affleck 2003</LINK>). Near-total and total thyroidectomy are usually recommended for malignant thyroid disease (<LINK REF="REF-Dackiw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dackiw 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott_x002d_Coombes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott-Coombes 2005</LINK>). However increasingly both these operations are being proposed for benign indications as well (<LINK REF="REF-Friguglietti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friguglietti 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rios-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rios 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Minimally Invasive Video Assisted Thyroidectomy (MIVAT) is a specialised technique which involves using special instruments to perform the thyroidectomy operation through a small incision. A video camera inserted through the incision displays the operative field on a monitor while the surgery is performed using special instruments. The main advantage is improved aesthetic appearance of the wound (<LINK REF="REF-Miccoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miccoli 2004</LINK>). The indications and controversies are outside the scope of this review. </P>
<P>People undergoing thyroid surgery are regarded as being particularly at risk of haematoma formation and consequent respiratory distress however the need for re-operation for haematoma varies between zero and 1.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Abbas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ardito-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ardito 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daou-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daou 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palestini-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palestini 2005</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Shaha-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaha 1994</LINK>). Most thyroid surgeons use drains postoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Willy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Willy 1998</LINK>) despite the low incidence of haematoma. </P>
<P>There are however strong arguments against the use of wound drains after thyroid surgery; they often become blocked by clotted blood (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1997</LINK>) and collections of blood or tissue fluid (seroma) can occur in spite of drains (<LINK REF="STD-Debry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Debry 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurtado_x002d_Lopez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurtado-Lopez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaha-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaha 1993</LINK>) In addition airway compromise can occur due to other causes such as nerve injury, laryngeal oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Hurtado_x002d_Lopez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurtado-Lopez 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mannell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martis-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martis 1971</LINK>) and inadvertent leakage of local anaesthetic onto the recurrent laryngeal nerves either by drains or during infiltration (<LINK REF="REF-Coress-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coress 2005</LINK>). Drains inserted in the peritoneal cavity have been shown to cause microscopic irritation (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1997</LINK>), and there is the potential for injury during insertion of the drain. Using drains can increase costs by prolonging hospital stay (<LINK REF="STD-Peix-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Peix 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoretsanitis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schoretsanitis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tubergen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tubergen 2001</LINK>). Drains can increase the infection rate (<LINK REF="REF-Karayacin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karayacin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tabaqchali-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabaqchali 1999</LINK>) and are associated with increased pain (<LINK REF="STD-Debry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Debry 1999</LINK>). Drain usage has been questioned in other areas such as colorectal (<LINK REF="REF-Urbach-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urbach 1999</LINK>), plastic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Collis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collis 2005</LINK>), vascular (<LINK REF="REF-Healy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healy 1989</LINK>) and orthopaedics (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2001</LINK>). The duration of drainage varies; the drain is either removed once it ceases to drain below a critical level (<LINK REF="STD-Ayyash-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ayyash 1991</LINK>) or after a fixed duration (<LINK REF="STD-Khanna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 2005</LINK>). This again may prolong hospital stay.</P>
<P>Once post operative wound collection occurs, the options are continued observation in the hope of gradual spontaneous resolution, needle aspiration and evacuation of wound collection under local or general anaesthesia. Collections which occur in the immediate post operative period are due to continued or delayed bleeding into wound. At this stage usually surgical intervention is required unless the bleeding is minimal. Later in the post operative course, tissue fluid can collect in the operated area and give rise to seroma. This can be aspirated with a needle or observed without any intervention. It is not clear whether drains decrease the incidence of either type of collections. </P>
<P>The nature of the drain used varies and surgical drains may be either open or closed. An open drain is when an artificial conduit is left in the wound to allow drainage of fluids to the exterior (outside the body), (examples of these are corrugated drain, Penrose drain and Yeates drain). A drain is said to be closed when an artificial conduit is left in the wound to allow drainage of fluids into a closed container. Suction may be applied by a closed drain (e.g. the Redon drain) or a closed drain may be passive (e.g. the Robinson drain). The use of any particular drain (open or closed) is based on surgeon preference. </P>
<P>Thyroid operations are classified as clean operations and are associated with low infection rates (<LINK REF="REF-Pino-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pino 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosato-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosato 2004</LINK>). Hence prophylactic antibiotic use is not recommended (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2006</LINK>), though it is used frequently (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2005</LINK>). Postoperative infections may still occur even when antibiotics are used and the wound drain has been identified as a possible source (<LINK REF="STD-De-Salvo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Salvo 1998</LINK>). Drains represent one of the risk factors in the development of nosocomial infections (<LINK REF="REF-Coello-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coello 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soleto-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soleto 2003</LINK>) which are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Okeke-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okeke 2005</LINK>)</P>
<P>In this review we seek to review the evidence regarding the use of drains in thyroid surgery.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were included in this review. Quasi-randomised trials in which there was inadequate generation of allocation sequence, for example, date of birth, hospital record number, alternation were excluded. Only studies with at least 80 percent follow up were included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>RCTs involving adults (greater than 18 years) undergoing any type of thyroid surgery (hemithyroidectomy, subtotal thyroidectomy, near total thyroidectomy. total thyroidectomy, MIVAT Minimally Invasive Video Assisted Thyroidectomy) irrespective of indication were included. Thyroid or parathyroid surgeries performed for parathyroid disorders were excluded since parathyroid surgery may involve varied and extensive amount of dissection depending on location of the parathyroid adenoma (<LINK REF="REF-Fredrickson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fredrickson 1998</LINK>). Lateral neck dissections (for lymphadenectomy in cancers) were excluded as these are more extensive operations and drains are necessary in this situation (<LINK REF="REF-Gavil_x00e1_n-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gavilán 2002</LINK>). </P>

<P>We performed the meta-analyses according to the recommendations of The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). We used the software package RevMan 4.2 provided by The Cochrane Collaboration. For dichotomous variables, we calculated the relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We used a random effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>). We estimated the quantity of heterogeneity I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). In the presence of significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> greater than 50%), we reported the random effects model, otherwise, we reported the fixed effect model. The trials were similar enough for an overall summary to be meaningful, hence we performed meta-analysis for all the outcomes where suitable data were available.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>We used an intention to treat analysis, when possible. (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>). If trials did not report an ITT analysis we adopted 'available case analysis' (that is, use the data available from the reports/ communication with the study authors) and did not impute any missing data for any of the outcomes.</P>
<P>We performed pre-specified subgroup analyses to explore the effects of aspects of methodological quality in order to compare the intervention effect in trials with adequate methodological quality to that in trials with unclear or inadequate methodological quality. Definition of a trial with adequate methodological quality was a trial which scored 'A" for all quality criteria except for blinding of participant and care provider (which would be difficult to achieve in practice). There is a possibility of bias (with respect to operating technique, surgeon and equipment used) if allocation was revealed anytime before insertion of drain hence we performed a subgroup analysis of trials where concealment of allocation was maintained right up to insertion of drain (i.e. just before closure of wound). There were insufficient studies to do a subgroup analysis of studies which included unilateral (hemithyroidectomy) operations only and those which included bilateral operations only (sub-total, near-total and total thyroidectomies). Another subgroup analysis, excluding trials containing re-operative thyroid surgeries, was not feasible due to insufficient number of studies. Antibiotic usage could not be analysed separately due to lack of sufficient studies.</P>

<P>42 references were identified by the search. Of these, 15 were prospective, randomised trials, 4 were duplicate references, and the rest were either clearly irrelevant or did not fulfil the criteria for a prospective randomised trial. One reference was identified by searching citations in included studies, however we were unable to obtain data from this study (<LINK REF="STD-Mok-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mok 1992</LINK>). A total of 13 randomised trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review; two trials which included parathyroid operations were excluded from the review (<LINK REF="STD-Ayyash-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ayyash 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kristoffersson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kristoffersson 1986</LINK>).

</B>
<BR/>One study was found (<LINK REF="STD-Hurtado_x002d_Lopez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurtado-Lopez 2001</LINK>) which had three comparison arms. For this comparison data reported for the open drain (Penrose drain) was compared with data reported for the no drain group (50 participants in each group). No patient in either group required reoperation and no data were available regarding the incidence of respiratory distress, wound infection and pain. The incidence of collections needing aspiration or drainage without re-operation was not significantly different between the groups (RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.60)(Analysis 03, outcome 01). There was no data on the incidence of minor collections not needing any intervention. There was a significant difference in length of hospital stay with the group having a drain inserted staying longer in hospital (WMD 0.6 days, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.92)(Analysis 03, outcome 02).<BR/>

Both were not significantly different. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Hurtado_x002d_Lopez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hurtado-Lopez 2001</LINK>) reported wound collections requiring intervention (RR 0.67, 95%CI 0.12 to 3.82; Analysis 04, outcome 02) and hospital stay (WMD 0.22 days 95%CI -0.25 to 0.69; Analysis 04, outcome 04); both were not significantly different. Due to different reported outcomes, the two studies could not be combined. None of the patients in either study required reoperation. Data regarding other outcomes were not available. </P>
<P>There was minimal asymmetry in funnel plot of study size against treatment effect, suggesting lack of publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). However the trials are small and few in number.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Drains are used widely in thyroid surgery, in spite of the lack of clear benefit. In our meta-analysis we could find no evidence of a benefit associated with using drains as measured by outcomes such as reoperation rates, incidence of respiratory distress and wound collections. The event rates for the important outcomes such as re-operation rates and incidence of respiratory distress are low, consistent with previous large series (<LINK REF="REF-Ardito-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ardito 1999</LINK>). The number of participants in individual trials are low. None of the studies reported the statistical power of the study to detect such small differences. It is hence possible that even after meta analysis, a small benefit or harm is being missed. Previous meta analyses have found no difference in complications rates (<LINK REF="REF-Corsten-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corsten 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanabria-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanabria 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pothier-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pothier 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>All the studies excluded patients with lateral neck dissections and patients with coagulation disorders. Some of the studies excluded patients with Grave's disease, large goitres and substernal goitres and therefore we emphasise that the results of this review do not necessarily apply to such patient groups. However for patients undergoing thyroid surgery where there is no mediastinal involvement or additional lateral neck dissection, there is no evidence of benefit from drains, and it would seem safe not to drain these wounds. However the excluded categories need to be examined in future trials.</P>
<P>There are obviously concerns that whilst a policy of not draining is safe, it may lead to more wound collections due to blood or tissue fluids. However we found that the incidence of wound collections was not significantly different between the groups. Assessment of post operative wound collections is variable. Some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tubergen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tubergen 2001</LINK>) using ultrasound, show a high frequency of fluid accumulation, attesting to the sensitivity of ultrasound. Apart from being operator dependent, there are no standards for defining normal from abnormal collections in terms of quantity. Very few of these are clinically significant, as on follow up most disappear. On the other hand clinical assessment is subject to bias. Even if assessor blinding is used, it is difficult to conceal the group allocation in case of drain insertion. It is also not clear as to the effect of post operative collections. While not necessarily needing intervention, they may still affect patient comfort and wound healing. Hence reporting of patient's satisfaction using validated scores would be more useful.</P>
<P>While most studies reported complications, respiratory distress as a specific complication was reported only in some of the trials. This is important as this is one of the main reasons for drain insertion. However there are other causes for respiratory distress such as nerve injury and vocal cord oedema. This could affect reporting of this outcome, as the presence of drains can give a false sense of security and hence affect surgeon's opinion as to cause of respiratory distress. Future trials need to specifically report all cases of respiratory distress irrespective of the cause.</P>
<P>Hospital stay was found to be significantly prolonged in patients who had drains. However the weighted mean difference was only 1.18 days (95% CI 0.74 to 1.63). It is not clear from this meta-analysis as to whether drains affect wound infection rates as there was no evidence of a significant difference between drainage and non drainage groups in terms of infection. As thyroid surgery is a clean operation, wound infection rates are low. There are no patient satisfaction scores reported in any of the study. Hence it is not clear whether drains, especially, when they exit at a separate site, have any adverse effect on the final cosmetic appearance.</P>
<P>We are unable to say what is the optimum drain, in cases where a drain is considered necessary by the surgeon. The number of trials in the other comparisons such as 'suction drain compared with passive closed drain', 'open drain compared with no drain' and 'suction drain compared with open drain' were between one and two, and hence no conclusions could be drawn. </P>
<P>Similar outcomes are obtained whether wound drains are provided or not during thyroid surgery. However hospital stay was significantly prolonged when patients received wound drains.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no obvious significant advantage associated with using wound drains after common thyroid operations (unilateral and bilateral), in patients where no lateral neck dissection is performed, with no extension of the thyroid into sub-sternal space and normal coagulation indices. Drains prolong hospital stay and absence of drains may facilitate the rapid discharge of patients after thyroidectomy. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There remains a great deal of uncertainty around the estimates of the effects of wound drainage after thyroid surgery. Further larger trials are required in patients undergoing resections for large goitres and those with sub-sternal extensions, comparing drains versus no drains. Larger trials reporting patient indices such as pain and satisfaction with wound appearance are required. Validated clinical measures for outcomes such as postoperative excessive wound collections should be used, rather than ultrasound, as ultrasound detects a large number of clinically insignificant collections. All occurrences of respiratory distress should be specifically reported along with the underlying cause. Trials should be conducted and reported according to CONSORT guidelines. Primary outcome should still be respiratory distress and re-operation rates, as these are still the major complications following a thyroid operation. However with more centres discharging patients earlier, readmission rates and re intervention rates should be reported in future trials. </P>
