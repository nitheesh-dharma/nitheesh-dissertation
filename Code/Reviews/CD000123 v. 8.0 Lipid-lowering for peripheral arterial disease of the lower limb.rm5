<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Lipid-lowering for peripheral arterial disease of the lower limb</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Atheroma (fatty deposits) in the walls of the arteries to the legs can lead to peripheral arterial disease with insufficient blood flow to the muscles and other tissues. People with peripheral arterial disease often do not have symptoms. The most common symptom is intermittent claudication, which is characterised by leg pain and weakness brought on by walking, with disappearance of the symptoms following a brief rest. Lipid-lowering therapies may reduce cardiovascular events and worsening of local disease for people with lower limb peripheral arterial disease. They are recommended to people with coronary artery disease, for prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke. </P>
<P>Eighteen randomised controlled trials were included in the review, involving a total of 10,049 participants (78% were men) from seven different countries. The trials compared lipid-lowering therapy with placebo or usual treatment for at least 90 days. They differed considerably in the inclusion criteria, outcomes measured, and type of lipid-lowering therapy used. Lipid-lowering therapies improved walking distance. The effect of lipid-lowering therapy on death from any cause in people with peripheral artery disease was inconclusive. Using drugs to lower blood lipids had a beneficial effect on the incidence of total cardiovascular events, due primarily to an overall reduction in coronary events (OR 0.8; 95% Confidence Interval 0.7 to 0.9). The only type of drug for which consistent, clear evidence of a beneficial effect on total cardiovascular events, total coronary events and stroke was available, was the statins. The greatest evidence was with simvastatin in people with a blood cholesterol level of at least 3.5 mmol/litre. The evidence on side effects was inconclusive in these trials.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-27 12:06:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Eighteen trials were included, involving a total of 10,049 participants. Trials differed considerably in their inclusion criteria, outcomes measured, and type of lipid-lowering therapy used. Only one trial (PQRST) reported a <I>detrimental</I> effect of active treatment on blood lipid/lipoprotein levels.</P>
<P>The pooled results from all eligible trials indicated that lipid-lowering therapy had no statistically significant effect on overall mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.86; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.50) or on total cardiovascular events (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.09). However, subgroup analysis which excluded PQRST showed that lipid-lowering therapy significantly reduced the risk of total cardiovascular events (OR 0.74; CI 0.55 to 0.98). This was primarily due to a positive effect on total coronary events (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87). Greatest evidence of effectiveness came from the use of simvastatin in people with a blood cholesterol &#8805; 3.5 mmol/litre (HPS).</P>
<P>Pooling of the results from several small trials on a range of different lipid-lowering agents indicated an improvement in total walking distance (Mean Difference (MD) 152 m; 95% CI 32.11 to 271.88) and pain-free walking distance (WMD 89.76 m; 95% CI 30.05 to 149.47) but no significant impact on ankle brachial index (WMD 0.04; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.09).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Lipid-lowering therapy is effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in people with PAD. It may also improve local symptoms. Until further evidence on the relative effectiveness of different lipid-lowering agents is available, use of a statin in people with PAD and a blood cholesterol level &#8805; 3.5 mmol/litre is most indicated.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-27 12:07:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the legs is caused by atheroma (fatty deposits) in the walls of the arteries leading to insufficient blood flow to the muscles and other tissues. Patients with PAD may have symptoms but are often asymptomatic. The commonest symptom, intermittent claudication, is characterised by leg pain and weakness brought on by walking, with disappearance of the symptoms following a brief rest. Approximately 1.5% of people over 50 years of age have a diagnosis of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (predominantly intermittent claudication). A further 3% have undiagnosed intermittent claudication and even more (approximately 11%) have asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients diagnosed as having lower limb PAD, including those who are asymptomatic, have an increased risk of mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Dormandy--1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormandy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heald-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heald 2006</LINK>). Relative risks are two to three times that of age and sex matched groups without PAD. Thus PAD provides a potential opportunity for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, patients with claudication can have a significantly reduced quality of life due to their restricted mobility (<LINK REF="REF-Dumville-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumville 2004</LINK>). Careful consideration therefore needs to be given to evidence on drug and lifestyle management of claudication itself so that patients can achieve optimum mobility and quality of life within the limitations of their condition.</P>
<P>This review addresses the question of whether or not lipid-lowering therapy, which has been shown to be of benefit for secondary prevention in coronary artery disease patients (<LINK REF="REF-SSS-Study-Group-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">SSS Study Group 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sacks-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacks 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LIPID-Study-Group" TYPE="REFERENCE">LIPID Study Group</LINK>), is effective in reducing the incidence of subsequent cardiovascular events in people with PAD. The impact of lipid-lowering therapy on local disease progression and symptoms of PAD (assessed by maximum and pain-free walking distance) is also considered.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effect of lipid-lowering therapy on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events and local disease progression in patients with lower limb PAD.<BR/> </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of trials</HEADING>
<P>Three authors (PPA, HM and RJ) selected potential trials and assessed their eligibility for inclusion in the update of this review. Any disagreements were resolved by a fourth author (JP).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of trial quality</HEADING>
<P>The quality of included trials was assessed for both allocation concealment and for internal and external validity using a standard scoring sheet developed by the PVD Group. For each included trial, information was collected on the method of randomisation, blinding and whether an intention-to-treat analysis had been done. For this update, three authors (PPA, HM and RJ) assessed trial quality and the results were cross-checked by JP.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>For this update PPA , HM and RJ independently extracted data and discrepancies were resolved in discussion with a fourth author (JP). We sought additional information to that appearing in published reports from the principal investigators when required.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Homogeneity between trial results was tested subjectively by clinical judgment of differences in patient populations, interventions and outcome assessments, and objectively using appropriate statistical tests. Where appropriate, trial results were pooled using relevant statistical techniques. We performed subgroup analyses for all trials excluding those reported as having a detrimental effect on lipid/lipoprotein parameters. We performed further subgroup analyses for trials with only the highest quality assessment and for trials confined to a single class of lipid-lowering therapy. Although publication bias could not be excluded, there proved to be an insufficient number of trials for each outcome to assess this formally.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-10-27 11:59:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>In the original version of this review there were seven included studies and two excluded studies. We identified 62 new trials, of which 49 were excluded. In addition, we excluded two trials included in the original review (<LINK REF="STD-CLAS" TYPE="STUDY">CLAS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1975</LINK>). The former trial was excluded because participants included were not only those suffering from lower limb atherosclerosis but also unaffected subjects. The trial by Davis et al was excluded because only subjective symptom changes were reported and newer trials provide an increased quantity of evidence on objective measures. For additional information on excluded studies, <I>see </I>
<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>No studies were excluded from the review purely due to poor methods, but the results of methodological quality scoring were used to exclude trials from subgroups in the meta-analysis. Four trials are awaiting further assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Borreani-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Borreani 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Degni-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Degni 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Stefano-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Di Stefano 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2001</LINK>). Despite many attempts, two references have proved to be unobtainable (<LINK REF="STD-Degni-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Degni 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Stefano-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Di Stefano 1984</LINK>); the remaining two require detailed translation (<LINK REF="STD-Borreani-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Borreani 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2001</LINK>) (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>).</P>
<P>A total of 13 new studies involving a total of 10,049 subjects were included in this update, including one previously ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-LEADER" TYPE="STUDY">LEADER</LINK>). The number of subjects participating in each study ranged from 19 to 6748.</P>
<P>The earliest study was published in 1973 (<LINK REF="STD-Nye-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Nye 1973</LINK>) and the most recent with relevant results in 2007 (<LINK REF="STD-HPS" TYPE="STUDY">HPS</LINK>). Eight studies were from Italy, three from the UK, and three from Cuba. The remaining studies were from USA, The Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden. Except for the <LINK REF="STD-LEADER" TYPE="STUDY">LEADER</LINK> trial, which was confined to men, there was no sex restriction. Men constituted 78% of the total number of study participants (n=7832). Duration of follow up ranged from 20 days to five years.</P>
<P>Trials differed in the criteria they used to define peripheral arterial disease of the lower limb (PAD) in trial participants. The majority used a combination of clinical symptoms (predominantly intermittent claudication) with or without confirmation using objective tests such as Doppler ultrasound, treadmill tests and/or angiography.</P>
<P>In the Nye study (<LINK REF="STD-Nye-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Nye 1973</LINK>) and HPS (<LINK REF="STD-HPS" TYPE="STUDY">HPS</LINK>), patients who had undergone surgery for PAD were also included. <LINK REF="STD-HPS" TYPE="STUDY">HPS</LINK> used a broad definition for PAD, including subjects with intermittent claudication, any peripheral revascularization procedure, or aortic aneurysm. Patients with diabetes and treated hypertension were also included in HPS but were excluded in some other studies. The <LINK REF="STD-LEADER" TYPE="STUDY">LEADER</LINK> trial used the Edinburgh Claudication questionnaire to identify PAD.</P>
<P>Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-HPS" TYPE="STUDY">HPS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LEADER" TYPE="STUDY">LEADER</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mondillo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mondillo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PQRST" TYPE="STUDY">PQRST</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-Thomas_x0027_-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">St Thomas' Trial</LINK>) used minimum blood lipid and/or lipoprotein levels as inclusion criteria; one trial used a maximum LDL cholesterol level of &#8804; 4.14 mmol/l (<LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>All studies were on drug interventions except one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>) which used fish oil. The majority investigated a single drug against placebo and/or usual treatment. Three of these were on statins; two on simvastatin (<LINK REF="STD-HPS" TYPE="STUDY">HPS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mondillo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mondillo 2003</LINK>), and one on atorvastatin (<LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK>); one on probucol, (probucol and cholestyramine versus cholestyramine alone) (<LINK REF="STD-PQRST" TYPE="STUDY">PQRST</LINK>); one on beta pyridil (<LINK REF="STD-Nye-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Nye 1973</LINK>); one on bezafibrate (<LINK REF="STD-LEADER" TYPE="STUDY">LEADER</LINK>); two on policosanol (fatty alcohol) (<LINK REF="STD-Castano-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Castano 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Castano-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castano 2001</LINK>); and seven on sulodexide (a glycosaminoglycan with lipid-lowering properties) (<LINK REF="STD-Bonalumi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bonalumi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caramelli-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Caramelli 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coccheri-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Coccheri 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corsi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Corsi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cospite-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cospite 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liguori-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Liguori 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmieri-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Palmieri 1984</LINK>).

<P>Methodological quality was assessed using the following criteria and in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK>).</P>

<P>For each criterion of internal validity, we graded studies as low risk of bias (A) if they fully met the criterion, moderate risk (B) if they partly met the criterion and high risk (C) if they failed to meet the criterion. Overall quality of each study was rated as A if the study scored A in all criteria, B if one or more of the criteria scored B and C if one or more of the criteria scored C. A detailed breakdown of the scoring is shown in the table of methodological quality assessment of included studies (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Information on provider blindness to the assignment status and observer variation in outcome measurements was not available for the included studies and therefore these quality criteria were not assessed in the review. Loss to follow up was also not used for quality assessment, as it was difficult to grade, but is described in the table of methodological quality assessment. External validity was also assessed by clear definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as outcome reported but this was not used in the overall grading of studies.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-10-27 12:07:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Trials comparing lipid-lowering therapy with placebo and/or usual treatment for at least 90 days were included in meta-analysis. There were insufficient trials comparing one lipid-lowering therapy with another to enable pooling.</P>
<P>Many of the data on all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events were obtained from information given on reasons for participant withdrawal from the trial, rather than forming a primary and prespecified outcome measure. In such cases, studies were generally under-powered to investigate these outcomes. In many trials fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events were reported separately and it was not clear whether only the first event was recorded for a given individual. Therefore, where cardiovascular event rates were created by adding together fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events for the purposes of pooling results from different trials, it is possible that subjects with both a fatal and a non-fatal event have been counted twice.</P>
<P>The included studies were not necessarily statistically diverse on tests of heterogeneity but were clinically varied. Therefore, we pooled results using a random-effects model for meta-analysis. We performed subgroup analyses excluding (i) those studies graded as having a high or moderate risk of bias and (ii) the PQRST trial, which had an adverse effect on lipoprotein profile (HDL cholesterol was reduced by 24% in those on probucol). We also performed subgroup analyses of studies using the same class of lipid-lowering therapy for every outcome wherever possible. Only three classes of drugs - statins, policosanol and sulodexide (the latter for walking distance only), were tested in more than one trial and were therefore subject to this sub-group analysis</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. All-cause mortality (Analysis 01/01)</HEADING>
<P>Information on all-cause mortality was reported in only six studies, of which three (<LINK REF="STD-Castano-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Castano 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Castano-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Castano 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nye-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Nye 1973</LINK>) were not designed to look at this outcome.</P>
<P>The pooled result from all six studies indicated that there was no statistically significant effect of lipid-lowering therapy on all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.50, P = 0.60). Exclusion of PQRST from the analysis did not change this finding (OR 0.92; CI 0.54 to 1.57, P = 0.75). The result was similar when additional studies with high or moderate risk of bias were excluded (OR 0.84; CI 0.36 to 1.96, P = 0.68).</P>
<P>In a pooled subgroup analysis of the two small Castano studies of policosanol versus placebo a lower risk of all-cause mortality among those treated with policosanol was not statistically significant (OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.71, P = 0.14).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(a) Total cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal) Analysis 01/02</HEADING>
<P>A total of eight studies were included in this analysis, including the large PAD subgroup of the HPS study. On pooling the results of all studies, treatment was associated with a non-significant reduction in the risk of total cardiovascular events (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.08, P = 0.14). The <LINK REF="STD-HPS" TYPE="STUDY">HPS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LEADER" TYPE="STUDY">LEADER</LINK> trials contributed 53% and 30% of the weight to this result respectively. The pooled result was similar when all studies with moderate or high risk of bias were excluded (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07, P = 0.12). However, when the PQRST trial alone was excluded, the reduction in risk was statistically significant (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98, P = 0.04).</P>
<P>Two studies investigated the effects of statins on total cardiovascular events (simvastatin 40 mg daily in <LINK REF="STD-HPS" TYPE="STUDY">HPS</LINK> and atorvastatin either 10 mg or 80 mg daily in <LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK>). The total number of participants was 7002 (95% in the HPS). A pooled subgroup analysis of these two studies demonstrated a statistically significant lower risk of a cardiovascular event among those taking HMG CO A lipid-lowering therapy compared with placebo (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.82, P &lt; 0.00001). Since one third of the patients in HPS had undergone coronary or peripheral vascular surgery, it is possible that the effect of simvastatin on this group may differ from those without such co-morbidity or advanced disease.</P>

<P>Of the eight studies which reported on total cardiovascular events, one did not distinguish between fatal and non-fatal events (<LINK REF="STD-HPS" TYPE="STUDY">HPS</LINK>) and one other gave only non-fatal cardiovascular events as a separate category (<LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK>). Therefore, only six studies were available for pooled analysis on this outcome, the result of which was heavily influenced by the <LINK REF="STD-LEADER" TYPE="STUDY">LEADER</LINK> trial (giving over 93% of the weight to the overall pooled result). There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of a fatal cardiovascular event between the treatment and placebo groups when all six studies were pooled (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.33, P = 0.81), nor when <LINK REF="STD-PQRST" TYPE="STUDY">PQRST</LINK> was excluded (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35, P = 0.87), nor when additional studies with moderate or high risk of bias were excluded (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.43, P = 0.89).</P>

No major side effects were experienced in subjects taking essential fatty acid supplements (<LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>). Betapyridyl carbinol produced gastrointestinal symptoms in seven out of the 23 patients at a dosage of 1800 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Nye-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Nye 1973</LINK>), but only three patients were unable to tolerate 1200 mg daily. In addition, two male patients developed liver toxicity in response to treatment. No major side effects were noted in patients receiving probucol therapy (<LINK REF="STD-PQRST" TYPE="STUDY">PQRST</LINK>). However, a reduction in the beneficial HDL cholesterol levels may be interpreted as an adverse reaction in those on probucol.

<P>The Heart Protection Study reported that there was no increase in the incidence of cancer associated with simvastatin, except for a slight increase in the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer (<LINK REF="STD-HPS" TYPE="STUDY">HPS</LINK>). The authors noted however that the incidence of this skin cancer did not increase with prolonged treatment, arguing against a causal relationship.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-24 15:23:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Thirteen additional studies were included in this first major update compared with the original version of the review . This was due to the results of studies still in progress at the time of the original review becoming available and an improved search facility which identified earlier studies (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Palmieri-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Palmieri 1984</LINK>) as well as the completion of new relevant trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Differences in included studies compared with original review</HEADING>
<P>Compared with the original review, this update included two studies on statins: the Heart Protection Study which used simvastatin 40 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-HPS" TYPE="STUDY">HPS</LINK>) and a smaller study by Mohler (<LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK>) using atorvastatin 10 mg or 80 mg daily. Other groups of drugs which were added included sulodexide and policosanol, although these drugs are not currently listed as lipid-lowering drugs in the British National Formulary (<LINK REF="REF-BNF" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF</LINK>).</P>
<P>Compared with studies included in the original review, the largest study added to this update used a wider definition of peripheral arterial disease (<LINK REF="STD-HPS" TYPE="STUDY">HPS</LINK>). Of 6748 participants with a history of PAD, around one third had undergone previous peripheral arterial surgery, which included aortic revascularization procedures and aneurysm repair, angioplasty or a previous amputation (2%). We were unable to obtain the results of the HPS excluding those with aortic disease from the trial investigators. The Nye study (<LINK REF="STD-Nye-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Nye 1973</LINK>) , which was included in the original version of the review, also included some patients who had undergone peripheral arterial surgery in its study population. We had pre-specified for this review that studies of lipid lowering solely in post-procedural patients with PAD would be excluded, in part because these trials are concerned with re-stenosis or procedure failure rates rather than long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, we made the decision to include studies with a mix of symptomatic and post-procedural subjects due to the likely similar underlying pathology and consistency in outcomes measured with other included trials.</P>
<P>In terms of aortic disease, most of the included studies did not mention aortic disease or surgery in their inclusion or exclusion criteria. It was therefore decided to omit the clause 'aortic disease' from the exclusion criteria used in the original version of the review (which was originally intended to exclude entire studies on aortic disease).</P>
<P>In contrast with the original review, the CLAS study (<LINK REF="STD-CLAS" TYPE="STUDY">CLAS</LINK>) was excluded from this update because participants included not only those suffering from lower limb atherosclerosis but also unaffected subjects. <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1975</LINK> was also excluded because only subjective symptom changes were reported and newer trials provide an increased quantity of evidence on objective measures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Studies which did not suggest a favourable effect on outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Overall, the vast majority of individual trials suggested a favourable effect on outcomes although only some of these were statistically significant. Exceptions to this were the studies by Mohler (<LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK>), Gans (<LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>) and the <LINK REF="STD-LEADER" TYPE="STUDY">LEADER</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PQRST" TYPE="STUDY">PQRST</LINK> trials. It is worth noting that the study by Mohler (<LINK REF="STD-Mohler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohler 2003</LINK>) was not designed to detect all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events and relatively few such events were recorded in either the treatment or placebo groups. <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK> suggested a reduction in walking distance on active treatment (fish oil), but results were not statistically significant.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-PQRST" TYPE="STUDY">PQRST</LINK> trial was not designed to detect fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events but to assess disease progression measured by femoral angiography. Results showed that probucol (in addition to existing cholestyramine treatment) did not impact on femoral atherosclerosis. Probucol was found to have an adverse effect on the lipid profile in participants assigned active treatment. Thus, plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was decreased by as much as 24% in the probucol group compared with those on placebo. The authors concluded that very low levels of HDL in probucol treated patients possibly counteracted the observed beneficial effect of treatment on plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol level . Probucol is currently not listed as a lipid-lowering drug in the British National Formulary (<LINK REF="REF-BNF" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-LEADER" TYPE="STUDY">LEADER</LINK> trial was designed to detect the combined incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke (fatal and non-fatal) as its primary outcome and separate fatal and non-fatal coronary and stroke events as secondary outcomes. Bezafibrate did not reduce the incidence of fatal events but did reduce the incidence of non-fatal coronary events. In post-hoc subanalysis, bezafibrate also decreased total coronary events (RR 0.13; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.56) among those aged under 65 years. Several factors need to be taken into account in interpreting the result of the <LINK REF="STD-LEADER" TYPE="STUDY">LEADER</LINK> trial, which heavily influenced the pooled results on fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in this review. Firstly, there was an increased use of statins in the placebo group; more subjects from the placebo group (109 out of 403 subjects) compared with those on active treatment (42 out of 369) withdrew because they were prescribed lipid-lowering therapy (predominantly a statin). Secondly, the primary outcome measure of combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events did not reach the level required by the author's sample size calculation; it was estimated that 33% of the placebo group would develop a primary end-point during four years follow up whereas the actual observed event rate was 20.4%. Although bezafibrate improved the blood lipid profile of participants (reducing plasma total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and increasing high density lipoprotein cholesterol), it was also reported that bezafibrate increased plasma homocysteine concentrations, which may be a risk factor for vascular diseases in high concentrations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The effect of lipid-lowering therapy on all-cause mortality in people with PAD was inconclusive, probably due to lack of large scale and long duration trials measuring this outcome. However, lipid-lowering therapy had a beneficial effect on the incidence of total cardiovascular events due primarily to a reduction in coronary events. Lipid-lowering therapy also improved walking distance. There was insufficient evidence to compare the effectiveness of different lipid-lowering regimens. However, the only class of drug for which consistent and statistically significant evidence of a beneficial effect on total cardiovascular events, total coronary events and stroke was available, was the statins. This evidence came from the HPS, in which simvastatin was assigned to subjects with PAD and a random blood total cholesterol level of at least 3.5 mmol/l. As such, lipid-lowering therapy with a statin is recommended for patients with peripheral arterial disease and total cholesterol levels &gt; 3.5 mmol/l.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research is indicated to compare the relative effectiveness of different lipid-lowering therapies in people with PAD. However, because of increasing use of statins in clinical practice, the opportunities to undertake such trials may be limited. Because of the relatively large number of people with asymptomatic PAD (detected for instance using measures of ankle brachial index), research into the effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy in such subjects should be considered. </P>

<P>This was a 2 year randomised controlled trial of gamma-linolenic acid and eicosapenataenoic acid in 120 patients with intermittent claudication.
