<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-10 21:27:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>†<BR/>Schizophrenia is a serious, chronic and relapsing mental illness with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about one per cent. Schizophrenia is characterised by 'positive' symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions and 'negative' symptoms such as emotional numbness and withdrawal. One quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. Half do have a recurrent illness but with long episodes of considerable recovery from the positive symptoms. The overall cost of the illness to the individual, their carers and the community is considerable.</P>
<P>Antipsychotic medications are classified into typical and atypical drugs. First generation or 'typical' antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been the mainstay of treatment, and are effective in reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but negative symptoms are fairly resistant to treatment. In addition, drug treatments are associated with adverse effects which can often compromise compliance with medication and therefore increase the incidences of relapse.</P>
<P>People who do not respond adequately to antipsychotic medication are sometimes given the 'atypical' antipsychotic drug clozapine, which has been found to be effective for some people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine is also associated with having fewer movement disorders than chlorpromazine, but may induce life-threatening decreases in white blood cells (agranulocytosis). We reviewed the affects of clozapine in people with schizophrenia compared with typical antipsychotic drugs drugs.</P>
<P>This review supports the notion that clozapine is more effective than typical antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia in general, and for those who do not improve on typical antipsychotic drugs in particular. Clozapine is associated with less movement adverse effects than typical antipsychotic drugs, but it may cause serious blood-related adverse effects. White blood cell count monitoring is mandatory for all people taking clozapine. There is a worry, however, that studies are - at the very least - moderately prone to bias favouring clozapine. Better conduct and reporting of trials could greatly have increased our confidence in the results.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-06 13:56:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Long-term drug treatment of schizophrenia with typical antipsychotic drugs has limitations: 25 to 33% of sufferers have illnesses that are treatment resistant. Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug, which is claimed to have superior efficacy and to cause fewer motor adverse effects than typical drugs for people with treatment-resistant illnesses. Clozapine carries a significant risk of serious blood disorders, which necessitates mandatory weekly blood monitoring at least during the first months of treatment.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-07 14:19:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bethany  L York">
<P>We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, based on a fixed-effect model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed-effect model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-06 13:55:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have included 52 trials (4746 participants) in this review. Forty-four of the included studies are less than 13 weeks in duration, and, overall, trials were at a significant risk of bias. We found no significant difference in the effects of clozapine and typical neuroleptic drugs for broad outcomes such as mortality, ability to work or suitability for discharge at the end of the study. Clinical improvements were seen more frequently in those taking clozapine (n=1119, 14 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.7 to 0.8, NNT 6 CI 5 to 8). Also, participants given clozapine had fewer relapses than those on typical antipsychotic drugs (n=1303, RR 0.62 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 21 CI 15 to 49). BPRS scores showed a greater reduction of symptoms in clozapine-treated participants, (n=1205, 17 RCTs, WMD -3.79 CI -4.9 to -2.7), although the data were heterogeneous (<SUP> </SUP>I<SUP>2</SUP>=69%). Short-term data from the SANS negative symptom scores favoured clozapine (n=196, 6 RCTs, WMD -7.21 CI -8.9 to -5.6). We found clozapine to be more acceptable in long-term treatment than conventional antipsychotic drugs (n=982, 6 RCTs, RR 0.60 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 15 CI 12 to 20). Blood problems occurred more frequently in participants receiving clozapine (3.2%) compared with those given typical antipsychotic drugs (0%) (n=1031, 13 RCTs, RR 7.09 CI 2.0 to 25.6). Clozapine participants experienced more drowsiness, hypersalivation or temperature increase, than those given conventional neuroleptics. However, those receiving clozapine experienced fewer motor adverse effects (n=1495, 19 RCTs, RR 0.57 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 5 CI 4 to 6).</P>
<P>The clinical effects of clozapine were more pronounced in participants resistant to typical neuroleptics in terms of clinical improvement (n=370, 4 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.6 to 0.8, NNT 4 CI 3 to 6) and symptom reduction. Thirty-four per cent of treatment-resistant participants had a clinical improvement with clozapine treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-06 13:57:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clozapine may be more effective in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia, producing clinically meaningful improvements and postponing relapse, than typical antipsychotic drugs - but data are weak and prone to bias. Participants were more satisfied with clozapine treatment than with typical neuroleptic treatment. The clinical effect of clozapine, however, is, at least in the short-term, not reflected in measures of global functioning such as ability to leave the hospital and maintain an occupation. The short-term benefits of clozapine have to be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. Within the context of trials, the potentially dangerous white blood cell decline seems to be more frequent in children and adolescents and in the elderly than in young adults or people of middle age.</P>
<P>The existing trials have largely neglected to assess the views of participants and their families on clozapine. More community-based long-term randomised trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of clozapine on global and social functioning as trials in special groups such as people with learning disabilities.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-06 15:12:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Arguably, the psychopharmacology of schizophrenia has witnessed two major discoveries, the discovery of chlorpromazine and of clozapine. The discovery of chlorpromazine was followed by the introduction of a large family of drugs that are now known as 'typical neuroleptics' or 'first generation antipsychotic drugs'. The putative finding that clozapine is effective in people who have treatment-resistant schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-1988-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 1988 (CPZ)</LINK>) stimulated a frantic search for a newer group of drugs known collectively as the 'atypical neuroleptics' or 'second generation antipsychotic drugs'.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-18 11:49:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a chronic, relapsing mental illness and has a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about 1% irrespective of culture, social class and race. Schizophrenia is characterised by positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions and negative symptoms such as emotional numbness and withdrawal. One quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. Half do have a recurrent illness but with long episodes of considerable recovery from the positive symptoms. Current medication is effective in reducing positive symptoms, but negative symptoms are fairly resistant to treatment. In addition, drug treatments are associated with adverse effects and the overall cost of the illness to the individual, their carers and the community is considerable.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-11-06 14:09:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clozapine has been in use for the treatment of schizophrenia since the early 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Hippius-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hippius 1989</LINK>). Although its availability has not been interrupted in parts of the world including China and some countries in South America, it was withdrawn from Western markets in 1975 after reports of agranulocytosis (a substantial decline in the white blood cells which made the individuals dangerously susceptible to infection) leading to death in some clozapine-treated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Id_x00e4_np_x00e4__x00e4_n_x002d_Heikkil_x00e4_-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Id‰np‰‰n-Heikkil‰ 1975</LINK>). More recent studies suggested that clozapine was more effective than other antipsychotic drugs against treatment-resistant schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-1988-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 1988 (CPZ)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 1989</LINK>). Treatment-resistant schizophrenia is a term generally used for the failure of signs or symptoms to respond satisfactorily to at least two different antipsychotic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Crilly-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crilly 2007</LINK>). Health authorities in many countries have approved the use of clozapine only for people with schizophrenia who were (i) resistant to typical neuroleptics and (ii) compliant with blood monitoring. People taking clozapine are required to have their blood sampled at least once a week for the first 18 weeks of treatment and at least once a month thereafter. Another potentially fatal adverse effect of clozapine that has been recently identified is that of myocarditis which usually develops within the first month of commencement and presents with signs of cardiac failure and cardiac arrhythmias (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2007</LINK>). Echocardiograms are recommended every six months to exclude cardiac damage. People receiving clozapine should also have their fasting blood glucose monitored; in addition to type II diabetes, significant weight gain is frequently experienced by people treated with clozapine (<LINK REF="REF-Wirshing-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirshing 1999</LINK>). Other adverse effects of clozapine include lowered seizure threshold, hepatic dysfunction and adverse effects associated with its interaction with different neurotransmitters' receptors.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-11-06 15:12:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clozapine is a strong antagonist at different subtypes of adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and serotonergic receptors. It may also have a different pattern of adhesion to receptors than other drugs. Clozapine&#8217;s common adverse effects are predominantly anticholinergic in nature, with dry mouth, sedation and constipation, drooling, and orthostasis.</P>

There is no clear evidence that the schizophrenia-like psychoses are caused by fundamentally different disease processes or require different treatment approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1994</LINK>). The group of studies dealing with people with illness that had been labelled as 'resistant' were also analysed separately.</P>

<P>Two reviewers independently inspected all study citations identified by the searches and obtained full reports of the studies of agreed relevance. Where disputes arose, we acquired the full report for more detailed scrutiny. The two reviewers inspected these articles independently to assess their relevance to this review. Again, where disagreement occurred we attempted to resolve this through discussion; if doubt still remained we added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment pending acquisition of further information.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2009-11-06 14:20:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Extraction<BR/>We independently extracted data from included studies. Again, any disagreement was discussed, decisions documented and, if necessary, authors of studies contacted for clarification. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data and added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>2. Management<BR/>We extracted the data onto standard, simple forms. Where possible, we entered data into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the 'line of no effect' indicates a 'favourable' outcome for clozapine. Where this was not possible, (e.g. scales that calculate higher scores = improvement) we labelled the graphs in RevMan analyses accordingly so that the direction of effects were clear.</P>
<P>3. Scale-derived data<BR/>A wide range of instruments are available to measure outcomes in mental health studies. These instruments vary in quality and many are not validated, or are even ad hoc. It is accepted generally that measuring instruments should have the properties of reliability (the extent to which a test effectively measures anything at all) and validity (the extent to which a test measures that which it is supposed to measure) (<LINK REF="REF-Rust-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rust 1989</LINK>). Unpublished scales are known to be subject to bias in trials of treatments for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). Therefore we only included continuous data from rating scales if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal. In addition, we set the following minimum standards for instruments: the instrument should either be (a) a self-report or (b) completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist) and (c) the instrument should be a global assessment of an area of functioning.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-11-06 14:20:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Again working independently, we assessed risk of bias using the tool described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). This tool encourages consideration of how the sequence was generated, how allocation was concealed, the integrity of blinding at outcome, the completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other biases. We would not have included studies where sequence generation was at high risk of bias or where allocation was clearly not concealed.</P>
<P>The categories are defined below:<BR/>YES - low risk of bias<BR/>NO - high risk of bias<BR/>UNCLEAR - uncertain risk of bias</P>
<P>If disputes arose as to which category a trial has to be allocated, again, resolution was made by discussion, after working with a third reviewer.</P>
<P>Earlier versions of this review used a different, less well-developed, means of categorising risk of bias (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-11-06 14:23:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For statistically significant results we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using Visual Rx taking account of the event rate in the control group. It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect.<BR/>
<BR/>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to binary data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into "clinically improved" or "not clinically improved". It was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>). It was recognised that for many people, especially those with chronic or severe illness, a less rigorous definition of important improvement (e.g. 25% on the BPRS) would be equally valid. If individual patient data were available, the 50% cut-off was used for the definition in the case of non-chronically ill people and 25% for those with chronic illness. If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
<P>2. Continuous data<BR/>Continuous data on outcomes in mental health trials are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data we applied the following standards to all endpoint data derived from continuous measures. We applied these criteria before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means had to be obtainable; and, for finite scores, such as endpoint measures on rating scales, (b) the standard deviation (SD), when multiplied by 2 had to be less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution) (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). If a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS, which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in (b) should be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score.</P>
<P>We did not graphically show skewed endpoint data from studies with less the 200 participants, but added to 'Other data' tables and briefly commented on in the text. However, skewed endpoint data from larger studies (=/&gt;200 participants) pose less of a problem and we entered the data for analysis.</P>
<P>For continuous mean change data (endpoint minus baseline) the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if change data are skewed. The RevMan meta-analyses of continuous data are based on the assumption that the data are, at least to a reasonable degree, normally distributed. Therefore we included such data, unless endpoint data were also reported from the same scale.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2009-11-06 14:25:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ cluster randomisation (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This can cause Type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a design effect. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect=1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intraclass correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, we synthesised these with other studies using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>2. Cross-over design<BR/>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia,†we will only use†data†of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
<P>3. Studies with multiple treatment groups<BR/>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not reproduce these data.</P>

<P>1. Overall loss of credibility<BR/>At some degree of loss to follow-up data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2007</LINK>). We are forced to make a judgment where this is for the trials likely to be included in this review. Should more than 40% of data be unaccounted for by 8 weeks we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses.</P>
<P>We attempted to include all people who had been randomised to clozapine or typical treatments. Where possible, we gave cases lost to follow up at the end of the study the worst outcome. For example, we treated those lost to follow up for the outcome of relapse in the analysis as having relapsed. Suicide was also treated as relapse. We agreed these rules before knowing the studies included. We tested the effects of inclusion of this assumption with sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome.</P>

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results. These are described in section 10.1 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were ten or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots were possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>

<P>Where possible we employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This does seem true to us, however, random-effects does put added weight onto the smaller of the studies - those trials that are most vulnerable to bias. For this reason we favour using the fixed-effect model.</P>

<P>1. 1997 search<BR/>During the original 1997 search in Biological Abstracts, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycLIT, we found 139 full reports. We contacted the senior author of each trial published since 1980 and the manufacturer of clozapine (Novartis AG, Switzerland) for additional references, data, and unpublished trials. We also searched the ISI citation index for each selected trial in order to identify further studies, and the reference sections of selected studies were searched for additional trials. We identified 34 additional citations of studies possibly relevant to this review. Novartis AG had agreed to provide additional data on early clozapine studies sponsored by the company, but to date, we have not received any additional data.</P>
<P>Out of these 173 articles 111 were excluded, mostly because they used a non-controlled design. On inspecting the full papers, relevant references found in these papers, references given by principal authors of recent studies and references provided by the manufacturer of clozapine, 37 separate randomised controlled trials comparing clozapine with typical neuroleptic treatment were found. Two papers were then excluded due to diagnostically mixed study populations (<LINK REF="STD-Angst-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Angst 1971</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Praag-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Van Praag 1976</LINK>) and three papers due to lack of satisfactory random allocation (Category C) (<LINK REF="STD-Bao-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bao 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz 1974</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yang-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 1988</LINK>).

<P>3. 2008 Update (2006 search)<BR/>The 2008 update of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of trials yielded 350 references of which 150 were Chinese. Most Chinese reports included an English abstract. We selected 12 trials for further inspection. We added one Chinese trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004-b" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004 b</LINK>) to awaiting assessment and sought further information and excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Cui-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cui 2002</LINK>) because it contained no usable data. Ten Chinese trials met the inclusion criteria.

<P>The current update of this review includes 52 studies. All were described as being randomised.</P>
<P>1. Study length<BR/>Seven studies were longer than 26 weeks (long-term) (<LINK REF="STD-Tamminga-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tamminga 1994 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kane-1995-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 1995 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994-_x0028_mainly-H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994 (mainly H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Essock-1996-_x0028_H_x002f_CPZ_x002f_Flu_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Essock 1996 (H/CPZ/Flu)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lieberman-2003-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lieberman 2003 (CPZ)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004-a-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004 a (CPZ)</LINK> ); <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002 (H)</LINK> reported both short and medium-term data; the remainder all fall into the 'short-term' category with a maximum length of 12 weeks.</P>
<P>2. Design<BR/>There are two cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-1974-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 1974 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-1975-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 1975 (H)</LINK>). We were only able to extract data for mortality and relapse from the first phase of these studies.</P>
<P>3. Participants<BR/>A total of 4746 participants are included from 52 trials conducted from 1974 and 2007. In the current revision, 11 trials were added and all were conducted in China. Thirty-six studies involved participants with schizophrenia that had been diagnosed using operationalised criteria (DSM, ICD, CCMD-2) whilst 16 studies did not report using any diagnostic tool, but only stated the type of illness.</P>
<P>Eight trials include only participants with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1988-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1988 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hong-1997-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 1997 (CPZ)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kane-1988-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 1988 (CPZ)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Essock-1996-_x0028_H_x002f_CPZ_x002f_Flu_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Essock 1996 (H/CPZ/Flu)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kumra-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumra 1994 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Buchanan-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Buchanan 1994 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002 (H)</LINK>). Most studies included participants with mean ages around the late thirties when reported. One trial focused on children or adolescents suffering from schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Kumra-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumra 1994 (H)</LINK>), and another trial studied the efficacy of clozapine in elderly people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Howanitz-1996-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Howanitz 1996 (CPZ)</LINK>).</P>
<P>4. Settings<BR/>The vast majority of the trials were in-hospital studies. To our knowledge, only two trials were performed in the community (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-1995-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 1995 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Buchanan-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Buchanan 1994 (H)</LINK>). Two long-term trials were hospital-based with follow up of discharged participants (<LINK REF="STD-Essock-1996-_x0028_H_x002f_CPZ_x002f_Flu_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Essock 1996 (H/CPZ/Flu)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>). One Chinese study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001 (CPZ)</LINK>) used participants who were outpatients, all other Chinese trials when reported were hospital-based.</P>
<P>5. Interventions<BR/>The following control treatments were used in different trials: chlorpromazine (29 trials), haloperidol (14 trials), various neuroleptics (two trials), clopenthixol (two trials), loxapine (two trials), perphenazine (one trial) thioridazine (two trials). For clarity we have incorporated these in the study tags: H denotes haloperidol, CPZ chlorpromazine, Clopen clopenthixol, and Thi thioridazine. Five trials used low doses of typical neuroleptic treatment, which may have benefited clozapine results in these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chiu-1976-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 1976 (CPZ)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Leon-1974-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1974 (CPZ)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ciurezu-1976-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ciurezu 1976 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Erlandsen-1977-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Erlandsen 1977 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Honigfeld-1984-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Honigfeld 1984 (H)</LINK>). Two of these studies used equal mg doses of clozapine and chlorpromazine (<LINK REF="STD-Chiu-1976-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 1976 (CPZ)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Leon-1974-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Leon 1974 (CPZ)</LINK>) and the other three used comparatively low doses of haloperidol.</P>
<P>6. Outcomes<BR/>Many trialists used symptom scales in assessing treatment effects mainly the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and its derivative The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) scale. Some studies measured changes in negative symptoms using the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and PANSS negative symptom sub-score. The use of scoring data were in several cases precluded by the lack of standard deviation figures. Behavioural changes were measured by changes in the Nurse's Observation Scale for In-patient Evaluation (NOSIE). Assessments of subjective well-being were determined by authors' own global scales or Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life Scale.</P>
<P>Definitions of improvement differed across studies. This warranted some caution in drawing conclusions, as it was difficult to decide whether the results concerning clinical improvement were comparable. However, as with a pragmatic approach to diagnosis, it seemed unlikely that those judging improvement would have such dramatically differing criteria as to make summation inappropriate.</P>
<P>6.1 Outcome scales: only details of the scales that provided usable data are shown below. Reasons for exclusions of data are given under 'Outcomes' in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>6.1.1 Global state<BR/>6.1.1.1 Clinical Global Impression - CGI (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1970</LINK>)<BR/>The CGI is a three-item scale commonly used in studies on schizophrenia that enables clinicians to quantify severity of illness and overall clinical improvement. The items are: severity of illness; global improvement and efficacy index. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery. Nine studies reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>6.1.2 Mental state<BR/>6.1.2.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>The BPRS is an 18-item scale measuring positive symptoms, general psychopathology and affective symptoms. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Scores can range from 0 to 126. Each item is rated on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. Twenty studies reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>6.1.2.2 Mini Mental State Examination - MMSE (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>)<BR/>This clinician-administered clinical evaluation assesses cognition in five areas: orientation, immediate recall, attention and calculation, delayed recall, and language. The test takes 15 minutes to administer and the score ranges from 0 (severe impairment) to 30 (normal). <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002 (H)</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>6.1.2.3 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)<BR/>This schizophrenia scale has 30 items, each of which can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from one (absent) to seven (extreme). This scale can be divided into three sub-scales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P), and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A low score indicates lesser severity. Nine studies reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>6.1.2.4 Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms - SANS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1983</LINK>)<BR/>This scale allows a global rating of the following negative symptoms: alogia (impoverished thinking), affective blunting, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality, and attention impairment. Assessments are made on a six-point scale from zero (not at all) to five (severe). Higher scores indicate more symptoms. Five studies reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>6.1.2.5 Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms - SAPS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1983</LINK>)<BR/>This six-point scale gives a global rating of positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking. Higher scores indicate more symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001 (CPZ)</LINK> reported data from this scale.</P>
<P>6.1.3 Behaviour.<BR/>6.1.3.1 Nurses Observational Scale of Inpatients Evaluation - NOSIE (<LINK REF="REF-Honigfeld-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honigfeld 1965</LINK>)<BR/>An 80-item scale with items rated on a five-point scale from zero (not present) to four (always present). Ratings are based on behaviour over the previous three days. The seven headings are social competence, social interest, personal neatness, cooperation, irritability, manifest psychosis and psychotic depression. The total score ranges from 0 to 320 with high scores indicating a poor outcome. Two studies reported data from this scale.</P>

<P>1. COMPARISON 1. CLOZAPINE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS - OVERALL</P>
<P>All data are derived from 50 studies.</P>
<P>1.1 Death<BR/>Four deaths occurred in 614 people treated with typical neuroleptics compared with three deaths in 629 people treated with clozapine. There were no significant differences in mortality between groups (n=1243, 12 RCTs, RR 0.56 CI 0.1 to 2.3).</P>
<P>1.2 Relapse rate<BR/>We included 19 short-term studies, and found incidences of relapse were lower in the clozapine group (n=1303, RR 0.62 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 21 CI 15 to 49) compared with typical antipsychotic drugs. Long-term data (4 RCTs, n=578) also favoured clozapine but data were heterogeneous (I-squared =76%) (RR 0.22 CI 0.1 to 0.3).</P>
<P>1.3 Global impression<BR/>1.3.1 Clinical improvement as defined by study authors<BR/>We found that the number of participants who had not improved were lower in the clozapine group (n=1119, 14 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.7 to 0.8, NNT 6 CI 5 to 8). Three long-term studies also favoured clozapine (n=719, RR 0.81 CI 0.7 to 0.9) but the data are heterogeneous (I-squared statistic 81%).</P>
<P>1.3.2 Readiness for hospital discharge<BR/>There were no significant differences between treatment groups for the number of participants who were judged to be not ready for discharge (short-term, n=447, 5 RCTs, RR 0.88 CI 0.8 to 1.0). Long-term data also failed to show a significant difference (n=648, 2 RCTs, RR 0.82 CI 0.6 to 1.1).</P>
<P>1.4 Hospitalisation - Not discharged or readmitted within one year after discharge<BR/>Data were available from two long-term studies (<LINK REF="STD-Essock-1996-_x0028_H_x002f_CPZ_x002f_Flu_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Essock 1996 (H/CPZ/Flu)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>), and we found no significant advantage for clozapine (n=648, RR 0.94 CI 0.9 to 1.0) compared with typical antipsychotic drugs.</P>
<P>1.5 Unable to work<BR/>We found no significant difference in the number of participants who were assessed as being unable to work (n=416, 4 RCTs, RR 0.87 CI 0.8 to 1.0), although the data suggested a trend favouring clozapine (p=0.06).</P>
<P>1.6 Participant dissatisfaction<BR/>No significant differences were found for dissatisfaction with treatment in two short-term studies (n=114, RR 0.72 CI 0.4 to 1.3). We found longer-term data in (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>). These favoured the clozapine group who were less dissatisfied with their treatment compared with conventional antipsychotic drugs (n=423, RR 0.45 CI 0.3 to 0.8, NNT 13 CI 9 to 37).</P>
<P>1.7 Leaving the study early - acceptability of treatment<BR/>We used leaving the study early data as a proxy measure for the acceptability of treatment. Short-term data from 32 studies involving 2316 participants indicated that significantly more participants given clozapine found treatment acceptable (RR 0.81 CI 0.7 to 1.0, NNT 35 CI 20 to 217). Longer-term data from six studies showed a significant benefit in the clozapine group (n=982, RR 0.60 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT15 CI 12 to 20). The long-term attrition rate from clozapine treatment is approximately 33% and 56% when treated with typical antipsychotic drugs.</P>
<P>1.8 Mental state<BR/>1.8.1 BPRS and PANSS<BR/>We found BPRS mental state scores favoured clozapine during short-term assessment in 16 studies (n=1205, WMD -3.79 CI -4.9 to -2.7), although the data were heterogeneous (I squared=69%). Longer-term BPRS data (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994-_x0028_mainly-H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994 (mainly H)</LINK>) were equivocal (n=52, WMD 0.80 CI -5.7 to 7.3). PANSS scores from three Chinese trials favoured the clozapine groups (n=163, WMD -3.82 CI -7.4 to -0.3) during short-term analysis. Also, PANSS scores assessed over the long-term favoured clozapine (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>, n=235, WMD -6.90 CI -10.7 to -3.1).</P>
<P>1.8.2 Negative symptoms<BR/>Short-term continuous data on negative symptom scores from six short-term trials with 236 participants favoured clozapine (SANS, WMD -7.12 CI -8.8 to -5.5) but these are heterogeneous data (I squared=92%). Longer-term negative symptoms scores assessed with the PANSS negative sub score were not significantly different (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>, n=235, WMD -0.90 CI -6.6 to 4.8).</P>
<P>1.8.3 Positive symptoms<BR/>We found short-term SAPS scores were equivocal (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001 (CPZ)</LINK>, n=60, WMD 4.39 CI -12.2 to 20.9). Longer-term data from the PANSS positive scores favoured clozapine (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>, n=235, WMD -2.20 CI -3.3 to -1.1).</P>
<P>1.9 Cognitive function<BR/>Cognitive impairment from one small study (n=82) favoured the clozapine group who experienced less impairment (<LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1990-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1990 (H)</LINK>, RR 0.56 CI 0.3 to 0.9, NNT 4 CI 3 to 21) when assessed with the SKT scale compared with those given typical antipsychotic drugs. One small study (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994-_x0028_mainly-H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994 (mainly H)</LINK>, n=54) reported data on a series of cognitive functioning tests (verbal, memory or executive functions etc.) and we found outcomes to be equivocal, except for 'psychomotor speed and attention' scores which favoured the clozapine-treated participants over the three pre-stated cut-off points (short-term, WMD 1.40 CI 0.2 to 2.6, medium-term, WMD 1.30 CI 0.01 to 3.0, long-term, WMD 2.10 CI 0.8 to 3.4).</P>
<P>1.10 Behaviour<BR/>We found behavioural scores from the NOSIE scale favoured clozapine (n=40, 2 RCTs, RR 0.36 CI 0.2 to 0.9, NNT 4 CI 3 to 20) compared with typical antipsychotic drugs, during short-term analysis.</P>
<P>1.11 Adverse effects<BR/>1.11.1 Blood problems<BR/>We defined blood problems as (a) any blood problem requiring withdrawal of participants from trials, or (b) leukopenia, defined as a white cell count &lt;3000 per cubic mm, or (c) neutropenia, defined as granulocyte count &lt;1500 per cubic mm. Blood problems occurred more frequently in participants receiving clozapine (3.2%) compared with those given typical antipsychotic drugs (0%) in short-term studies (n=1031, 13 RCTs, RR 7.09 CI 2.0 to 25.6). We found two long-term studies had a much higher incidence of blood problems in both clozapine (7%) and control group (haloperidol) (5.2%), but no significant differences were found (n=462, RR 1.35 CI 0.7 to 2.8) (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tamminga-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tamminga 1994 (H)</LINK>). We found incidences of abnormal ESR were higher in the clozapine group (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-1999-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 1999 (CPZ)</LINK>, n=62, RR 10.78 CI 2.8 to 41.9, NNH 2 CI 2 to 9). Also, <LINK REF="STD-Dong-1999-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 1999 (CPZ)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Li-2003-_x0028_Lox_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2003 (Lox)</LINK> reported changes in white blood cell count, and we found that the clozapine group had a significant increase in white cells (n=122, RR 13.02 CI 2.6 to 65.5, NNH 5 CI 2 to 38) compared with the typical antipsychotic group.</P>
<P>1.11.2 Other adverse effects<BR/>Clozapine commonly caused drowsiness (n=1527, 16 RCTs, RR 1.23 CI 1.1 to 1.3, NNH 11 CI 7 to 18). No significant differences were found in the incidences of low blood pressure/dizziness (n=1478, 14 RCTs, RR 1.13 CI 1.0 to 1.3) between clozapine and the typical neuroleptic drugs. Salivation occurred more frequently in the clozapine group (n=1479, 17 RCTs, RR 2.25 CI 2.0 to 2.6), but data were heterogeneous (I squared=68%). Dry mouth occurred more frequently in the typical antipsychotic group (n=859, 9 RCTs, RR 0.38 CI 0.3 to 0.5, NNH 7 CI 6 to 8), compared with clozapine. We found participants given clozapine gained weight significantly more than those given typical antipsychotic drugs (n=590, 5 RCTs, RR 1.28 CI 1.1 to 1.5, NNH 10 CI 5 to 37). We found continuous data for weight gain (n=58, MD -0.17 CI -3.1 to 2.8) to be equivocal.</P>
<P>Extrapyramidal movement disorders were more frequent in those who were treated with conventional neuroleptics (n=1495, 19 RCTs, RR 0.57 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 5 CI 4 to 6). No significant differences were found between clozapine and the typical neuroleptic drugs for fits (n=1157, 9 RCTs, RR 1.51 CI 0.8 to 2.8). Increases in body temperature were more frequent in the clozapine group (n=1147, 9 RCTs, RR 1.57 CI 1.3 to 2.0, NNH 12 CI 7 to 23).</P>
<P>We found oral glucose tolerance tests data (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004 (CPZ)</LINK>) were equivocal (WMD 0.30 CI -0.16, 0.76). One study from China reported continuous data for fasting blood glucose over different time cut-off points, with most data being equivocal (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004-a-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004 a (CPZ)</LINK>). Long-term data, however, revealed more participants in the clozapine group had abnormal blood glucose (n=87, WMD 1.00 CI 0.4 to 1.6). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2003-_x0028_Lox_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2003 (Lox)</LINK>) reported data for tachycardia and electro-cardiogram tests and we found no significant differences between clozapine and loxapine. We found no significant difference in TESS scores (n=50, 1 RCT, WMD -0.90 CI -1.93 to 0.13).</P>
<P>1.12 Sensitivity Analysis<BR/>In the 2008 update we included ten trials that were conducted in China. Some differences in effect size were observed, but sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results of Chinese trials followed the same general affect as trials conducted in western countries. The most meaningful comparisons were those related to short-term studies. The overall reduction in clinical symptoms, for instance, in ten short-term non-Chinese studies were (n=828, BPRS, WMD -6.32 CI -8.1 to -4.6). Whilst, the overall reduction in clinical symptoms in six short-term Chinese studies were (n=317, BPRS, WMD -2.56 CI -4.1 to -1.0). Similarly, the relative risk for leaving the study early in 21 short-term non-Chinese studies were (n=1553, RR 0.84 CI 0.7 to 1.0) compared with five short-term Chinese studies (n=278, RR 0.61 CI 0.3 to 1.4).</P>
<P>2. COMPARISON 2. CLOZAPINE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS - TREATMENT-RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA</P>
<P>All data were derived from eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Buchanan-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Buchanan 1994 (H)</LINK>), <LINK REF="STD-Essock-1996-_x0028_H_x002f_CPZ_x002f_Flu_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Essock 1996 (H/CPZ/Flu)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hong-1997-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 1997 (CPZ)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kane-1988-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 1988 (CPZ)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Klieser-1988-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Klieser 1988 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kumra-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumra 1994 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002 (H)</LINK>)<BR/>
<BR/>2.1 Death<BR/>We found no significant difference in mortality rates in four studies that included 939 participants with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (RR 0.64 CI 0.1 to 3.1).</P>
<P>2.2 Relapse rate<BR/>Analysis of four short-term studies (396 people) did not reveal any significant difference in relapse rates between treatment groups (RR 1.04 CI 0.6 to 1.8), but we found data from one longer-term study did favour clozapine (n=423, RR 0.17 CI 0.1 to 0.3, NNT 4 CI 4 to 4).</P>
<P>2.3 Global impression<BR/>2.3.1 Clinical improvement as defined by study authors<BR/>We found that participants allocated to clozapine had greater clinical improvement than the typical antipsychotic group (n=370, 4 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.6 to 0.8, NNT 4 CI 4 to 4). Similarly, longer-term data also favoured clozapine (n=648, 2 RCTs, RR 0.83 CI 0.8 to 0.9, NNT 8 CI 5 to 14).</P>
<P>2.3.2 Readiness for hospital discharge<BR/>No significant differences were found between clozapine and typical antipsychotic drugs when assessed on dischargeability in two longer-term studies (n=648, RR 0.82 CI 0.6 to 1.1).</P>
<P>2.4 Hospitalisation<BR/>The numbers of participants who were either not discharged from hospital or were readmitted revealed no significant differences (n=648, RR 0.94 CI 0.9 to 1.0) between intervention groups over one year's treatment.</P>
<P>2.5 Leaving the study early - acceptability of treatment<BR/>The acceptability of treatment as measured by the number of people leaving the study revealed no significant difference between treatment groups (n=436, 5 RCTs, RR 1.19 CI 0.7 to 1.9) during short-term analyses with 14% attrition in clozapine group and 12% in the typical antipsychotic drugs group. Longer-term data, however, significantly favoured clozapine (n=648, RR 0.57 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 4 CI 3 to 5) compared with typical antipsychotic drugs, with 39% attrition in the clozapine group compared with 70% leaving from the typical antipsychotic drugs group.</P>
<P>2.6 Participant satisfaction<BR/>Only one long-term study provided data on patient satisfaction and we found that more participants given clozapine were satisfied with their treatment (n=423, RR 0.45 CI 0.3 to 0.8, NNT 13 CI 9 to 37) than those allocated to typical antipsychotic drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>).</P>
<P>2.7 Mental state<BR/>We found BPRS endpoint scores favoured clozapine (n=429, 5 RCTs, WMD -7.83 CI -10.0 to -5.6) compared with the typical antipsychotic group during short-term analyses. Longer-term data were equivocal (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>, n=235, WMD -6.90 CI -10.7 to -3.1). We found medium-term data by <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002 (H)</LINK> (n=77) were not significantly different for PANSS total, negative or positive symptom scores. We found negative symptoms score data from four short-term studies favoured the clozapine group (n=164, SMD -0.44 CI -0.8 to -0.1) but these data contain the skewed <LINK REF="STD-Kumra-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumra 1994 (H)</LINK> figures.</P>
<P>2.8. Adverse effects<BR/>2.8.1 Blood problems<BR/>The differences in the number of participants with blood problems failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.06) although a trend could be seen which suggests blood problems were less frequent in the typical antipsychotic group (n=827, 5 RCTs, RR 1.90 CI 1.0 to 3.7).</P>
<P>2.8.2 Drowsiness<BR/>Participants given clozapine experienced significantly more incidences of drowsiness (n=827, 5 RCTs, RR 1.22 CI 1.1 to 1.3, NNH 10 CI 7 to 20) compared with participants given typical antipsychotic drugs.</P>
<P>2.8.3 Low blood pressure/dizziness<BR/>We found no significant difference in incidences of dizziness between groups (n=806, 4 RCTs, RR 1.08 CI 0.9 to 1.2).</P>
<P>2.8.4 Salivation<BR/>Short-term data indicated that participants given clozapine experience more hypersalivation (n=827, 5 RCTs, RR 2.01 CI 1.7 to 2.3) than those receiving typical antipsychotic drugs, but data were heterogeneous (I-squared 78%). We found incidences of dry mouth were significantly lower in the clozapine group (n=383, 4 RCTs, RR 0.27 CI 0.2 to 0.5, NNT 5 CI 5 to 7) compared with typical drugs.</P>
<P>2.8.5 Weight gain<BR/>The number of participants who gained weight were found to be higher in the clozapine group (n=484, 3 RCTs, RR 1.33 CI 1.1 to 1.6, NNH 8 CI 4 to 24) compared with those given typical antipsychotic drugs.</P>
<P>2.8.6 Movement disorder<BR/>Incidences of movement disorder were significantly less frequent in the clozapine group (n=521, 4 RCTs, 0.77 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 8 CI 6 to 17).</P>
<P>2.8.7 High temperature<BR/>We found that the participants allocated to clozapine had more incidences of raised temperatures than the typical antipsychotic group (n=766, 3 RCTs, RR 1.36 CI 1.0 to 1.8), but data were heterogeneous (I-squared 51%).</P>
<P>2.8.8 Fits<BR/>No significant differences were found in the incidences of fits between groups (n=784, 5 RCTs, RR 1.75 CI 0.9 to 3.4).</P>

<P>3.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>We found no significant difference in the number of participants leaving the study early (n=11, RR 3.30 CI 0.4 to 26.8).</P>
<P>3.5 Mental state<BR/>We found no significant difference in BPRS scores or SANS scores in the small study by (<LINK REF="STD-Kumra-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumra 1994 (H)</LINK>, n=21).</P>
<P>3.6 Adverse effects<BR/>In the single study (<LINK REF="STD-Kumra-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumra 1994 (H)</LINK>) dealing with adolescents or children, 40% (4/10) of the clozapine-treated group developed blood problems (RR 9.82 CI 0.6 to 162.2) but the differences were not statistically significant. Drowsiness occurred more frequently in the clozapine group (n=21, RR 3.30 CI 1.2 to 8.9, NNH 2 CI 2 to 16). Hypersalivation also occurred more frequently in the clozapine group (n=21, RR 3.85 CI 1.0 to 14.4, NNH 2 CI 2 to 185), compared with typical antipsychotic drugs. No statistically significant differences were found for weight gain, movement disorders or fits.</P>

<P>4.2 Leaving the study early<BR/>We found no significant differences in rates of attrition (n=42).</P>
<P>4.3 Blood problems<BR/>We found that elderly people were also at risk of developing blood problems with 8% affected in the clozapine group, but the differences were not statistically significant (n=42, RR 3.8 CI 0.2 to 74.6).</P>
<P>4.4 Other adverse effects<BR/>The occurrence of drowsiness, dizziness, hypersalivation, weight gain, movement disorders or fits revealed no significant difference between groups.</P>
<P>5. Publication bias<BR/>To look for a possible publication bias (that is, the possibility that studies with negative findings have not reached full publication) funnel graphs for clinical improvement, relapse frequency and number of people leaving early (acceptability) were constructed by plotting number of study participants (on the 'y' axis) against the log odds ratios (on the 'x' axis). No 'gap' in the funnel indicating a publication bias affecting the results were found.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-06 15:03:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. COMPARISON 1. CLOZAPINE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS - OVERALL (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>)<BR/>1.1 Death<BR/>This review did not reveal any difference in mortality between clozapine and the typical neuroleptic treatment groups. This would be a rare adverse event and the short duration of the included studies means that these trials would be unlikely to highlight any differences there may be.</P>
<P>1.2 Global impression<BR/>1.2.1 Relapse<BR/>We found clozapine to be more advantageous than conventional neuroleptics in avoiding, or postponing, psychotic relapses at least in the short term. The relapse-preventing effect of clozapine were heterogeneous in the long-term studies, but favoured clozapine. However, the relapse-preventing effect of clozapine were not seen in treatment-resistant participants during short-term analyses, but were effective in one longer-term study (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>, n=423, RR 0.17 CI 0.1 to 0.3, NNT 4 CI 4 to 4).</P>
<P>1.2.2 Global impression - clinical improvement<BR/>Treating six people with schizophrenia with clozapine instead of typical neuroleptics resulted in one additional person showing a clinical improvement. This may be a real finding and, if so, important. However, as has been said many times above, there are reasons to consider that bias may also influence the research and therefore even this modest result my over estimate clozapine's effects.</P>
<P>Global impression was chosen as the primary outcome of this review. There is some suggestion of a real effect of clozapine over and above that of haloperidol, chlorpromazine and a few other typical drugs - but the data are not strong and may include important biases in favour of clozapine.</P>
<P>1.3 Discharge - not ready<BR/>We found both short and long-term studies failed to show any advantage for participants given clozapine compared with typical antipsychotic drugs or for hospital readmission in long-term studies.</P>
<P>1.4 Unable to work<BR/>About half of all participants in the four included studies were judged as being unable to work. The outcome data between groups were not significantly different but the graph revealed a trend favouring clozapine (p=0.06). More studies may have produced a significant outcome.</P>
<P>1.5 Participant dissatisfaction<BR/>Clozapine participants were more satisfied with their treatment in one long-term study (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>). This was an important finding as participant satisfaction may enhance compliance. Two short-term studies were equivocal, and more studies measuring satisfaction with treatment are needed to substantiate the long-term benefit.</P>
<P>1.6 Leaving the study early<BR/>Using study attrition as a proxy measure of acceptability, the results favoured clozapine in short-term studies. Longer-term studies revealed a larger advantage for clozapine over typical antipsychotic drugs (n=982, RR 0.60 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 15 CI 12 to 20), and as with participant dissatisfaction the benefits are more apparent during the longer durations of treatment.</P>
<P>1.7 Mental state<BR/>1.7.1 BPRS/PANSS<BR/>We found short-term studies indicated a greater improvement for participants on clozapine compared with typical antipsychotic drugs, but the data were heterogeneous, the differences in overall reduction were small, and the clinical significance of a difference of this magnitude may be questioned. We found long-term BPRS data (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994-_x0028_mainly-H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994 (mainly H)</LINK>) from a single small study (n=52) to be equivocal and without much larger data sets it is impossible to interpret such findings. PANSS scores which are based upon the BPRS scale were found to favour clozapine in a single long-term study, and three short-term Chinese trials, which included two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2003-_x0028_Lox_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2003 (Lox)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2007-_x0028_Lox_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2007 (Lox)</LINK>) that used loxapine as the comparator drug, and is thought to have drug profile similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs.</P>
<P>1.7.2 Negative symptoms<BR/>Negative symptom score from the SANS scale favoured clozapine group with about a seven point advantage. Again, the clinical significance of such a shift of this magnitude is questionable. We were able to include data from one long-term study (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>) and found that negative symptoms were not significantly different when assessed using the PANSS negative symptoms sub-score.</P>
<P>1.7.3 Positive symptoms<BR/>SAPS scores in a single short-term study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001 (CPZ)</LINK>) failed to reveal any significant differences, although small participant numbers (n=60) limited the possibility of detecting a real treatment effect. Longer-term PANSS positive data from a larger study (n=235) did favour clozapine in a group of participants who were treatment-resistant, although the points difference was only about two and the clinical relevance of this is unclear.</P>
<P>1.8 Cognitive functioning<BR/>Few studies measured cognitive functioning and outcome data were complicated by the use of different scales by single studies making meta-analyses impossible. We found participants given clozapine had less cognitive impairment (n=82, RR 0.56 CI 0.3 to 0.9, NNT 4 CI 3 to 21). Most other cognitive outcomes were equivocal and were based on small numbers of participants.</P>
<P>1.9 Behaviour<BR/>Few studies reported usable data for behavioural changes. We were only able to report two studies that measured behaviour using the NOSIE scale and data favoured clozapine. However, only 40 participants were included and more robust data are needed.</P>
<P>1.10 Adverse effects<BR/>1.10.1 Blood problems<BR/>The reason for clozapine being taken off the international market in 1978 had been due to a fatal or potentially fatal drop in white cells in the blood of 16 people in Finland (<LINK REF="REF-Id_x00e4_np_x00e4__x00e4_n_x002d_Heikkil_x00e4_-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Id‰np‰‰n-Heikkil‰ 1975</LINK>). The rate of white blood cell problems (leukopenia) seems to be agreed to be 1.5 to 2% with an increased risk in females and the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Alvir-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvir 1993</LINK>). In the short-term studies included in this review 16 cases of blood problems from 507 clozapine-treated individuals were reported, which indicates a blood problem frequency of 3.2%. A relatively high effect size is observed in one Chinese study contributing data to the meta-analysis on blood problems (<LINK REF="STD-Ou-1999-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ou 1999 (CPZ)</LINK>). If this study is excluded, the frequency of blood problems is reduced to 1.9%. Also, twelve of the cases of blood problems occurred in adults (frequency 2.4%) and four occurred in children or adolescents (frequency 40%). Two of the adult cases were in a study of elderly people (frequency 8%). Based on these small but important numbers, clozapine-induced leukopenia seemed to be more frequent in children and adolescents, and in elderly people. Furthermore, incidences of blood problems were even higher in long-term clozapine treatment (7%) but were not significantly more frequent than the control group receiving haloperidol (5%). Limited data also suggests that clozapine produces more problems with erythrosedimentation rate and initial increases in white cells.</P>
<P>1.10.2 Other adverse effects<BR/>People on clozapine experienced significantly more hypersalivation, temperature increase, and drowsiness than those given conventional neuroleptics, but less uncomfortable dry mouth. Over half of those allocated clozapine experienced hypersalivation compared with about one fifth of participants in the control groups. Hypersalivation is a real problem with use of clozapine. It is remarkable in its quantity and very socially disabling. The management of this problem is the focus of another review (<LINK REF="REF-Syed-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Syed 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In assessing the frequency of extrapyramidal adverse effects one has to remember that some trialists (<LINK REF="STD-Kane-1988-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kane 1988 (CPZ)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1994-_x0028_mainly-H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1994 (mainly H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tamminga-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tamminga 1994 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kumra-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumra 1994 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rosenheck-1993-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenheck 1993 (H)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Buchanan-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Buchanan 1994 (H)</LINK>) used anticholinergic add-on medication in the control group to alleviate neurological adverse effects. To this extent the comparisons were biased in favour of the typical neuroleptics. Even with this the clozapine group displayed fewer movement disorders than those treated with the typical neuroleptic drugs.</P>
<P>1.11 Sensitivity analysis<BR/>The 2008 update of this review included ten trials conducted in China. Chinese trials were not different from other trials in terms of efficacy and adverse effects, despite observed differences in effect size.</P>
<P>2. COMPARISON 2. CLOZAPINE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS - TREATMENT-RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>)<BR/>2.1 Overall<BR/>Most findings are based on trials with a total number of participants of 400 to 600. These studies are most difficult to undertake. Nevertheless, that millions of people are now, or have been, treated with this potent drug on the back of data from a few industry-funded trials reporting limited data for use in everyday life is not ideal and more replication is indicated.</P>
<P>In neuroleptic-resistant patients, clozapine shows a somewhat greater advantage in controlling symptoms. Participants classified as treatment-resistant evidenced a significantly better improvement rate with clozapine than with typical pharmacological treatment. The weighted mean difference between short-term treatments in BPRS total score is about eight points, which probably is a clinically meaningful difference. Treatment-resistant people did not show any beneficial effect of clozapine on relapse frequency or attrition rates in the short-term, but the outcomes of long-term clozapine treatment were more beneficial. The newly included Chinese trials provided no data regarding treatment-resistant schizophrenia.</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 3. CLOZAPINE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS - CHILDREN OR ADOLESCENTS<BR/>3.1 Overall<BR/>From the limited data we found no differences between clozapine and typical antipsychotic drugs in children for the outcomes of death, relapse, global impression, leaving the study early and mental state. The adverse effects, drowsiness, hypersalivation occurred more frequently in the clozapine group. No significant differences were found for weight gain, movement disorders or fits. All data came from a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Kumra-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumra 1994 (H)</LINK>) involving just 21 people. Issues with the frequency of blood dyscrasias in this subgroup are discussed above (1.10.1).</P>
<P>4. COMPARISON 4. CLOZAPINE versus TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS - ELDERLY PEOPLE<BR/>4.1 Overall<BR/>We found no significant differences in the outcomes of death, leaving the study early or adverse effects in elderly people. All data came from a single study, <LINK REF="STD-Howanitz-1996-_x0028_CPZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Howanitz 1996 (CPZ)</LINK>, which randomised just 42 participants. Issues with the frequency of blood dyscrasias in this subgroup are discussed above (1.10.1).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-11-06 15:05:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised clozapine studies have been published since 1974, but the majority have a duration of only four to eight weeks. The severe adverse effect of loss of white blood cells (agranulocytosis) may occur later than during the first four to eight weeks of treatment and may therefore be under-reported in short-term studies. Also, deficiencies of global and social functioning caused by schizophrenia may take much longer to improve and any beneficial effect of clozapine may thus be underestimated in short-term studies.</P>
<P>Data on mortality were missing in a majority of the studies. Outcome reporting were mainly symptom and physician-oriented. Participant-oriented global and functional outcomes, such as readiness for discharge and ability to work were seldom reported. Participant satisfaction was only reported in four studies and no studies reported family burden. There is clearly a need for studies focusing not only on symptoms, but also on general and social functioning, family burden and participant acceptability.</P>
<P>The setting also compromises the applicability of the studies. Most of the included studies were undertaken in hospital, whereas the majority of people with schizophrenia are treated in the community. Our data, therefore, on the important aspects of functions of normal living are remarkably limited. It is surprising that after over three decades of research we still do not have much long-term, community-based data. It is not that these data are impossible to generalise - just that, considering the enormous change use of clozapine has wrought, we had expected much more easily applicable data to routine community care.</P>

<P>The quality of reporting in most studies was poor. There are likely to be significant biases in the results favouring clozapine. The magnitude of the effects of these biases on, for example, the primary outcome, could be considerable with an overestimate of 30% being entirely credible (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">J¸ni 2001</LINK>). This shocking finding, combined with the wide use of clozapine, must mean that better independent studies are a matter of urgency. </P>

<P>We have just worked with published reports and by doing this we may be perpetuating a reporting and publishing bias.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-11-06 15:08:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>Clozapine demonstrated some advantage over typical antipsychotic drugs in terms of clinical improvement with one person improving for every six people treated over and above those given typical drugs. Also, the incidences of relapse are likely to be postponed in some people, but this advantage is less apparent with about one relapse prevented for every 21 people given clozapine. Clozapine reduced the number of people dropping out of studies and as a consequence people with schizophrenia may find clozapine more tolerable than typical drugs. However, this effect is to be expected only when compared with low potency drugs such as chlorpromazine; when compared with high potency drugs such as haloperidol no difference in attrition rates are detected. Furthermore, data suggests that people receiving clozapine will express more satisfaction with their drug treatment, although this is based on only one trial. With clozapine treatment there will probably be a slight improvement in negative symptoms and general behaviour/functioning may improve but there is no evidence that a person's ability to be discharged from hospital or to work will be changed. Clozapine is likely to cause more drowsiness and weight gain than typical drugs, but less movement disorders. People with schizophrenia will also need to base their decisions upon their own personal response to treatment and consider that these data are statistical outcomes that are not universally applicable.</P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>Clozapine appears to be as effective as typical antipsychotic drugs. It presents an advantage in clinical improvement and relapse prevention but studies are at risk of bias. It may provide greater compliance with treatment since both participant satisfaction and attrition rates are improved. Clozapine may be effective in inducing clinical improvement in the long-term, and acceptability of treatment is significantly improved in the long-term. Long-term relapse prevention may also be improved compared with typical antipsychotic drugs but heterogeneity leaves doubt. More studies are needed to replicate and validate these findings.</P>
<P>Non-trial studies suggest that one to two of every 100 people receiving clozapine will have serious white blood cell problems that will necessitate a precipitous withdrawal of medication, careful monitoring for infection, and even specialised nursing and hospitalisation should infection occur (<LINK REF="REF-Alvir-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvir 1993</LINK>). Everyone taking clozapine must have weekly blood monitoring during the first 18 weeks of treatment and at least monthly thereafter. In one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Kumra-1994-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumra 1994 (H)</LINK>) almost half of the clozapine-treated children and adolescents developed blood problems so use of clozapine in this subgroup must be of overriding necessity and undertaken with extreme caution. Similar precautions are warranted when prescribing clozapine to elderly people. Treatment-resistant people appear to respond better to clozapine than typical antipsychotic drugs when evaluated on global clinical improvement measures and negative symptoms scores. Clozapine may also be more tolerable over the long term, as indicated by significantly fewer attrition from studies.</P>
<P>3. For managers / policy makers<BR/>We found no data for service outcomes, or economic outcomes. People given clozapine do require monitoring for potential blood disorders, which may influence the decision for countries with limited resources.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-06 15:09:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. General<BR/>The majority of existing randomised studies on clozapine are short-term in-hospital trials focusing on clinical outcomes. Short studies may underestimate both adverse effects and global efficacy. The effects of clozapine in comparison to typical neuroleptics in hospitalised adult patients would have been more clear if studies had been better reported. Compliance with CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) by both authors and editors would ensure that the methods used were accessible to the readership and would also avoid the loss of valuable data.</P>
<P>The outcomes currently described are largely disease-oriented and may not be very relevant for measuring the global functioning level of a person with schizophrenia. Several important treatment aspects, such as social functioning and family burden, have not been assessed in any of the trials. Some highly relevant outcomes, such as the person's own satisfaction with the treatment, their ability to be discharged from hospital, and to work for a living, were reported in only a small minority of studies. The typically reported outcomes were heterogeneous rating scales. The non-reporting of participant-oriented data and the reporting of heterogeneous scales of sometimes questionable validity are major obstacles when summing up data for assessment of clozapine effectiveness. There is a compelling need for an internationally agreed set of standardised outcomes for schizophrenia trials.</P>
<P>Data for assessing the effectiveness of clozapine in the long term are only beginning to accumulate. No good quality data are available for assessing the effectiveness of clozapine in special groups, such as those with learning disabilities. Also data on effects in elderly people are scarce, and further randomised studies are needed in this group of people.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>The large collection of trials reviewed here still leave many questions unanswered. Trials are not of high quality and are prone to considerable bias. Large pragmatic randomised, community-based trials that measure global outcomes such as healthy days, social functioning, satisfaction with treatment, ability to live and work in the community, and compliance are required, especially focusing on those whose illness is clearly difficult to treat. One suggested design is presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>We have added to the review a primary outcome - "no clinically important change in global state" as defined by the individual studies - this had not been clearly defined in the first versions of the review.</P>
<P>We have substantially reformatted this review in light of changes to software (RevMan 5).</P>
<P>We have analysed outcomes using relative risk (see <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>) - rather than odds ratios.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The 'Results' section states there is no significant difference in weight gain between clozapine and typical neuroleptics. This is contrary to the meta-analysis ('Adverse effects 5. Weight gain') which reveals a significant difference.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2009-08-17 15:48:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The weight gain data from four trials are heterogeneous. Thus we have employed random-effects statistics to include between-study variance in the pooled estimate. The pooled estimate and its 95% confidence interval using random-effects odds ratio is 1.07 (CI 0.37 to 3.10), which is not a significant difference. Due to the heterogeneity it would be incorrect to apply the Peto odds ratio (which the author of the comment appears to have done).</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-18 10:25:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). These criteria, which is based on the degree of allocation concealment. Poor concealment has been associated with overestimation of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Category A includes studies in which allocation has been randomised and concealment is explicit. Category B studies are those which have randomised allocation but in which concealment is not explicit. Category C studies are those in which allocation has neither been randomised nor concealed. Only trials that are stated to be randomised (categories A or B of the handbook) will be included in this review. The categories are defined below:</P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment).<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results).<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment).</P>
<P>Additionally, we assessed the methodological quality of included trials in this review using the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scale includes three items:</P>
<P>A. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>B. Was the study described as double-blind?<BR/>C. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop outs?</P>
<P>Each item receives one point if the answer is positive. In addition, a point can be deducted if either the randomisation or the blinding/masking procedures described are inadequate. For this review we used a cut-off of two points on the Jadad scale to check the assessment made by the handbook criteria. However, we did not use the Jadad Scale to exclude trials.</P>
<P>When disputes arose as to which category a trial should be allocated, again resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not possible we did not enter the data and the trial was added to the list of those awaiting assessment until further information could be obtained.</P>
