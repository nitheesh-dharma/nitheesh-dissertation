<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The abdominal aorta is the main artery supplying blood to the lower part of the body. An abnormal ballooning and weakening of the wall of the aorta (aortic aneurysm) can occur with age, particularly in older men. An aneurysm may progressively enlarge without obvious symptoms, yet it is potentially lethal as it can burst (rupture), causing massive internal bleeding. Death is inevitable unless the bleeding can be stopped and blood flow to the lower body promptly restored. Until recently this required an open operation (laparotomy) to clamp the abdominal aorta and replace the segment of the aorta with a synthetic artery tube-graft. Many patients do not survive this major operation due to the effects of massive bleeding or failure of vital organs, such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys, despite improvements in the surgical technique and care of the critically ill patient.</P>
<P>Endovascular treatment, a minimally invasive technique, allows the surgeon to pass a stent graft through the blood vessels from the groin to the site of rupture, where it is positioned and attached to the healthy artery above and below the aneurysm to stop bleeding and form a new channel for blood flow. This technique is successful in suitable patients for the planned treatment of non-ruptured aneurysms and can reduce early postoperative complications and deaths.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics and key results</B>
</P>
<P>The present review looked at the available evidence for endovascular repair effectiveness compared with open surgery for ruptured aneurysms. We included four studies with a total of 868 participants. Risk of bias was generally low, but one study was at high risk of selection bias due to their use of the block method of randomisation; one study did not adequately report randomisation methods; and two studies may not have included a sufficient number of participants to adequately answer the questions posed by the studies. We found that from the data currently available there appears to be no difference in death within 30 days of the procedure between endovascular repair and open repair. Endoleaks were reported in 44 participants from three studies. The data on complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, combined cardiac complications, renal complications, spinal cord ischaemia, reoperation, amputation, and respiratory failure) are not robust enough at this point to make any strong conclusions on superiority of either repair technique, but emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (eEVAR) may be associated with a lower risk of bowel ischaemia. No robust conclusion can be made on outcomes at six months or one year. More studies are needed to better understand whether or not one of the aneurysm repair techniques, endovascular or open surgical, is superior based on patient outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We found from the data available moderate-quality evidence suggesting there is no difference in 30-day mortality between eEVAR and open repair. Not enough information was provided for complications for us to make a well-informed conclusion, although it is possible that eEVAR is associated with a reduction in bowel ischaemia. We downgraded the quality of the evidence as some studies contained too few participants, not all studies reported on all complication outcomes, and the number of complications occurring between studies varied substantially.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:38:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (pathological enlargement of the aorta) is a condition that can occur as a person ages. It is most commonly seen in men older than 65 years of age. Progressive aneurysm enlargement can lead to rupture and massive internal bleeding, which is fatal unless timely repair can be achieved. Despite improvements in perioperative care, mortality remains high (approximately 50%) after conventional open surgical repair. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), a minimally invasive technique, has been shown to reduce early morbidity and mortality as compared to conventional open surgery for planned AAA repair. More recently emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (eEVAR) has been used successfully to treat ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA), proving that it is feasible in select patients; however, it is unclear if eEVAR will lead to significant improvements in outcomes for these patients or if indeed it can replace conventional open repair as the preferred treatment for this lethal condition. This is an update of the review first published in 2006.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:38:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the advantages and disadvantages of emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (eEVAR) in comparison with conventional open surgical repair for the treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA). This will be determined by comparing the effects of eEVAR and conventional open surgical repair on short-term mortality, major complication rates, aneurysm exclusion (specifically endoleaks in the eEVAR treatment group), and late complications.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:38:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included four randomised controlled trials in this review. A total of 868 participants with a clinical or radiological diagnosis of RAAA were randomised to receive either eEVAR or open surgical repair. Overall risk of bias was low, but we considered one study that performed randomisation in blocks by week and performed no allocation concealment and no blinding to be at high risk of selection bias. Another study did not adequately report random sequence generation, putting it at risk of selection bias, and two studies were underpowered. There was no clear evidence to support a difference between the two interventions for 30-day (or in-hospital) mortality (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.16; moderate-quality evidence). There were a total of 44 endoleak events in 128 participants from three studies (low-quality evidence). Thirty-day complication outcomes (myocardial infarction, stroke, composite cardiac complications, renal complications, severe bowel ischaemia, spinal cord ischaemia, reoperation, amputation, and respiratory failure) were reported in between one and three studies, therefore we were unable to draw a robust conclusion. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for myocardial infarction, renal complications, and respiratory failure due to imprecision, inconsistency, and risk of bias. Odds ratios for complications outcomes were OR 2.38 (95% CI 0.34 to 16.53; 139 participants; 2 studies; low-quality evidence) for myocardial infarction; OR 1.07 (95% CI 0.21 to 5.42; 255 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence) for renal complications; and OR 3.62 (95% CI 0.14 to 95.78; 32 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence) for respiratory failure. There was low-quality evidence of a reduction in bowel ischaemia in the eEVAR treatment group, but very few events were reported (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.94), and we downgraded the evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias. Six-month and one-year outcomes were evaluated in three studies, but only results from a single study could be used for each outcome, which showed no clear evidence of a difference between the interventions. We rated six-month mortality evidence as of moderate quality due to imprecision (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.98; 116 participants).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:38:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conclusions of this review are currently limited by the paucity of data. We found from the data available moderate-quality evidence suggesting there is no difference in 30-day mortality between eEVAR and open repair. Not enough information was provided for complications for us to make a well-informed conclusion, although it is possible that eEVAR is associated with a reduction in bowel ischaemia. Long-term data were lacking for both survival and late complications. More high-quality randomised controlled trials comparing eEVAR and open repair for the treatment of RAAA are needed to better understand if one method is superior to the other, or if there is no difference between the methods on relevant outcomes.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:39:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), the pathological enlargement of the main artery in the abdomen, affects around 1.34% of men in England (<LINK REF="REF-Jacomelli-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacomelli 2016</LINK>). The prevalence of AAA has been declining, which is independent of participant selection criteria and reflects better cardiovascular risk profiling and management in the overall population (<LINK REF="REF-Conway-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UK-NAAASP" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK NAAASP</LINK>). This is also seen elsewhere, with 2.2% prevalence in Sweden and 3.3% in Denmark (<LINK REF="REF-Svensj_x00f6_-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svensjö 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-S_x00f8_gaard-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Søgaard 2012</LINK>), due to reduced risk factors, in particular the rate of smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Svensj_x00f6_-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svensjö 2011</LINK>). The prevalence of AAA in men is approximately three times greater than in women, and the incidence increases with advancing age (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1995</LINK>). The cause of AAA is unknown, but its development is associated with many of the cardiovascular risk factors that predispose a person to atherosclerosis and arterial occlusive disease, perhaps most importantly tobacco smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Lederle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lederle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilmink-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilmink 1999</LINK>). Genetic factors are also important, as the risk of aneurysm development is significantly greater in relatives of those with a diagnosed AAA (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Vlijmen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Vlijmen 2002</LINK>). Unfortunately, many aneurysms progressively enlarge without overt symptoms, presenting only when the aneurysm ruptures, a catastrophic event causing massive internal bleeding that results in death in the majority of those affected.</P>
<P>The extremely high mortality rate from ruptured AAA (RAAA) is 80%, accounting for 2% of total deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Gorham-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorham 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nordon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veith 2003</LINK>). For those at risk of RAAA, the current in-hospital mortality rates in England are around 65%, and a postoperative mortality rate of 41.65% (<LINK REF="REF-Karthikesalingam-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karthikesalingam 2014</LINK>). Detailed risk analysis and scoring systems have been shown to predict non-survivors in certain groups, but individual patient outcomes cannot be accurately predicted. Clinicians have been reticent to rigidly apply these scoring systems, as to do so would serve to preclude most patients with RAAA from surgical repair, condemning them to certain death (<LINK REF="REF-Alsac-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alsac 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korhonen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korhonen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neary-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neary 2003</LINK>). It is also now clear that those people who undergo successful open repair of RAAA enjoy a postoperative quality of life similar to the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Hinterseher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hinterseher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tambyraja-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tambyraja 2004</LINK>). Indeed, the long-term survival of RAAA patients after successful repair is the same as for elective repair patients (<LINK REF="REF-Mani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mani 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Randomised controlled trials and a Cochrane review have shown that mortality can be reduced by mass population ultrasound screening in men, with early detection and intervention preventing future rupture and aneurysm-related mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Ashton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cosford-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosford 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 2004</LINK>). The risk of aneurysm rupture has been shown to be proportional to aneurysm size, with aneurysms measuring less than 5.4 cm having an annual rupture rate of approximately 1%, whereas those greater than 7.0 cm in diameter have an annual rupture rate of 32.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Gorham-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorham 2004</LINK>). The UK Small Aneurysm Trial has shown that, in general, people benefit from aneurysm repair when the maximum aneurysm diameter exceeds 5.5 cm, at which stage the risk of spontaneous rupture exceeds the risks of conventional open surgical repair (<LINK REF="REF-Greenhalgh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenhalgh 1998</LINK>). In addition, two randomised controlled trials showed no difference in outcome in participants that received intervention of small aneurysms (less than 5.5 cm) compared with participants that received surveillance at that size (<LINK REF="REF-CAESAR-Trial" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAESAR Trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PIVOTAL-Trial" TYPE="REFERENCE">PIVOTAL Trial</LINK>). With the prevalence of AAA much lower in women, there is less robust data regarding the ideal size of aneurysm for treatment, but it is currently recommended that women receive intervention at 5 cm, which is 5 mm smaller than that which is recommended for men (<LINK REF="REF-Moll-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moll 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:39:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Historically, conventional open surgical repair was the only effective treatment for AAA, which involved open surgical exposure of the aorta and replacement of the aneurysm with a synthetic tube-graft. This complex major operation carries a significant morbidity and mortality due to the combined effects of surgical exposure, haemorrhage, and aortic clamping with related lower body ischaemia-reperfusion injury. However, with improvements in patient selection and perioperative care, excellent results can now be achieved with open repair; some specialist centres report mortality rates of less than 2%, and surgeons in non-specialist units achieve mortality rates of 5% to 8% (<LINK REF="REF-Gorham-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorham 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenhalgh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenhalgh 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veith 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the last two decades this approach to treatment of patients with AAA has been challenged by the arrival of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), a minimally-invasive technique. The EVAR technique was introduced to Western surgical practice by Parodi in 1991 (<LINK REF="REF-Parodi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parodi 1991</LINK>). He described the placement of a homemade, material-covered metal stent across an abdominal aneurysm to exclude this from the circulation and to form a new channel for blood flow. The stent is delivered to the aorta from a remote accessible vessel such as the femoral artery at the groin. Since this seminal report, outcomes have progressively improved with significant advancements in commercial stent design, delivery, and the implantation technique (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2005</LINK>). Since the inception of the EVAR technique, many specialised vascular surgery centres have adopted its use in the elective treatment of AAA, where its use has contributed to a reduction in early postoperative morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-EVAR-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EVAR 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prinssen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prinssen 2004</LINK>). In many countries it has now become established in most centres as the primary mode of aneurysm repair (<LINK REF="REF-Mani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mani 2011</LINK>). A recent Cochrane review showed improved short-term mortality for EVAR compared with open repair, but no difference for medium- and long-term mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Paravastu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paravastu 2014</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:39:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Modern aortic stent grafts are available in a range of sizes and can be custom designed. The addition of fenestrations and side-branches can adapt the stent to suit encountered difficult anatomical variations. These modular devices are most commonly delivered remotely by open exposure of the femoral arteries and are broadly described as the aorto-uni-iliac (single-lumen) graft and aorto-bi-iliac (bifurcated-lumen) graft. The minimally invasive nature of this technique allows it to be performed under regional or even local anaesthesia rather than general anaesthesia. In recent years minimally invasive percutaneous deployment of stent under local anaesthesia has become popular, and routine in some centres. This increases the availability of the technique to those patients with significant concomitant medical disease who may otherwise have been considered unfit for surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Lachat-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lachat 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veith 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two large prospective randomised controlled trials have compared EVAR with conventional open repair for the treatment of large AAAs and have shown significant reductions in early complications and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-EVAR-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EVAR 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prinssen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prinssen 2004</LINK>). However, whilst endovascular repair for unruptured AAA clearly has a role in 'healthy' patients, these trials have also reinforced the knowledge that open repair is a successful technique and will remain a common form of treatment for patients presenting with a large AAA for whom EVAR is unsuitable on anatomical grounds or due to other factors (<LINK REF="REF-EVAR-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EVAR 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EVAR-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EVAR 2005</LINK>). Long-term results from the EVAR 1 trial revealed later ruptures in the EVAR group, and therefore short-term benefit to EVAR, but no long-term difference in all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2012</LINK>). Furthermore, it is now clear that those patients who are unfit for open surgical repair can expect such a high mortality rate from their comorbid disease that even successful EVAR of their aneurysm is unlikely to alter their overall prognosis and life expectancy, which remains guarded (<LINK REF="REF-EVAR2-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EVAR2 2005</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:39:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a catastrophic event that is occurring with increasing frequency as our population ages. Despite improved surgical techniques and advances in intensive care support, RAAA mortality was static for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Adam-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adam 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huber-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huber 1995</LINK>). However, in recent years it has improved, with large-volume centres associated with the improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Karthikesalingam-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karthikesalingam 2014</LINK>). The high mortality associated with open repair has led many to look for alternative treatments for the management of RAAA. Several studies have confirmed that the use of EVAR, especially under local anaesthesia, reduces the physiological insult to the body as compared to conventional open surgical repair (<LINK REF="REF-Cuypers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuypers 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peppelenbosch-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Peppelenbosch 2003</LINK>). The EVAR technique has been successfully used in the planned treatment of non-ruptured aneurysms of the abdominal aorta and, when compared to conventional open surgical repair, has been shown to reduce early postoperative complications and death. Emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (eEVAR) has been successfully carried out using a variety of protocols and techniques and would appear to offer a feasible alternative to conventional open repair in select patients (<LINK REF="STD-Peppelenbosch-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Peppelenbosch 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Sambeek-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Sambeek 2002</LINK>). In this review we have assessed the available evidence to support the use of eEVAR to treat RAAA.</P>

<P>We evaluated the <LINK REF="STD-ECAR" TYPE="STUDY">ECAR</LINK> study as being at high risk for selection bias, as they used a block randomisation technique by week with no allocation concealment.

For intention-to-treat purposes, we included all deaths that occurred after randomisation, which may have included deaths before intervention and perioperative deaths.

This could be due to the 13% of randomised participants in the <LINK REF="STD-IMPROVE" TYPE="STUDY">IMPROVE</LINK> study who were found not to have RAAA (10 participants had no AAA; 45 had asymptomatic AAA or other final diagnoses; and 22 had symptomatic non-ruptured AAA); also, 84 participants randomised to eEVAR were determined unsuitable for the procedure and moved to open repair but were not considered as open-conversion participants.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:41:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included four studies in this review with a total of 868 participants randomised to receive either eEVAR or open repair to treat an RAAA. All four studies reported on short-term mortality, defined as either 30-day or in-hospital; the meta-analysis found no significant difference between eEVAR and open repair. Only three studies reported 30-day complications (low-quality evidence), and many of the individual 30-day complication outcomes were only reported in a single study. We rated the evidence for myocardial infarction, renal complications, and respiratory failure as low quality. Bowel ischaemia was the only complication with a statistically significant association, favouring eEVAR (low-quality evidence). Three studies reported longer-term outcomes, mortality and complications at six months and one year, but we evaluated only two by meta-analysis (one at six months and one at one year). We could not determine a conclusion regarding either of the long-term outcomes with such a paucity of data. We evaluated evidence for six-month mortality as of moderate quality. Only a single study evaluated quality of life, from which no conclusions could be drawn. Three studies reported cost per patient, but only a single study could be evaluated for analysis, with a slight decrease in cost for participants randomised to eEVAR.</P>
<P>At present we are unable to draw any significant conclusions regarding the superiority of either of the interventions for mortality and complication outcomes. Hopefully with further high-quality studies being undertaken evaluating eEVAR versus open repair for RAAA we will better understand if there is truly no difference between these two interventions regarding the outcomes evaluated in this review, or if we simply do not have enough data at this time to determine any differences.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:42:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The four studies included in this review were of good quality, with the exception of an assessment of high risk of selection bias for a single study. The evidence gathered using the four studies can be considered relevant, however insufficient data make any conclusions spurious at this time. There was little information to support an association for the outcomes addressed in this review, and our other outcomes of interest, such as minor complications, were not acknowledged within the studies.</P>
<P>All four included studies required a clinical or radiological diagnosis of RAAA for inclusion in the study, yet the <LINK REF="STD-IMPROVE" TYPE="STUDY">IMPROVE</LINK> study, upon commencement of intervention, found that 13% of their included randomised participants did not have RAAA: 10 participants had no AAA; 45 had asymptomatic AAA or other final diagnoses; and 22 had symptomatic non-ruptured AAA; the study authors claimed this was a more "real world" approach to the issue. While this may not affect the overall outcomes, it is of concern and should be kept in mind. Also, the <LINK REF="STD-IMPROVE" TYPE="STUDY">IMPROVE</LINK> trial did not assess eEVAR suitability prior to randomisation, which resulted in 84 participants randomised to eEVAR not being suitable for the procedure and transferred to open repair. <LINK REF="STD-Hinchliffe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hinchliffe 2006</LINK> also did not select participants for their suitability for both eEVAR and open repair prior to randomisation, and one participant randomised to eEVAR was transferred to open repair. The <LINK REF="STD-AJAX" TYPE="STUDY">AJAX</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ECAR" TYPE="STUDY">ECAR</LINK> trials evaluated a more select population of participants suitable for both eEVAR and open repair. Consequently, there are two separate questions being addressed in the trials, namely if an EVAR strategy for all RAAAs would work (<LINK REF="STD-IMPROVE" TYPE="STUDY">IMPROVE</LINK>), or if EVAR-suitable patients are better treated thus or by open surgery (<LINK REF="STD-AJAX" TYPE="STUDY">AJAX</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECAR" TYPE="STUDY">ECAR</LINK>). Such issues are emphasised by the <LINK REF="STD-IMPROVE" TYPE="STUDY">IMPROVE</LINK> trial's findings that aortic morphology, specifically neck length, has an effect on patient outcome. For our review analysis we found a paucity of subgroup data, which meant that we were unable to carry out any of the planned subgroup analyses, and it was therefore not possible to assess in detail whether certain patient groups may benefit more from EVAR or open surgery. With future updates of this review we hope more detailed subgroup data will be made available so we can provide a more robust analysis.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-05-19 13:25:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the update of this review 868 participants from four trials of good quality have been included for analysis. Risk of bias of the included studies was generally low, but one study used a block randomisation technique by week with no allocation concealment and was unblinded, leading to a high risk of selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-ECAR" TYPE="STUDY">ECAR</LINK>). Another study did not adequately report random sequence generation (<LINK REF="STD-Hinchliffe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hinchliffe 2006</LINK>), putting it at risk of selection bias. The same two studies were underpowered as per their own calculations reported by the study authors (<LINK REF="STD-ECAR" TYPE="STUDY">ECAR</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hinchliffe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hinchliffe 2006</LINK>), leading to an unclear risk of other bias. The data from these four studies are insufficient for us to be able to draw any robust conclusions about the outcomes evaluated in this review regarding the comparison of eEVAR and open repair for the treatment of RAAA.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence according to GRADE varied by outcome and was assessed as moderate to low. Several outcomes had issues with heterogeneity, leading to inconsistency, and most outcomes included few participants or events, leading to imprecision. We were unable to evaluate the outcome of endoleaks using meta-analysis as it occurs only in the eEVAR treatment group, but we found significant heterogeneity in the reported events in each of the three reporting trials. This outcome remains an important factor for success for eEVAR and should be evaluated in future trials. For the outcomes that had a majority of participants from the <LINK REF="STD-ECAR" TYPE="STUDY">ECAR</LINK> study, we downgraded for risk of bias as the study did not have adequate random sequence generation and allocation concealment techniques. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The outcomes from the <LINK REF="STD-Hinchliffe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hinchliffe 2006</LINK> study used in our review were gathered from descriptions within the text of the publication and were not presented in a table.

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:42:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment in order to reduce bias and subjectivity. We are confident that all potential sources of data to be included in this review were carefully vetted. However, the possibility remains that there exist relevant data that we did not include in this review, which were not published or were not found in the search.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:42:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To our knowledge this is the first systematic review evaluating only studies that are prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing eEVAR with open repair in people with RAAA. Other studies, including several systematic reviews, have addressed eEVAR versus open repair in people with RAAA, but these have been mostly observational, non-randomised studies, many of which were retrospective. These types of studies are more likely to be subject to bias compared with RCTs.</P>
<P>A systematic review from 2007 included 10 studies, all of which were observational studies, using as their inclusion criteria that there was a comparison between people who underwent eEVAR and people who underwent open surgery; a minimum of five participants in each treatment group; data available on patients' haemodynamic condition at presentation; and availability of 30-day mortality data (<LINK REF="REF-Visser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visser 2007</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-Visser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visser 2007</LINK> review did not include any of the studies included in our systematic review. A crude random-effects model for 30-day mortality, comparing eEVAR with open repair, found an OR of 0.45 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.72), and when the patient haemodynamic condition at presentation, which varied between studies, was included in the model, the adjusted OR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.31 to 1.44; P = 0.37). These results indicate that both eEVAR and open repair are suitable for treatment of people with RAAA, and that eEVAR may have a higher 30-day survival. The crude and adjusted ORs showed a stronger relationship between eEVAR and lower mortality than did our results for the 30-day mortality outcome, which showed no difference between the two interventions. The <LINK REF="REF-Visser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visser 2007</LINK> review also evaluated a composite systemic complications outcome, which found a lower point estimate within the eEVAR group (28%, 95% CI 17% to 48%) compared with open repair (56%, 95% CI 37% to 85%), indicating fewer complications within the eEVAR group. We did not have sufficient data on complications in our review to compare with these results, and we did not include a composite systemic complications outcome.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-Takagi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takagi 2011</LINK> meta-analysis included 11 RCTs or risk-adjusted observational studies with a total of 42,888 participants. The inclusion criteria for this review required studies to be RCTs or risk-adjusted observational comparative studies with acceptable risk-adjustment methods (propensity score analyses or multivariate logistic regression); the study population be people with RAAA; participants were assigned to eEVAR or open repair; and outcomes include in-hospital or 30-day mortality. This review included one RCT, which we also included in our review, and 10 observational studies. The random-effects model found a statistically significantly OR of 0.49 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.69; P &lt; 0.001). While our mortality results showed little difference in mortality between eEVAR and open repair, the <LINK REF="REF-Takagi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takagi 2011</LINK> study showed a strong relationship between eEVAR and lower mortality.</P>
<P>The findings of another meta-analysis also reflect these results (<LINK REF="REF-Qin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qin 2014</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Qin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qin 2014</LINK> included a total of 18 studies, of which 12 were retrospective, four were prospective but with observational or retrospective components, and two were RCTs, which were also included in our review. This review demonstrated a lower mortality (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.67; P &lt; 0.001) and shorter length of stay in the eEVAR group (mean difference -5.25 days, 95% CI -9.23 to -1.26; P = 0.010), which differed from our own conclusion of no difference between the two interventions. However, the heterogeneity of study designs in the meta-analysis significantly detracts from the quality of the results and conclusions.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis performed by <LINK REF="REF-van-Beek-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Beek 2014</LINK> also attempted to evaluate the effects of eEVAR versus open surgery for RAAA on 30-day or in-hospital mortality. This review included RCTs as well as observational studies and administrative registries. The three RCTs included by <LINK REF="REF-van-Beek-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Beek 2014</LINK> were the same as those included in this Cochrane review, therefore their OR was nearly identical to ours for 30-day or in-hospital mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.24; P = 0.966). The 21 observational studies and eight administrative registries included by <LINK REF="REF-van-Beek-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Beek 2014</LINK> showed reduced mortality in the eEVAR group, which reflects the meta-analyses described above that also included observational studies.</P>
<P>A recent literature review and meta-analysis included 41 studies, of which two were RCTs and the remaining studies were observational, population-based studies, with a total of 59,941 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Antoniou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoniou 2013</LINK>). The two RCTs were also included in our review. <LINK REF="REF-Antoniou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoniou 2013</LINK> included studies if they compared perioperative outcomes of eEVAR and open repair of ruptured infrarenal or juxtarenal AAA, and included all types of comparative studies. Using a random-effects model, the review authors found a statistically significant lower mortality for participants who underwent eEVAR compared with open repair (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.64; P &lt; 0.001). The mortality outcome of the <LINK REF="REF-Antoniou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoniou 2013</LINK> review shows a strong mortality odds reduction for the eEVAR group, whereas our review found little difference between the eEVAR and open-repair groups. The <LINK REF="REF-Antoniou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antoniou 2013</LINK> study also showed a lower risk for many of the complications evaluated in those who underwent eEVAR, such as respiratory complications (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.69; P &lt; 0.001) and acute renal failure (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78; P &lt; 0.001), as well as trends towards lower risk in the eEVAR group, however statistically insignificant, of lower limb ischaemia (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.07; P = 0.09) and mesenteric ischaemia (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.00; P = 0.05). The authors also evaluated cardiac complications, but mistakenly measured risk difference (RD) instead of OR and showed a borderline statistically significant RD favouring eEVAR (RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.00; P = 0.05). We were unable to compare the findings for the complications outcomes in our review as data were insufficient for us to be able to make any definitive conclusions.</P>
<P>A recent individual patient data meta-analysis was conducted from three RCTs evaluating mortality at 30 days, 90 days, and one year after receiving either eEVAR or open repair for RAAA (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeting-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeting 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sweeting-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeting 2015a</LINK>). The three studies included in this meta-analysis were also included in our review (<LINK REF="STD-AJAX" TYPE="STUDY">AJAX</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECAR" TYPE="STUDY">ECAR</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IMPROVE" TYPE="STUDY">IMPROVE</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Sweeting-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeting 2015</LINK> calculated very similar results to our own, with no difference in mortality at 30 days (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.18), also finding no difference at 90 days (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.13). There was still no difference in mortality between the treatment groups at one year (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.11) (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeting-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeting 2015a</LINK>), which was similar to our own findings, but we were only able to include the data from a single study (<LINK REF="STD-IMPROVE" TYPE="STUDY">IMPROVE</LINK>).</P>

<P>The conclusions of this review are currently limited by the paucity of data. From the data available we found moderate-quality evidence of no difference between eEVAR and open repair for the primary outcome evaluated in this review, 30-day or in-hospital mortality. Not enough information was provided for complications for us to be able to make well-informed conclusions at this time, although there was some evidence of reduced bowel ischaemia in the emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (eEVAR) treatment group. Long-term data are lacking for both survival and late complications.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:42:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further trials are required to evaluate the role of eEVAR in the treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. These trials should be methodologically adequate in terms of sample sizes, treatment standardisation, and duration of follow-up. Clinically relevant outcomes such as rate of major complications, open conversion, aneurysm exclusion, endoleak, rupture, and mortality should be addressed. Long-term results on survival and secondary interventions will also be an important aspect of future results. However, accumulating evidence from non-randomised studies, which shows significant reductions in mortality in select patients deemed suitable for endovascular repair, may raise ethical concerns with regard to randomising these patients to open repair. Large prospective studies are required to validate the acceptable anatomical criteria for eEVAR in ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Furthermore, longitudinal studies are required to assess the long-term durability of this form of treatment in terms of re-intervention rate, open-conversion rate, and rupture-free survival. There are indications that eEVAR patients have a higher rate of discharge to home with associated enhanced quality of life, and also that aortic morphology could be important for outcomes. Due to a paucity of data for our review we were unable to undertake any subgroup analysis that could illuminate if certain patient groups may benefit more from one or the other intervention. This is of vital interest to patients and deserves more attention in future research. Finally, as EVAR device technology improves, outcome differences may emerge in future research.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:43:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In order to reflect the nature of the diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, we rephrased 'clinical diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm' to 'clinical and radiological diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm'. We also clarified the 'Types of participants' section.</P>
<P>We added a new outcome, 'complications and mortality long term (longer than six months); we sought re-intervention rates for problems related to the ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm as well as cause of death with or without re-intervention, that is device-related', as we expect these data will become available in the future.</P>
<P>We rephrased the outcome 'aneurysm exclusion' to 'endoleak', as this previously used term was vague and found to be misleading.</P>

<P>We agree we have misinterpreted the 77 participants that were randomised but did not actually have a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, which was discovered at commencement of the intervention. We have amended the text in the locations where we discuss this aspect of the IMPROVE trial using the data supplied by Professor Janet Powell.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2017-06-22 10:24:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We were pleased to see the updated Cochrane Review of &#8220;Endovascular Treatment for Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm&#8221; by Badger et al. (DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005261). However, we hoped that there might be an opportunity to correct some of the inaccuracies, relating mainly to IMPROVE but also to some aspects of the AJAX and ECAR trials.</P>
<P>1 Page 9, Sensitivity analyses. The first sentence should start &#8220;Although all the participants in the IMPROVE trial had a clinical diagnosis of RAAA&#8221;. In the second sentence one of the clauses should read &#8220;45 had asymptomatic AAA and other final diagnoses&#8221;.</P>
<P>2 Page 14 Open Conversion. The information regarding IMPROVE is incorrect. Currently it reads &#8220;IMPROVE study reported four out of the 316 (1.3%) randomised participants&#8221;. In fact, open conversion occurred in 5/186 EVARs (four in the endovascular strategy group and one in the open repair group) in the IMPROVE trial. Therefore the use of 1.3% is incorrect.</P>
<P>3 Page 14 Bowel ischaemia. The data for the IMPROVE trial, by randomized group, are given in the reference Sweeting et al 2015.</P>
<P>4 Page 15, Mortality and complications at 6 months or longer. As is evident from Sweeting et al 2015 and 2015a, we hold all the data for AJAX, ECAR and IMPROVE. No one contacted us with a data request for the ECAR or AJAX trials. The mortality data to 5 years for AJAX, by randomized group, also are available in van Beek SC et al. Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg 2015;49:661-668</P>
<P>5 Page 15 Quality of life. The authors appear to have missed the fact that the IMPROVE trial one year results provided EQ5D data at both 3 and 12 months (Eur Heart J 2015;36:2061-9, although the listing of authors is incorrect).</P>
<P>6 Page 28, Characteristics of included studies. The study aim of the trial is listed incorrectly. It should read &#8220;Study aim: to assess whether an endovascular strategy versus open repair reduces early mortality for people with suspected RAAA&#8221;.</P>
<P>We would be pleased to help with amending these inaccuracies and they may have some bearing on the Discussion and Implications sections.</P>
