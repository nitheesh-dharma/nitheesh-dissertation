<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-28 09:30:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous leg ulcers (open wounds on the lower leg) can be caused by a blockage or breakdown in the veins of the legs. Compression, using bandages or hosiery (stockings), can help heal most of these ulcers and is also widely used after healing to prevent ulcers returning. One small trial confirms that compression reduces ulcer recurrence compared with no compression. There is some evidence that people wearing high rather than moderate-compression hosiery are less likely to get a new ulcer. It is not clear whether moderate strength hosiery is better tolerated than high compression. There is, therefore, some evidence that compression hosiery might prevent ulcers, but the evidence is not strong.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-16 14:11:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Up to 1% of adults will have a leg ulcer at some time. The majority of leg ulcers are venous in origin and are caused by high pressure in the veins due to blockage or weakness of the valves in the veins of the leg. Prevention and treatment of venous ulcers is aimed at reducing the pressure either by removing/repairing the veins, or by applying compression bandages/stockings to reduce the pressure in the veins.</P>
<P>The majority of venous ulcers heal with compression bandages, however ulcers frequently recur. Clinical guidelines therefore recommend that people continue to wear compression, usually in the form of hosiery (tights, stockings, socks) after their ulcer heals, to prevent recurrence. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-06-28 09:22:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of compression (socks, stockings, tights, bandages) in preventing the recurrence of venous ulcers. If compression does prevent ulceration compared with no compression, then to identify whether there is evidence to recommend particular levels of compression (high, medium or low, for example), types of compression, or brands of compression to prevent ulcer recurrence after healing.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-28 09:45:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials (979 participants) were eligible for inclusion in this review. One trial in patients with recently healed venous ulcers (n = 153) compared recurrence rates with and without compression and found that compression significantly reduced ulcer recurrence at six months (Risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.76). </P>
<P>Two trials compared high-compression hosiery (equivalent to UK class 3) with moderate-compression hosiery (equivalent to UK class 2). The first study (n=300) found no significant reduction in recurrence at five years follow up with high-compression hosiery compared with moderate-compression (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.12). The second study (n = 338) assessed ulcer recurrence at three years follow up and found that high-compression hosiery reduced recurrence compared with moderate-compression (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.81). Statistically significant heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis of the results from these studies. Patient-reported compliance rates were reported in both trials;,there was significantly higher compliance with medium-compression than with high-compression hosiery in one and no significant difference in the second. </P>
<P>A fourth trial (166 patients) found no statistically significant difference in recurrence between two types of medium (UK class 2) compression hosiery (Medi versus Scholl: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.2).</P>
<P>No trials of compression bandages for preventing ulcer recurrence were identified.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-06-28 09:44:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence from one trial that compression hosiery reduces rates of reulceration of venous ulcers compared with no compression. Results from one trial suggest that recurrence is lower in high-compression hosiery than in medium-compression hosiery at three years whilst another trial found no difference at 5 years. Rates of patient intolerance of compression hosiery were high. There is insufficient evidence to aid selection of different types, brands, or lengths of compression hosiery.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-28 10:08:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-03-28 10:02:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>Venous ulceration is a chronic recurring condition. Callam found that 45% of people with ulcers in a study in Scotland had open leg ulcers for more than 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1985</LINK>). There is a considerable cost to the patient in terms of prescription charges (dressings, drugs and bandages), increased laundry bills due to discharge from the ulcer, time off work attending nurse/doctor consultations, and pain, isolation and distress (<LINK REF="REF-Charles-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charles 1995</LINK>). The treatment of leg ulceration is extremely costly to the health service (the UK NHS was estimated to have spent £300 million in 1992), mainly in terms of nursing time (<LINK REF="REF-Bosanquet-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosanquet 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Around 1% of adults in industrialised countries are affected by leg ulceration at some time in their life (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1991</LINK>). Around three-quarters of leg ulcers are caused by changes in the blood flow in the veins of the legs. These changes are caused by blockage (occlusion) and/or weakness in the valves of the veins (venous incompetence) (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1985</LINK>). The resulting ulcers are known as venous, stasis or varicose ulcers.</P>
<P>Occlusion and/or incompetence of the veins in the legs leads to increased pressure in the veins. This can sometimes be seen as distended, tortuous (varicose) veins. Increased pressure in the veins may cause varicose eczema, oedema in the lower leg, and deposition of scar tissue (fibrin) and iron pigments in the skin. This may lead to breakdown of the skin, or can delay healing if the leg is injured.</P>
<P>Both treatment of venous ulcers and prevention of recurrence aims to reduce the pressure in the veins. This can be accomplished by surgical removal of superficial or perforating veins (or both) or blocking any incompetent veins by injecting an irritant solution (sclerotherapy) or by applying compression to reduce the pressure. Not all patients are suitable for, or agree to, venous surgery. Surgery on the deep veins is experimental, unevaluated and not widely practised.</P>
<P>Until recently the main aim of venous ulcer care has been to heal the ulcer. The use of high-compression bandaging has increased ulcer healing rates and the use of these bandages is widespread (<LINK REF="REF-Cullum-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullum 2000</LINK>). Increased success in treating venous ulcers has meant that more patients are at risk of ulcer recurrence. Twelve-month recurrence rates range between 26% and 69% (<LINK REF="REF-Monk-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monk 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vowden-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-03-28 10:08:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>There are many ways of applying compression, e.g. bandages, compression stockings or combinations of bandages and/or stockings. The interpretation of comparisons between compression systems is complicated by the lack of internationally agreed standards.</P>
<P>In the UK, stockings are classified according to the amount of force required to stretch them and hence the level of compression they can apply to a limb (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Even in the UK it appears that different specifications apply to hosiery supplied through hospitals and via community pharmacists. In addition, different classification systems are used in other countries. An international collaboration is developing an agreed classification of compression devices for use in clinical studies (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2008</LINK>).</P>

We reported estimates for dichotomous outcomes (e.g. number of ulcers reported) as risk ratio (RR).Continuous data would have been reported as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. and standardised mean difference (SMD) if different measures used. Methods of synthesising the studies depended on their quality, design and heterogeneity. We explored both clinical and statistical heterogeneity. In the absence of clinical and statistical heterogeneity (as identified by an I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic less than 50%) we applied a fixed-effect model to pool data. In the presence of statistical heterogeneity (as estimated by a I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic between 59 and 75%) we applied a random-effects model for meta-analysis (Higgins 2003). Where synthesis was inappropriate we undertook a narrative overview, for example in the presence of significant statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>of more than 75%), or of clinical heterogeneity.</P>

<P>Four trials met the review criteria. There was no disagreement between review authors in selection of included/excluded studies.</P>
<P>HOW THE RESULTS ARE PRESENTED AND WHAT THE TERMS MEAN</P>
<P>Results of dichotomous variables are presented as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
<P>Risk ratio of recurrence is the ulcer recurrence rate in the experimental group divided by the ulcer recurrence rate in the control group and indicates the likelihood of an ulcer recurring with the experimental compression compared with a control treatment (no compression or an alternative). By definition the risk of an ulcer recurring in the control group is 1, so the risk ratio reduction associated with using the experimental stocking is 1-RR. The risk ratio indicates the relative benefit of a therapy but not the actual benefit, i.e. it does not take into account the number of people who would have had an ulcer recurrence anyway. The absolute risk reduction (ARR) can be calculated by subtracting the recurrence rate in the experimental group from the recurrence rate in the control group. The ARR tells us how much the decrease in recurrence is due to the stocking, and its inverse is the number needed to treat, or NNT. Thus a recurrence rate of 50% with a control treatment, which decreased to 30% with an experimental stocking, translates into an ARR of 50% - 30% = 20% (0.5 - 0.3 = 0.2). The NNT is the inverse of 20% (or 0.2) and this is 5. In other words five patients would need to receive the experimental stocking to prevent one additional leg ulcer from developing.</P>
<P>The results are presented with reference to the original questions posed by the review:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Does the application of compression bandages or hosiery prevent recurrence after venous ulcers heal?</HEADING>
<P>We identified one study that compared ulcer recurrence in people with and without compression. The trial was set up to assess the effect of compression stockings in reducing the area of lipodermatosclerosis in patients with previous venous ulceration and also reported recurrence rates with and without compression (<LINK REF="STD-Vandongen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vandongen 2000</LINK>). It found that compression with high compression hosiery (class 3: Venosan 2003) significantly reduced ulcer recurrence compared with no compression at six months follow up (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.76, p=0.003, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). These trialists also reported reulceration at 12 months however we have not reported or analysed this due to the high attrition bias (only 22 participants out of 72 randomised to the stocking arm were analysed at 12 months compared with 24 out of 81 randomised to the non-stocking arm; patients were withdrawn from the stocking arm if they did not wear their stockings (16/72) and their outcomes are not reported). </P>
<P>In a trial comparing two brands of UK class 2 compression hosiery, <LINK REF="STD-Franks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 1995</LINK> also report recurrence in compliant and non compliant people. It is not clear if this comparison was pre-specified and the likely presence of selection bias means that their comparison of wearing or not wearing compression hosiery is an observational study rather than a trial of compression per se. <LINK REF="STD-Franks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 1995</LINK> found a higher recurrence rate in partially and non-compliant patients (10/25 with partial compliance versus 1/4 with non-compliance versus 43/136 with full compliance). The study also reported greater recurrence in participants who were excluded from the trial as they were unable to wear compression stockings compared with all those who wore compression (11/17 in those excluded versus 58/171 with compression; RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.33 to 5.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Franks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 1995</LINK>). This trial provides some indirect evidence that compression reduces recurrence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. If compression prevents recurrence, what is the optimal level of compression?</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2006</LINK>) with 300 patients, followed up every four months for five years, compared ulcer recurrence rates in patients allocated to moderate (UK Class 2) or high (UK class 3) compression hosiery. There was no statistically significant difference in recurrence rates (39% with Class 2 versus 32% with Class 3; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.12, p=0.22) at five years (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). A second study with three-year follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Milic-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2010</LINK>) found significantly reduced ulcer recurrence with high (UK Class 3) compared with moderate (UK Class 2) compression hosiery (RR 0.57, 95% 0.39 to 0.81, p=0.002) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). It was not appropriate to pool these two studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 92%) and there is insufficient information reported in <LINK REF="STD-Milic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2007</LINK> to allow potential explanations for the heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Milic-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2010</LINK> also reported patient compliance with stockings; in <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2006</LINK> the compliance was patient reported however the in <LINK REF="STD-Milic-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2010</LINK> it is unclear how compliance data were collected). <LINK REF="STD-Milic-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2010</LINK> reported no significant difference in compliance between Class 2 and Class 3 (high-compression) hosiery. <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2006</LINK> reported significantly greater compliance with UK Class 2 hosiery than with UK Class 3 hosiery (RR of non-compliance with Class 2 compared with Class 3; 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.96) <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-06-28 09:37:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-systematic reviews of the literature invariably state that compression hosiery reduces the recurrence of venous leg ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Capeheart-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capeheart 1996</LINK>). A small study in this review found that compression can reduce recurrence of venous ulcers for up to 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Vandongen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vandongen 2000</LINK>) but in this trial ulcer recurrence was not the primary outcome (reduction in area of lipodermatosclerosis was) and there were also high rates of attrition and probable attrition bias. The use of compression after venous ulcer healing is now widespread and further trials with a non-compression comparison group are unlikely. There is evidence that people who fail to comply with compression hosiery have higher recurrence rates than those who do comply but this finding is less robust evidence of the effectiveness of compression than direct comparisons within randomised controlled trials would be.</P>
<P>The trials reporting the relative benefits of medium or high compression hosiery reported only event rates at trial completion, and not time to recurrence. Without such analysis it is not clear whether the contradictory results for these two trials are a consequence of the difference in the length of follow up. As recurrence of an ulcer is likely after healing, and this risk does not reduce, then a very long follow-up period would potentially miss clinically important differences in effectiveness. This would occur if a high compression sock delayed recurrence for significantly longer than a moderate compression sock, but by 5 years the differences in effects size was reduced. Therefore future studies need to report not only the risk of recurrence at study follow-up points, but also the time to recurrence, as this is likely to be important to patients and clinicians.</P>
<P>The trials by Nelson, Franks and Vandongen were conducted in different settings: hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2006</LINK>) and community (<LINK REF="STD-Franks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandongen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vandongen 2000</LINK>). The setting of <LINK REF="STD-Milic-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2010</LINK> is unclear. The Nelson study defined a recurrence as a break in the skin lasting for six weeks. Franks and Milic do not describe their definition of recurrence and Vandongen defines recurrence as any break in the skin between the ankle and the knee. These differences may account for some of the variation between studies. Two trials were conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and used stockings which are approved for use by the UK Drug Tariff. It is unclear whether these results can be extrapolated to other countries where standards for stockings are different.</P>
<P>Given the prevalence of venous disease and the relatively large number of trials of compression for the treatment of ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Cullum-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullum 2000</LINK>) it is disappointing that so few trials appear to have been undertaken for the use of compression to prevent ulcer recurrence. Additional trials may have been carried out but are unpublished and their impact on these results is unknown. Prospective registration of trials would reduce any potential publication bias.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-06-28 09:46:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-06-28 09:37:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High compression hosiery appears to be more effective in reducing recurrence from venous leg ulceration than no compression. There is some evidence that high-compression hosiery is more effective than moderate-compression in prevention of ulcer recurrence in the medium term although less clear in the long term. Compliance is lower in people wearing high-compression stockings and a possible strategy would be to prescribe the highest level of compression that people will tolerate (at least UK Class 2).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-06-28 09:46:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More research is needed regarding acceptable modes of long-term compression therapy for people at risk of recurrent venous ulceration. Future trials need to consider interventions to help people wear compression since there is evidence that compression is effective in reducing re-ulceration but that a high proportion of patients are disinclined to wear it. Indepth qualitative research is needed to understand the patients perspective and explain low rates of concordance. </P>
<P>Future trials of maintenance compression therapy and interventions to promote concordance:</P>
<UL>
<LI>should be large enough to detect clinically important differences in recurrence.</LI>
<LI>should define ulcer recurrence clearly as there may be small skin breaks due to varicose eczema that can be confused with a true ulcer recurrence.</LI>
<LI>report co interventions thoroughly including surgery, exercise advice and drug therapies.</LI>
<LI>should use blinded outcome assessment.</LI>
<LI>should employ survival analysis methods to assess time to recurrence.</LI>
<LI>should incorporate economic evaluations.</LI>

We combined the Ovid MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision) (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>). We combined the Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL searches with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2011</LINK>). Overall there were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.  Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non­opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>

<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others unlikely to introduce bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>

<LI>Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias).</LI>
<LI>Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>&#8216;As-treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation.</LI>
<LI>Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias (e.g. number randomised not stated, no reasons for missing data provided).</LI>
<LI>The study did not address this outcome.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>The study protocol is available and all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way.</LI>
<LI>The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon)</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported.</LI>
<LI>One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified.</LI>
<LI>One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect).</LI>
<LI>One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study:</P>
