<P>Some patients develop abnormal excessive electrical activity of brain nerve cells. This is called seizure activity and may involve a small area of the brain or the whole brain, resulting in sudden dysfunction of the structures involved, such as shaking of the limbs. The seizure activity often results in jerky movements (convulsions) and usually lasts a few minutes. When there is either more than 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity; or there are two or more seizures in a row without recovery of full consciousness between two seizures, the condition is called status epilepticus, which is a medical emergency. Many drugs have been studied in the management of this condition. This review found that intravenous (injected into a vein) lorazepam is better than diazepam or phenytoin for immediate control of status epilepticus. In the treatment of serially occurring seizures, diazepam gel administered rectally is effective in controlling seizures. Intravenous lorazepam is better than intravenous diazepam or phenytoin for immediate control of status epilepticus. For pre-hospital treatment, intramuscular midazolam is as effective as (probably more effective than) intravenous lorazepam in control of seizures and frequency of hospitalisation or intensive care admissions. There is a need to conduct more studies on other drugs routinely used for this condition.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-23 09:50:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eighteen studies with 2755 participants were included. Few studies used the same interventions. Intravenous diazepam was better than placebo in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures (risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.92), requirement for ventilatory support (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.94), or continuation of status epilepticus requiring use of a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92). Intravenous lorazepam was better than placebo for risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.71) and for risk of continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.71). Intravenous lorazepam was better than intravenous diazepam for reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90) and had a lower risk for continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88). Intravenous lorazepam was better than intravenous phenytoin for risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86). Diazepam gel was better than placebo gel in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.43 95% CI 0.30 to 0.62)</P>
<P>For pre-hospital treatment, intramuscular midazolam is at least as effective as (probably more effective than) intravenous lorazepam in control of seizures (RR1.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.27) and frequency of hospitalisation (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97) or intensive care admissions (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.96). It was uncertain whether Intravenous valproate was better than intravenous phenytoin in reducing risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.00). Both levetiracetam and lorazepam were equally effective in aborting seizures (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.13). Results for other comparisons of anticonvulsant therapies were uncertain due to single studies with few participants.</P>
<P>The body of randomised evidence to guide clinical decisions is small. It was uncertain whether any anticonvulsant therapy was better than another in terms of adverse effects, due to few studies and participants identified. The quality of the evidence from the included studies is not strong but appears acceptable. We were unable to make judgements for risk of bias domains incomplete outcome reporting (attrition bias) and selective outcome reporting (selection bias) due to unclear reporting by the study authors.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-15 08:59:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intravenous lorazepam is better than intravenous diazepam or intravenous phenytoin alone for cessation of seizures. Intravenous lorazepam also carries a lower risk of continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia compared with intravenous diazepam. Both intravenous lorazepam and diazepam are better than placebo for the same outcomes. For pre hospital management, midazolam IM seemed more effective than lorazepam IV for cessation of seizures, frequency of hospitalisation and ICU admissions however,it was unclear whether the risk of recurrence of seizures differed between treatments. The results of other comparisons of anticonvulsant therapies versus each other were also uncertain.<I> </I>Universally accepted definitions of premonitory, early, established and refractory status epilepticus are required.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-02 11:00:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-05-01 09:01:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Status epilepticus is defined as a condition in which there is either more than 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity; or two or more sequential seizures without recovery of full consciousness between the seizures. Status epilepticus is a medical emergency. It is associated with an overall mortality of 8% in children and 30% in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Epilepsy-Foundation-of-America-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epilepsy Foundation of America 1993</LINK>). An additional 5% to 10% of people experiencing this condition have permanent sequelae, such as a permanent vegetative state or cognitive difficulties. Approximately 12% to 30% of adults with a new diagnosis of epilepsy present in status epilepticus (<LINK REF="REF-Lowenstein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowenstein 1998</LINK>). Some authors, depending upon the duration of seizure activity, stipulate three stages of the condition: early, established and refractory. Early status epilepticus consists of the first 30 minutes of the epileptic state during which physiological mechanisms compensate for the greatly enhanced metabolic activity. Established status epilepticus is defined as the stage beyond 30 minutes, where the status continues despite early stage treatment. It is during this phase that physiological compensation mechanisms begin to fail. If seizures continue for 60 to 90 minutes after the initiation of therapy the stage of refractory status is said to have been reached. Status epilepticus may be convulsive (with limb stiffness and jerking) or non-convulsive (without limb stiffness and jerking). Though convulsive status epilepticus is associated with a higher mortality and morbidity than non-convulsive status epilepticus, both require prompt and effective treatment. However, the most effective treatment regimen is not clear from the literature. Different experts give different recommendations regarding the best treatment regimen for status epilepticus (<LINK REF="REF-Lowenstein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowenstein 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prasad-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Epilepsy-Foundation-of-America-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epilepsy Foundation of America 1993</LINK>) and the evidence base of many of these recommendations is often unclear. We conducted a systematic review of all the randomised controlled trials that we could identify to summarise the existing evidence, to delineate the reasons for disagreements and to highlight areas requiring further research.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-07-02 11:00:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several drugs are available as interventions to treat status epilepticus.</P>
<P>Interventions for the treatment of status epilepticus cover a range of drugs, some of which may be safe, while others may be associated with serious adverse events. As status epilepticus progresses sequentially through premonitory, early, established and refractory stages, accordingly, treatment starts with benzodiazepines but may, in appropriate situations, require anaesthetic agents. The need to terminate the status requires the use of such interventions that enter the brain rapidly, and have a long half-life to prevent recurrence of seizures. Diazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, being lipid soluble, enter the brain rapidly, but diazepam is rapidly taken up by fatty tissues and hence has a shorter redistribution half-life (one hour) compared to half-lives of midazolam (two hours) and lorazepam (14 hours). As a result, duration of action of diazepam is only 0.25 to 0.5 hour, whereas for lorazepam it is 12 to 24 hours. For long-term maintenance therapy, drugs that can be administered in both parenteral and oral routes are required, such as sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbitone etc.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-05-01 09:02:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mechanism of action varies from one drug to another. Benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam) mainly potentiate GABA induced chloride influx. The most important mechanism for phenobarbitone is GABA receptor mediated synaptic inhibition. Phenytoin has a stabiliSing influence on the neuronal membrane through prolongation of the inactivated state of voltage sensitive neuronal sodium channel. Sodium valproate acts through multiple mechanisms: frequency dependent prolongation of sodium channel inactivation, attenuation of calcium mediated transient currents, augmentation of GABA. Benzodiazepines have a relatively short duration of action, and hence for maintenance of action, phenytoin, sodium valproate, or phenobarbitone are used or added to benzodiazepines.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-05-01 09:02:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Status epilepticus is a medical emergency with a significant mortality, but like many acute medical emergencies it is a challenging topic for randomised controlled trials. A regularly updated systematic review is required to summarise current evidence in order to inform both treatment guidelines and the research agenda.</P>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>For a study to be included in the review, study participants were required to have premonitory or early stage status epilepticus or established status epilepticus. The premonitory phase was referred to as the period during which seizures became increasingly frequent or severe but the condition did not meet the definition of status epilepticus. Early status was defined as the first 30 minutes of seizure activity. Established status epilepticus was defined as a condition with either more than 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity or two or more sequential seizures without recovery of full consciousness between the seizures. If seizure activity remains uncontrolled for one to two hours, in spite of first-line treatment, then the participant is considered to be in refractory status epilepticus (<LINK REF="REF-Shorvon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorvon 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Both convulsive as well as non-convulsive status epilepticus were considered for this review. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-29 11:14:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Studies comparing any anticonvulsant drug against placebo or another anticonvulsant drug were included in the review. For the premonitory stage of status epilepticus, interventions included diazepam (intravenous or intrarectal); lorazepam (intravenous); paraldehyde (intramuscular or intrarectal) or midazolam (intravenous, intramuscular or intrarectal). For early or established status epilepticus, drug interventions included lorazepam; diazepam; phenytoin; fosphenytoin; lignocaine; paraldehyde or clonazepam. For refractory status epilepticus, thiopentone; propofol; pentobarbitone; isoflurane or etomidate were included.</P>

<P>The outcomes considered depended on the stage of status epilepticus at which the treatment was tested. For the purpose of this review, our intention was to analyse treatment failure as the primary outcome. We intended to define treatment failure for the various stages as any of the following.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">For premonitory stage</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>Development of status epilepticus or death.</LI>

<LI>Death.</LI>
<LI>Continuation of status epilepticus requiring use of a different drug or general anaesthesia for control.</LI>
<LI>Long-term disabling sequelae, defined as persistent neurological deficits severe enough to require dependence on some other person for activities of daily living (walking, toileting, bathing, dressing and eating) at six months after randomisation.</LI>
<LI>Need for ventilatory support.</LI>
<LI>Incomplete recovery before discharge, defined as inability to attain pre-status epilepticus state at the time of discharge. This outcome was included because most people attain their pre-status epilepticus state before discharge and are not followed up subsequently. People who do not recover need to be followed up in order to judge recovery or persistent deficit.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used the term 'non-cessation of seizures' rather than cessation of seizures (used in the various studies) to maintain uniformity since all the other outcomes were unfavourable outcomes. Some of the studies described data on continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia separately, hence this has been taken as a separate outcome for analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">For refractory status epilepticus</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>Death.</LI>
<LI>Long-term sequelae defined as dependence for activities of daily living (walking, toileting, bathing, dressing and eating) assessed at six months or beyond, but if studies reported only one or three months after onset, this was treated as a long-term outcome.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other outcomes which were considered for separate analyses in this review</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>Complications such as infections; renal failure; respiratory failure.</LI>
<LI>Adverse effects of drugs. The following were considered in the safety analysis:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg recorded while the drug was being administered or within 24 hours of the last dose;</LI>
<LI>respiratory depression, defined as the occurrence of apnoea or need for intubation;</LI>
<LI>cardiac arrest (diagnosed clinically) or bradyarrhythmias including heart block, documented on an electrocardiogram.</LI>
</OL>
</OL>
<P>We intended to analyse outcomes separately and as a composite outcome (treatment failure) because the latter would have allowed more power. This was not possible because many participants had more than one outcome measured during the course of treatment and the studies presented the number of outcomes observed but not the number of participants having one or more of these outcomes. We also considered an analysis of the number of outcomes as a continuous variable but the studies did not present standard deviations for these data and, therefore, did not permit meta-analysis.</P>

Clearly some individuals had more than one of the above outcomes. For example, a person might require anaesthesia and ventilation then recover incompletely and may have long-term disabling sequelae. Our intention was to carry out separate analyses for premonitory stage, early status epilepticus, established status epilepticus and refractory status epilepticus. However, the definitions used in the different studies were both variable (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) and often unclear.</P>
<P>Potential causes of heterogeneity were assessed by examining differences between trials in respect to trial design; participant population; intervention and outcome. We tested for heterogeneity between trial results for each outcome using a chi squared (Chi<SUP>2</SUP>) test. If the test for heterogeneity was statistically non-significant, then the results from the different trials were combined to obtain a summary estimate of effect (and the corresponding confidence interval (CI)) using a fixed-effect model. We used risk ratio (RR) as the measure of choice for our analyses, but for some outcomes there were zero events in all the arms of some studies. In such situations we used risk difference (RD) to ensure inclusion of the data in our meta-analysis. Using RR would exclude such studies from analysis because confidence intervals cannot be calculated around RR when there is a zero event in both the arms of the study.</P>
<P>Assessment of statistical heterogeneity was supplemented using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than a sampling error.</P>
<P>Interpretation of I<SUP>2 </SUP>for heterogeneity is as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>0% to 40%: may not be important.</LI>
<LI>30% to 60%: represents moderate heterogeneity.</LI>
<LI>50% to 90%: represents substantial heterogeneity.</LI>
<LI>75% to 100%: represents considerable heterogeneity.</LI>

<P>All disagreements were resolved through discussion. Poor data presentation encountered included studies not mentioning the total number of participants studied, or presenting only the number of outcomes observed rather than the number of participants with the outcomes.</P>
<P>The data extraction was difficult because of heterogeneity in the definition of status epilepticus (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) and the type of data presented. Very few studies used the same interventions. We could combine data from eleven studies over five different outcomes. Even here, the definitions used by different authors varied and we assumed that the type of participants were similar. We presented the rest of the studies separately.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-07-23 09:51:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review demonstrated that there are few reported randomised studies on drug interventions used in status epilepticus. Considering that the condition is relatively frequent in neurological practice, it is surprising that we found only 18 studies with analysable data. For status epilepticus, carrying out randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the emergency situation may be difficult; particularly when the patient is unconscious, which makes getting rapid consent to join a trial difficult. This review highlights the need to conduct more randomised studies in status epilepticus.</P>
<P>The review has demonstrated several areas requiring attention in future research in status epilepticus. A universally acceptable definition of premonitory, early, established and refractory status needs to be agreed upon and used consistently by investigators. Agreement on the definition of outcomes and method of data presentation is also desirable to facilitate meta-analysis. In particular, reports should provide the number of participants having each outcome and the denominator in analyses should be the number of participants rather than the number of episodes of status epilepticus.</P>
<P>The time frame required of the administration of interventions would be an important element for study/comparison in the future. A table has been added depicting the time since onset of status to administration of drug and since administration of drug to cessation of seizures as reported for drugs in respective studies (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-23 09:51:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Even with limited data, the results may be summarised as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Diazepam was better than placebo for cessation of seizures: there was a lower risk of requirement for ventilatory support and continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia with diazepam.</LI>
<LI>Lorazepam was better than placebo for cessation of seizures and carried a lower risk for continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia.</LI>

<P>5. For pre hospital treatment, midazolam IM was as effective and probably better than lorazepam IV for cessation of seizures, frequency of hospitalisation and ICU admissions but not for risk of recurrence of seizures.</P>
<P>No definitive conclusions were possible with other comparisons. However, statistically non-significant trends were found for the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Lorazepam IV versus diazepam IV - trend favouring lorazepam for ventilatory support and adverse effects.</LI>

<LI>Midazolam versus diazepam IV - trend favouring diazepam for reduced number of deaths.</LI>
<LI>Diazepam versus placebo gel - trend towards fewer adverse effects with placebo gel.</LI>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-05-01 09:03:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Considering the frequency and seriousness of the condition, the body of randomised evidence available to guide clinical decisions is small. The only clinically applicable conclusions appear to favour lorazepam or midazolam as initial treatment of status epilepticus. Of these, adequate evidence is available only in favour of midazolam IM. However, this result is applicable only for pre hospital treatment. Once a patient has reached hospital, the intravenous (IV) route is the preferred route, for which evidence seems to favour lorazepam.</P>

<P>Lorazepam is better than diazepam or phenytoin for cessation of seizures and carries a lower risk of continuation of status epilepticus that requires use of a different drug or general anaesthesia. Both lorazepam and diazepam (IV or gel form) are better than placebo for the same outcomes. For pre hospital treatment, midazolam IM seemed more effective than lorazepam IV for cessation of seizures, frequency of hospitalisation and ICU admissions. However, it was unclear whether the risk of recurrence of seizures differed between treatments. The results of other comparisons of anticonvulsant therapies versus each other were also uncertain. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-05-01 09:03:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review has demonstrated several areas requiring attention in future research in the treatment of status epilepticus. Investigators need to develop and use universally acceptable definitions of premonitory, early, established and refractory status epilepticus. Agreement on the definition of outcomes and method of data presentation is also desirable to facilitate meta-analysis. In particular, investigators should report the number of participants having each outcome, with one participant included only once in a study. Where counts of seizure episodes are presented, then the standard deviation of the counts should be provided to facilitate meta-analysis.</P>
<P>A practical difficulty in conducting RCTs in status epilepticus is obtaining consent, because participants are unconscious or not in a state to provide it. Taking consent from next of kin is one option. Such an approach has been used in RCTs with participants experiencing head injury and stroke.</P>
