<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-03-08 13:31:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Hip fractures are common among elderly people, who often have medical conditions that put them at risk of developing other problems whilst their fracture is treated. Treatment usually involves an operation to fix the break in the bone, and giving too much or too little fluid to a patient around this time may increase the risk of additional problems. Healthcare staff use many approaches to determine how much fluid a patient needs in this situation, but it is not clear whether some methods are better than others. For this Cochrane review, we looked at research on the effects of different methods of finding maximum effective fluid levels for adult men and women who undergo surgery for any type of hip fracture.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence is current to September 2015. We found five studies with 403 participants, each of which compared two or three methods of guiding fluid therapy. These methods include 'usual care' (whereby staff use changes in basic measurements, such as heart rate, to decide for themselves how much fluid to give), 'protocols using standard measures' (whereby staff use changes in basic measurements when giving fluid according to a formal set of rules) and 'advanced haemodynamic monitoring' (whereby staff use invasive equipment, such as specialized blood pressure monitoring devices placed into arteries, to determine how much fluid to give).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>These trials found no evidence to suggest that using one method instead of another reduces harm, including death, or decreases the number of complications. We found no evidence, when study results were combined, indicating that any method reduced length of hospital stay or time that participants were assessed as medically fit for discharge. Results also showed no difference in the number of participants able to return to normal accommodation after discharge.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We found few relevant studies with only a small number of participants. The time difference between the earliest study, published in 1985, and the latest study, published in 2014, suggests that standard practice for managing hip fracture may differ between these studies. We judged one study as having a high risk of bias, and we used the GRADE approach to assess evidence quality as low or very low. Results of the review are applicable only to countries in which the relevant studies were conducted, as 'usual care' may differ in other countries.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>Current evidence is insufficient to show which method of finding maximum effective fluid levels in people undergoing hip fracture surgery is preferable.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-03-08 13:20:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 9<I>); </I>MEDLINE (October 2012 to September 2015); and EMBASE (October 2012 to September 2015) without language restrictions. We ran forward and backward citation searches on identified trials. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for unpublished trials. This is an updated version of a review published originally in 2004 and updated first in 2013 and again in 2015. Original searches were performed in October 2003 and October 2012.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-03-08 13:20:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adult participants undergoing surgical treatment for PFF that compared any two of advanced haemodynamic monitoring, protocols using standard measures or usual care, irrespective of blinding, language or publication status.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-03-08 13:21:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors assessed the impact of fluid optimization interventions on outcomes of mortality, length of hospital stay, time to medical fitness, whether participants were able to return to pre-fracture accommodation at six months, participant mobility at six months and adverse events in-hospital. We pooled data using risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) for dichotomous or continuous data, respectively, on the basis of random-effects models.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-08 13:27:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included in this updated review five RCTs with a total of 403 participants, and we added two new trials identified during the 2015 search. One of the included studies was found to have a high risk of bias; no trial featured all pre-specified outcomes. We found two trials for which data are awaited for classification and one ongoing trial.</P>
<P>Three studies compared advanced haemodynamic monitoring with a protocol using standard measures; three compared advanced haemodynamic monitoring with usual care; and one compared a protocol using standard measures with usual care. Meta-analyses for the two advanced haemodynamic monitoring comparisons are consistent with both increased and decreased risk of mortality (RR Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) random-effects 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 1.20; 280 participants; RR M-H random-effects 0.45, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.95; 213 participants, respectively). The study comparing a protocol with usual care found no difference between groups for this outcome.</P>
<P>Three studies comparing advanced haemodynamic monitoring with usual care reported data for length of stay and time to medical fitness. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for these outcomes in the two studies that we were able to combine (MD IV fixed 0.63, 95% CI -1.70 to 2.96); MD IV fixed 0.01, 95% CI -1.74 to 1.71, respectively) and no statistically significant difference in the third study. One study reported reduced time to medical fitness when comparing advanced haemodynamic monitoring with a protocol, and when comparing protocol monitoring with usual care.</P>
<P>The number of participants with one or more complications showed no statistically significant differences in each of the two advanced haemodynamic monitoring comparisons (RR M-H random-effects 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.17; 280 participants; RR M-H random-effects 0.72, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.31; 173 participants, respectively), nor any differences in the protocol and usual care comparison.</P>
<P>Only one study reported the number of participants able to return to normal accommodation after discharge with no statistically significant difference between groups.</P>
<P>There were few studies with a small number of participants, and by using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach, we judged the quality of the outcome evidence as low. We had included one study with a high risk of bias, but upon applying GRADE, we downgraded the quality of this outcome evidence to very low.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-08 15:58:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-03-08 13:32:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Proximal femoral fractures (PFFs), or hip fractures, are fractures of the femur immediately distal to the articular surface of the hip joint to about 5 cm below the lesser trochanter. They can be subdivided into intracapsular and extracapsular fractures. Intracapsular (also termed <I>transcervical</I> or <I>subcapital</I>) fractures occur proximal to the trochanteric line, and extracapsular (also termed <I>pertrochanteric</I>, <I>subtrochanteric</I>, <I>trochanteric</I> or <I>intertrochanteric</I>) fractures occur distal to the trochanteric line, up to 5 cm below the lower border of the lesser trochanter.</P>
<P>These fractures occur most commonly in elderly people with osteoporosis after a simple mechanical fall. Approximately 1.5 million hip fractures are reported per year worldwide, and the number of hip fractures is projected to increase to 4.5 million by the year 2050 (<LINK REF="REF-Gullberg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gullberg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sterling-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterling 2011</LINK>). Incidence varies by country, from about 50 to 500 per 100,000, and is about two times higher among females than males, although this difference varies with race (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kannus-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannus 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>PFF is one of the most common orthopaedic emergencies, and most cases are managed by early surgical fixation to reduce complications from prolonged immobility associated with conservative treatment. Limited evidence has been obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to inform this practice, but other types of studies have shown increased risk of death when surgery is delayed; it would be difficult to conduct ethically sound trials that compare operative with conservative treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bottle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bottle 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2008</LINK>). Generally, medically fit patients should undergo surgery within 24 hours.</P>
<P>Undisplaced intracapsular fractures usually are treated by internal fixation to preserve the femoral head, with screws or pins, with or without plates, fixed to the femur. Displaced intracapsular fractures may be reduced and internally fixated or may undergo replacement arthroplasty. Extracapsular fractures may be fixed with a screw passed up the femoral neck to the head,then attached to a plate on the side of the femur, or an intramedullary nail may be used with a side screw passed up into the femoral head.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-08 15:58:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Age-related co-morbidities and dehydration in people presenting with PFF put them at increased risk for peritraumatic and perioperative complications. Providing adequate fluid resuscitation is important in minimizing this risk. The adequacy of fluid therapy may be determined by simple, readily available clinical measures, such as tissue turgor, heart rate, blood pressure, urine output and central venous pressure (CVP). However, these are non-specific and poorly sensitive measures of fluid optimization (<LINK REF="REF-Marik-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marik 2008</LINK>). Growing evidence suggests that predicting responsiveness to fluid therapy is more important (<LINK REF="REF-Funk-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Funk 2009</LINK>). The aim is to use goal-directed fluid therapy to optimize cardiac output, to avoid overloading the cardiovascular system and precipitating heart failure. This approach, along with adequate haemoglobin and inspired oxygen levels, optimizes delivery of oxygen to tissues and organs and may improve outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>One way to assess fluid responsiveness is to use a protocol that combines several simple measures to determine the effect of a standardized fluid bolus and to decide whether additional fluid will provide benefit for the patient. Another method is to use advanced haemodynamic monitoring techniques to detect cardiovascular changes that occur with incremental fluid boluses, to predict responsiveness to increased fluid. Although some of these advanced techniques are in their infancy, several have become established in clinical practice. These approaches can be split into static measures of cardiac preload (load placed on the heart by blood returning to it) and dynamic measures of interactions between heart and lung.</P>
<P>Static measures aim to determine cardiac preload but fail to estimate response to fluids in about one-half of patients, thus rendering them exposed to the hazards of unnecessary fluid therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Eyre-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eyre 2010</LINK>). Despite this, many of these measures are in clinical use. Right ventricular end-diastolic volume can be measured by a fast-response thermistor pulmonary artery catheter or by cardiac scintigraphy. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) can measure left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic area, which correlates well with left ventricular end-diastolic volume - a measure of LV preload. Transpulmonary thermodilution measured by a commercially available device (PiCCO; Pulsion Medical Systems, Feldkirchen, Germany) assesses global end-diastolic volume (GEDV), the largest volume of blood contained within the four heart chambers, and intrathoracic blood volume; both measurements have been validated as indicators of cardiac preload (<LINK REF="REF-Bendjelid-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bendjelid 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muller-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller 2008</LINK>). Pulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheters are inserted into the pulmonary artery to measure pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP); however, their use has been reduced over recent years, as PAOP has been shown to be a poor marker of left ventricular end-diastolic volume, and therefore of cardiac preload and cardiac output (<LINK REF="REF-Maus-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maus 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dynamic measures are generally superior to static measures in predicting fluid responsiveness, although this has been demonstrated mainly in sedated ventilated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Eyre-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eyre 2010</LINK>). Various technologies use these measures, which include stroke volume variation (SVV), systolic pressure variation (SPV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), aortic blood velocity (ABV), superior vena cava collapsibility index (SVCCI) and inferior vena cava distensibility index (IVCDI). The commercially available LiDCO device (Vigileo/FloTrac, Irvine, California, USA) analyses the waveform of the arterial blood pressure pulse for SVV, SPV and PPV; transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) measures IVCDI; oesophageal Doppler measures SVV and ABV; TOE can measure SVCCI and ABV; and PiCCO can measure SVV. LiDCO and TTE can be used with patients who are awake when undergoing regional anaesthesia, and with those who are unconscious when undergoing general anaesthesia. Oesophageal Doppler and TOE can be used only with patients who are undergoing general anaesthesia<I>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-03-08 13:34:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Major surgery and critical illness are associated with increased oxygen demand due to a systemic inflammatory response, the stress response and increased metabolic activity. Inadequate fluid resuscitation and cardiopulmonary disease may reduce the supply of adequate tissue blood flow and delivery of oxygen. This may result in cellular dysfunction, organ damage, organ failure and ultimately death. Fluid overload is also harmful, potentially causing cardiac performance to fall as the result of extreme right shift on the Starling myocardial performance curve, respiratory failure due to fluid accumulation in the lungs, gastric dysmotility and poor wound healing. Growing evidence indicates that standardized methods to optimize fluid and oxygen delivery to tissues may decrease morbidity and mortality in a variety of clinical settings, particularly among high-risk surgical patients and those with critical illness or sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Lees-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lees 2009</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-03-08 13:35:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Protocols, or advanced methods of managing fluid therapy, may improve various outcomes in the large number of people who suffer from PFF each year. However, these methods may cause harm and may incur financial cost. A systematic evaluation of the current evidence is needed to assist clinicians who attempt to optimize fluid volume status in people undergoing surgery for PFF. We selected our included outcomes according to their frequency in studies of PFF and their usefulness in clinical decision making (<LINK REF="REF-Liem-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liem 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>This is the second update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Price-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 2004</LINK>) and first updated in 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-Brammar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brammar 2013</LINK>). New monitoring techniques and revised methods have been introduced within Cochrane; therefore, we have re-run the searches, including extra search terms, and have used different methods to assess study quality.</P>

<P>We constructed a 'Summary of findings' table by using GRADE software (<A HREF="http://www.gradepro.org">gradepro.org</A>). The GRADE approach appraises the quality of a body of evidence according to the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association reflects the item assessed. The quality of a body of evidence is based on within-study risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of the evidence, heterogeneity of the data, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias.</P>

<P>Three trials were conducted in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>), one in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK>) and one in Sweden (<LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK>). All provided full-text publications in the English language. The interval between the first trial and the last trial was approximately 29 years.</P>
<P>All trials included solely adult participants who were undergoing surgery for PFF. Ages of participants ranged from 40 to 102 years. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK> underwent spinal anaesthesia, and those in <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK> underwent general anaesthesia. <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK> did not explicitly state the type of anaesthesia, although from the year of this study, we assumed that the clinicians used general anaesthesia. Surgical techniques used to treat PFF included dynamic hip screw, arthroplasty and AO cannulated screws.</P>
<P>Each trial performed different comparisons: goal-directed haemodynamic treatment (with LiDCO monitor) versus routine fluid treatment based on a treatment algorithm (<LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK>); LiDCO monitor-guided fluid therapy versus standard care (<LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK>); Swan-Ganz monitoring versus CVP monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK>); oesophageal Doppler monitoring versus conventional fluid management (<LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>); and oesophageal Doppler monitoring versus CVP monitoring versus conventional fluid management (<LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>). These trial comparisons correspond to the following comparisons in our review: advanced haemodynamic monitoring (LiDCO, Swan-Ganz, oesophageal Doppler); a protocol using standard measures (CVP monitoring, routine fluid treatment with treatment algorithm); and usual care (standard care, conventional fluid management). Three trials studied only intraoperative fluid optimization (<LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>); one trial studied intraoperative and postoperative fluid optimization (<LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK>); and one trial studied preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative fluid optimization (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK>).</P>

We excluded in-hospital deaths that occurred more than 30 days postoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>). On the basis of total hospital stays and ranges reported in <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>, we assumed that all deaths and adverse events in this trial occurred within 30 days of operation. Four trials compared total length of hospital stay (<LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>) and three compared time until medically fit for discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>).

<P>Defining adequate blinding in trials of fluid optimization was challenging. Given the different monitoring techniques described, it was not possible to effectively blind the anaesthetist/clinician. Three trials addressed this by ensuring that the anaesthetist was blinded to measurements from the Doppler and LiDCO monitors in the control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>); however, anaesthetists remained aware of group allocation, and we were unclear about whether this may have affected their performance. Therefore, we judged all trials to be at unclear risk of performance bias.</P>
<P>Three studies had made adequate attempts to blind nursing personnel and/or those collecting outcome data to reduce risk of detection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>). Although data on the LiDCO monitor were coded, personnel collecting relevant outcome data for the review outcomes were not blinded in <LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK>, and we judged this study to be at a high risk of detection bias. <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK> reported no details of data collection.</P>

<P>Two trials reported complete follow-up for mortality, morbidity, adverse events and length of stay (<LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>). One trial provided no information about exclusions due to deviations from protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK>) but reported no participants lost to follow-up. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK>) reported a high number of losses (12%), and although study authors provided explanations, we considered this number of losses to have a potential influence on effect estimates. <LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK> explained losses similarly but described fewer losses.Both <LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK> performed intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis on lost data.</P>

<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK> were registered with clinical trials registers, and we were able to compare protocols against published study reports. <LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK> had also published a protocol in an open access journal (<LINK REF="REF-Wiles-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiles 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK> reported all outcomes relevant to this review, and we judged this study to be at low risk of bias; however, some long-term outcomes on health-related quality of life were reported in an interim publication but not in the full study publication. Similarly, we found that <LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK> reported the outcomes relevant to this review, although study authors did not report data on cost of care nor on changes in the way the heart and blood vessels work with spinal anaesthesia. We judged both of these studies as having low risk of bias.</P>
<P>The remaining three trials were not registered, and we were unable to source any published protocols for them. Two of these trials reported all expected outcomes in their Methods section (<LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>). One trial provided inadequate information about expected outcomes; therefore, we assessed the risk of selective reporting as unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some of our analyses were subject to limitations because length of stay data were published in graphical form without adequate corresponding numerical data. One trial did not provide details on length of follow-up in terms of mortality but provided sufficient data for analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>); data regarding morbidity and adverse events were adequate in all studies.</P>

<P>Three studies received funding that appeared to be independent and unlikely to influence the results (<LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>). Four trials reported sample size calculations (<LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>). One trial was stopped early because of difficulty in recruiting participants (<LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK>). Trials were too few to permit construction of funnel plots to facilitate assessment of publication bias, or to allow performance of Egger's test for asymmetry.</P>
<P>Analyses of the benefits of fluid optimization in this group of participants were limited by differences in study design. Three trials involved intraoperative optimization (<LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>). One involved both intraoperative and postoperative optimization (<LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK>), and one involved preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative optimization (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK>). We noted differences between trials in outcome definitions, in time points for mortality and length of stay reporting and in types of adverse events reported. In addition, all trials involved relatively few participants.</P>

<P>Three trials reported mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>). For one study, the follow-up period was unclear but was reported as "postoperative" (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK>). This trial showed a significant reduction in mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.74; 70 participants); however, we had serious concerns about its quality. In <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>, the time frame for death was described as within hospital and results were consistent with both increased and decreased risk of mortality in the intervention group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.88; 61 participants). In <LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK>, the time frame for death was within 30 days, and again results were consistent with both increased and decreased risk of mortality in the intervention group (RR Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) random-effects 0.76, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.28; 149 participants). See <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> for pooled data that showed no statistically significant differences between groups (RR M-H random-effects 0.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.20; 280 participants). Using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group), we downgraded the quality of this evidence to very low, as few studies were identified by which we could judge precision and we noted a high level of bias in <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK> and some inconsistency in the study results (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

Therefore, it was not possible for review authors to pool these data. <LINK REF="STD-Bartha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bartha 2013</LINK> (149 participants) reported median length of hospital stay as nine (range, three to 20) days in the advanced haemodynamic monitoring group and as 10 (range one to 38) days in the protocol group. <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK> (61 participants) reported mean length of hospital stay as 13.5 (95% CI 10.9 to 17.5) days in the advanced haemodynamic monitoring group and as 13.3 (95% CI 10.3 to 19.2) days in the protocol group. Study authors did not report these data as statistically significant.

Study authors reported this finding as statistically significant (P value = 0.035). No other study reported this outcome.

These results are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. We combined the numbers of participants with one or more complication in <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, which shows no statistically significant differences between the advanced haemodynamic monitoring group and those using a protocol (RR M-H random-effects 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.17; 280 participants). Using GRADE, we downgraded the quality of this evidence to very low, as again studies were too few to allow us to judge precision, level of bias in <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK> was high and results showed some inconsistency (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

We excluded two deaths from <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1997</LINK> - one each from the intervention and control groups - as they occurred more than 30 days postoperatively. Pooled results are consistent with both increased and decreased risks of mortality in participants who received advanced haemodynamic monitoring (RR M-H random-effects 0.45, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.95; 213 participants). See <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.

In <LINK REF="STD-Moppett-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Moppett 2014</LINK> (114 participants), the total mean length of stay was 15.3 (95% CI 13.8 to 17.2) days in the intervention group and 14.2 (95% CI 12.9 to 15.8) days in the usual care group.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK> (59 participants), we used the RevMan calculator to determine the mean difference between groups for length of hospital stay.

One study reported a reduction in time to medical fitness when advanced haemodynamic monitoring was compared with a protocol using standard monitoring, and when a protocol using standard monitoring was compared with usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Venn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venn 2002</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-03-08 14:24:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted a thorough search for the 2015 update, carrying out both backward and forward citation tracking of included studies. We used the search strategies delineated in a previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Brammar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brammar 2013</LINK>). All five studies included here provided evidence applicable to participants with PFF, with appropriate comparisons of fluid optimization techniques.</P>
<P>Applicability may extend only to those countries in which included studies were conducted, as usual care, fluid management and perioperative care of patients with femoral fracture may differ considerably between countries. Management of this patient group may also differ within countries, with different institutions adopting different protocols; with such few included studies, it could be argued that applicability of the review is limited by institution.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-03-08 15:58:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We noted differences in quality among our included studies. We were concerned about the robustness of the randomization process in one study and judged this study to have a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK>). We included this study in our analysis but used GRADEpro software to downgrade the overall quality of evidence for relevant outcomes accordingly. Blinding of clinicians to group allocation was an inevitable challenge in this review. However, we were unable to make a decision about whether this had introduced performance bias to our review.</P>
<P>Our main concern was lack of data because we identified few studies with a small number of participants for each of our comparisons. It is arguable that any mortality reduction due to the interventions described in our review would be small because of the many other factors that put participants with PFF at relatively high risk of death. If in-hospital mortality of 6.6% is assumed (<LINK REF="REF-Moppett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moppett 2012</LINK>), a study with 80% power to detect a 50% decrease in in-hospital mortality (from 6.6% to 3.3%) would require randomization of 678 participants into each group (&#945; = 0.05). Therefore, much larger studies than the ones presented in this review are likely needed to show the benefit derived from these interventions. Similarly, to detect a 50% reduction in adverse event incidence (from 15% to 7.5%) (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roche-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roche 2005</LINK>), 278 participants would be required for each group. We used GRADEpro to downgrade the quality of most outcomes to low or very low, as the review could not offer precision for our objectives.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-09-09 19:45:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>To the best of our knowledge, no potential biases arose from the review process.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-03-08 14:26:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The authors of the original version of this review stated that invasive methods of fluid optimization may shorten hospital stay, but their effects on other important, patient-centred, longer-term outcomes are uncertain. We would agree in general with this but urge caution in interpretation of hospital stay data that are limited in scale and in some cases are not adequate for detailed analysis. We are not aware of any other good quality studies or systematic reviews investigating perioperative fluid optimization after PFF.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-03-08 14:26:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Limited evidence of low quality is available to support or reject the hypothesis that fluid volume optimization improves mortality or reduces complication rates for patients with PFF, whether advanced haemodynamic monitoring or protocols based on standard measures are used.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-03-08 14:29:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Broadening the scope of this review to include a greater number of clinical groups would increase the data set but would be clinically less useful to the reader who is interested in specific management of PFF. This approach would also further increase heterogeneity. Therefore, we suggest additional studies specifically for PFF that are adequately powered and methodologically robust to allow detection of differences in outcome measures.</P>
<P>It would be useful to assess the use of fluid optimization strategies within enhanced recovery programmes for PFF. These programmes comprise multi-factorial bundles of care that are becoming more widely used across a range of clinical conditions, although the quality of evidence of benefit is still low (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2012</LINK>). This assessment would provide the benefit of control of many of the confounding factors that limit studies comparing advanced monitoring or protocols against usual care.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Alterations made in earlier review (Brammar 2013)</HEADING>
<P>We altered and re-ran the search strategy using updated key terms from inception of the databases to October 2012. In addition to CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, we searched the <A HREF="http://www.apps.who.int/trialsearch">International Clinical Trials Registry Platform</A> and <A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</A> websites for ongoing and unpublished studies (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>). We carried out backward and forward citation searching for key review articles identified during the initial searches (see <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>). We repeated title selection and full-text review in full.</P>
<P>We moved one study from excluded to included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1985</LINK>). We added one study as awaiting classification pending contact with study authors (<LINK REF="STD-Sandham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandham 2003</LINK>). We added two ongoing studies (GDHT study; NOTTS study).</P>
<P>We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the quality of studies. We did not exclude studies on the basis of low quality.</P>
<P>We altered comparison groups so that protocol measures and advanced haemodynamic methods were compared with each other and were not combined.</P>
<P>We redefined outcomes to separate length of stay into time to medical fitness and total stay. The all-cause mortality time frame was changed to include in-hospital, 30 days and undefined. We changed reduced return of function outcomes to time to the pre-fracture category of accommodation and mobility. We re-classified complications into major iatrogenic, cardiopulmonary, neurological and combined, including minor.</P>
<P>We included 'Summary of findings' tables for all comparisons, using the principles of the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) system (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>) to assess the quality of the body of evidence associated with specific outcomes.</P>
