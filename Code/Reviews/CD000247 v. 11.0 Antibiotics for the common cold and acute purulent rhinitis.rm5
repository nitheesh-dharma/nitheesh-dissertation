<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Searches conducted. No new studies were found. We have made a few amendments, for example, changing <LINK REF="STD-Herne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Herne 1980</LINK> to one antibiotic group and <LINK REF="STD-Taylor--1977" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1977</LINK> to one antibiotic group. This has the impact of reducing the weight for these studies in the random-effects analysis, hence this is a conservative bias but our conclusions remain unchanged. Antibiotics are not effective as an initial treatment for patients with the common cold. Our analysis now shows no benefit for antibiotics for acute purulent rhinitis and our recommendation is that they should not be used initially. It may be reasonable to negotiate the use of antibiotics with patients if the purulent rhinitis persists for more than 10 days. However, even in these cases, most patients get better without antibiotics.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>In this updated review (2005) an additional four studies were identified and added to the review. The first, <LINK REF="STD-Herne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Herne 1980</LINK>, was in French, which necessitated translation into English. The addition of this result has not altered the findings of the common cold systematic review. The other papers added to the review were the studies by <LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Todd-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vogt-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Vogt 1966</LINK>, which dealt with the treatment of purulent rhinitis. It was pointed out to us by peer reviewers that two studies, <LINK REF="STD-Howie-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Howie 1970</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1996</LINK>, included patients with purulent rhinitis and hence we decided to expand the review to include patients with acute purulent rhinitis. While there is some variation in the findings, they are suggestive of there being a benefit from antibiotics for this condition. In the past, guidelines have suggested not using antibiotics as they are not effective. The review authors suggest not recommending antibiotics in the first instance as most people will get better without them.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-18 03:12:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Most people around the world will have one or more common cold episodes every year. Except in low-income countries, the common cold is one of the most cited reasons for people to use antibiotics, even more so if the mucus from their nose is coloured (acute purulent rhinitis). However, common colds are caused by viruses, which do not respond to antibiotics, and antibiotics can cause side effects, especially diarrhoea. Overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics.</P>
<P>To find out whether antibiotics work for the common cold we identified studies that compared one group of people taking an antibiotic with another group of people taking a medication that looked similar but contained no antibiotic (a placebo). We found six studies of the common cold, with 1047 participants and five studies of acute purulent rhinitis, with 791 participants. Many of the studies had flaws which might have biased the results, especially because many of the participants probably had chest or sinus infections that the researchers did not know about.</P>
<P>Results suggest that antibiotics do not work for either the common cold or for acute purulent rhinitis and many people are affected by antibiotic side effects.</P>

<P>This updated review included 11 studies. Six studies contributed to one or more analyses related to the common cold, with up to 1047 participants. Five studies contributed to one or more analyses relating to purulent rhinitis, with up to 791 participants. One study contributed only to data on adverse events and one met the inclusion criteria but reported only summary statistics without providing any numerical data that could be included in the meta-analyses. Interpretation of the combined data is limited because some studies included only children, or only adults, or only males; a wide range of antibiotics were used and outcomes were measured in different ways. There was a moderate risk of bias because of unreported methods details or because an unknown number of participants were likely to have chest or sinus infections.</P>
<P>Participants receiving antibiotics for the common cold did no better in terms of lack of cure or persistence of symptoms than those on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.51, (random-effects)), based on a pooled analysis of six trials with a total of 1047 participants. The RR of adverse effects in the antibiotic group was 1.8, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.21, (random-effects). Adult participants had a significantly greater risk of adverse effects with antibiotics than with placebo (RR 2.62, 95% CI 1.32 to 5.18) (random-effects) while there was no greater risk in children (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.63).</P>
<P>The pooled RR for persisting acute purulent rhinitis with antibiotics compared to placebo was 0.73 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.13) (random-effects), based on four studies with 723 participants. There was an increase in adverse effects in the studies of antibiotics for acute purulent rhinitis (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.94).</P>

<P>There is no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold or for persisting acute purulent rhinitis in children or adults. There is evidence that antibiotics cause significant adverse effects in adults when given for the common cold and in all ages when given for acute purulent rhinitis. Routine use of antibiotics for these conditions is not recommended.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-03-18 03:12:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The International Classification of Health Problems in Primary Care (ICHPPC) (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1995</LINK>) defines an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), the common cold, as an illness with evidence of acute inflammation of the nasal or pharyngeal mucosa and the absence of other specifically defined respiratory conditions, for example streptococcal tonsillitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma and hay fever (<LINK REF="REF-ICHPPC-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICHPPC 1986</LINK>). A common cold is commonly regarded as a self limiting viral illness that is experienced annually by the majority of the population. A practical definition is an acute illness with some of the following symptoms: rhinitis (not hay fever or allergic rhinitis), sore throat (not streptococcal pharyngitis), with or without fever, cough and/or productive sputum/purulent sputum.</P>
<P>There is evidence of high usage of antibiotics for the common cold (viral URTI) in spite of doubts about the efficacy of such therapy (<LINK REF="REF-McGregor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGregor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spector-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1995</LINK>). Although it is known that viruses are the causative agent, many patients presenting to their general practitioners receive antibiotics. In one study, URTI was the most common reason for new consultations in general practice and the second most common reason for the prescribing of an antibiotic (<LINK REF="REF-McAvoy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAvoy 1994</LINK>). In a New Zealand study, computerised records of 100,222 consultations from 17 General Practices were examined over one year (<LINK REF="REF-McGregor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGregor 1995</LINK>). Seventy-eight per cent of patients with an URTI received antibiotics. About one-third of these medications were expensive broad-spectrum antibiotics. In a more recent study, 49% of persons with URTIs received antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Ochoa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ochoa 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are two published reviews of antibiotics for treating URTIs. One review found no benefit of antibiotics for preventing pneumonia in patients with URTI (<LINK REF="REF-Gadomski-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gadomski 1993</LINK>). Another review found that antibiotics had no benefit in children and that there was no strong evidence of significant adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Fahey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fahey 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The presence of purulent nasal discharge (or a runny nose with coloured discharge) has repeatedly been shown to be an important determinant of antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections for both adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-Arroll-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroll 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gonzales-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzales 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mainous-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainous 1997</LINK>). In one study, no General Practitioners said they would give antibiotics for clear rhinitis, yet 72% said they would for purulent rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Arroll-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroll 2000</LINK>). A survey found that primary care physicians were far more likely to prescribe an antibiotic for a patient with a cold involving coloured nasal discharge than for a patient without coloured nasal discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Mainous-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainous 1997</LINK>). Another study found purulent nasal discharge was a stronger predictor of prescribing antibiotics than any other patient characteristic (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzales-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzales 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Guidelines usually advise against antibiotics for acute purulent rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenstein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstein 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snow 2001</LINK>) yet evidence supporting such recommendations comes from a limited number of small studies of varying methodological quality. Some studies have found no evidence that antibiotics reduce the duration of acute purulent rhinitis (<LINK REF="STD-Todd-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 1984</LINK>) whereas a recent larger study reported that treatment with amoxicillin reduced the duration of purulent rhinorrhoea; although there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of general symptom improvement (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is important to obtain an estimate of the effectiveness of antibiotics for the common cold to support judicious use of these important medicines, particularly because URTIs are so common. If ineffective, as has long been thought, widespread use of antibiotics is not only a poor use of health funds but also a cause of unnecessary morbidity from adverse effects and of development of resistant strains (<LINK REF="REF-Arason-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arason 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verkatesum-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verkatesum 1995</LINK>). If antibiotics were shown to be effective for the common cold then society may be willing to tolerate the increase of resistance with an appropriate reduction in the symptoms. Other reviews to date have not specifically considered the effect of antibiotics in acute purulent rhinitis. The current review expands on previous reviews by considering the effects of antibiotics on the speed of resolution of common cold symptoms in both adults and children, and by examining the evidence for antibiotics in both acute purulent rhinitis and acute clear rhinitis.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-02-13 15:39:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The common cold, or acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), is an illness with evidence of acute inflammation of the nasal (rhinitis) or pharyngeal mucosa (sore throat) and the absence of other specifically defined respiratory conditions, for example streptococcal tonsillitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma and hay fever. Acute purulent rhinitis is the presence of coloured discharge, from one or both nostrils, that has persisted for less than 10 days. The choice of less than 10 days is based on the inclusion criteria for the Cochrane Review on chronic purulent rhinitis which included patients with 10 or more days of purulent rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is evidence that too many antibiotics are being used. Of the top 18 medications prescribed in New Zealand in 2008, three were antibiotics.

<P>All trials in which participants with the diagnosis of acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) were randomly assigned to treatment with an antibiotic or a placebo; also all trials in which the majority of participants had acute purulent rhinitis of less than 10 days duration. We included trials allowing concurrent use of other medications if they allowed equal access for participants in both the antibiotic and placebo group.</P>
<P>We excluded studies for the following reasons.</P>
<OL>
<LI>If they involved the use of an active substance (such as cough mixtures or anti-pyretics/analgesics) instead of a placebo as these substances may help or suppress symptoms, thereby giving a false measure of the antibiotic's effectiveness. Trials comparing one antibiotic with another, or trials comparing the use of antibiotics versus other medications, were not included.</LI>
<LI>If antibiotics were given prophylactically, that is given to asymptomatic individuals, for many weeks to prevent symptoms of acute URTI.</LI>
<LI>If more than 5% of participants had throat swabs positive for beta haemolytic streptococcal infection. In the sore throat review by <LINK REF="REF-Del-Mar-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Mar 1992</LINK>, the lowest percentage of participants with streptococci on throat swab was 8%, hence our choice of 5%. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Haight-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Haight 1954</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardy-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Hardy 1956</LINK>) were excluded by this criterion but neither had data that could be analysed. We accept the contradiction that some studies may include participants with streptococcal infections or colonisation due to the fact that they have not performed throat cultures. There is also the issue of contaminants, which may be as high as 57% in children under 15 years with pharyngitis (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1971</LINK>), hence our desire to remove studies with high proportions of participants with positive throat cultures.</LI>
<LI>If not randomised.</LI>
<LI>If participants had past histories of serious illness, for example chronic obstructive respiratory disease where antibiotics have been shown to be effective in treating exacerbations.</LI>
<LI>If the participants had been given the diagnosis of bronchitis. The International Classification of Health Problems in Primary Care (ICHPPC) definition of bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1995</LINK>) is a definite cough with abnormal chest signs: scattered or generalised, coarse or moist sounds, or wheeze. This definition is not always used by trialists and probably not by General Practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Arroll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroll 2001</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>If the participants had more than seven days of symptoms at the time of study entry. This is an arbitrary duration to avoid post viral syndromes.</LI>
<LI>If participants were treated with two or more medications, that is in situations where co-interventions could be an issue.</LI>
<LI>If participants were diagnosed with pharyngitis not conforming to the ICHPPC (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1995</LINK>).</LI>

<P>We used the following search strategy to search MEDLINE and CENTRAL. We combined the MEDLINE search strategy with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision); Ovid format (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>). We adapted this search strategy to search EMBASE (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), CINAHL (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>), LILACS (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>) and Biosis Previews (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). The search strategy has been amended since the last published version as the authors have now extended the review to include persistent nasal discharge (rhinosinusitis). Details of earlier searches are in <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>.</P>

<P>All of the included trials were double-blind evaluations comparing antibiotic with a placebo.

<P>The method of randomisation was marginally satisfactory for some of the studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Hoaglund-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Hoaglund 1950</LINK> the pharmacist dispensed the medication "in rotation". The method of randomisation was "haphazard" in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Vogt-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Vogt 1966</LINK>, hence there is some concern about the methods of this study. In <LINK REF="STD-Lexomboon-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Lexomboon 1971</LINK> the allocation was determined by the selection of coloured strips and only the pharmacist knew the allocation. The method of randomisation for the <LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK> study was by computer-generated random number and the medications (capsules) were identical.</P>
<P>All but two of the studies had either inclusion criteria that selected cases of acute viral respiratory tract infection and/or had the term viral or minor respiratory infection or common cold in the title of the study. The exception was <LINK REF="STD-Todd-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 1984</LINK>, where the children had non-transparent nasal discharge. While there was some variation in the inclusion criteria (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1974</LINK> found 13% of children under two years old and 16% of two- to four-year olds had clinical signs in the chest) the study groups generally included participants with acute URTIs.

<P>Six studies reported adverse effects experienced by individual participants. When all studies were combined there was a significant difference for adverse effects (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.21; random-effects model) but there was a high level of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). This appeared to be due to a difference between adults and children because when analysed separately there was a significant difference for adults (RR 2.62, 95% CI 1.32 to 5.18; random-effects model) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>) but not for children (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.63) <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>; heterogeneity for the child analysis was not significant. <LINK REF="STD-McKerrow--1961" TYPE="STUDY">McKerrow 1961</LINK> did not distinguish between the pneumoconiosis group and the office (unit) group so the proportion of adverse effects in the office unit group were allocated in proportion to the number of participants in the two parts of the study; with this study removed the increase in adverse effects with antibiotics was not significant (RR1.68, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.20) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). Some studies did not report adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Herne 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoaglund-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Hoaglund 1950</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lexomboon-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Lexomboon 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogt-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Vogt 1966</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Rhinitis purulent and clear</HEADING>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Herne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Herne 1980</LINK> did not specify if the rhinitis was purulent or not. When this study was excluded, pooling the other four antibiotic versus placebo studies for purulent rhinitis gave a RR of 0.73 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.13; random-effects model) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). When <LINK REF="STD-Herne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Herne 1980</LINK> was added to the purulent group, the RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.04; random-effects model) for persisting purulent rhinitis (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Because xibornol and inhaled nitrofurazone are no longer available, pooling the three studies plus the tetracycline arm of the Herne study gave a RR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.18; random-effects model) for persisting purulent rhinitis on currently available antibiotics (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). It is worth noting that in <LINK REF="STD-Howie-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Howie 1970</LINK> there was no significant benefit from antibiotics in participants with purulent nasal discharge but this study used illnesses, not individuals, as the denominator. Antibiotics also appeared to be not effective for clear rhinitis when Herne was added as clear rhinitis (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.48; random-effects model) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Five studies reported purulent rhinitis with no additional explanation (<LINK REF="STD-Howie-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Howie 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor--1977" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Todd-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogt-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Vogt 1966</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK> defined purulent rhinitis on a purely clinical basis (that is, the recruiting doctors made the decision).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-05-27 10:07:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>While the International Classification of Health Problems in Primary Care (ICHPPC) gives one definition of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), it is not clear how rigidly this definition applies in practice. The review authors have accepted that the diagnosis of URTI is made on clinical grounds and treatment decisions are made on the basis of that clinical decision. Although the range of inclusion criteria appears wide, the review authors accept that the majority of participants in each study in this review were suffering from viral URTIs. Only three studies reported their findings in terms of the lower respiratory tract. <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1974</LINK> reported 13% of children under two years old and 13% of those over six years to have lower respiratory tract signs. Forty-three per cent (84 out of 197) of participants in <LINK REF="STD-Taylor--1977" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1977</LINK> had auscultatory evidence of a more extensive peripheral airways disease.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Herne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Herne 1980</LINK> included seven participants with bronchitis: four in the tetracycline group, two in the xibornol group and one in the placebo group. In the context we assumed this diagnosis was mainly due to bronchospasm. We excluded studies with significant numbers of participants with streptococci on throat swabs (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table). We included <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1974</LINK>, which found 2% of participants (2 of 89) with cultures of beta haemolytic streptococci. Seven participants were excluded from <LINK REF="STD-Herne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Herne 1980</LINK> because the pharynx looked as though the participants had clinical streptococcal tonsillitis.</P>
<P>Other studies did not test for throat bacteria. Cultures that are positive for streptococci may include contaminants as well as cases of true infection. The issue of bacterial involvement is a concern for reviews of bronchitis, sore throats and upper respiratory tract infections. There is no overlap with Fahey's bronchitis review (<LINK REF="REF-Fahey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fahey 1998</LINK>) but there are two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Howie-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Howie 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1996</LINK>) that are also in the <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2011</LINK> bronchitis review.</P>
<P>The review by <LINK REF="REF-Del-Mar-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Mar 1992</LINK> on managing sore throat included one study that is in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor--1977" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1977</LINK>). Clearly the larger the proportion of illnesses caused by bacteria that exist among the cases of viral illness the more likely the findings are to show a benefit for antibiotics. There is no other way of defining the disease of interest other than perhaps doing nasopharyngeal aspirations, as done in <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1996</LINK>, and throat cultures on all participants. This is not current clinical practice and the purpose of our review is to be relevant to clinical practice.</P>
<P>The a priori outcomes for analysis included persistence of symptoms of nasopharyngeal inflammation, global rating of health and adverse effects. The summary risk ratio (RR) for general improvement or cure was 0.95 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.51) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In contrast with the Cochrane Review by <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2011</LINK>, there was no over-reporting of significant findings. Indeed, there was a tendency to under-report findings and, hence, less likelihood of a type one statistical error.</P>
<P>Most studies did not report adverse effects. However, the summary RR for adverse effects from the four studies in adults that had analysable data was significant. The majority of adverse effects were gastrointestinal, which is consistent with clinical anecdote. In the two studies in children there was no significant adverse effect from antibiotics, which is consistent with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Fahey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fahey 1998</LINK>.</P>
<P>The symptoms of nasopharyngeal inflammation chosen for analysis were sore throat and runny nose, either purulent or clear. No studies reported sneezing as an outcome. Six trials provided outcome data on nasopharyngeal inflammation (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Herne 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howie-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Howie 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Todd-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor--1977" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogt-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Vogt 1966</LINK>). Data from <LINK REF="STD-Howie-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Howie 1970</LINK> were not in a form that could be used in this review but indicated no benefit from antibiotics for purulent nasal discharge. Pooling the purulent rhinitis data suggested that antibiotics are not beneficial for this condition. For runny nose with a clear discharge there was no significant benefit when <LINK REF="STD-Herne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Herne 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Taylor--1977" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1977</LINK> were pooled. As noted above, the definition of the type of rhinitis in <LINK REF="STD-Herne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Herne 1980</LINK> was not given and hence it was added to both clear and purulent rhinitis. There is collateral information about this in the literature. In an acute bronchitis study (<LINK REF="REF-Stott-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stott 1976</LINK>) there was a lower incidence of runny nose at day seven in the doxycycline group than in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.01). There is a Cochrane Review on persisting rhinosinusitis (more than 10 days duration) which shows a benefit from treating with antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2007</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sore throats</HEADING>
<P>The finding of no benefit from antibiotics for sore throat was expected. We would suggest the reader read the Cochrane Review on antibiotics for sore throat (<LINK REF="REF-Spinks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spinks 2011</LINK>). The role of bacteria in upper respiratory tract infections, either as a causal factor or a complication, is highlighted in <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1996</LINK>. The authors make a convincing argument for the role of three types of bacteria (<I>H. influenzae</I>, <I>M. catarrhalis</I> and <I>S. pneumoniae</I>). It would be helpful to see this work repeated in another centre. Treatment in this subgroup resulted in one day less of symptoms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sinusitis or purulent rhinitis</HEADING>
<P>The difference between sinusitis and acute purulent rhinitis is not clear. There is presumably an overlap: 19% of the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1996</LINK> had radiological sinusitis and between 53% and 56% of the participants in <LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK> had unilateral facial pain. In one study, which was excluded because of a greater than 10-day duration of purulent rhinitis, all participants had to have facial X-rays free of abnormalities (<LINK REF="STD-Haye-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Haye 1998</LINK>). In this study azithromycin was significantly more effective than placebo on the outcome of purulent rhinitis. This suggests that participants may be able to have purulent rhinitis without sinus involvement. These issues need to be taken into account in future studies. The methodological quality of the studies before 1990 was low and hence it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from these.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Generalisability</HEADING>
<P>Although only three of the studies were conducted in general practice (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howie-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Howie 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor--1977" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1977</LINK>), the others seemed to represent a cross-section of participants seen in primary care settings. This indicates that our results are generalisable to the wider primary care setting if the assumption is made that participants can self refer to these secondary care settings and use them as primary care providers. Other study settings were:<BR/>

</UL>
<P>The heterogeneity of the pooled data for adverse effects from all the studies appears to come from the difference between adverse effects in adults and children. There was no heterogeneity when they were analysed separately. In one arm of <LINK REF="STD-Taylor--1977" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1977</LINK> the group taking co-trimoxazole had more adverse effects than the placebo group, while the amoxycillin group had fewer. None of the children were given amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, which contributed a lot to the adverse effects in <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1996</LINK>. This finding in children is consistent with <LINK REF="REF-Fahey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fahey 1998</LINK>. That review included the two studies in our review and three which we excluded. This negative finding in children relates mainly to the unexpected findings in <LINK REF="STD-Taylor--1977" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1977</LINK>. There is no methodological reason for this and our assumption would be that this is a chance (and erroneous) finding. The expected finding would be for children to get more adverse effects in the antibiotic group, as was found in the Cochrane Review on antibiotics for acute otitis media (<LINK REF="REF-Venekamp-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venekamp 2013</LINK>). The adverse effects in the purulent rhinitis group were statistically significant.</P>

<P>Antibiotics offer no benefit in the initial treatment of the common cold (acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs)). Antibiotics should not be given in the first instance as they will not improve the symptoms and adult participants will be affected by their adverse effects. Antibiotics offer no benefit for acute purulent rhinitis while there is an increase in adverse effects. However, if the symptoms persist for more than 10 days then antibiotic therapy may be beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2007</LINK>) and clinicians may wish to negotiate the use of them with patients, taking into account the resistance issues.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2009-11-23 11:29:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>METHODS and METHODOLOGICAL QUALITIES OF INCLUDED STUDIES<BR/>The reviewers use a scoring system for methodological quality, whereby each trial is given a numerical score on a scale of 1 to 12 points, which they say is described in the Cochrane Handbook. The Handbook in fact advises against composite scores as they are not transparent. In the Methodological quality of included studies section, the reviewer's then say that they do not think that these scores are an accurate measure of study quality. Furthermore, trial quality is not incorporated into interpretation of the results. It is therefore difficult for the reader to assess how systematic bias in the included studies might have affected the findings reported in the review.</P>
<P>It is not clear how concealment of allocation in each trial was assessed. Have the reviewers erroneously used reporting of double blinding in the trials to assess concealment of the allocation sequence? The trials Howie 1970, Kaiser 1996 and Taylor 1977 are reported as having adequate concealment of allocation (A) yet there is no description of how this was achieved. In the trials Hoaglund 1950 and Lexomboom 1971, allocation concealment is reported as unclear (B) yet, according to the Table of characteristics of included studies, in the latter only the pharmacist knew of allocation. Also, why have the reviewers use the option (D) not to assign a score for allocation concealment to the trial Sutrisna 1991? The reader can not find any information in the review about adequacy of allocation concealment for the trial Gordon 1974.</P>
<P>The statement, in Methodological quality of included studies, that "Loss to follow-up was an issue for a number of studies..." needs to be expanded and loss to follow-up in each trial should be documented in the table of characteristics of included studies. Presumably the denominators used in the analyses are participants who were evaluable? How might loss to follow-up have affected the findings in the review (worst case and best case scenario)?</P>
<P>RESULTS<BR/>In the meta-analysis of General improvement, it would be better to present the Hoaglund study separately if, as the reviewer's say, there is good biological reason why measuring this outcome at 24 hours does not make sense.</P>
<P>It is questionable to calculate numbers needed to treat and numbers needed to harm from pooled data without qualification of the conditions to which they apply, and they should not be reported without confidence intervals.</P>
<P>There are several inconsistencies in the numerical data reported in the text compared with the graphs.</P>
<P>CONCLUSIONS<BR/>The statement, in Implications for practice, that "many participants will get adverse effects" from antibiotics is not supported by evidence presented in the review. The principle of using a random effect model of analysis where there is significant heterogeneity, without going on to explore possible reasons to explain it, is questionable.</P>
<P>REFERENCES<BR/>The references should be listed in the appropriate reference sections rather than included as text at the end of the conclusions.</P>
<P>The above comment was made as part of a collaborative effort coordinated by Ole Olsen at the Nordic Cochrane Centre. All new reviews on Cochrane Library 1998.4 were selected and critically read by a set of methodologists, comments were coordinated and finally fed back. The general results of the survey will be presented at the Cochrane Colloquium in Rome, October 1999.</P>

<P>Author's response:</P>
<P>I thought the comments made were very helpful to us. I have been struggling with the numbers needed to treat information and the recent BMJ article and some stuff from the EBM mailbase has been useful. I can see the advantages of an electronic database where changes can be continuously made.</P>
<P>METHODS and METHODOLOGICAL QUALITIES OF INCLUDED STUDIES<BR/>1. The two papers which did not contribute to the review for benefit were the two high scoring studies. Howie with a score of 9 and Gordon with a score of 8. The others either had a 6 or a 7 and we did not feel that there was any face validity in using such a small score difference to meta-analyse the others (referring to <I>The Cochrane Library</I> 1999, Issue 2 - the commentator may be referring to the original review which was in fact a draft and put on the Cochrane database by mistake).</P>
<P>2. We assumed that if the authors said they randomised the study then there was adequate concealment of allocation. The study by Sutrisna has been eliminated from the final review as it did not have a placebo control group.</P>
<P>3. The worst case scenario found that the adverse effects became statistically significant when added to the adverse effects of antibiotics but did not change the findings when added to placebo. There was no change for treatment or control when the missing participants were added for general improvement.</P>
<P>RESULTS<BR/>4. Removing the Hoaglund study did not alter the results nor did removing the McKerrow study where very low doses of tetracycline (15 mg) were used (these would be considered to be sub-therapeutic today).</P>
<P>5. We agree with this comment and quote Smeeth et al BMJ 1999;318:1548-51 that it is best not to use NNT derived from meta-analyses as there are differences in baseline risk. In the next update there are no statistically significant findings apart from runny nose (both purulent and clear in one study). Hence there will be no NNT or NNH. The adverse effects findings have changed as there were 5 participants in the trial by Howie who had side effects on more than one occasion and hence contributed more to the adverse effects. With those 5 participants removed the adverse effects confidence interval now includes one.</P>
<P>6. There were two typographical errors in translating the tables to the data form. Correction of this did not alter the findings.</P>
<P>CONCLUSIONS<BR/>7. The commentator may be looking at the original version of the review which as explained above was a draft version. The current version has "there is a significant increase in adverse effects associated with antibiotic use. RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.34 to 1.39". This is consistent with findings of other meta-analyses of antibiotics versus placebo, e.g. Sanders S, Glasziou PP, Del Mar C, Rovers M. Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children. <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> 2004, Issue 1. Art. No.: CD000219. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000219.pub2. In the next version of the review we have removed 5 participants from the adverse effect intervention group. This makes the adverse event findings non-significant and hence our conclusions will need to note that they are not significant but are very similar to those in other meta-analyses of antibiotic versus placebo which were significant.</P>
<P>8. This will be added to the next version.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Details of A014 2005 search update</HEADING>
<P>In previous versions of the review, we searched CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2002, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to 2002) and EMBASE (1990 to 2002).</P>
<P>In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2005, Issue 1) which includes the ARI Group's specialised trials register; MEDLINE (1966 to April Week 3, 2005), EMBASE (1997 to December 2004) and the references of relevant articles. Authors and pharmaceutical companies were contacted.</P>
<P>MEDLINE (OVID) and CENTRAL were searched using the following terms which were combined with the highly sensitive search strategy devised by Dickersin (Dickersin 1994).</P>
<P>1 exp SINUSITIS/<BR/>2 sinusitis<BR/>3 exp RHINITIS/<BR/>4 rhinitis<BR/>5 exp Paranasal Sinus Diseases/<BR/>6 paranasal sinus disease$<BR/>7 exp NASOPHARYNGITIS/<BR/>8 nasopharyngitis<BR/>9 exp Common Cold/<BR/>10 common cold$<BR/>11 (rhinorrhoea or rhinorrhea)<BR/>12 nasal discharge<BR/>13 or/1-12<BR/>14 exp Anti-Bacterial Agents/<BR/>15 antibiotic$<BR/>16 (amoxicillin or amoxycillin or ampicillin or azithromicin or azithromycin or cefaclor or penicillin or sulphamethoxazole or sulfisoxazole)<BR/>17 or/14-16<BR/>18 13 and 17</P>
<P>The above terms were modified to search for trials in EMBASE (WebSPIRS).</P>
<P>OLD MEDLINE was accessed via the National Library of Medicine Gateway and combined with the following terms to identify randomised controlled trials: random: OR "double-blind" OR "double blind" OR "single-blind" OR "single blind" OR placebo: OR "clinical trial:" OR "drug therapy".</P>
<P>We searched the list of references in relevant publications for reports of randomised controlled trials. Written communication with the authors of trials included in the review and with major pharmaceutical companies (with offices in Australia) that manufacture antibiotics was undertaken. There were no language restrictions.</P>
