Figure 7 will need to be deleted if you are happy with this. All changes accepted. I have changed participants to adults in the abstract results. This can go for copy edit if you are content with the changes and have deleted Fig 7?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC May 12 Final&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have slightly modified the conclusions in the asbract (removing asthma control as the thrust of the need for more information, as we need this across all outcomes and control points towards the GOAL trial). The entered data has all been checked. The results on rescue and exacerbations had not been updated so I have altered these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am left wondering why the hospital admission rates were so different between studies whilst the OCS rates are very similar. May be a message of some sort here????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can now be published! Thanks for getting the new data in for this version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Nov 12&lt;br&gt;I have checked the OR and RR for the outcomes. All the events are under 20% and the OR and RR are very nearly identical so not a problem but altered in abstract. Some extra changes in red for you to check and then publish please unless you want to make any further changes&lt;br&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;Peer review&lt;br&gt;Sorry I didn't get this back to you last week. I didn't receive any graphs or tables with the review but going on the text alone it looks good. The hospitalisation&lt;br&gt;results are interesting - a pity there aren't more studies out there yet and of longer duration. My only comment is that from my understanding when you use&lt;br&gt;odds ratios the text should not be written as &amp;quot;the risk&amp;quot; but always as the odds of the event happening. Using the term risk, especially in the abstract may lead to&lt;br&gt;misinterpretation or over estimation for those who do not understand the difference between odds ratios and relative risks and think they are the same.&lt;br&gt;Otherwise it looks great.&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;Well done Toby,&lt;br&gt;I am happy for this to go out to peer review. I will leave you to strip out the WMD archive comparisons.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;TJL response 30/10/2007&lt;br&gt;Chris - I have gone through the points listed below and made the minor revisions necessary. If you are happy I can send this out for peer review now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC Oct ober 29th&lt;br&gt;Date:&lt;br&gt;Authors' Contribution&lt;br&gt;ACTION: ****Needs to be updated for the review work please&lt;br&gt;Objectives&lt;br&gt;ACTION: I have removed &amp;quot; evaluate the effects of single inhaler therapy containing both a corticosteroid and a LABA.&amp;quot; FPS put first in abstract objective to match the forest plots.&lt;br&gt;References&lt;br&gt;ACTION: left for Liz!&lt;br&gt;Table of included studies&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Good. I have put the FPS arm first in Aalbers as noted above, and mentioned that the AMD arm is not included here. I have also corrected the BDP equivalent in the SAM40048 study as it is only 400 not 800***Can we add the study sponsors to the Notes field please.&lt;br&gt;Metaview Labels&lt;br&gt;ACTION: It would help transparency if the outcome title specified oral steroids for asthma exacerbation, all cause or asthma hospitalisations etc. **Please amend. **also I think 1#11 needs label reversing? Are we going to keep the WMD archive in the review? What happened to well controlled week as an outcome?&lt;br&gt;Synopsis&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Fine but are you happy that the studies are all dose equivalent? SAM40048 is clearly not!&lt;br&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Good. I do not like abbreviations in abstract and have removed them. I have also changed FPS to FP/SAL etc in the main text. Conclusions end on an unfinished sentence. Please complete.&lt;br&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;ACTION:Fine&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Good description of studies - all were on patients uncontrolled on regular ICS so this is the group to whom the conclusions apply. ***? Please add this rider to the conclusions.&lt;br&gt;The dosage under the Results heading looks wrong. Sal should be 100mcg/day I think. Also the BDP equivalent is only 400 in SAM. I am not sure about the 640 and whether this is the same as 800 but described differently in Aalbers?&lt;br&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Good. I have pointed out the lower dose of BUD in SAM40048, but it does not contribute to the exacerbation outcomes.&lt;br&gt;Contentious issues&lt;br&gt;ACTION: The dose of BUD is the same in 160 and 200 inhalers I am pretty sure - this is described in different ways in different parts of the world. Both are equivalent to 200 BDP. So although the ICS level is lower BUD-F has lower admission rates. Very interesting.......&lt;br&gt;Spellchecked&lt;br&gt;ACTION: done&lt;br&gt;Next action Back to Toby to fine tune and send for rapid Peer Review?????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC May 8 2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers Contributions: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: ?Checked by Susan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: Salmeterol is not recommended at all on an as-needed basis so I have taken out this sentence. &amp;quot;This may justify the use of the combination of formoterol with an ICS to be used on an as-needed basis more readily than that of salmeterol.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Types of participants is currently describing the participants and the methods. These two threads need to be separated. For example: &amp;quot;Any severity of asthma and patients on any co-intervention will be included (as long as the co-interventions are not part of the randomised treatment) but studies on acute asthma carried out in Emergency departments will be excluded.&amp;quot; The section on data collection and sub-group analysis covers the other issues presented here so I have removed the rest of the paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods : I have adjusted the bias protection criteria to be in line with the coming changes! Two stage analysis is frowned upon so you should not choose to use random methods after the I-square test. You can use random throughout or fixed with a comparison to random as part of the sensitivity analysis. I have added an also to reflect the latter approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues : Dose equivalence between the two combined inhalers will be an difficult issue (particularly the ICS component).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: back to authors to see if everyone is happy with changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2011-11-17 11:46:46 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="SING-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.1.4" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.0">

<TITLE MODIFIED="2011-08-31 14:15:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">Different combinations of inhaled steroids and long-acting beta-agonists for chronic asthma (fluticasone/salmeterol versus budesonide/formoterol)</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:37:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with persistent asthma often require an additional treatment to regular inhaled steroids. Some preparations of long-acting beta-agonists are delivered in the same inhaler device as the inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled steroids help to treat inflammation of the airway and long-acting beta-agonists help the airway to relax, improving symptoms and lung function. This systematic review examined randomised controlled trials comparing two commonly available combinations administered at a fixed dose through a single inhaler, fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol. We included five studies which recruited 5537 people. The trials were generally well designed but only recruited adults and adolescents and not children. Participants were already taking regular inhaled steroids before the studies commenced and had mild or moderate asthma based on tests of their airway. We found that the number of people who required treatment with oral steroids and admission to hospital was similar between the treatments, but due to the statistical uncertainty of this result we could not rule out important differences in favour of either drug combination. Additional trials would enable us to draw more reliable conclusions about how well these drugs work compared with each other. We also looked at serious adverse events. Again, the results did not indicate that one combination was clearly better than the other, but again these results were imprecise so we cannot be certain. However, lung function and rescue medication use were similar between the treatments. We could not assess the relative effects of these drugs on mortality because there were so few deaths which leads to statistical uncertainty; out of the five studies, one person died. Quality of life was measured in different ways in two studies and we could not determine how the treatments compared in this respect. Further studies are needed to strengthen and better explain these findings. In particular studies which assess the effects of these therapies in children and studies which measure quality of life are a priority.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:33:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>Long-acting beta-agonists are a common second line treatment in people with asthma inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids. Single device inhalers combine a long-acting beta-agonist with an inhaled steroid delivering both drugs as a maintenance treatment regimen. This updated review compares two fixed-dose options, fluticasone/salmeterol FP/SALand budesonide/formoterol, since this comparison represents a common therapeutic choice.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-08-31 11:37:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>To assess the relative effects of fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol in people with asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-09-15 09:09:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials with prespecified terms. We performed additional hand searching of manufacturers' web sites and online trial registries. Search results are current to June 2011.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:33:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>We included randomised studies comparing fixed dose fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol in adults or children with a diagnosis of asthma. Treatment in the studies had to last for a minimum of 12 weeks.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:33:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review. We combined continuous data outcomes with a mean difference (MD), and dichotomous data outcomes with an odds ratio (OR). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-17 11:42:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five studies met the review entry criteria (5537 adults). Study populations entered the studies having previously been treated with inhaled steroids and had moderate or mild airway obstruction (mean FEV<SUB>1</SUB> predicted between 65% and 84% at baseline). Most of the studies assessed treatment over a period of six months. The studies were at a low risk of selection and performance/detection bias, although we could not determine whether missing data had an impact on the results. Availablility of outcome data was satisfactory.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>The odds ratio for exacerbations requiring oral steroids was lower with fluticasone/salmeterol but did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.07, four studies, N = 4949). With an assumed risk with budesonide/formoterol of 106/1000 participants requiring oral steroids, treatment with fluticasone/salmeterol would lead to between 25 fewer and seven more people per 1000 experiencing a course of oral steroids. Although the odds of hospital admission was higher with fluticasone/salmeterol, this did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.47, four studies, 4879 participants). With an assumed risk in the budesonide/formoterol of 7/1000, between three fewer and nine more people per 1000 would be hospitalised on fluticasone/salmeterol. The odds of a serious adverse event related to asthma was higher with fluticasone/salmeterol but did not differ significantly between treatments (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.86, three studies, 4054 participants). With an assumed risk in the budesonide/formoterol of 7/1000, between two fewer and 13 more people per 1000 would experience a serious adverse event on fluticasone/salmeterol.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>Lung function outcomes, symptoms, rescue medication, composite of exacerbations leading to either emergency department visit or hospital admission, withdrawals and adverse events did not differ statistically between treatments. Assessment of quality of life was limited to two studies, both of which gave results that did not reach statistical significance. One study reported one death out of 1000 participants on fluticasone/salmeterol and no deaths in a similar number of participants treated with budesonide/formoterol. No deaths were reported in the other studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:33:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>Statistical imprecision in the effect estimates for exacerbations and serious adverse events do not enable us to conclude that either therapy is superior. The uncertainty around the effect estimates justify further trials to provide more definitive conclusions; the overall quality of evidence based on GRADE recommendations for the three primary outcomes and withdrawals due to serious adverse events was moderate. We rated the quality of evidence for mortality to be low. Results for lung function outcomes showed that the drugs were sufficiently similar that further research is unlikely to change the effects. No trials were identified in the under-12s and research in this population is a high priority. Evaluation of quality of life is a priority for future research.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:33:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-09-15 10:11:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, and anti-inflammatory treatment is a cornerstone of asthma therapy. Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) improves lung function and reduces asthma symptoms in asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:33:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>Many patients remain symptomatic despite using optimal doses of ICS. There is strong evidence to support the use of long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) as a means of reducing the requirement for short burst oral steroid therapy improving lung function (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2010b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two interventions being assessed in this review combine a LABA and ICS as a fixed-dose maintenance regimen, namely fluticasone and salmeterol (marketed by GSK as 'Seretide', 'Advair' or 'Viani'), and budesonide and formoterol (marketed by AstraZeneca as 'Symbicort').</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-08-31 14:24:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>The principal advantage of combining ICS and LABA in one inhaler is the simultaneous delivery of two effective inhaled therapies with complementary anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory properties. This may facilitate better adherence to fixed dosing regimens, especially given concerns over the use of LABA therapy without a regular background steroid (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2007</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-10-27 21:28:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>There is some uncertainty as to which particular combination may be suitable. Previous assessments have considered the addition of any LABA to any ICS when the dose of ICS is increased or when the study drugs are titrated according to symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2005</LINK>). Although the LABAs commonly used in combination preparations have a similar duration of effect of around 12 hours or more, salmeterol and formoterol also have differing pharmacological properties. The onset of action of formoterol is faster than that of salmeterol (<LINK REF="REF-Palmqvist-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmqvist 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Noord-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Noord 1996</LINK>) and has as rapid an onset of action as salbutamol in asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Cazzola-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cazzola 2002</LINK>). Some differences exist also between fluticasone and budesonide despite the shared anti-inflammatory effect (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2007</LINK>), and so a systematic exploration of the relative efficacy of these different drug combinations is justified. </P>

<P>A total of 5537 adult and adolescent participants were recruited to the studies. The studies required participants to have a history of chronic asthma, treated with maintenance inhaled corticosteroids at moderate to high doses prior to study entry.</P>
<P>In the five studies, participants had to be stable for one month before the run-in period. Once in the run-in phase, participants were further required to demonstrate the need for frequent reliever inhaler use. On the basis of these characteristics we adjudged the trial populations to be partly controlled, since the requirement for relief medication was in addition to chronically applied inhaled steroids (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The severity of airway obstruction varied between the trials, with the participants with the lowest percentage predicted of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> recruited to <LINK REF="STD-SAM40048" TYPE="STUDY">SAM40048</LINK> (65%), <LINK REF="STD-Busse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-COMPASS" TYPE="STUDY">COMPASS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-EXCEL" TYPE="STUDY">EXCEL</LINK> recruiting participants with moderate airway obstruction (79%, 73% and 79%, respectively), and participants with milder obstruction represented in <LINK REF="STD-Aalbers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aalbers 2004</LINK> (84%).</P>

<P>Converting the inhaled steroid load to BDP equivalent indicated that the trials assessed high doses of inhaled steroids in both FP/SAL and BUD/F groups, although FP/SAL was higher in BDP equivalence terms than BUD/F (1000 versus 400 to 800 mcg/day). All doses were given twice daily via different inhalers (Diskus and Turbohaler for FP/SAL and BUD/F respectively). Two studies were open label (<LINK REF="STD-Aalbers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aalbers 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Busse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2008</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:33:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>This review summarises evidence from five well-designed industry-sponsored studies randomising over 5000 adults and adolescent patients. We identified three co-primary outcomes, two pertaining to different severities of asthma exacerbation (those requiring oral steroid treatment, and those leading to hospitalisation), and one relating to asthma-related serious adverse events. None of the results for our primary outcomes reached conventional thresholds of statistical significance. Based on our analyses, there remains some uncertainty as to the superiority of either drug combination.</P>
<P>Neither lung function parameters, symptom scores nor rescue medication use identified statistically significant differences between treatments. The estimates for FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and peak flow are sufficiently close and statistically precise that further research is unlikely to change the similar effect of these drugs on these outcomes. One subsequent trial report for <LINK REF="STD-COMPASS" TYPE="STUDY">COMPASS</LINK> reported quality of life on the AQLQ scale. Although the trial was large, the wide confidence intervals for this result make the small difference observed uncertain and further evaluation of this important outcome is required. Outcome data relating to harms indicated that our analyses were underpowered to detect equivalent or increased risk of candidiasis, loss of voice, respiratory tract infections or headache, with either therapy.</P>

<P>The studies assessed the two drug combinations in predominantly adult populations with mild or moderate airway obstruction partly controlled regular inhaled steroids at baseline. Follow-up was adequate for the key outcomes of interest to the review. The greatest limitation of the evidence base in this area is the absence of data in children under the age of 12 years. However, there is an overriding need to establish the additive benefit of long-acting beta-agonists in children more generally (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The dose comparisons across the studies were similar, except for <LINK REF="STD-SAM40048" TYPE="STUDY">SAM40048</LINK> where the dose of budesonide was half of that in the other studies. Based on UK recommendations, the BUD/F dose was the maximum licensed dosing for asthma in the UK, and the FP/SAL dose is the medium dose recommended in the UK for asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2007</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:33:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>Five outcomes populate the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>: oral steroid-treated exacerbations, hospital admission and asthma-related serious adverse events; and for the 2011 update we also included withdrawal due to adverse events and mortality. Based on the GRADE recommendations we did not consider the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness or biases of publication/reporting to affect our confidence in the results. However, we downgraded the quality of evidence to 'moderate' for exacerbations and SAEs, and to 'low' for mortality. For all five outcomes we downgraded the quality of the evidence due to statistical imprecision. The low event rate and lack of a pooled estimate for mortality prompted us to downgrade two points rather than one.</P>
<P>Requirement for a course of oral steroid treatment is a treatment-driven rather than a symptom-driven definition, but gives some indication as to whether maintenance therapy reduces inflammation sufficiently to prevent requirement for additional steroid. The ratio of such events was close to one in the four studies, and the BUD/F event rate was similar between the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aalbers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aalbers 2004</LINK>: 15%; <LINK REF="STD-Busse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 2008</LINK>: 9%; <LINK REF="STD-COMPASS" TYPE="STUDY">COMPASS</LINK>: 10%; <LINK REF="STD-EXCEL" TYPE="STUDY">EXCEL</LINK>: 11%). Whilst the absence of a statistically significant difference may reflect the effectiveness of adding long-acting beta-agonists to ICS in reducing exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2010b</LINK>), the low frequency of this outcome across the studies underpowered our analyses to determine either no important difference between the treatments or superiority of either therapy.</P>
<P>The morbidity associated with hospital admission is considerable, and may indicate severe uncontrolled disease as well as predict future hospitalisation and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2001</LINK>). Superiority of FP over BUD in dose ratio comparisons of 1:1 and 1:2 has been demonstrated for lung function endpoints, but not exacerbation rate data (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2007</LINK>). In this review the risk of hospitalisation did not differ significantly between therapies, although the confidence interval was wide and further evidence is necessary before a conclusion of equivalence could be drawn reliably.</P>
<P>The relative effects of these treatments on serious harms including death remain to be fully elucidated. Monotherapeutic use of LABAs is discouraged since the bronchodilatory effects of LABAs possibly masks deterioration in underlying airway inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walters-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2007</LINK>). However, recent reviews assessing LABAs as additive treatment have also failed to identify an abolition of risk with ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2009b</LINK>). Our analyses lack statistical precision since serious adverse events did not occur very frequently in the studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-10-28 13:33:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>We limited our analyses to parallel studies on the assumption that optimum washout in steroid trials is uncertain, and that our primary outcome of exacerbations was best measured in long-term studies with a between-patient design. We assumed that requirement for oral steroids and admission to hospital are independent, and that participants who experienced hospital admission after a course of oral steroids would feature in both outcomes. This may not be the case, although it is reasonable to expect that poor asthma control when associated with poor adherence to maintenance inhaled steroids is a useful predictor for the requirement of rescue oral steroid therapy and hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2004</LINK>). Assessment of patient severity was confined to GINA defined control status, and this categorisation may not be sensitive enough to discern between severities of asthma.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-11-04 13:29:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A related Cochrane Review on safety issues comparing different long-acting beta-agonists in addition to regular inhaled steroid treatment provides similarly equivocal results on the outcomes of serious harms and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2010</LINK>). Our composite analysis of ED visit/hospitalisation gave an effect estimate that was similar in terms of size and direction to that reported by <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2007</LINK>. However, the confidence interval was narrower in the <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2007</LINK> meta-analysis giving a result favouring BUD/F that was statistically significant. The data for that analysis were in part based upon hospitalisation data from <LINK REF="STD-EXCEL" TYPE="STUDY">EXCEL</LINK> and did not include additional ED visits.</P>

<P>The results from this review do not provide a strong basis for supporting one therapeutic option over the other. The confidence intervals for the effect estimates in our primary outcomes include no difference, but their width for these endpoints also include possibly meaningful differences between the treatments in either direction. As such, more evidence would help to improve their precision. Serious adverse events were too infrequent to generate findings which could be easily interpreted. Applying GRADE recommendations to our assessments, we rated the quality of evidence in each of the three primary outcomes as moderate. Withdrawal due to adverse events was rated moderate and based on the low rate of mortality in the studies we rated the quality of evidence for death to be low. The lung function outcomes we analysed gave results which suggest that these drugs have similar effects. The evidence base in this area pertains to adults and adolescents whose asthma is not adequately controlled with high doses of inhaled steroids.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-25 13:05:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>The findings of our review would be strengthened by more data on exacerbations from further trials, in particular trials that include visits to emergency departments and hospitalisation. Evidence is required to establish the ratio of serious adverse events between these two drugs with better accuracy. Evidence for the effects of these drugs in children is also required. Assessment and fuller reporting of quality of life should feature in further research. </P>

<P>A previous version of this review was withdrawn prior to publication following the identification of incomplete data by GSK for the outcome ED visit/admission to hospital. The data included in the original version of the review indicated a significant increase in the odds of ED visit/hospitalisation with FP/SAL. However, this reflected data that were drawn from those participants who were admitted to hospital only. The pooled outcome data did not an accurately represent the composite outcome of presentation at ED or hospital admission (<LINK REF="STD-EXCEL" TYPE="STUDY">EXCEL</LINK>). We have now included data made available to us by GSK which are an accurate record of ED visit or admission to hospital.</P>
