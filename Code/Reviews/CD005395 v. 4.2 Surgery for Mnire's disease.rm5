<P>Ménière's disease is characterised by recurrent attacks of three major symptoms: vertigo (rotational dizziness), deafness and tinnitus (ringing of the ears), and/or aural fullness, all of which are discontinuous and variable in intensity. The symptoms of Ménière's disease are thought to be caused by excess pressure in the fluids of the inner ear which leads to sudden attacks of vertigo and hearing loss. A number of surgical procedures, of varying levels of invasiveness, have been developed to reduce the symptoms of Ménière's disease, but it is not clear whether or not these are effective. The surgical interventions can be categorised as two types: one type of surgical intervention aims to affect the natural history of the disease, with conservation of vestibular function. The other type aims to relieve symptoms by abolishing vestibular function. Both types of surgical intervention are considered in this review. Despite an extensive search the review authors only found two randomised controlled trials studying surgical interventions for Ménière's disease. Both of these trials, involving a total of 59 patients, studied endolymphatic sac surgery; one comparing it to placebo surgery and the other to a different type of surgery. Neither trial detected a significant difference between the treatment and control group.</P>

<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 1, 2010.</P>
<P>Ménière's disease is an incapacitating disease in which recurrent attacks of vertigo are accompanied by hearing loss, tinnitus and/or aural fullness. The attacks of vertigo may follow each other with intervals of days, weeks or even months. Usually, these become less severe and disappear after two to eight years in 60% to 80% of sufferers (<LINK REF="REF-Portmann-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Portmann 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silverstein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverstein 1989</LINK>), with profound lasting hearing loss and tinnitus, however there is great variability in the presentation and natural course of the disease. When no known cause of the disease is identified, the term Ménière's <I>disease</I> is applicable. When the symptoms are secondary to a known disease (e.g. meningitis), the term Ménière's <I>syndrome</I> is used.</P>
<P>Few articles have been published on the epidemiology of Ménière's disease. Great variation exists in the published reports of the incidence and prevalence of Ménière's disease, ranging from 17 cases per 100,000 population in Japan (<LINK REF="REF-Nakae-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakae 1984</LINK>) to 46 cases per 100,000 population in Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-Stahle-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahle 1978</LINK>). There seems to be a slight female preponderance, with up to 1.3 times more women affected than men. The disease is more common in adults in their fourth and fifth decade of life (<LINK REF="REF-Kotimaki-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotimaki 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sajjadi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sajjadi 2008</LINK>). The frequency of bilateral disease is unclear. Published reports vary greatly between 2% and 78% (<LINK REF="REF-Balkany-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balkany 1980</LINK>). In a large population study by Kitahara in Japan, bilaterality of disease was noted in 9.1% of patients in their first year of experiencing symptoms. This increased steadily to 41.5% after 20 years of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kitahara-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitahara 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 1861 Prosper Ménière first recognised that this disorder originated from the inner ear (the membranous labyrinth), but wrongly attributed the cause to haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Meniere-1861" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meniere 1861</LINK>). In 1938 Hallpike and Yamakawa independently described a hydrops (i.e. accumulation of fluid) of the endolymphatic system in patients with Ménière's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hallpike-1938" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallpike 1938</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamakawa-1938" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamakawa 1938</LINK>). In 1965 Kimura introduced an experimental model in which an endolymphatic hydrops was produced in guinea pigs after surgical obliteration of the endolymphatic sac and duct (<LINK REF="REF-Kimura-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimura 1967</LINK>). Endolymphatic hydrops caused by an abnormality in the absorption of endolymph at the endolymphatic sac remains the most promising theory to explain the symptoms of Ménière's disease. Other explanations for the cause of an endolymphatic hydrops, such as a hypoplasia of the vestibular aqueduct (<LINK REF="REF-Egami-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egami 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamamoto-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamamoto 1992</LINK>), a genetic predisposition (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1995</LINK>) or a viral aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Vrabec-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vrabec 2003</LINK>), have been suggested.</P>
<P>Currently no 'gold standard' diagnostic test for Ménière's disease exists. Diagnostic criteria vary among practitioners, who mostly diagnose Ménière's disease based upon the patient's history, neurotologic evaluation and clinical response to medical treatment. In 1972 the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) produced diagnostic guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Alford-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alford 1972</LINK>) which were revised in 1985 (<LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1985</LINK>) and 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-Monsell-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monsell 1995b</LINK>). According to these guidelines Ménière's disease is 'definite' when the last two spontaneous episodes of vertigo occur for at least 20 minutes, hearing loss of at least 20 decibels (dB) is objectified and tinnitus or aural fullness in the affected ear is experienced. Further investigation has to be performed to exclude any other disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Monsell-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monsell 1995b</LINK>). When patients match the AAO-HNS criteria, but symptoms are secondary to a known cause, they are classified as having Ménière's syndrome.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-26 09:53:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>There still is no unequivocal treatment for Ménière's disease, mainly because the precise aetiology is unknown. The disorder has been associated with a significant placebo effect and its relapsing, remitting nature has made evaluation of various treatments difficult. Primary treatment options include the use of diuretics, a low salt diet (to decrease fluid retention) and betahistine hydrochloride (Serc®). Betahistine and diuretics have been evaluated in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-James-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2001</LINK>). A variety of other drugs may be used including antihistamines, benzodiazepines and corticosteroids. With medical management about 60% to 87% of patients with Ménière's disease are able to maintain their normal daily activities (<LINK REF="REF-Claes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Claes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Santos-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santos 1993</LINK>). For patients who still have incapacitating, disabling attacks after three to six months of conservative therapy and unilateral involvement, surgical intervention can be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Konrad-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konrad 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monsell-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monsell 1988</LINK>). If the patient's hearing is socially adequate (arbitrarily set at 50 dB and 80% speech discrimination) a non-destructive surgical procedure is advised. If the patient's hearing is socially inadequate a destructive operation can be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Wiet-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiet 1981</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Surgery</HEADING>
<P>There are two types of surgery: destructive surgery which aims to control individual symptoms by abolishing vestibular function, and non-destructive surgery which aims to alter the natural course of the disease.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Destructive surgery</HEADING>
<P>In Ménière's disease the vestibular end organ (labyrinth) is responsible for the attacks of vertigo and the hearing end organ (cochlea) is responsible for the hearing loss. The rationale for destructive surgery to the vestibule is to rid the patient of episodic vertigo by abolishing the vestibular end organ. The brain will eventually compensate for the loss of one labyrinth, provided that the other vestibular organ is working properly. Destructive procedures of the vestibular organ have a high risk of destroying the cochlea as well. These procedures are irreversible and should be avoided in patients with bilateral involvement and in patients with adequate hearing. Destructive procedures comprise:</P>
<OL>
<LI>selective vestibular nerve section, which aims to decrease vertigo by sectioning the vestibular nerve so the input of the diseased vestibular end organ cannot reach the brain, but at the same time leaves the patient with unilateral (and therefore sub-optimal) vestibular function via the opposite (non-operated ear);</LI>
<LI>cochleovestibular nerve section, which has the same effect as the above but in addition leads to total loss of hearing in the operated ear;</LI>
<LI>labyrinthectomy, which aims to decrease vertigo by total destruction of the labyrinth but in addition leads to total loss of hearing in the operated ear;</LI>
<LI>insertion of aminoglycosides or other medicine into the middle ear to perform a chemical labyrinthectomy, which aims to decrease vertigo but may result in loss of hearing.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Non-destructive surgery</HEADING>
<P>Non-destructive procedures aim to change the natural history of the disease by reducing the frequency and severity of the symptoms. These procedures are less invasive and do not preclude use of conservative treatment modalities (<LINK REF="REF-Wiet-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiet 1981</LINK>). Non-destructive procedures comprise:</P>
<OL>
<LI>endolymphatic sac decompression and/or shunt, which aims to increase endolymph drainage;</LI>
<LI>insertion of ventilation tubes which diminish middle ear pressure changes, on the assumption that symptoms are caused by pressure disturbances of the middle ear;</LI>
<LI>lateral semicircular canal plugging which aims to ablate endolymphatic movement in the occluded canal (<LINK REF="REF-Charpiot-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charpiot 2010</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Since Ménière's disease is a difficult disease to diagnose, with great variability in presentation, and has a fluctuating natural course, evaluation of any intervention is difficult and requires careful long-term follow-up, as advised by the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) (<LINK REF="REF-Monsell-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monsell 1995a</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-10-21 09:46:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>In the current literature there is much controversy about the effectiveness of surgical procedures used to treat patients with Ménière's disease, most of which are more or less harmful to the inner ear. This review aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of these different procedures.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-11-23 14:20:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of the several surgical options, either destructive or non-destructive, in the treatment of Ménière's disease. We have assessed the effect of surgical treatment on the severity and frequency of acute attacks of vertigo, on symptoms such as tinnitus and aural fullness, and on sensory hearing loss. The safety and side effects of the procedures have also been evaluated.</P>

<P>Due to the natural history of Ménière's disease it is hard to say when a patient is cured. According to the Committee of Hearing and Equilibrium (<LINK REF="REF-Monsell-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monsell 1995a</LINK>) it is possible to define improvement subjectively. The patient counts their vertigo spells for six months before the intervention, then again for a further period of six months and at 18 to 24 months after the intervention. The quotient of the mean vertigo spells per month classifies the improvement of vertigo. When this quotient is zero, complete control of the vertigo has been achieved. As it is not clear whether this relief of vertigo is permanent, authors are encouraged to report results up to four years after the treatment.<BR/>

<P>We assessed the quality of the selected studies using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. The domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment, selective outcome reporting, blinding, incomplete outcome data and other sources of bias are each addressed in the tool by a single entry for each study. The two authors judged these domains according to table 8.5.a of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Handbook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handbook 2011</LINK>): low, high and unclear risk of bias. We incorporated these results into a 'Risk of bias' table in RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). We have also assessed the length of follow-up, with 'low risk of bias' indicating complete follow-up (two years or more) and 'high risk of bias' meaning follow-up of less than two years.</P>
<P>We have also judged three extra domains: the certainty of diagnosis of Ménière's (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK>), the quality of the outcome assessment (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>) and the description of the protocol used.

<P>The search identified 85 references, of which 10 were retrieved in full text. We identified three randomised controlled trials of surgery for Ménière's disease. Two trials studied endolymphatic shunt therapy versus placebo therapy. One study discussed ventilation tube placement solely and in combination with transtympanic dexamethasone placement. No placebo-controlled studies were found which studied vestibular or cochleovestibular nerve section and labyrinthectomy. Transtympanic aminoglycoside application therapy is studied in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Pullens-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pullens 2011</LINK>), as is ventilation tube placement in combination with pressure therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Pullens-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pullens 2010a</LINK>).</P>

The <LINK REF="STD-Bretlau-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bretlau 1989</LINK> study is a nine-year follow-up report of an original study from 1981.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The two trials studied patients with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease only. None of the trials discussed Ménière's syndrome. The two trials recruited a total of 59 patients but seven patients withdrew. The smallest trial studied 29 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1998</LINK>) and the largest 30 (<LINK REF="STD-Bretlau-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bretlau 1989</LINK>). Although neither study explicitly stated that the AAO-HNS classification for certainty of diagnosis was used, Thomsen used the functional level scale according to the guidelines of the AAO-HNS and stated that all patients had typical symptoms of Ménière's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1998</LINK>). The guidelines of the AAO-HNS are not mentioned in the study by Bretlau, but the inclusion criteria are identical to the aforementioned guidelines (<LINK REF="STD-Bretlau-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bretlau 1989</LINK>). Both studies included patients who had received conservative therapy previously, but excluded patients who had received surgical therapy.</P>

<P>The trial by Bretlau et al was double-blind. The trial by Thomsen et al was double-blind until just before the intervention; after this moment it was clear to the surgeon and the patient what surgery had been done because one group had a retroauricular surgical wound and the other group did not. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Bretlau-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bretlau 1989</LINK> were published with a follow-up period of nine years: on a monthly basis for 12 months and then three and nine years postoperatively. <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1998</LINK> had a follow-up period of 12 months and data were collected six and 12 months postoperatively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bretlau-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bretlau 1989</LINK> analysed the total scores of all five parameters using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Friedmann test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff two-sample test to identify significant differences. <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1998</LINK> used the Mann-Whitney and the Pratt's test to show significant differences for all the separate parameters.</P>

</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-11-26 09:28:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the initial publication of the Bretlau/Thomsen study in 1981 (<LINK REF="REF-Thomsen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomsen 1981</LINK>), there has been great controversy concerning its contents and conclusions. In a letter to the editor, Dr. Arendberg stated that the conclusions of the authors are not supported by the data presented in the study (<LINK REF="REF-Arendberg-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arendberg 1981</LINK>). He states that the methods used by the authors to determine therapeutic success are wrong and not in accordance with the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology criteria. In another letter to the editors, Dr. Vaisrub criticised the study on statistical grounds, stating that "...the reported findings by Thomsen et al. and the interpretations drawn from them suffer a number of shortcomings that raise numerous questions..." (<LINK REF="REF-Vaisrub-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaisrub 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>These and other comments have moved Welling et al (<LINK REF="REF-Welling-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welling 2000</LINK>) to re-evaluate the original 1981 data, represented by Thomsen et al (<LINK REF="REF-Thomsen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomsen 1981</LINK>). No numerical data ware represented by Thomsen et al, therefore three different observers extracted the data concerning vertigo complaints from the graphs, given by Thomsen and Bretlau in 1981. The averages of their estimates were used to re-analyse the data. For other variables, individual values were estimated by a single observer. After statistical analysis Welling et al found five areas (vertigo, nausea and vomiting, tinnitus and combined score) that differed from the analysis by Thomsen and Bretlau, favouring active group over placebo.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1998</LINK> study had a lower methodological quality; because of the different surgical modalities the study could not be blinded.</P>
<P>Due to of the different ways the outcome measures were obtained, and because not all the required data were reported, we could not perform a meta-analysis in this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-11-26 10:12:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Only two randomised controlled trials of surgery for Ménière's disease were included, both studying endolymphatic sac surgery. In both of these trials, a statistically significant effect could not be established for the intervention versus placebo or grommet insertion, although the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bretlau-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bretlau 1989</LINK> has been the subject of great criticism. It is remarkable, however, that 70% of participants in both the endolymphatic sac surgery groups and the comparator experienced some relief of complaints. This either implicates a beneficial effect of any surgical intervention, or a beneficial effect of any intervention, surgical or non-surgical. This constitutes one of the biggest challenges investigators face when evaluating treatment for Ménière's disease. The two trials included in this review provide insufficient evidence for the beneficial effect of endolymphatic sac surgery in Ménière's disease.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-05 11:36:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Only two randomised controlled trials studying endolymphatic sac surgery were found. Both of these studies have their limitations, however, and are subject to debate. An additional randomised controlled trial would help to determine the effectiveness of this therapy. However, a fully double-blinded trial with concealment of allocation is very difficult to undertake in the modern age due to ethical objections.</P>
<P>None of the other surgical treatment options for Ménière's disease have been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. This implies a great need for the evaluation of surgical options for Ménière's disease in a randomised or controlled clinical trial setting. However, for ethical restrictions, a true double-blind set-up for any surgical intervention will not be possible. Studies which can be considered are those comparing surgical interventions to other interventions (e.g. grommet insertion, intratympanic gentamicin or medication), in which the outcome assessor is blinded.</P>
