<TITLE>Corticosteroids for treating optic neuritis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-29 12:41:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We reviewed the evidence about the effects of corticosteroids on visual recovery of people with acute optic neuritis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve leading to sudden loss of vision that takes place over the course of several hours or days. The optic nerve, which enters the back of the eye, carries visual information from the eye to the brain. When the optic nerve becomes inflamed, damage may occur. Thus information from the eye to the brain is interrupted, resulting in temporary or permanent vision loss. Optic neuritis is closely linked to multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory disease that affects nerve cells generally. Corticosteroids have been widely used in the treatment of optic neuritis due to their anti-inflammatory effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>For this systematic review, we identified six trials conducted in Denmark, Germany, India, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States, which included 750 participants. These trials compared corticosteroid treatment with placebo or another treatment; they varied in the way corticosteroids were given and the dose. Two trials compared oral corticosteroids versus placebo; three trials compared intravenous corticosteroids versus placebo; one trial compared two types of intravenous corticosteroids; and one trial with three groups compared oral corticosteroids versus intravenous corticosteroids versus placebo. Participants in all six trials were followed up for at least three months. Outcomes of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity in the normal range and visual field were assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months. Quality of life also was assessed and reported in one trial. The information is current as of 7 April 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>There was no available evidence of beneficial effect from oral or intravenous corticosteroids compared with placebo for the visual acuity, visual field, and contrast sensitivity outcomes. Adverse effects, although not consistently reported, included dermatological symptoms, endocrinological disorders, gastrointestinal problems, headache, fever, sleep disturbance and psychiatric problems. Severe adverse events were reported in the intravenous steroid treatment group of one trial. The investigators of three trials concluded that minor adverse events were more common in steroid groups than in the placebo group.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>Out of six trials included in this review, we assessed one trial to have high risk of bias due to including a subset of participants who were allowed to choose their intervention. The remaining five trials were of either low or uncertain risk of biases.</P>

<P>Optic neuritis is an inflammatory disease of the optic nerve. It usually presents with an abrupt loss of vision and recovery of vision is almost never complete.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-27 20:16:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six RCTs with a total of 750 participants. Each trial was conducted in a different country: Denmark, Germany, India, Japan, UK, and United States. Additionally, we identified two ongoing trials not due to be completed until 2016. Among the six trials included in this review, we judged one to be at high risk of bias. The remaining five trials were judged to be at either low or uncertain risk of biases.</P>
<P>Five trials compared only two intervention groups and one trial had a three-arm comparison of oral corticosteroids or intravenous corticosteroids with placebo. Of the five trials with only two intervention groups, two trials compared oral corticosteroids versus placebo, two trials compared intravenous corticosteroids with placebo, and one trial compared intravenous dexamethasone with intravenous methylprednisolone plus oral prednisolone.</P>
<P>Three trials evaluating oral corticosteroids used varying doses of corticosteroids versus placebo. In the meta-analyses to assess visual acuity, the risk ratio (RR) was 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.23; participants = 398) at one month; 0.92 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.11; participants = 355) at six months; and 0.93 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.24; participants = 368) at one year. In the meta-analyses of two trials evaluating corticosteroids with total dose greater than 3000 mg administered intravenously, the RR of normal visual acuity (defined as 20/20 Snellen fraction or equivalent) in the intravenous corticosteroids group compared with the placebo group was 1.05 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; participants = 346) at six months. The RR of contrast sensitivity in the normal range for the same comparison was 1.11 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.33; participants = 346) at six months follow-up. The RR of normal visual field for this comparison was 1.08 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.21; 346 participants) at six months; and 1.01 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.19; participants = 316) at one year. Four trials reported adverse events primarily related to gastrointestinal symptoms and sleep disturbance; one trial reported minor adverse event of acne.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-10 17:11:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Optic neuritis is an inflammatory disease of the optic nerve. It is second only to glaucoma as the most common acquired optic nerve disorder in persons under 50 years. The majority of people with optic neuritis are between the ages of 20 and 50 years, with a mean age ranging from 30 to 35 years. In population-based studies in the United States, the annual incidence of optic neuritis has been estimated to be between 1 and 5 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1998</LINK>). Koch-Henriksen and Hyllested reported an annual incidence of 4 to 5 per 100,000 for new onset optic neuritis cases in Denmark from 1948 to 1964 (<LINK REF="REF-Koch_x002d_Henriksen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch-Henriksen 1988</LINK>). In Olmstead County, Minnesota, United States the prevalence rate of optic neuritis was estimated as 115 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 1995</LINK>). Women are more often affected than men. Optic neuritis is closely linked to multiple sclerosis (MS) and in most cases has a similar pathogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Lightman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lightman 1987</LINK>). It may be the first manifestation of multiple sclerosis or occur later in its course (<LINK REF="REF-Ebers-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebers 1985</LINK>). A similar, yet distinct condition to multiple sclerosis known as neuromyelitis optica, or Devic's disease, also is characterized by optic neuritis. Because neuromyelitis optica is very rare and is treated with a different course than typical cases of optic neuritis, we considered optic neuritis secondary to neuromyelitis optica to be outside the scope of this review.</P>
<P>The presenting symptom of optic neuritis usually is abrupt visual loss in one eye taking place over several hours or days, accompanied by mild pain. In about 10% of cases, symptoms occur in both eyes either simultaneously or sequentially (<LINK REF="REF-de-la-Cruz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">de la Cruz 2006</LINK>). A clinical diagnosis of optic neuritis may be made based on the following: age between 18 and 45 years, sudden visual loss with progression within one week, pain with eye movement, absence of inflammation in the vitreous or anterior chamber, and improvement in vision that begins within three to four weeks of initial symptoms. The prognosis for visual recovery after acute optic neuritis is generally good; however, most people have some lasting visual impairment. Even when an individual's visual acuity does return to normal, abnormalities frequently remain in other measures such as contrast sensitivity, color vision, and visual field (<LINK REF="REF-Fleishman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleishman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1986</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-12 20:33:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Corticosteroids have been used since the early 1950s to treat acute optic neuritis because of their anti-inflammatory effects. Initially, some experts advocated treatment with oral prednisone while others recommended alternative or no treatment. In the 1980s, anecdotal reports suggested that high-dose intravenous corticosteroids might be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Spoor-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spoor 1988</LINK>). In 1992, the National Eye Institute of the United States National Institutes of Health funded a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of optic neuritis (<LINK REF="STD-ONTT-1992_x002d_2006" TYPE="STUDY">ONTT 1992-2006</LINK>). Based on results of this trial the current guidelines in the United States suggest either administration of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone to hasten recovery of vision or no treatment. No other treatment has been shown to aid recovery of vision lost due to acute optic neuritis.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-05-12 20:34:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>By controlling the inflammation associated with optic neuritis, it is believed that visual recovery may be quicker, permanent damage to the optic nerve may be prevented, or both. However, corticosteroids, along with having anti-inflammatory properties, also have known side effects such as hypertension and may lead to other eye disease such as glaucoma or cataract.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-07-28 15:35:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prior to the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) (<LINK REF="STD-ONTT-1992_x002d_2006" TYPE="STUDY">ONTT 1992-2006</LINK>), well-established guidelines for treating optic neuritis did not exist. Brusaferri and Candelise published a meta-analysis of steroids for multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis with inclusion criteria for participants and treatment type different from those specified for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Brusaferri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brusaferri 2000</LINK>). A systematic review of available studies is needed to further explore the value of corticosteroids in treating optic neuritis.</P>
<P>We first published a Cochrane review of this topic in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Vedula-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vedula 2007</LINK>), for which we identified five trials of corticosteroid use in participants with acute optic neuritis compared with placebo or no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Kapoor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kapoor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ONMRG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">ONMRG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ONTT-1992_x002d_2006" TYPE="STUDY">ONTT 1992-2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-T_x00fc_bingen-Study-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tübingen Study 1993</LINK>). In an update of the review in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Gal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gal 2012</LINK>), we identified one additional trial that had investigated the effects of two corticosteroids head-to-head (<LINK REF="STD-Menon-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Menon 2007</LINK>).</P>

In all trials, visual field was measured; <LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1999</LINK> did not assess visual field in a systematic manner (personal communication with Dr. Sellebjerg). In four trials, personnel assessed color vision (<LINK REF="STD-Menon-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Menon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ONMRG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">ONMRG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ONTT-1992_x002d_2006" TYPE="STUDY">ONTT 1992-2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Menon-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Menon 2007</LINK> also reported stereoacuity and visual evoked response as outcomes.

Normal visual acuity was defined as 20/20 Snellen fraction or equivalent in the other five included trials, normal visual field was defined as greater than &#8722;3.00 dB by Goldmann perimeter test; contrast sensitivity was measured in various ways. Normal contrast sensitivity was defined as greater than 1.65 log units in <LINK REF="STD-ONTT-1992_x002d_2006" TYPE="STUDY">ONTT 1992-2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ONMRG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">ONMRG 1999</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1999</LINK> measured contrast sensitivity using Arden gratings and defined normal as less than or equal to 80 points. <LINK REF="STD-Kapoor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kapoor 1998</LINK> considered normal contrast sensitivity to be greater than 1.35 dB by Humphrey automated perimetry when carried out using the manufacturer&#8217;s 30-2 protocol.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-27 15:23:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute demyelinating optic neuritis is a common form of optic neuritis, with inflammation of the optic nerve that often is associated with multiple sclerosis. Optic neuritis is the initial manifestation of multiple sclerosis in some people (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtzke-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzke 1985</LINK>). In this systematic review performed to evaluate the effects of corticosteroid therapy in participants with optic neuritis, we included six randomized controlled trials. We did not conduct a meta-analysis including all trials because of clinical heterogeneity resulting from variations in doses and routes of administration of corticosteroids. However, we conducted a meta-analysis of trials evaluating similar doses of corticosteroids (3000 mg or more) administered by the oral route and the intravenous route. The ONTT was the largest of the included trials and contributed the most weight in all the meta-analyses, which used the inverse weighting approach (<LINK REF="STD-ONTT-1992_x002d_2006" TYPE="STUDY">ONTT 1992-2006</LINK>). While none of the other included trials reported an evidence of benefit with intravenous corticosteroids, the results of our analyses are consistent with the effects on vision of intravenous corticosteroids reported by the ONTT investigators (<LINK REF="STD-ONTT-1992_x002d_2006" TYPE="STUDY">ONTT 1992-2006</LINK>). The 95% confidence intervals for the pooled risk ratios of normal visual acuity, contrast sensitivity in the normal range, and normal visual field at six months for the oral corticosteroids arm and the intravenous route in ONTT include the null value, thus suggesting no evidence of benefit with either oral or intravenous corticosteroids compared to placebo in this large trial for the outcomes of interest in this review (<LINK REF="STD-ONTT-1992_x002d_2006" TYPE="STUDY">ONTT 1992-2006</LINK>). This observation is consistent with the analyses of ONTT outcome data when adjusted for baseline visual acuity (<LINK REF="STD-ONTT-1992_x002d_2006" TYPE="STUDY">ONTT 1992-2006</LINK>). A life-table analysis reported in the same article indicated that the rate of return of vision to normal was higher with intravenous corticosteroids than with placebo (P = 0.09 for visual acuity, 0.02 for contrast sensitivity and 0.0001 for visual field). No statistically significant difference was found for the same outcomes for oral corticosteroids compared with placebo in a life-table analysis in the trial report. However, ONTT participants treated with oral corticosteroids had a higher rate of new episodes of optic neuritis compared with those in the placebo arm. The pooled risk ratio indicated a statistically significant benefit with respect to achieving a normal visual field at one month for participants treated with intravenous corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Finally, there was no evidence of benefit when intravenous corticosteroids were compared to intravenous followed by oral corticosteroids for the visual acuity and contrast sensitivity outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Menon-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Menon 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-04-27 21:53:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials evaluating oral corticosteroids were very heterogeneous in dose of medication, method of corticosteroid delivery, and comparison group. For the comparisons where meta-analysis was possible, there was no evidence of benefit with oral or intravenous corticosteroids for each of the outcomes considered. The 95% confidence intervals for the risk ratio of normal visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and visual field included the null value. Oral corticosteroids, however, resulted in statistically significantly fewer ONTT participants who had achieved normal visual acuity by one year compared with the placebo group and was consistent with our review findings. Our review has included no comparison of outcomes between higher and lower doses of corticosteroids. Adverse effects were inconsistently reported; comparisons of different management strategies were not possible. Therefore, the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids in treating optic neuritis was not supported by the currently available evidence.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-07-26 21:36:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the assessment of trial quality per pre-specified criteria, we judged the overall quality of evidence as low to moderate. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment before randomization were implemented in only two of the six included trials. Masking of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors was achieved in only two trials. Complete or nearly complete outcome data were reported from four trials. Only one trial was considered to be at high risk of selective outcome reporting bias. In addition, one trial was judged to have high risk of bias because a subgroup of participants was allowed to select their treatment; four trials were judged to be unclear risk of other bias due to source of funding to conduct the trial.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-07-26 21:37:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are unaware of any potential biases in the review process. We searched multiple databases to identify six RCTs relevant to this review. Data extracted from the trials focused on clinical and functional outcomes and were confirmed by at least two authors. Thus, the findings regarding the effectiveness of corticosteroids on treating optic neuritis is based on established, reproducible methods. Inadequate reporting of adverse events may have led to underestimation of such outcomes.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-07-27 15:24:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) was the first major study to examine corticosteroid treatment for optic neuritis, most other review articles also use data from the ONTT as the basis for their conclusions (<LINK REF="STD-ONTT-1992_x002d_2006" TYPE="STUDY">ONTT 1992-2006</LINK>). In a narrative review article by <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2014</LINK>, authors came to the same conclusions as this review: that short-term benefits were seen in the methylprednisolone arm of ONTT, but by one year, there was no clinically or statistically significant difference between treated and untreated participants. Another review on optic neuritis diagnosis and treatment explained corticosteroid treatment in much the same manner, reporting that treatment with corticosteroids hastens recovery but does not affect the final outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Toosy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toosy 2014</LINK>). Brusaferri and Candelise published a meta-analysis of steroids for multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis and although the inclusion criteria and treatment type differed from this review, the conclusions were the same (corticosteroid treatment improved visual acuity at 30 days but the improvement did not differ between treatment arms to a statistically significant degree during longer follow-up) (<LINK REF="STD-Brusaferri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brusaferri 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>There was no conclusive treatment benefit with return to normal visual acuity, visual field or contrast sensitivity with either intravenous or oral corticosteroids at the doses evaluated by trials included in this review. Either no treatment or treatment with intravenous corticosteroid therapy followed by oral corticosteroids is appropriate; intravenous corticosteroids may benefit the patient in terms of faster recovery to normal vision. As suggested by analyses reported in the ONTT, oral corticosteroid therapy has been associated with an increase in rate of new episodes of optic neuritis (<LINK REF="STD-ONTT-1992_x002d_2006" TYPE="STUDY">ONTT 1992-2006</LINK>).</P>

Future research efforts could focus on the identification of participant subgroups who are predisposed to have permanent visual deficits and would benefit from therapy that could reduce neural damage.</P>
<P>The trial database included a total number of 750 participants enrolled in the six trials. Except for the ONTT, individual trials likely did not have adequate power to detect or rule out a statistically significant difference in one-year outcomes that favored corticosteroids; larger trials with longer follow-up may yield different results. Future trials evaluating the role of high dose oral corticosteroids (greater than 3000 mg) as a treatment option for optic neuritis may be warranted.</P>
<P>Neurological outcomes were not the focus of this review but future research to evaluate the role of high-dose oral corticosteroids as a treatment option for optic neuritis, and including the observation of neurological outcomes, may be warranted.</P>
