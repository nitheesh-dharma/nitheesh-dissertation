<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-07-28 16:42:10 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>In women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) what are the best methods to prevent embryos from being expelled after the embryo transfer (ET) procedure?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>In recent years assisted reproduction has become more evidence based in an attempt to determine what techniques truly work. This has led to major changes in the way embryos are transferred and what therapies are given to women before and after the transfer. Even so, one aspect that is still not well established is whether or not there are ways to decrease the movement or expulsion rate of embryos from the uterus following transfer. Based on this lack of information, combined with the need to clearly improve outcomes by reducing the risk of losing embryos following transfer, Cochrane authors decided to systematically locate and review the best available evidence regarding interventions for the prevention of embryo expulsion in women undergoing IVF and ICSI.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Following meticulous searches of major databases (all databases searched June 2013, MDSG register last searched June 2014) and conference proceedings we were able to locate four trials, with a total of 1392 women. These were all prospective, randomised controlled trials comparing two competing post-ET interventions or an intervention versus no treatment on clinical outcomes in women undergoing IVF and ICSI. Each study recruited from 164 to 639 infertile women of reproductive age and all were conducted in IVF centres; none of them had conflicts of interest regarding study funding.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Our primary measure of success, live birth rate, was not reported in any of the included trials.</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to support a specific length of time for women to remain recumbent, if at all, following ET, nor was there sufficient evidence to recommend the use of fibrin sealants. There was very limited evidence to support the use of mechanical pressure to close the cervical canal. Further large well-designed studies are required to determine the true effectiveness and safety of these interventions.</P>
<P>There was no evidence that any of the interventions had an effect on adverse event rates, but data were too few to reach any conclusions.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons. The main limitations were failure to report live births, imprecision and risk of bias. Study risk of bias was variable, with the reporting of a proper method of randomisation and allocation concealment demonstrated in most trials while only one trial clearly blinded both the patients and the clinicians to the intervention received.</P>

<P>In women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), embryos transferred into the uterine cavity can be expelled due to many factors including uterine peristalsis and contractions, low site of deposition and negative pressure generated when removing the transfer catheter.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-07-28 16:41:48 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials to June 2014 and PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, CINAHL, World Health Organization ICTRP, and trial registers from inception to June 2014, with no language restrictions. Additionally, we handsearched reference lists of relevant articles, and ESHRE and ASRM conference abstracts.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-07-04 23:41:12 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions used to prevent post-transfer embryo expulsion in women undergoing IVF and ICSI. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and reviewed the full-texts of all potentially eligible citations to determine whether they met our inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-07-04 23:42:18 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included trials using standardised, piloted data extraction forms.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-05 15:21:48 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included four RCTs (n = 1392 women) which administered the following interventions: bed rest (two trials), fibrin sealant (one trial), and mechanical closure of the cervix (one trial). Our primary outcome, live birth rate, was not reported in any of the included trials; nor were the data available from the corresponding authors. For the ongoing pregnancy rate, two trials comparing more bed rest with less bed rest showed no evidence of a difference between groups (odds ratio (OR) 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.31, 542 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, low quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were sporadically reported with the exception of the clinical pregnancy rate, which was reported in all of the included trials. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rate between more bed rest and less bed rest (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.31, 542 women, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, low quality evidence) or between fibrin sealant and usual care (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.78, 211 women, very low quality evidence). However, mechanical closure of the cervix was associated with a higher clinical pregnancy rate than usual care (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.40 to 2.63, very low quality evidence). The quality of the evidence was rated as low or very low for all outcomes. The main limitations were failure to report live births, imprecision and risk of bias. Overall, the risk of bias of the included trials was high. The use of a proper method of randomisation and allocation concealment was fairly well reported, while only one trial clearly reported blinding. There was no evidence that any of the interventions had an effect on adverse event rates but data were too few to reach any conclusions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-18 18:03:46 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Despite the major advances made in ovarian stimulation and in vitro embryo development, pregnancy and embryo implantation rates following embryo transfer (ET) have remained consistently low. The majority of women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) reach the transfer stage with good quality embryos available for transfer, but only a small proportion of them ever achieve a live birth. It is estimated that up to 85% of the embryos placed into the uterine cavity fail to implant (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1995</LINK>). This may reflect a bottleneck in the sequential processes required for a successful IVF treatment cycle.</P>
<P>The pregnancy rate following ET is dependent upon multiple factors including embryo quality and endometrial receptivity (<LINK REF="REF-Sallam-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sallam 2005</LINK>). With regard to the ET technique itself, factors such as the ease of the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Lesney-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesney 1998</LINK>), use of a trial ET (<LINK REF="REF-Mansour-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansour 1990</LINK>), the choice of ET catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Abou_x002d_Setta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou-Setta 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Abou_x002d_Setta-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou-Setta 2006</LINK>), and ultrasound guidance during ET (<LINK REF="REF-Sallam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sallam 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Abou_x002d_Setta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou-Setta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2010</LINK>) may improve the clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>In recent years more emphasis has been placed on the optimisation and standardisation of the ET protocol through the production of evidence-based guidelines. Even so, post-transfer aspects of the ET technique are still debated. Different strategies have been proposed to prevent the expulsion of embryos from the cervix by preventing the intrauterine movement of embryos post-transfer.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-07-18 18:00:15 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>During ET, embryos are transferred to the uterus to allow for implantation and pregnancy to occur. Movement in the uterine cavity of the fluid that contained the embryos away from the site of deposition is an undesirable event and the expulsion of transfer fluid after ET is commonly seen in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Schulman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghazzawi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghazzawi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mansour-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansour 2005a</LINK>). This fluid has been shown to sometimes contain the transferred embryos (<LINK REF="REF-Ghazzawi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghazzawi 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-07-18 18:03:46 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Several interventions have been proposed to possibly resolve these events. These are bed rest (<LINK REF="REF-Sharif-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharif 1998</LINK>), the use of a fibrin sealant (Feichtinger 1992; Bar-Hava 1999), and mechanical closure of the cervix by use of a speculum (<LINK REF="REF-Mansour-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansour 2005a</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-07-05 00:17:54 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Embryo movement following transfer has been theorized to occur while removing the ET catheter or with immediate mobilization after the transfer procedure. In theory there would be a linear relationship between the time spent in a recumbent position and the success rates following ET, at least until embryo implantation occurred. Moreover, expulsion of embryo-containing fluid would result in failure of the transfer, especially if a limited number of embryos were transferred (for example single embryo transfer). Therefore, any intervention that could prevent this unwanted expulsion would potentially result in higher pregnancy and live birth rates.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-07-05 00:20:35 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Historically women were advised to have complete bed rest for up to 24 hours, or more, following ET as a measure to improve success. More recently clinicians have opted to decrease the time immediately following ET that women spend resting in order to make the procedure more patient friendly (<LINK REF="REF-Sharif-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharif 1998</LINK>) and guidelines have proposed bed rest for only 15 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). This trend towards allowing for earlier or immediate patient mobilization is still not completely accepted in all centres and a widespread variation in clinical practice is apparent.</P>
<P>Factors other than the transfer technique itself may influence the success rate following ET. However, there is still debate on which issues directly relate to the success rate. In light of this controversy, and the need to clearly identify the risk of embryo loss following ET, we decided to systematically identify, analyse, and review the best available evidence in the medical literature.</P>

Two review authors (from AMAS, LP, ADA, HA) independently screened the titles and abstracts identified by the search results to determine if a citation met the inclusion criteria. The full texts of citations classified as 'include' or 'unclear' were reviewed independently with reference to the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus by discussion with a third review author, as required. We corresponded with study investigators to clarify study eligibility when needed.

<P>We assessed internal validity using the Cochrane Collaboration&#8217;s risk of bias tool. This tool consists of six domains and assesses five specific biases.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Design</HEADING>
<P>All the included trials were conducted in single centres with sample sizes ranging from 164 to 639 participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All the included trials recruited women undergoing IVF, ICSI and ET at infertility centres. The mean age of participants ranged from 32 to 37 years. Only one trial reported the mean number of infertile years. Most women were undergoing down-regulation using a long agonist protocol, received human menopausal gonadotrophin for ovarian stimulation, and were given 10,000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) for final oocyte maturation. Oocyte fertilisation was performed using a mix of IVF and ICSI and most women underwent cleavage stage ET.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions and comparators</HEADING>
<P>The trials described bed rest immediately following ET (<LINK REF="STD-Amarin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Amarin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Purcell-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Purcell 2007</LINK>), the use of a fibrin sealant (<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Rafael-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Rafael 1995</LINK>), and mechanical closure of the cervix (<LINK REF="STD-Mansour-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mansour 2005</LINK>) following ET.</P>
<P>For bed rest following ET, there was some heterogeneity in the length of time prescribed to women in the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Botta-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Botta 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amarin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Amarin 2004</LINK>). In general the goal was to prevent embryo movement due to gravity by remaining recumbent following the ET procedure.</P>
<P>For the use of a fibrin sealant, Ben-Rafael et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Rafael-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Rafael 1995</LINK>) noted that they used the 'two step' technique described by Feichtinger et al (Feichtinger 1992). The described technique uses multiple columns of air or medium to separate the fibrin sealant and embryo compartments. The sealant components were loaded into the catheter first followed by either an air or medium column. Finally, a medium column containing the embryos was aspirated into the ET catheter. This allowed the embryos to be closest to the uterine cavity and the subsequent columns of media and fibrin sealant to create a layer between the embryos and the uterine cavity.</P>
<P>For the mechanical closure of the cervix, Mansour (<LINK REF="STD-Mansour-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mansour 2005</LINK>) described loosening the screw of the vaginal speculum after introducing the ET catheter to allow the two lips of the speculum to gently close the portio vaginalis of the cervix. Following ET and removal of the transfer catheter, the vaginal speculum was left in place, pressing on the cervix, for another five to seven minutes to maintain cervical closure as a way of preventing expulsion of fluid from the uterine cavity.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-05 16:04:06 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No data were available on live births. There is limited evidence from a single trial to suggest that mechanical occlusion of the cervix after ET may improve pregnancy rates. Bed rest for varying lengths of time following ET and the use of a fibrin sealant were not associated with improved outcomes. There was no evidence that any of the interventions had an effect on adverse event rates, but data were too few to reach any conclusions.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-07-05 16:05:36 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has identified three individual post-ET interventions that may affect the success rates in women following ET. The lack of adequate numbers of included trials coupled with the small sample sizes does not allow for definitive conclusions to be made regarding the use of bed rest (two trials, 542 women) or fibrin sealants (one trial, 211 women). The evidence for the use of mechanical closure of the cervix was gathered from a single trial (639 women). The present level of evidence demands the need for future well-designed and powered trials to either support or challenge these results or introduce evidence for other interventions.</P>

<P>The quality of the evidence was rated as low or very low for all outcomes. The main limitations were failure to report live births, imprecision and risk of bias. Evidence was lacking for the live birth rate and only half the included trials reported on the ongoing pregnancy rate.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-07-05 16:07:08 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In order to prevent bias from being introduced into the review process, the authors performed extensive searches to locate all properly randomised trials of interest to this review. Even so, the availability of only four included trials demonstrates a gap in our knowledge base. It is important to note that this gap has persisted since the last update of the review in 2008 and therefore may not be high on the agenda of researchers. Furthermore, the lack of available data on the primary outcome indicates a possible bias in the outcomes. To the best of our knowledge there are no systematic biases with this review. Even so, two of the review authors (AMAS, HA) were employed at the centre where one of the included trials was performed (<LINK REF="STD-Mansour-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mansour 2005</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-07-18 18:02:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>To the best of our knowledge this is the only comprehensive systematic review of the evidence on post-ET interventions to prevent embryo loss in women undergoing IVF and ICSI. In addition, the results of the included trials and meta-analysis of bed rest and the use of fibrin sealant are similar to the results of prospective controlled trials investigating the same interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Feichtinger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Feichtinger 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Botta-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Botta 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rezabek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rezabek 2001</LINK>). We are not familiar with any other published randomised trials comparing mechanical closure with no intervention. Even so, one group has published two quasi-randomised trials (Amui 2009; Amui 2011) comparing mechanical closure with no intervention and have not demonstrated a significant benefit from using this intervention.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-06-25 13:55:43 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support any specific length of time for women to remain recumbent, if at all, following embryo transfer or the use of fibrin sealants added to the embryo transfer fluid. There is very limited evidence to support the use of mechanical pressure to close the cervical canal following embryo transfer.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-06-25 14:10:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Further well-designed and powered studies are required to determine the true effectiveness and safety of these and other post-embryo transfer interventions to prevent embryo loss in women undergoing IVF and ICSI. Of particular importance is whether or not any duration of bed rest is beneficial. Furthermore, more RCTs are required to strengthen the evidence base on the use of fibrin sealants and mechanical pressure on the cervix.</P>

<P>One review author (AM Abou-Setta) took the initiative in preparing the protocol for the review with input and feedback provided by the other review authors (A D'Angelo, R Hart, HN Sallam). Three review authors (AM Abou-Setta, LR Peters, A D'Angelo) screened the results of the literature search and independently considered trials for inclusion. Differences in interpretation were resolved by discussion and refereeing by the other review authors (HN Sallam, R Hart, HG Al-Inany). Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials and assessed the risk of bias (AM Abou-Setta, HG Al-Inany). Differences in interpretation were resolved by discussion and refereeing by the other review authors (HN Sallam, R Hart, A D'Angelo). One review author (AM Abou-Setta) prepared the final manuscript with input and feedback provided by the other review authors (LR Peters, A D'Angelo, HN Sallam, R Hart, HG Al-Inany).</P>

<P>We have removed the primary outcome 'ongoing pregnancy or live birth rate' and the secondary outcome 'multiple pregnancy rate' from the list of outcome measures. We have expanded the search strategy, incorporating new search terms and databases being searched. We have updated the review methodology to be in line with 'methodological expectations of Cochrane intervention reviews' (MECIR) recommendations including adding a summary of findings table.</P>
