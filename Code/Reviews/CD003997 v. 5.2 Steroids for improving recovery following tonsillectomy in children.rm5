<P>The current review differs from the 2003 review in several ways.</P>
<P>Two authors (JA Welge and CM Myer) were no longer involved and two new authors (JJ Grisel and J Meinzen-Derr) joined.</P>
<P>We included 10 new studies and excluded 17 additional studies. This review does not include diet at day three as an outcome measure (included in 2003), but it does now include pain as measured by a visual analog scale. Children in the steroid group were two times less likely to vomit than children in the placebo group. They were also more likely to advance to a diet by day one and less likely to experience pain. These results strengthen the results found in the 2003 review.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-18 12:52:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After children have a tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy (surgery to remove the adenoids and/or tonsils), pain, nausea, vomiting and delays to return to eating are common. The corticosteroid drug dexamethasone is sometimes given in a single intravenous dose (through the veins) during surgery to try to prevent vomiting after the operation. We included 19 randomized controlled trials in the review, with a total of 1756 patients. The review of trials found that a dose of corticosteroid during tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy can prevent vomiting for one out of every five children who gets the drug. Children also return to a normal diet more quickly and they have less pain after surgery.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-07-01 12:52:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 19 studies (1756 participants). We selected only randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies to minimize inclusion of poor quality studies. However, the risk of bias in the included studies was not formally assessed. Children receiving a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone (dose range = 0.15 to 1.0 mg/kg) were half as likely to vomit in the first 24 hours compared to children receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.58; P &lt; 0.00001). Routine use in five children would be expected to result in one less patient experiencing post-tonsillectomy emesis (risk difference (RD) -0.24; 95% CI -0.32 to -0.15; P &lt; 0.00001). Children receiving dexamethasone were also more likely to advance to a soft/solid diet on post-tonsillectomy day one (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.83; P = 0.001) than those receiving placebo. Finally, postoperative pain was improved in children receiving dexamethasone as measured by a visual analog scale (VAS, 0 to 10) (MD -1.07; 95% CI -1.73 to -0.41; P = 0.001), which correlates clinically to a reduction in pain (on a VAS of 0 to 10) from 4.72 to 3.65. No adverse events were noted in the included studies.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-03-18 12:56:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 1, 2003.</P>
<P>Tonsillectomy continues to be one of the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide. Despite advances in anesthetic and surgical techniques, post-tonsillectomy morbidity (emesis, poor oral intake, pain and bleeding) remains a significant clinical problem for the patient, family and physician (<LINK REF="REF-Randall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randall 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>During the past 40 years, investigators have studied the effects of systemic corticosteroids in reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Papangelou-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Papangelou 1972</LINK>). Results of randomized, placebo-controlled studies of single intravenous steroid dosing have been conflicting; some demonstrating benefit and others showing no benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Aouad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aouad 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-April-1996" TYPE="STUDY">April 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Catlin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Catlin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohlms-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlms 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pappas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pappas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Volk 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vosdoganis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vosdoganis 1999</LINK>). For this reason, a Cochrane systematic review was completed in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Steward-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steward 2003</LINK>), which showed that a single dose of intraoperative, intravenous steroids reduced postoperative emesis by half and children were more likely to return to a soft/solid diet by day one. Although pain was a predefined outcome measure in the 2003 review, due to inconsistencies in pain measurement we could not analyze this outcome, although a systematic review focusing specifically on pain was performed in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Afman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afman 2006</LINK>). Additionally, multiple randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have been performed during the intervening years since the initial review in 2003, which has created the need for an update of the current literature.</P>
<P>In an attempt to consolidate current research findings for emesis, return to diet and pain outcomes, and to update the Cochrane Review performed in 2003, we performed a systematic overview of published clinical trials using established meta-analysis techniques with a predetermined protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saks-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saks 1987</LINK>). Our hypothesis that a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone reduces morbidity following pediatric tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy is based upon clinical experience and published randomized studies demonstrating reduction in post-tonsillectomy morbidity. Our goals were to determine if a meta-analysis of randomized studies would still statistically support this hypothesis and to determine if a statistically significant result would have clinical relevance.</P>

<P>Note: in the Cochrane Review of 2003, return to diet by post-tonsillectomy day three was also analyzed. In that review, only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Catlin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Catlin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Volk 1993</LINK>) met the inclusion criteria for day three analysis, and the results did not show any statistical significance between the steroid group and placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Steward-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steward 2003</LINK>). Since 2003, return to diet by day three has not been measured with any consistency. For this reason, day three diet was eliminated from the current review. Additionally, several studies have measured time to first oral intake (hours). This outcome measure was not included in the 2003 review, and an improvement in this measure was felt to add little additional information separate from the &#8216;return to diet by day one&#8217; measure. Therefore, this measure was not included in the current review.</P>

<P>We specifically designed our protocol to select only randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies to minimize inclusion of poor quality studies. While we did not rank studies based upon quality, the authors did assess the methodological quality of included studies. Two of the authors (DLS, JG) worked independently to assess trials for methodological quality using the following criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomization), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow up and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. We added information about allocation concealment to the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> under the 'Risk of bias' tables.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-07-01 12:54:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed all meta-analyses of the included trials using the RevMan 5.1 software developed by the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We performed all data analyses with random-effects models and reported Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we derived a pooled risk difference from a random-effects model. When a study collected but did not report data regarding one of the three primary outcome measures, we excluded that study from the meta-analysis of that particular outcome measure. When a measurement tool for an outcome from one study differed from other studies in such a way as to prevent pooling of data, we excluded that study and provided the reasons in the results section. Lastly, we excluded studies that did not collect data regarding a particular outcome measure from analysis of that outcome measure. We made decisions regarding the exclusion of studies from analysis based on the above criteria with the investigators blinded to the results of the studies. RevMan calculates measures of heterogeneity with the Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test and I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic, which measures the inconsistency of effects across interventions. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess statistically the impact of study exclusion due to missing data or different measurement tools (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1989</LINK>). We also performed sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact of publication bias or missed studies (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1979</LINK>).</P>

<P>To address problems of quality in meta-analysis, some authors have suggested methods to assign relative value to studies based upon assessment of quality (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1981</LINK>). However, this technique has not gained universal acceptance (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1989</LINK>). We specifically designed our protocol to select only randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies to minimize inclusion of poor quality studies.</P>
<P>While we did not rank studies based upon quality, the authors did assess the methodological quality of included studies. Two of the authors (DLS, JG) worked independently to assess trials for methodological quality using the following criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomization), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. We added information on allocation concealment to the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> in the 'Risk of bias' tables.</P>
<P>Only six studies reported adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-April-1996" TYPE="STUDY">April 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Catlin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Catlin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elhakim-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elhakim 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giannoni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Giannoni 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanasono-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hanasono 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Volk 1993</LINK>), while the remaining studies were unclear on this point. Performance bias included surgical and anesthetic techniques, which were controlled in nine of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aouad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aouad 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Catlin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Catlin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elhakim-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elhakim 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giannoni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Giannoni 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanasono-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hanasono 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohlms-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlms 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pappas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pappas 1998</LINK>). Surgical technique was not controlled in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kaan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Khani 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samarkandi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Samarkandi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1996</LINK>), while anesthetic technique was not controlled in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Shehri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Al Shehri 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-April-1996" TYPE="STUDY">April 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Volk 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vosdoganis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vosdoganis 1999</LINK>), one of which used blocked randomization to address this issue (<LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1996</LINK>). Attrition bias did not appear to be significant within any of the studies and all studies reported the number of subjects excluded from analysis. Outcome measurements differed amongst studies and are discussed specifically in the results section for each outcome measure. Reporting bias (not reporting data with no statistical significance) was present in one study for the emesis outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Catlin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Catlin 1991</LINK>), two studies for dietary outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Catlin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Catlin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Volk 1993</LINK>) and four studies for pain outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-April-1996" TYPE="STUDY">April 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Catlin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Catlin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Volk 1993</LINK>). Based on this analysis, the authors feel that the risk of bias is low, however we did not perform a formal assessment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Emesis</HEADING>
<P>We evaluated emesis by analyzing the number of patients who experienced an emetic event during the first 24 hours following tonsillectomy. For this outcome measure, we pooled the data from 15 studies (1273 participants). The result of the meta-analysis suggests a statistically significant risk ratio, favoring steroids (RR 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.58; P &lt; 0.00001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In addition, patients who received steroids had lower rate of emesis (21%) compared to patients who received placebo (48%). The pooled risk difference for this analysis was statistically significant (RD -0.24; 95% CI -0.32 to -0.15; P &lt; 0.00001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). No significant heterogeneity regarding the risk ratio was noted in this meta-analysis (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 14%; P = 0.3), although significant heterogeneity was present regarding the risk difference (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 71%; P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analysis (emesis)</HEADING>
<P>We checked the sensitivity of this analysis to potential reporting bias (not reporting data with a null result) first by deleting and then by assuming a null result for the Giannoni et al study (<LINK REF="STD-Giannoni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Giannoni 2002</LINK>). The results were not significantly different for either the deleted (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.58; P &lt; 0.00001) or null assumption analyses (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.60; P &lt; 0.00001). We also conducted sensitivity analysis by assuming a null result for the Catlin et al study (<LINK REF="STD-Catlin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Catlin 1991</LINK>). Again, the results were not different including Catlin et al with a null assumption (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.59; P &lt; 0.00001). To check the sensitivity of the emesis analysis to possible publication bias (not publishing studies with a null result) and/or studies missed by the search strategy, we calculated the fail-safe N as described by Rosenthal (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1979</LINK>). The result of this analysis suggests that 129 studies with a null risk ratio (i.e. RR = 1) would be required to raise the overall risk ratio to statistical non-significance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diet (day one)</HEADING>
<P>We evaluated diet by analyzing the number of patients that advanced to a soft or solid diet during post-tonsillectomy day one.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We pooled the data from five studies (452 participants) in the day one diet analysis. The result of this meta-analysis suggests statistical significance using both risk ratio (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.83; P = 0.001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) and risk difference (RD 0.21; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.31; P &lt; 0.0001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Although moderate heterogeneity was noted regarding both the risk ratio (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 46%; P = 0.12) and the risk difference (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 44%; P = 0.13), neither was statistically significant.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analyses (day one diet)</HEADING>
<P>To determine the impact of potential reporting bias, we performed sensitivity analysis assuming a null result for the two studies with missing data (<LINK REF="STD-Catlin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Catlin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Volk 1993</LINK>). The missing proportions in each group for each study were set equal to the observed average over all studies (0.58). The risk ratio is reduced, but still suggests statistical significance (RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.61; P = 0.001). To assess the impact of possible selection bias resulting from exclusion of the studies by Pappas et al, Aouad et al and Kaan et al, we performed sensitivity analysis by also including these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aouad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aouad 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pappas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pappas 1998</LINK>). The result suggests statistical significance (RR 1.52; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.97; P = 0.001) even when including the null assumption for the missing data as described above (RR 1.23; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.46; P = 0.01).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pain</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies (652 participants) were included in this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Elhakim-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elhakim 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giannoni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Giannoni 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanasono-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hanasono 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Khani 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohlms-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlms 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Volk 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vosdoganis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vosdoganis 1999</LINK>). The result of this meta-analysis suggests statistical difference in the mean difference regarding mean pain scores (mean difference (MD) -1.07; 95% CI -1.73 to -0.41; P = 0.001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). We excluded three studies because they did not report pain as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Aouad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aouad 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kyrou-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kyrou 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1996</LINK>). Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Shehri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Al Shehri 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-April-1996" TYPE="STUDY">April 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Catlin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Catlin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samarkandi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Samarkandi 2004</LINK>) that evaluated pain as an outcome measure did not publish enough data for analysis, and thus were excluded. Pappas et al reported analgesic use as a pain outcome measure and Tom et al reported the frequency of pain between study groups; both studies were also excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Pappas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pappas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tom 1996</LINK>). Significant heterogeneity was noted in this meta-analysis (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 86%; P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analysis (pain)</HEADING>
<P>To determine the impact of potential reporting bias, we performed sensitivity analysis assuming a null result for the six studies that did record pain scores, but did not adequately report results for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Shehri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Al Shehri 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-April-1996" TYPE="STUDY">April 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Catlin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Catlin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samarkandi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Samarkandi 2004</LINK>). This was done by assuming a null result for the additional studies and recalculating the pooled difference in means. Including the additional studies reduced the pooled mean difference, but the results remained significant (MD -0.59; 95% CI -1.18 to 0.0; P = 0.05).</P>
<P>We detected significant heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of pain scores, therefore we also performed a sensitivity analysis to determine whether the heterogeneity was due to the presence of one or two outlying studies. Each study was subsequently removed from the analysis and the pooled results were recalculated to determine which study(ies) contributed the most to the heterogeneity. Results indicated that both of the studies by Elhakim et al (<LINK REF="STD-Elhakim-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elhakim 2003</LINK>) and Khani et al (<LINK REF="STD-Khani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Khani 2009</LINK>) contributed the most to the I<SUP>2</SUP>. After excluding these two studies, the I<SUP>2</SUP> was 0% (P = 0.67) (MD -0.48; 95% CI -0.85, -0.10; P = 0.01).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-07-01 13:13:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Meta-analysis</HEADING>
<P>With certain limitations, meta-analysis is a valuable tool that can provide a more objective evaluation of a group of studies than a traditional narrative review (<LINK REF="REF-Alsarraf-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alsarraf 2000</LINK>). Limitations of meta-analysis are well described and can be grouped into problems of combinability, selection bias and the quality of the original studies (<LINK REF="REF-Sharpe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharpe 1997</LINK>). Combinability problems result from 'mixing apples and oranges'. In our study this relates to pooling data from studies with different surgical techniques, surgical procedures, anesthetic techniques, dexamethasone dosages, patient populations and outcome measurement tools. To address this problem, we accepted the inherent heterogeneity amongst the trials and utilized a random-effects model for analysis, rather than a fixed-effect model. This has the advantage of allowing for variability within the patient populations and also for variability in treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>To address problems of selection bias in our meta-analysis, we performed sensitivity analyses to determine the impact on our results due to exclusion of studies: potentially missed or unpublished; with missing data; or with a significantly different measurement tool (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1979</LINK>). The results for the emesis and day one diet outcome measures remained significant even after the sensitivity analysis. For the pain outcome, the pooled mean difference (MD) changed from -1.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.73 to -0.41; P = 0.001) to -0.59 (95% CI -1.18 to 0.0; P = 0.05).</P>
<P>To address problems of quality in meta-analysis, some authors have suggested methods to assign relative value to studies based upon assessment of quality (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1981</LINK>). However, this technique has not gained universal acceptance (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1989</LINK>). We specifically designed our protocol to select only randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies to minimize inclusion of poor quality studies. As such, we think it unlikely that quality issues significantly impact the result of our analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Emesis</HEADING>
<P>Our results suggest a statistically significant reduction in chance of experiencing episodes of post-tonsillectomy emesis during the first 24 hours with dexamethasone versus placebo for pediatric patients.</P>
<P>The mechanism by which dexamethasone may exert an anti-emetic effect remains unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Brunton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunton 1996</LINK>). However, dexamethasone has been shown to be an effective anti-emetic in randomized trials with emetogenic chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Hesketh-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hesketh 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Research-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Research 1995</LINK>). Additionally, randomized studies of a serotonin antagonist plus either dexamethasone or placebo have shown a statistically significant reduction in emesis after pediatric tonsillectomy in the dexamethasone-treated group (<LINK REF="STD-Fujii-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Fujii 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Holt 2000</LINK>). Thus, despite the fact that the mechanism is not yet understood, an anti-emetic effect of corticosteroids is supported by other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henzi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henzi 2000</LINK>) and widely accepted (<LINK REF="REF-Schimmer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimmer 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The number needed to treat (NNT = 1/risk difference) is a statistical inference of the size of therapeutic effect one might expect in clinical practice. The NNT of 4.17 predicts that routine use of a single intravenous dose of dexamethasone in approximately five patients would result in one less patient experiencing post-tonsillectomy emesis. This suggests therapeutic benefit with a clinically relevant effect size. This therapeutic benefit is consistent with the previous review in 2003. In clinical practice, whether or not an individual patient responds will likely be dependent upon patient factors, anesthetic technique, narcotic use and possibly the amount of blood swallowed during tonsillectomy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diet</HEADING>
<P>An earlier return to a regular diet following tonsillectomy as a result of dexamethasone therapy could be the result of mood elevation, appetite stimulation, anti-emetic effect or a combination of these (<LINK REF="REF-Schimmer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimmer 1996</LINK>). Our results of the day one diet outcome measure demonstrate a statistically significant increase in the number of patients returning to a soft/solid diet during the first 24 hours. In 2003, the systematic review also demonstrated a statistically significant difference (RR 1.69, P = 0.04). The current review reduces the chance of a type I error from 4% to 0.1%.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The NNT of 4.76 suggests that routine use of dexamethasone in five children would result in one more child advancing to a soft/solid diet on post-tonsillectomy day one. This suggests a clinically significant effect size. These results are consistent with and support the findings of the 2003 systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Steward-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steward 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pain</HEADING>
<P>In the 2003 Cochrane Review, pain was listed as a predefined outcome, but there were insufficient data to analyze the results. Since that time, eight studies have rigorously measured postoperative pain using a visual analog scale (VAS). (<LINK REF="STD-Elhakim-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elhakim 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giannoni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Giannoni 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanasono-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hanasono 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khani-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Khani 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohlms-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlms 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Volk 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vosdoganis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vosdoganis 1999</LINK>). The results of meta-analysis of these studies demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in postoperative pain for patients in the steroid group (MD -1.07; 95% CI -1.73 to -0.41; P = 0.001). These data are consistent with the results of a systematic review devoted specifically to this issue (<LINK REF="REF-Afman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afman 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The clinical significance of this observed pain reduction must be considered. Each study measured pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) with 0 corresponding to 'least pain' and 10 corresponding to 'most pain' (studies with different pain scales were normalized to a 0 to 10 scale). The mean score in the placebo group was 4.72 and the steroid group was reduced to 3.65. The sensitivity analysis decreased this pain reduction benefit (MD -0.59; 95% CI -1.18 to 0.0; P = 0.05). Therefore, while dexamethasone was associated with reduction in pain, the clinical significance of this finding should be interpreted with caution. The effect size of the estimated benefit on postoperative pain appeared to be, in part, driven by specific studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Safety</HEADING>
<P>One of the excluded studies was terminated prematurely because the steroid group demonstrated significant postoperative hemorrhage compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Czarnetzki-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Czarnetzki 2008</LINK>). Several methodological questions have been raised regarding this study, including non-standardization of diagnosis, administration of ibuprofen, non-standard surgical technique and attributing primary hemorrhage to dexamethasone use (<LINK REF="REF-Gunter-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunter 2009</LINK>). Indeed, four of eight patients requiring surgical re-intervention had bleeding on the day of surgery. The use of ibuprofen perioperatively is also controversial. Ibuprofen is known to have antiplatelet effects and some practice guidelines discourage its perioperative use (<LINK REF="REF-Douketis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douketis 2008</LINK>), although a recent prospective study comparing tonsillectomy patients recovered with ibuprofen did not observe increased bleeding rates compared to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Yaman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaman 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings published by Czarnetski et al resulted in several retrospective chart reviews representing 3318 patients receiving intraoperative, intravenous dexamethasone (<LINK REF="REF-Brigger-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brigger 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shakeel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shakeel 2010</LINK>). These studies did not show any increase in bleeding rates associated with steroid use. None of the other included or excluded studies for this review demonstrated any increased bleeding risk. It should also be considered that the findings of Czarnetski et al were a type I error. Duplication under more appropriate study conditions should be performed before serious consideration can be made of their claim.</P>
<P>Other risks to patients of single-dose dexamethasone appear minimal. A single dose of corticosteroid, even a large one, has been considered to be virtually without harmful effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schimmer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimmer 1996</LINK>). The most concerning potential risks of corticosteroid therapy include immune system suppression resulting in severe systemic infection and avascular joint necrosis. Disseminated varicella infection (chicken pox) is described in patients undergoing immune suppressive steroid therapy. A systematic review of avascular joint necrosis found that while risk is associated with increased daily steroid dosage, no increased risk was observed with single bolus dosing (<LINK REF="REF-Felsen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felsen 1987</LINK>). While neither complication has been reported as a consequence of a single perioperative dose during tonsillectomy, this does not imply that these complications are not possible. Appropriate discussion of the risks and benefits of therapy should occur between patient, family and physician.</P>
<P>The cost of dexamethasone is relatively low, which makes routine use seem reasonable. This modest increase in cost may be offset by a reduction in cost resulting from rescue anti-emetic therapy, prolonged hospitalization or both. However, its cost-effectiveness remains to be studied.</P>
<P>A previously published version of this meta-analysis suggested improved anti-emetic effect with increasing dexamethasone dose (<LINK REF="REF-Steward-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steward 2001</LINK>). Though meta-analysis lends itself to subset analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saks-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saks 1987</LINK>), caution should be used in evaluating this result as these studies were not designed to assess dose effect and patients were not randomized to different dosages. Additionally, because both mg/kg dose and the maximum dose given varied amongst these studies, statistical results of regression analysis of only the former are questionable. Therefore, the question of appropriate dosing remains unanswered and final recommendations must await randomized dose-control trials</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Generalizability</HEADING>
<P>As this analysis excluded studies with adult patients, these results cannot be generalized to the adult population. However, dexamethasone has been shown to be an effective anti-emetic in adult patients undergoing emetogenic chemotherapy, suggesting a role for further study in adult tonsillectomy patients. Previous randomized, placebo-controlled studies of adult patients have focused primarily on pain as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tewary-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tewary 1993</LINK>).</P>

<P>Tonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide. Despite changes in anesthetic and surgical techniques, however, postoperative morbidity remains a significant clinical problem. The results of our meta-analysis suggest a statistically significant reduction in postoperative morbidity with single-dose dexamethasone therapy given during pediatric tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Specifically, our results suggest a statistically significant reduction in post-tonsillectomy emesis events during the first 24 hours and an increase in the number of patients advancing to a soft/solid diet on postoperative day one. Postoperative pain is also reduced with dexamethasone use. Moreover, single-dose dexamethasone therapy is inexpensive and, if harmful effects occur, they are exceptionally rare. Given the frequency with which tonsillectomy is performed; the low cost and safety of single-dose intravenous dexamethasone; and the benefit from emesis reduction, return to a soft/solid diet and pain reduction, the evidence suggests that routine use would significantly reduce morbidity from pediatric tonsillectomy.<BR/>
