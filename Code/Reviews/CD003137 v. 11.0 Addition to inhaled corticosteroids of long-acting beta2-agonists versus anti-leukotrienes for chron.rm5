I have corrected the SoF, abstract and PLS in terms of the new point estimate, 95% CI and absolute differences from outcome 1.1. Please check that you agree with my changes. I have also corrected the text which wrongly attributed statistical significance for some of the tests for sub-group differences. Again please check that you agree with my changes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note for Emma W - PLEACS guidance to authors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma J notes 13.6.13&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) I've accepted all the tracked changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Please could you add 'dates accessed' for those I've highlighted (11 I think).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Please can you look at validation report - 'section missing' for Study characteristics x4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC April 4th in Perth. Problems with checking review in so will try again. Now working so will correct 12 and 48 week data and revise the section in the text for this. Duration has been added a 7th subgroup analysis and data is now correct (please check this Toby). The next paragraph describes risk of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Feb 1st. I have accepted Francine's tracked changes and addressed the highlighted text questions. Stelmach 2007a references all removed. The single versus combined inhalers are statistically significantly different for exacerbations but &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; adverse events. I think the abstract correctly focusses primarily on the overall result, rather than the subgroups which may be confounded by other differences. The single and combined studies have different LRTA risks for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby, could you revise the flow chart to make the total 17 studies please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Edited Jan 17th 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CFC-BDP issue clarified (I hope). I have put in a new Cates plots for the exacerbations at 48 weeks and contrasted this with the plot for SAEs over the same duration. I have changed SAE subgroup Forest plots for number of devices to IV methods to show that there is not a significant difference between single and combined inhalers on the plot. I have removed the post hoc subgroup analysis by funder. I have also toned down the single versus separate inhalers conclusions, as the difference between subgroups is NOT significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL edit 7/01/2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure whether the post-hoc subgroup analysis by funder is pure mischief or helpful...There are a number of related variables here not least study duration (longer in the LTRA manufacturer studies than in the LABA manufacturer studies). The ratio of risk ratios is non-significant but only just (RRR 1.35, P = 0.152). For now I have retained this, and it does feel like fishing, but am happy for CJC to make final ruling on this...In view of the fact that it is post hoc and there was little statistical variation in the first instance, I would be concerned about whether this is published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC editing Aug 22 2006&lt;br&gt;Thanks for checking this Francine. I am sure that the way of tackling NNT is valid in this review and will send you the dublin slides! I have made a minor change to the new sentence and we should be able to get this onto the next submission tomorrow&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The similarity of results with and without Grosclaude 2003 underscores the robustness of the pooled effect estimate for this outcome and confirms that the group difference observed is due to the differential effect of LABA and LTRA and is not affected by the different inhaled steroids used in the two arms of Grosclaude 2003.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;============================&lt;br&gt;July 25 2006&lt;br&gt;Hi Francine,&lt;br&gt;The point I was trying to make with Grosclaude is that the randomisation was to the combination of S/FP vs BDP/LRTA so the trial compares the combination of these two agents and is not a clean comparison of LRTA v LABA. We therefore have to assume that the FP and BDP do not influence any of the outcomes. As there is no great increase in heterogeneity in the lung function outcomes when Grosclaude is added I am prepared to go with this. I have added a note to the morning PEF results to explain this and report sensitivity analysis without Grosclaude.&lt;br&gt;As far as NNT is concerned we cannot report a timeless NNT as it does not mean anything. I am presenting an abstract in Dublin on this topic but I am quite sure we need to stick with the pooled OR/RR from all the studies and use this to calculate NNT for a given baseline risk which must be for a SPECIFIC time frame. You double the NNT each time you halve the duration of a study. If you know a better way to assess baseline risk of exacerbation over one year we can use this, but we cannot just use the average baseline risk across different studies with different durations. The other 3 studies last for 12 weeks and have a baseline risk of exacerbation of 5.2% which gives a 12 week NNT of 106 (63 to 676). This could be separately reported but might confuse readers. It makes no sense at all to me to take an average of these two NNTs (at 48 and 12 weeks), so I strongly suggest that we stick with the current methodology for this update which we can then submit in August.&lt;br&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;re: NNT then is only valid for long-term studies which may be different in their patient selection, intervention, co-interventions, etc. It would be worthwhile calculating NNT for all studies and also reporting it without a time frame, so that we can gave the direction and magnitude of any bias derived from these 3 studies - I don't like to be at the mercy of few studies. Could you please do that?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;re: Grosclaude. I feel strongly that we should keep this study in. In all systematic reviews and in this in particular, we have never specified as a requirement for inclusion the use of the same medication in both arms but rather the same class of medication. However, we have always ensured that the two arms were equivalent in potency; if this condition was not met, the study was excluded or dealt with in another comparison. In this case, CFC-BDP 500 bid is considered equivalent to FP 250 bid. Perhaps, it is because of a language issue (this paper is French) but your email seems to suggest that you believed there were two randomisations, one for LABA vs LTRA and one for FP vs BDP. this was not the case: patients were randomised to S/FP in a single device vs BDP-LTRA.&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Dear Francine,&lt;br&gt;Sorry for the delay - i have just returned from 2 weeks surfing in cornwall.&lt;br&gt;Thanks very much for updating this review. The NNT was standardised to 48 weeks by using the overall pooled Odds Ratio from all studies and applying this to the average baseline risk of exacerbation at 48 weeks using the data from the long studies only. I have added a line to the methods section about this.&lt;br&gt;The main contentious area for this update relates to the inclusion of the Grosclaude trial; this is different from the others as patients were randomised to both LABA v LRTA and FP v Beclometasone. I regard this as a dirty comparison as the different steroid could influence the exacerbation rates and the lung function results. I would propose therefore that this study is either excluded on these grounds, or put in as a separate comparison making clear that this patients are randomised to the double intervention.&lt;br&gt;Could you let me know what you think?&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;PS I am very happy for you to submit to the BMJ if you wish and would also be happy to be a co-author. I am not sure if you are aware of the existing paper in Chest which you may wish to mention in the references and my response to the authors in view of their different conclusion from our review based upon their decision not to pool any studies?&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;Dear Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby and I have updated the LTRA vs. LABA as add-on to ICS review. There are 4 new eligible trials, of which none contributed additional data to the main outcome and two contributed additional data to secondary outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindly review the update and&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Verify the calculation of the NNT. I am not sure how it was standardized on 48 weeks. I think you did it when you reviewed the original version. Perhaps, you could add a line in the methodology to describe how it was standardized?&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;and inform me if you will submit it to external peer review or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;p.s. I would like to submit it to BMJ.

See changes to the text in red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: We will need to unravel the first author and corresponding author issue here! We have no other reviews where these two are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: &amp;quot;Other co-interventions such as xanthines, anticholinergics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications were not permitted.&amp;quot; non-steroidals will be understood as being Ibuprofen etc. I am sure this is not what you mean so please omit or clarify this. MOREOVER THIS IS A COMPLETE CHANGE FROM THE PROTOCOL SO NEEDS TO BE DESCRIBED AS SUCH AND JUSTIFIED IN THE METHODS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Very thorough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: No problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: &amp;quot;This review of eight good quality randomised controlled trials has shown that both options are safe and effective.&amp;quot; How has the review done this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Only randomised controlled trials conducted in adults or children with recurrent asthma where a LABA (for example, salmeterol or formoterol) or LTRA (for example, montelukast, pranlukast, zafirlukast) was added to ICS for a minimum of 28 days were considered for inclusion. Inhaled short-acting &amp;#223;2-agonists and short courses of oral steroids were permitted as rescue medications. Other pharmacological co-interventions were not permitted. &amp;quot; THIS IS NOT AN OBJECTIVE BUT A SUMMARY OF INCLUSION CRITERIA AND NEEDS AMENDING PLEASE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Use of a single inhaler to deliver LABA+ICS was superior to use of two separate inhalers.&amp;quot; This was not a pre-specified sub-group analysis and is not based on head to head comparisons. It is therefore data-driven and I do not think this should be in the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In asthmatic adults inadequately controlled on low doses of inhaled steroids, the addition of LABA is marginally superior to LTRA for preventing exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, lung function, symptoms, and use of rescue b2-agonists. The review supports the use of both options as add-on to ICS, with slight preference to LABA over LTRA.&amp;quot; There is clearly a statistically significant difference. Clinical significance is much more difficult to assess and may be safer to leave to the reader in my view! Present the data and let the reader draw their own conclusions. How does the review support the use of LRTA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: 4 of the subgroups were not in the protocol so this needs to be made explicit or these should be removed as they are not a priori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: &amp;quot;There was no evidence of systematic bias identified by the test for funnel plot asymmetry.&amp;quot; This does not fit well with my funnel plot produced by RevMan that shows a lack of small studies favouring LRTA using both OR and RR! This is subject but may need to be moderated by stating that visual inspection of funnel plot suggested a lack of small studies favouring LRTA but .......&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot; The difference in the magnitude of effect, attributable to the number of inhaler devices, was statistically significant (Chi2 =4.35 (1df), p&amp;lt;0.05)).&amp;quot; This needs to be moderated as it was not in the protocol and is not head to head. I would be much more cautious about this (especially because it is interesting and therefore tempting to make much of!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;a posteriori subgroup analysis suggested a trend towards greater risk with use of two separate devices (RR=1.43 95% CI 1.04 to 1.97) rather than 1 device (RR=0.55 95% CI 0.19 to 1.64) for administering LABA + ICS (l2.=2.7 (1df), p=0.1).&amp;quot; I am even more unhappy about the way that this is reported as the P value is NOT Significant it should not be reported as a trend in favour of one treatment. This is reporting bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The magnitude of protective effect of LABA was more significantly influenced by the number of inhalers used for administering the combination of LABA + ICS; use of a single inhaler led to a 50% reduction in the risk of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids compared to 10% reduction with two inhalation devices.&amp;quot; See above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Surprisingly, in the two trials reporting this outcome, patient satisfaction only marginally (RR=1.12) favored long-acting b2-agonist over leukotriene receptor antagonists.&amp;quot; In my view this is overstated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Although derived from nearly 6000 patients in 8 trials, the results of this meta-analysis may be reversed by as little as 9 additional trials.&amp;quot; Seems a lot of trials to me??? Why do you describe this a little. How big would these trials need to be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Importantly, the use of a single, rather than two, devices to administer the combination of LABA and ICS appear more promising, and possibly safer. &amp;quot; But please add caution about post hoc subgroup analysis!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The evidence support the use of both options as add-on to inhaled steroids, with a slight preference in favour of LABA.&amp;quot; You will need to justify this as the current data only assess the comparison between the two treatments and I am not sure how you can conclude this from the review?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Where is the Gold data on exacerbations??? Why has this not been published. Considered with funnel plot of primary outcome this suggests publication bias? GSK are on the author list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: back to authors.&lt;br&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Francine has replied to this in a separate email.&lt;br&gt;CJC relook 14 July&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your details letter about the changes you have made in relation to my comments above.&lt;br&gt;Further alterations made: IN BOLD RED&lt;br&gt;Abstract (conclusions)&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We interpret the magnitude of additional benefit provided by LABA over LTRA as relatively modest and suggest that both options might be considered as add-on to ICS, with slight preference to LABA over LTRA. &amp;quot; I have removed the slight preference bit. Not appropriate, subjective comment, that is covered by the previous sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REsults&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot; It should be noted that these comparisons are indirect and that the rate of exacerbations varied considerably between studies, so it is not certain that the differences found are only attributable to the number of inhalers used.&amp;quot; Added as a cautionary note to the end of paragraph. If you look at RD there is no significant difference between single and combined inhalers - not a consistent finding!&lt;br&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot; Importantly, the use of a single, rather than two, devices to administer the combination of LABA and ICS appear more promising, and possibly safer. &amp;quot; I do not think you can say possibly safer as you have removed the non-significant difference that supported this so I have deleted the last 3 words. Especially this is the case with very little reporting of effects on liver functions!!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francine,&lt;br&gt;How did you calculate the mean change in FEV1 and PEF with LRTA. I have done this using weighted and unweighted means and cannot replicate your results. Can I see your workings for this? This data really needs to come from pooled results of LRTA v Placebo trials in addition to ICS. This is a more secure way of assessing this effect and PEF from your review is 7.7ml for PEF. This needs to be set alongside the data you give here! Similarly the quoting of a clinically important difference in the LABA arm for FEV1 should come from placebo trials NOT this data. Single arms must be compared with each other and reported as such. Similarly the quoting of a clinically important difference in the LABA arm for FEV1 should come from placebo trials NOT this data. Single arms must be compared with each other and reported as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Await response from Felix before working further on this.&lt;br&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;CJC August 5th&lt;br&gt;Francine has submitted spreadsheet for single arms. &amp;quot;See attached xls file. I realize I have made a mistake in the 2 PEFs:&lt;br&gt;change in AM PEF observed in LTRA is 21.51 instead of 19.4 L/min(fixed effect)&lt;br&gt;change in PM PEF observed in LTRA is 18.04 instead of 15.9 L/min(fixed effect)&lt;br&gt;change in FEV1 observed in LTRA group was correct at 134 mL (fixed effect)&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;And an amended paragraph for the discussion section:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The average difference in the improvement from baseline in FEV1 between LABA and LTRA was 80 mL. Although this difference appears minimal, only the average improvement in FEV1 observed with LABA+ ICS (215 mL), but not with LTRA + ICS (134 mL), exceeded what is generally considered normal intra-subject variation, e.g., &amp;gt;=200 mL in FEV1 and would thus be considered clinically important improvement. ATS 1991 In absence of a placebo group treated with ICS alone, one must recognized that these values likely overestimate the true benefit of each drug alone. Indeed, other Cochrane reviews have quantified the magnitude of improvement in FEV1 attributable to each drug over that of ICS and placebo; the use of LABA+ICS was associated with an additional increase of 180 mL (Ni Chroinin, unpublished data) while a non statistically increase of 60 mL was observed for the combination of LTRA and ICS (Ducharme 2004) over ICS alone. Thus, 80 mL difference in improvement in FEV1 observed in the present review between LABA and LTRA is in keeping with previous Cochrane reviews comparing each drug to ICS alone. Clearly, although both treatment options appear to lead to improvements in asthma control, the absence of a placebo group prevents firm conclusion as to their respective efficacy as opposed to ongoing treatment with inhaled steroids alone.&lt;br&gt;The superiorityof LABA + ICS over LTRA+ICS was more modest for the proportion of rescue-free and symptom-free days, use of rescue b2-agonists, quality of life, symptom score, night awakenings, and patient satisfaction. There was no group difference in the risk of hospital admission and withdrawals due to poor asthma control.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have incorporated the new paragraph into the review and rectified the PEF results. All other amendments have been checked.&lt;br&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;cjc Sep 16 and 23&lt;br&gt;Title changed as LABA is treatment and LRTA is control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANGES TO TEXT ARE IN RED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers contributions amended. CJC now included as second author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes re-ordered to make primary outcome first in Metaview and subtotals switched off. Totals cross-checked between FD and FR and they agree. Results amended to reflect re-ordered outcomes. Sub-group analyses left at the bottom.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;both options appear effective, although their superiority over inhaled steroids alone could not be assessed. However,&amp;quot; removed from synopsis and text amended.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;and suggest that both options might be considered as add-on to ICS&amp;quot; removed from conclusions in abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Types of intervention: check if other interventions were permitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ilowite has been published so reference added and text of review amended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mean Jadad score is not useful and has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is confusion over allocation concealment and double blinding. &amp;gt; Ask FD to check on allocation concealment for the trials and therefore ABC grading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publication bias cannot be ruled out and the text has been altered on this section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results section has been rewritten combining the two versions of the review. The numbers match except where NNT is concerned and this has been taken from Francine's version using Odds Ratios as described in methods section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NNT removed from single v combined results as these are not head to head and depend on ARR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No difference changed to no significant difference throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion amended as in red with value statements (such as modest improvement etc) avoided as far as possible. Paragraph on size of difference in FEV1 retained but modified to remove the significance of the individual arms (not a valid comparison measure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions _ amended to try to balance both points of view. Peer review responses awaited on this.&lt;br&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;3 Oct 2004&lt;br&gt;Feedback from Felix and Fracine incorporated. Formula for NNT has been removed as it was wrong. Odds do not behave like risks.&lt;br&gt;This is now ready for Peer Review.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oops I just checked the I2 results and have changed 5 outcomes to random modelling!&lt;br&gt;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;4 November 2004&lt;br&gt;Peer reviewers take exception to statement &amp;quot;We interpret the magnitude of additional benefit provided by LABA over LTRA as relatively modest. &amp;quot; This has been removed.&lt;br&gt;NNT has been revised to reflect baseline event rate from 48 week studies of 16% (rather than 11% for all studies) and is reported as a 48 week NNT. Visual Rx figure added to illustrate this Figure 2&lt;br&gt;Otherwise the high quality of the review has been commended!&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Long-acting &amp;#223;2-agonists versus anti-leukotrienes as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids in chronic asthma&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-01-23 15:56:27 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="ALEV-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.7 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="11.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-01-13 13:32:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People who continue to experience asthma symptoms despite regular use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) represent an asthma management challenge. The addition of a long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (LABA) and the addition of an oral anti-leukotriene (LTRA) are two therapeutic options.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>What is the best add-on treatment in adults and children with asthma whose condition is inadequately controlled with ICS alone: LABA or LTRA?</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>From available evidence until December 2012, we found 16 trials involving 6872 adults and two trials involving 336 children contributing to the review. The risk of asthma exacerbations requiring the use of corticosteroids was lower with the combination of LABA + ICS compared with LTRA + ICS&#8212;from 13% to 11%. The choice of LTRA (montelukast or zafirlukast), the dose of ICS and the age of patients did not significantly affect the results. The effect appeared stronger in trials of short duration and in those using a single device to administer both ICS and LABA. Serious adverse events were more common with LABA than with LTRA, particularly in adults. The combination of LABA + ICS was superior to LTRA + ICS in terms of lung function and was modestly superior in other indicators of the control of asthma and quality of life. LTRA was found superior in preventing deterioration during exercise. The risk of withdrawal from a trial for any reason was significantly lower with LABA than with LTRA. More patients were satisfied with the combination of LABA + ICS, and fewer changed therapy if they started with LABA instead of LTRA.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>In adults whose asthma is inadequately controlled with ICS, the addition of LABA to ICS was found to be modestly superior to LTRA + ICS. Although both options appeared safe, evidence suggests that slightly more serious adverse events (SAE) may be seen with LABA than with LTRA, particularly when separate devices are used to administer LABA + ICS. Because only two paediatric trials contributed data to the review, the best adjunct strategy to ICS remains uncertain for children.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Our confidence in the quality of evidence is high in the primary efficacy outcome (i.e. patients with exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids and high to moderate efficacy and safety measures). One open-label study of adult patients with asthma contributed to certain outcomes that led to downgrading of the quality of evidence from high to moderate. Of note, only two paediatric trials contributed to this review.</P>

<P>Asthma patients who continue to experience symptoms despite taking regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) represent a management challenge. Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) and anti-leukotrienes (LTRA) are two treatment options that could be considered as add-on therapy to ICS.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-01-21 17:26:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>To compare the safety and efficacy of adding LABA versus LTRA to the treatment regimen for children and adults with asthma who remain symptomatic in spite of regular treatment with ICS. We specifically wished to examine the relative impact of the two agents on asthma exacerbations, lung function, symptoms, quality of life, adverse health events and withdrawals.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register until December 2012. We consulted reference lists of all included studies and contacted pharmaceutical manufacturers to ask about other published or unpublished studies.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-01-13 11:41:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in adults or children with recurrent asthma that was treated with ICS along with a fixed dose of a LABA or an LTRA for a minimum of four weeks.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We sought unpublished data and further details of study design when necessary.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-13 13:26:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>We included 18 RCTs (7208 participants), of which 16 recruited adults and adolescents (6872) and two recruited children six to 17 years of age (336) with asthma and significant reversibility to bronchodilator at baseline. Fourteen (79%) trials were of high methodological quality.</P>
<P>The risk of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (primary outcome of the review) was significantly lower with the combination of LABA + ICS compared with LTRA + ICS&#8212;from 13% to 11% (eight studies, 5923 adults and 334 children; risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.99; high-quality evidence). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with LABA compared with LTRA to prevent one additional exacerbation over four to 102 weeks was 62 (95% CI 34 to 794). The choice of LTRA, the dose of ICS and the participants' age group did not significantly influence the magnitude of effect. Although results were inconclusive, the effect appeared stronger in trials that used a single device rather than two devices to administer ICS and LABA and in trials of less than 12 weeks' duration.</P>
<P>The addition of LABA to ICS was associated with a statistically greater improvement from baseline in lung function, as well as in symptoms, rescue medication use and quality of life, although the latter effects were modest. LTRA was superior in the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm. More participants were satisfied with the combination of LABA + ICS than LTRA + ICS (three studies, 1625 adults; RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.20; moderate-quality evidence). The overall risk of withdrawal was significantly lower with LABA + ICS than with LTRA + ICS (13 studies, 6652 adults and 308 children; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96; moderate-quality evidence). Although the risk of overall adverse events was equivalent between the two groups, the risk of serious adverse events (SAE) approached statistical significance in disfavour of LABA compared with LTRA (nine studies, 5658 adults and 630 children; RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.79; P value 0.06; moderate-quality evidence), with no apparent impact of participants' age group.</P>
<P>The following adverse events were reported, but no significant differences were demonstrated between groups: headache (11 studies, N = 6538); cardiovascular events (five studies, N = 5163), osteopenia and osteoporosis (two studies, N = 2963), adverse events (10 studies, N = 5977 adults and 300 children). A significant difference in the risk of oral moniliasis was noted, but this represents a low occurrence rate.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-13 13:26:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>In adults with asthma that is inadequately controlled by predominantly low-dose ICS with significant bronchodilator reversibility, the addition of LABA to ICS is modestly superior to the addition of LTRA in reducing oral corticosteroid&#8211;treated exacerbations, with an absolute reduction of two percentage points. Differences favouring LABA over LTRA as adjunct therapy were observed in lung function and, to a lesser extend, in rescue medication use, symptoms and quality of life. The lower overall withdrawal rate and the higher proportion of participants satisfied with their therapy indirectly favour the combination of LABA + ICS over LTRA + ICS. Evidence showed a slightly increased risk of SAE with LABA compared with LTRA, with an absolute increase of one percentage point. Our findings modestly support the use of a single inhaler for the delivery of both LABA and low- or medium-dose ICS. Because of the paucity of paediatric trials, we are unable to draw firm conclusions about the best adjunct therapy in children.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-01-23 15:52:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-21 17:47:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Leukotrienes are inflammatory molecules released along with several other substances by mast cells during the immediate response to an inhaled allergen. They are derived from arachidonic acid, the precursor of prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Wasserman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasserman 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wenzel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenzel 1997</LINK>). Two families of leukotrienes have been identified. Leukotriene B<SUB>4</SUB> acts primarily in conditions in which inflammation is dependent on neutrophils, such as cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. The second group (C<SUB>4</SUB>, D<SUB>4</SUB>, E<SUB>4</SUB>), called cysteinyl-leukotrienes, bind to highly selective receptors to induce eosinophil- and mast cell-induced bronchoconstriction and inflammation associated with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1997</LINK>). Drugs that can interfere with the production (leukotriene synthesis inhibitors) and activity (leukotriene receptor antagonists) of leukotrienes have been designed. Leukotriene synthesis inhibitors (e.g. zileuton) inhibit the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, thus blocking the production of many leukotrienes (e.g. B<SUB>4</SUB>, C<SUB>4</SUB>, D<SUB>4</SUB>, E<SUB>4</SUB>) (<LINK REF="REF-Georgitis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georgitis 1999</LINK>). Leukotriene (cysteinyl) receptor antagonists (e.g. montelukast, zafirlukast, pranlukast) block leukotriene D<SUB>4</SUB> (LTD<SUB>4</SUB>) receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Georgitis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georgitis 1999</LINK>). Both types of leukotriene modifiers are administered orally as tablets.</P>
<P>Two Cochrane reviews have concluded that leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) are mild anti-inflammatory agents when used as monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Chauhan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chauhan 2012</LINK>), and they bring modest benefit as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2004</LINK>). Long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB> (beta2)-agonists (LABA) have a similar mode of action to that of short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA). Some LABA may have a slightly slower onset of action than beta2SABA (<LINK REF="REF-Lotvall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lotvall 1996</LINK>) but display prolonged activation of beta2-receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1995</LINK>) in bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in prolonged duration of action for up to 12 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 1995</LINK>). LABA are recommended solely as add-on therapy to ICS in patients with moderate to severe asthma who remain symptomatic despite anti-inflammatory therapy (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lougheed-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lougheed 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 2011</LINK>). Several concerns have been raised about the safety of LABA, predominantly when used without concomitant ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walters-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2007</LINK>). Because evidence suggests increased risk of severe exacerbations and death, a recent call was made for the withdrawal of inhalation devices containing only LABA. The combination of LABA with ICS has been carefully examined and is superior to placebo when introduced as second-line therapy in adults treated with ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2006</LINK>). In contrast to adults, the addition of LABA to maintenance dose ICS in children with persistent asthma failed to reach a significant reduction in, but rather showed a trend towards, increased risk of oral corticosteroid-treated exacerbations and hospital admissions. These trends raised concern about the safety of combination therapy in view of modest improvement in children younger than 12 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2010a</LINK>). Despite non-statistically significant results for outcomes related to serious adverse events, the data do not prove conclusively that the risk of serious adverse events is abolished by the presence of ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Individuals with asthma who continue to experience symptoms and have ongoing airway obstruction despite taking regular ICS represent a management challenge. Both LTRA and LABA agents may be considered as add-on therapy to ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2007</LINK>). Several reasons are known to support the synergistic effect of either combination at the cellular and pathophysiological level. LABA reduce airway hyperresponsiveness by means of functional antagonism (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 2002</LINK>), and corticosteroids increase the expression of beta2-adrenergic receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Baraniuk-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baraniuk 1997</LINK>); this represents a good combination for synergy. LTRA inhibit the production of cysteinyl leukotrienes&#8212;important pro-inflammatory mediators in asthma that are unaffected by corticosteroid treatment. LTRA are particularly effective in allergen-, exercise- and aspirin-induced asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Krawiec-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krawiec 2002</LINK>). Thus, the addition of LTRA or LABA could potentiate the anti-inflammatory effect of ICS and may lead to better asthma control. The current review compares the relative benefits and the safety profile of adding an LTRA or a LABA to the treatment of patients with asthma whose condition is inadequately controlled by ICS and updates a previous Cochrane review on the same topic (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen studies focused on adults, with mean age ranging from 35 to 44 years, a similar sex representation and mean asthma duration ranging from 10 to 26 years. Two studies recruited children six to 17 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Lemanske-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lemanske 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fogel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fogel 2010</LINK>), and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Nsouli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nsouli 2001</LINK>) failed to report the age of participants.

Severity of asthma, measured by degree of airway obstruction, was available for all but one study and is reported on the basis of categorisations outlined by <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2012</LINK> of mild obstruction, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> 80% of predicted or higher; moderate obstruction, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> 60% to 80% of predicted; severe, less than 60% of predicted.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>During the intervention period, all participants remained on a stable dose of ICS. For the purposes of this review, we considered low ICS doses to be 400 µg/d or less (CFC-BDP equivalent), moderate doses to be 400 to 800 µg/d (CFC-BDP equivalent) and high doses to be 800 µg/d (CFC-BDP equivalent) or higher. Based on this categorisation, most studies assessed the addition of LABA or LTRA to low and moderate doses of ICS (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Two trials failed to report the dose of ICS (<LINK REF="STD-Price-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome: exacerbations requiring oral (systemic) corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>Eight trials (5923 adults and 334 children) contributed data to the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Bjermer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bjermer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fish-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fish 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ilowite-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ilowite 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ringdal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ringdal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lemanske-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lemanske 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2011</LINK>). A statistically significant reduction in the risk of having an exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids was seen with the use of LABA + ICS compared with LTRA + ICS (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.99) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The addition of LABA lowered the risk of an exacerbation from 13% to 11%&#8212;a 2% (95% CI 0 to 3%) risk difference in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids over the use of LTRA. The NNTB from the combination of LABA + ICS compared with LTRA + ICS was 62 (95% CI 34 to 794) to prevent one exacerbation requiring rescue oral corticosteroids over four to 102 weeks (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results were homogeneous despite different treatment and participant characteristics (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Although the funnel plot intercept suggested no evidence of publication bias (-0.01, 95% CI -4.23 to 2.10), visual inspection of the funnel plot precludes firm reassurance (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although no heterogeneity was apparent between trials, we had planned a priori to perform subgroup analyses on the following variables to explore their possible influence on the magnitude of effect (effect modification). The subgroup comparison between single and combined inhalers was added after the initial protocol was published as a result of work subsequently published on this topic (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2003</LINK>).</P>

The confidence intervals for the paediatric study were much wider than in the pooled results from the studies in adults, but no statistically significant subgroup difference was apparent between results in adults and results in children (Chi² = 0.02, df = 1 (P value 0.90), I² = 0%).</P>

Use of a single inhaler to deliver LABA + ICS appeared to provide significantly greater protection against exacerbations compared with LTRA + ICS (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.91) versus use of two separate inhalers (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.41), yet because of the wide confidence interval around each estimate, no statistically significant difference in the magnitude of effect was noted between subgroups of trials using a single inhaler versus two separate inhalers (Chi² = 2.69, df = 1 (P value 0.10), I² = 62.9%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<P>This review demonstrates that, in adult study participants who remain symptomatic on low or moderate doses of ICS, the addition of a LABA significantly reduces by 13% the risk of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids compared with the addition of a LTRA. The proportion of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids was 13% in those treated with a combination of LTRA + ICS versus 11% with the use of LABA, for an absolute risk reduction of 2%. Sixty-two participants had to be treated over four to 102 weeks with LABA + ICS instead of LTRA + ICS to prevent one participant from experiencing an exacerbation requiring rescue oral corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Results were homogeneous between trials. The choice of LTRA did not appear to affect the magnitude of the benefit related to LABA. When compared with LTRA + ICS, a single inhaler containing LABA + ICS was associated with a 30% reduction in the risk of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, and a 10% reduction was observed when the two drugs were delivered separately. This difference was not statistically significant and should be interpreted with caution because it is not based on a head-to-head comparison and may be confounded by other differences between trials that used single or separate inhalers (such as trial duration, ICS dose used and age of participants). However, the direction of effect is congruent with findings of head-to-head comparisons of single versus separate inhalers (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2003</LINK>). No effect of age, ICS dose to which to add adjunct therapy and choice of LTRA was apparent in terms of the magnitude of effect. Although subgroup analyses showed no apparent effect of trial duration on the magnitude of effect, study findings suggest that the superiority of LABA over LTRA was less apparent in children and in trials lasting 48 weeks or longer compared with those lasting 12 weeks or less. Baseline severity of airway obstruction, choice of LABA, type of ICS and methodological quality were too similar between the studies to allow exploration of any effect modification. Additional trials are needed to confirm these trends to enable meta-regression and untangle the effect of other trial and participant characteristics. Consequently, we were unable to identify participant characteristics that would allow us to better guide the selection of treatment for specific patients and, because of the paucity of paediatric trials, we could not firmly conclude which adjunct therapy is best for use in children.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Statistically significant improvements were seen with LABA + ICS versus LTRA + ICS for most secondary outcomes. The average group difference in improvement from baseline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> between LABA and LTRA was 81 mL (95% CI 60 to 100 mL), specifically, 215 mL with the addition of LABA to ICS compared with 134 mL with the addition of LTRA to ICS. A change of 200 mL or more in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> is considered a clinically important difference, as it exceeds normal intrasubject variation; this would suggest that in general the change in LTRA did not exceed normal variation (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1991</LINK>). In the absence of a placebo group, the magnitude of benefit from ICS alone is unclear. Yet, these changes from baseline exceed the previously reported benefit for the additive effect of each drug in comparison with the use of ICS alone, suggesting that other participant or study characteristics may be at play. Indeed, previous Cochrane reviews have quantified the magnitude of improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> attributable to each drug over that of ICS and placebo. The addition of LABA to ICS was associated with an increase of 110 to 120 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2010</LINK>), and an increase of 60 mL was observed for the combination of LTRA + ICS over ICS alone (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2004</LINK>). The clinical importance of the observed differences in favour of LABA over LTRA (81 mL in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, 15 mL in morning PEF and 12 mL in evening PEF) is debatable, particularly as LABA are specifically meant to achieve bronchodilation, and participants were generally selected if they demonstrated significant bronchodilator reversibility. In contrast, compared with the combination of LABA + ICS, the combination of montelukast + ICS was found superior for preventing exercise-induced % fall in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>in children and adults with asthma.</P>
<P>Other outcomes such as rescue-free days, rescue medication use, asthma quality of life, symptom-free days, daytime symptom score, number and percentage of night-time awakenings, participant satisfaction with treatment and number of participants who switched their allocated medication also reported statistically significant better values with LABA. Moreover, significantly fewer participants allocated to the combination of LABA + ICS withdrew from the study for any reason. Yet, for most secondary outcomes (other than lung function, participant treatment satisfaction and participants switching to other treatments), the magnitude of the observed difference appeared modest. No group difference was observed in the risk of withdrawals due to poor asthma control and hospitalisation.</P>
<P>Only two trials examined the impact of both strategies on inflammatory markers, namely, serum eosinophils. The addition of a LTRA to ICS was associated with greater (4%) reduction in serum eosinophils from baseline when compared with LABA + ICS.</P>
<P>The risk of SAE just failed to achieve a statistically significant group difference between LABA and LTRA (3.1% with LABA vs 2.4% with LTRA&#8212;a risk difference of 0.7%). SAE associated with LABA have raised concerns, so we performed a post hoc analysis to explore whether the use of single or separate devices for delivering LABA + ICS and the age of participants influenced the risk of SAE. The increased risk may be limited to the studies using two separate inhalers to deliver LABA + ICS, but again, the subgroup differences were not statistically significant. Yet, the trend is concordant with accumulating evidence of an increased risk of SAE in participants using LABA without ICS and is possibly mediated by non-compliance with concurrent ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Perera-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perera 2003</LINK>). Similarly, adults, but not children, showed a significant group difference with higher numbers of SAE with LABA over LTRA; however, in view of the large confidence interval around the paediatric estimate, no firm conclusion on age can be drawn.</P>
<P>No statistically significant group difference was observed in the risk of cardiovascular events, headaches and osteopenia or osteoporosis. Only the risk of oral moniliasis was significantly higher in the LABA group than in the LTRA group, although the risk difference was clinically small (1% for LABA in comparison with 0.5% for LTRA). The risk of overall adverse events was similar in the two groups, meeting our a priori<I> </I>definition of equivalence and suggesting a similar overall safety profile of the two treatment options. No difference was noted between LABA and LTRA in withdrawals due to adverse effects.</P>
<P>One of the entry criteria common to all included trials was the need to demonstrate significant reversibility in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (&#8805; 12% improvement postbronchodilation). It is possible that the requirement to demonstrate significant reversibility with beta2 SABA resulted in the selection of participants who were more likely to show a response on lung function outcomes. This may explain the greater differences in favour of LABA that were observed with measures of lung function compared with other outcomes. Although reversibility to a bronchodilator is one of the standard diagnostic criteria of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lougheed-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lougheed 2012</LINK>), only a minority of asthmatic participants display significant reversibility at a given point in time (<LINK REF="REF-Storms-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Storms 2003</LINK>). It is quite possible that the selection of participants with significant reversibility has favoured the combination of LABA + ICS over LTRA + ICS.</P>
<P>The major limitation of relevant studies in this area is the strikingly low number of studies examining the best step three in children. Only one of two paediatric trials reported the number of exacerbations requiring the use of rescue oral corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Lemanske-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lemanske 2010</LINK>). Several other paediatric trials were excluded, as they tested add-on therapy in children still on step one or in those already on step three (<LINK REF="STD-Karaman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Karaman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miraglia-del-Giudice-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Miraglia del Giudice 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stelmach-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stelmach 2008</LINK>). As wide variations in the definition of exacerbations have been identified as an important difficulty in comparing data across studies, reporting of data restricted to the use of rescue oral corticosteroids appeared important. Although this review could not provide conclusions regarding the best therapy, many asthma guidelines still recommend LABA as preferred add-on therapy in children. In view of the potential harms associated with LABA, it is particularly critical that future paediatric studies carefully examine the best option as add-on therapy for those who remain inadequately controlled when taking ICS alone using direct comparison of adjunct (LABA vs LTRA) therapy.</P>
<P>The relative homogeneity of adult trials may limit the applicability of the results in individuals older than 65 years of age, smokers and those with asthma with no significant reversibility to SABA. Moreover, how well these add-on therapies perform when added to doses of ICS outside the range of those we have reviewed remains uncertain. Inadequate documentation and reporting also limit the generalisability of results to adolescents. We recommend that trialists including adolescents specify the number of teenagers included and perform subgroup analyses on this age group to begin to address this considerable gap in knowledge. An individual data meta-analysis might provide critical information to reveal whether the presence of allergic rhinitis modifies the observed superiority of LABA over LTRA as add-on therapy to ICS.</P>
<P>With well-documented decreases in adherence over time (<LINK REF="REF-Storms-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Storms 2003</LINK>), one wonders whether an undocumented lack of compliance may have affected the results. Was there poor adherence to a twice-daily regimen for LABA? With a flat dose-response curve to ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2003</LINK>), one may even wonder whether similar improvement observed with LTRA and LABA is derived from enhanced compliance with ICS per se as a result of study participation, rather than the selected add-on therapies. Is the greater improvement associated with concomitant rather than separate delivery of LABA and ICS mostly attributable to better lung deposition of, and interaction between, the two drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Buhl-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buhl 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenhall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenhall 2003</LINK>) or better adherence with ICS? In the absence of adherence measures, these questions remain unanswered. The perception of more rapid and greater benefit for participants with LABA is often regarded by clinicians as justification for selecting LABA over LTRA as add-on therapy. In the three trials reporting satisfaction, significantly more participants were satisfied in the group receiving LABA + ICS (85%) than in the group given LTRA + ICS (76%), and 27% of participants treated with the combination of LTRA + ICS switched to alternative treatment options over the period of two years, which indicates better satisfaction or clinical benefit with LABA + ICS.</P>
<P>Although derived from close to 6000 adult participants in eight trials, the direction of results may be influenced by participant selection. It is possible that a differential effect of add-on options may be influenced by age, airway reversibility, smoking status, severity of baseline airway obstruction, type of asthma (eosinophilic vs non-eosinophilic), triggers (such as allergic rhinitis), adherence, etc. Future studies should focus on comparing these add-on strategies in selected groups of participants, so that characteristics of responders to either option may be better delineated. Measures of adherence (before and after randomisation) should also be incorporated into the design of future studies.</P>
<P>Study results apply predominantly to adult asthmatic patients who remain symptomatic despite predominantly low doses of ICS and who present with a moderate (baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB> 65% to 75% of predicted value) reversible airway obstruction. Data are insufficient to allow firm conclusions regarding children and adults over 65 years of age.</P>
<P>The extensive search strategy and assessment of methodological quality and data extraction provided by two review authors yielded the high-quality outputs. The high methodological quality of all trials contributing data and the confirmation of methodology and extracted data by review authors or of study sponsors for studies contributing to the primary outcome strengthen our findings.</P>

<P>In asthmatic adults with persistent mild or moderate airway obstruction despite low or medium doses of ICS who demonstrate significant reversibility to a short-acting bronchodilator, the absolute risk of an exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids in patients is 2% lower if patients are treated with LABA rather than LTRA. This finding was compatible with an NNTB of 62 over four to 102 weeks. Compared with LTRA, the addition of LABA to ICS is associated with statistically significant greater improvement in lung function, symptom-free days, use of rescue beta2-agonists, symptoms, symptom-free days, night-time awakenings and quality of life, although group differences in several markers are generally modest. The findings are indirectly supported by higher participant satisfaction and lower numbers of participants switching to the alternative treatment with LABA over LTRA as adjunct to ICS. Findings suggest that LABA increase the risk of SAE from 2.4% to 3.1% in adults when compared with LTRA, but the data are much more uncertain in children. These findings would support the use of a single inhaler as the preferred device for delivery of LABA + ICS.</P>

<LI>In the protocol published in April 2001, we had planned to examine the impact of the ICS (subgroups: three) and of baseline severity (subgroups: five) as sensitivity analyses but changed to subgroup analyses because this enhanced the clarity of interpretation. The last two subgroup analyses (six and seven), not initially considered in 2001, were added to the list subsequently, as recent data indicated that the number of inhaler devices used to deliver LABA + ICS might be an important effect modifier (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2003</LINK>), and a peer reviewer suggested that differences might not be the same over 12 weeks and 48 weeks.</LI>
<LI>Because of recent concerns over the association between LABA and SAE, we included a subgroup analysis of data by number of inhaler devices.</LI>
<LI>Study assessment was amended to reflect changes in the recommended approach to risk of bias evaluation. In the original protocol and in the first version of the review, we assessed studies by using the Jadad Scale and by grading concealment of allocation.

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2014-01-21 17:26:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The procedures for randomising GSK-sponsored studies have been detailed in correspondence between Richard Follows and TL, the details of which are given below.</P>
<P>The randomisation software is a computer-generated, centralised programme (RandAll). After verification that the randomisation sequence is suitable for the study design (cross-over, block or stratification), Clinical Supplies then packages the treatments according to the randomisation list generated. Concealment of allocation is maintained by a third party because the sites phone in and are allocated treatments on that basis. Alternatively, a third party may dispense the drug at the sites. Unblinding of data for interim analyses can be done only through RandAll, and this is restricted so that only those reviewing the data are unblinded to treatment group allocation.</P>
