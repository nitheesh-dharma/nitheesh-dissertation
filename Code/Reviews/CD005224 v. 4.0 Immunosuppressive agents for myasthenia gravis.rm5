<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>A review of the use of drugs that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants) in myasthenia gravis.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is caused by antibodies produced by the immune system that impair the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles. This results in muscle weakness that characteristically fluctuates. About one person in every 10 000 - 50 000 develops MG each year. The natural history of the disorder is typically a series of exacerbations and remissions. Severe attacks can be life-threatening because of weakness of muscles involved in swallowing causing choking, and chest muscles causing difficulty with breathing. In MG, immunosuppressant drugs act mainly by reducing the production of antibodies.</P>
<P>There were seven randomised controlled trials to include in this review. Each trial compared different interventions in generalised MG: (1) azathioprine plus initial prednisolone versus prednisolone - 41 participants; (2) azathioprine plus prednisolone versus prednisolone plus placebo (dummy treatment) - 34 participants; (3) ciclosporin monotherapy versus placebo - 20 participants; (4) ciclosporin plus prednisolone versus prednisolone plus placebo - 39 participants; (5) cyclophosphamide plus prednisolone versus prednisolone plus placebo - 23 participants; (6) mycophenolate mofetil plus either ciclosporin or prednisolone or no immunosuppressants versus placebo plus either ciclosporin or prednisolone or no immunosuppressants trial - 14 participants; (7) tacrolimus plus corticosteroids with or without plasma exchange versus no tacrolimus plus corticosteroids with or without plasma exchange trial - 34 participants. </P>
<P>It is difficult to draw useful clinical conclusions from this small number of often short-term, randomised controlled trials. Each trial had relatively few participants and different trials used different study designs. The limited evidence available found that MG improved significantly with either ciclosporin (alone or in combination with corticosteroids) or cyclophosphamide (in combination with corticosteroids) compared with placebo. There is no clear evidence from randomised controlled trials of benefit for any of the immunosuppressant drugs used more commonly in MG - azathioprine (alone or in combination with corticosteroids), mycophenolate mofetil (as monotherapy or in combination with either corticosteroids or ciclosporin) or tacrolimus (in combination with corticosteroids or plasma exchange or both). There is no randomised controlled trial of methotrexate in MG. Long-term studies of the potentially formidable toxic effects of all of these drugs are lacking in MG.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>One author extracted and two checked the data. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven trials are included but few reported the outcomes selected for this review. A meta-analysis of ciclosporin versus placebo from two trials (59 participants) - one as monotherapy (20 participants) and the other with corticosteroids (39 participants) - showed that it resulted in improvement of participants in the ciclosporin group compared with those in the placebo group, with a relative rate of improvement of 2.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 5.27). In addition the weighted mean difference in QMG score between the ciclosporin and placebo groups was -0.34 (95% CI -0.52 to -0.17). Azathioprine (plus prednisolone for first month) had no significant benefit over prednisolone alone (41 participants). The effects of azathioprine plus prednisolone versus prednisolone plus placebo were similar (34 participants). Cyclophosphamide was reported to be statistically more efficacious than placebo at 12 months in corticosteroid-dependent participants (23 participants), but no raw data were available. Trials of mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus did not provide relevant endpoint data for this review. All trials had low numbers of participants. Adverse event reporting was variable. Trial protocol heterogeneity prevented comparison of the different immunosuppressants.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In generalised MG, limited evidence from small RCTs suggests that ciclosporin, as monotherapy or with corticosteroids, or cyclophosphamide with corticosteroids, significantly improve MG. <BR/>Limited evidence from RCTs shows no significant benefit from azathioprine (as monotherapy or with steroids), mycophenolate mofetil (as monotherapy or with either corticosteroids or ciclosporin) or tacrolimus (with corticosteroids or plasma exchange). Bigger, better-designed, longer trials are needed.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-18 21:05:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The clinical hallmark of myasthenia gravis (MG) is fluctuating, painless muscle weakness. It typically starts in the extraocular muscles and remains purely ocular in 15% of people. In the other 85%, MG becomes generalised - usually by descending to involve the bulbar followed by the neck, proximal limb, and sometimes respiratory muscles. Severe respiratory or bulbar weakness constitutes a myasthenic crisis, which can require intubation and mechanical ventilation. </P>
<P>MG is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission usually caused by antibodies to postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the motor endplate (<LINK REF="REF-Drachman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drachman 1994</LINK>). These antibodies reduce the number of functional AChRs, thereby impairing neuromuscular transmission. About 15% of people with generalised MG have no detectable AChR antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Vincent-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 1985</LINK>). However, sera from these AChR antibody-negative people contain other immune factors and about 30 to 50% have IgG antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) (<LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>The annual incidence of MG is about one in 10,000 to 50,000 of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Vincent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 2001</LINK>). The natural history is characterised by exacerbations and remissions (<LINK REF="REF-Richman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richman 2003</LINK>). In untreated MG, the most disabling, sometimes life threatening, phase is usually the first five to seven years (<LINK REF="REF-Grob-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grob 1981</LINK>). Spontaneous remissions, often temporary, occur in about 10 to 15% of people in the 10 years after onset (<LINK REF="REF-Oosterhuis-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oosterhuis 1981</LINK>). </P>
<P>Advances in treatment over the past 40 years have markedly reduced MG mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Oosterhuis-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oosterhuis 1988</LINK>). Treatment options include symptomatic therapy with cholinesterase inhibitors and immunosuppression with glucocorticosteroids, azathioprine, ciclosporin, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, or cyclophosphamide. Thymectomy may be useful in selected people. Plasma exchange, immunoadsorption, and intravenous immunoglobulin are useful emergency therapies. </P>
<P>The first report of the use of cytotoxic immunosuppressive agents in a large series of MG patients was by Mertens and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Mertens-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mertens 1969</LINK>). They treated 38 participants with 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate or actinomycin D. Some of these drugs were combined or given alternately. From the data presented, it was impossible to determine which participants benefited from which drug. However, an overall improvement was observed in 84% of participants. </P>
<P>There have been many observational studies of immunosupppressants. In one series, azathioprine improved MG in 78% of 26 participants previously unresponsive to adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) or glucocorticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Matell-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matell 1976</LINK>). In a further study, 91% of 78 participants improved with azathioprine with or without corticosteroids or thymectomy or both (<LINK REF="REF-Mertens-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mertens 1981</LINK>). Fifteen of 18 participants (83%) improved with azathioprine treatment alone for more than six months (<LINK REF="REF-Witte-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witte 1984</LINK>). All 41 MG participants followed for more than three years improved when azathioprine was used either as monotherapy or in combination with prednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Kuks-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuks 1991</LINK>). In this study, of the 21 participants who were not on steroids, 19 (90%) either improved or remained stable on azathioprine. Thirteen (65%) of the 20 participants on corticosteroids improved with the addition of azathioprine. In another study, 75% of 32 participants treated with azathioprine alone improved, compared with 70% of the 57 participants treated with azathioprine and corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Mantegazza-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantegazza 1988</LINK>). The use of early 'high-dose' immunosuppression with azathioprine and prednisolone resulted in 50% of participants achieving remission after two years, compared with only a 16% remission rate in those on a 'low-dose' regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Heckmann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heckmann 2001</LINK>). Hohlfeld and colleagues evaluated the course of MG in participants treated with long-term azathioprine until they entered stable clinical remission or had minimal manifestations for longer than six months (<LINK REF="REF-Hohlfeld-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohlfeld 1985</LINK>). After stopping azathioprine, eight of 15 participants (53%) had a clinical relapse within one year. These 15 participants, and another five who were treated identically, were re-evaluated three years later. All these participants originally had marked MG, with Quantitative MG Score for Disease Severity (QMG) scores ranging from 0.9 to 3.0. Four of these 20 participants (20%) relapsed within 27 to 70 months. All of the relapsed participants achieved remission again on combined immunosuppressive treatment including azathioprine, apart from one who died from pulmonary embolism after plasma exchange (<LINK REF="REF-Michels-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michels 1988</LINK>). Therefore this group of participants can be defined as a treatment-responsive, originally severely affected group. </P>
<P>There are three uncontrolled trials of ciclosporin in people with severe MG. In the first trial, participants recruited were unresponsive to anticholinesterase drugs alone or to the combination of thymectomy and corticosteroids or azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Goulon-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulon 1988</LINK>). In this trial, eight out of 10 participants (80%) improved significantly after 12 months of treatment. In the second trial, participants recruited were resistant to thymectomy, corticosteroids or azathioprine or all three (<LINK REF="REF-Bonifati-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonifati 1997</LINK>). In this trial, seven out of nine participants (78%) improved significantly after a mean of two years of treatment. In the third trial, participants recruited were resistant to thymectomy, corticosteroids and azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Lavrnic-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavrnic 2005</LINK>). In this trial, 44 out of 52 participants (85%) improved significantly after an average follow up of 30 months on treatment. </P>
<P>Perez and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Perez-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 1981</LINK>) reported stable remissions in 42 participants on cyclophosphamide for two to 37 months. Thirty three of these participants received concomitant corticosteroid therapy and five underwent thymectomy. </P>
<P>The preliminary results of three open label trials of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in MG have been published. In the first trial (<LINK REF="REF-Cos-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cos 2000</LINK>), 15 out of 22 participants (68%) treated for between two and 18 months improved significantly. Improvement occurred in three out of five participants on monotherapy, four out of seven participants previously unresponsive to azathioprine, and seven out of 10 participants on combination therapy with corticosteroids. In the second trial, 12 participants unresponsive to corticosteroids, azathioprine, ciclosporin or thymectomy or all three were recruited (<LINK REF="REF-Ciafaloni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciafaloni 2001</LINK>). Eight participants (67%) improved significantly after six months of treatment. In the third trial, it is unclear how many of the 32 participants had undergone thymectomy or were unresponsive to either corticosteroids, azathioprine, ciclosporin or methotrexate or all three (<LINK REF="REF-Chaudhry-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaudhry 2001</LINK>). Nineteen participants (59%) improved significantly after an average of 11 months of treatment. A retrospective analysis of the use of MMF in 85 participants, 48 of whom had undergone thymectomy and 66 of whom were on various combinations of corticosteroids, ciclosporin, azathioprine and methotrexate, suggested improvement in 73% of participants (<LINK REF="REF-Meriggioli--2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meriggioli 2003a</LINK>). </P>
<P>Konishi et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Konishi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konishi 2003</LINK>) treated 19 people with generalised MG, all of whom had previously undergone thymectomy and all but one were on corticosteroid therapy, in a 16-week open trial of low dose tacrolimus (FK506). Seven participants (37%) had clinical improvement at the end of the study. Thereafter, 12 participants continued with tacrolimus treatment for up to two years and the other seven participants stopped treatment: in three participants the treatment did not show efficacy and another four participants had procedural difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Konishi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konishi 2005</LINK>). Eight out of the 12 participants who continued treatment (67%) showed clinical improvement. In another open trial of low dose tacrolimus in thymectomised and corticosteroid-dependent participants, 12 of the 17 participants (71%) treated had clinical improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Kawaguchi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawaguchi 2004</LINK>). In an open-label study of tacrolimus in severe MG, where all participants had undergone thymectomy and were on prednisolone and ciclosporin, 69 (87.3%) of the 79 participants in the trial achieved pharmacological remission after a mean follow-up of 2.5 years (<LINK REF="REF-Ponseti-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ponseti 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are many problems in comparing drug treatment trials in MG. It is rarely considered whether participants have had thymectomy and it is often not possible to extract from the data how many participants in a treatment arm have had this procedure. In addition, it is often unknown how many non-operated participants in a study had thymoma at the time of recruitment. In studies before 1980, the numbers of participants with and without AChR antibodies are unknown. Therefore, some of the AChR antibody-negative people may have had antibodies to other antigenic targets, such as MuSK, and some may have had no identifiable antibodies. In most studies after 1980, AChR antibody positivity is an inclusion criterion. Finally, there are no controlled or prospective trials of immunosuppressive treatment in ocular MG or in children or in adolescents.<BR/> </P>

Its interexaminer reliability has been confirmed (<LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1998</LINK>). The QMG consists of 13 independent assessments (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Each item is graded 0 (normal), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) and 3 (severe), with a total score ranging from 0 to 39.</P>
<P>For calculation, grades of each item are added and divided by the number of items tested. On serial testing, slight alterations of QMG (within 0.3 score grades) will be considered as 'no change', a decrease of more than 0.3 as 'improvement' and an increase of more than 0.3 as 'worsening'. Using our transformation, a decrease of more than 0.3 was categorised as improved, while not improved included the subsets 'no change' and 'worsening'. When QMG is used, we subdivided improved to 'mild improvement' (a reduction of 0.3 to 1.0) and 'marked improvement' (a reduction of more than 1.0).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">MGFA Postintervention Status </HEADING>
<P>This scale (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) is designed to assess the clinical state of MG patients at any time after institution of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Jaretzki-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaretzki 2000</LINK>). The MGFA recommended that criteria for change in a patient's status should be defined in each study protocol based on quantitative assessment of strength in pertinent or sentinel muscles, and what constitutes a sustained substantial change in medication should also be defined specifically in the protocol.</P>
<P>Using our transformation, the category improved comprises 'I' in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, while not improved encompasses categories 'U', 'W', 'E' and 'D of MG' in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.<BR/>
<BR/>Apart from the stipulated primary and secondary outcome measures we compared the data of those studies where identical, or similar primary or secondary outcome measures, were used.</P>
<P>We calculated a weighted treatment effect across trials using the Cochrane statistical package, Review Manager (RevMan). The results would have been expressed as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and risk differences (RDs) with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes, and weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. If the trials of the same immunosuppressive agent did not use the QMG or MGFA Postintervention Status scales, or if different scales were used in each study, a description of the trial results was given. We tested for heterogeneity between the effects found by different studies and where these were not due to unusual subgroups of studies we intended to use a random-effect model. Otherwise, a fixed-effect model was used.</P>
<P>We defined and analysed the following subgroups: patients with or without thymectomy, with or without corticosteroid co-medication, and with different types of disease severity as defined by the MGFA Clinical Classification (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) (<LINK REF="REF-Jaretzki-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaretzki 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>When the QMG was used, as a supplementary test we subdivided the four groups (improved, not improved, immunosuppressive agent-treated and placebo-treated patients) into eight groups differentiating mild from marked improvement and no change from worsening.</P>
<P>We searched non-randomised literature for relevant complications and adverse events that can be related to immunosuppressive treatment in MG (<LINK REF="REF-Dukes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dukes 2000</LINK>). Since only a few studies address adverse events, we did not specify an exact time frame in which an adverse event had to be recorded to be taken into consideration. However, appropriate adjustments were made if the time at risk varied between studies.</P>
<P>We have discussed the cost and cost-effectiveness of immunosuppressive agents in MG where the relevant information is available.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Azathioprine plus initial prednisolone versus prednisolone</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>
</P>
<P>
<I>Study design:</I> Randomised, unblinded, controlled trial with a mean follow-up of 30 months.</P>
<P>
<I>Sample size:</I> Forty one participants, 21 randomised to receive prednisolone for the first month plus azathioprine and 20 received prednisolone.</P>
<P>
<I>Setting:</I> All participants had severe generalised MG. The severity of MG was defined by the persistence of swallowing impairment, respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation, functional deficit responsible for discontinuation of occupational activity or important reduction of daily activity for at least one month, and decremental amplitude of at least 20% or seropositivity of AChR antibodies. Participants with pure ocular MG, those with contraindications to corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive treatments, preceding treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents in the last three months, participants under 15 or above 75 years, and pregnant participants were excluded. Twelve participants (60%) in the prednisolone group and 11 (52%) in the azathioprine group had had thymectomy before the study.</P>
<P>
<I>Interventions: </I>Prednisolone (1 mg/kg daily for one month, which was subsequently reduced to 0.5 mg/kg daily by the fifth month, and to 0.25 mg/kg daily by the tenth month) versus azathioprine (3 mg/kg daily for one year and then 2 mg/kg daily). Because of the delayed response to azathioprine in the latter group, these participants were also given prednisolone 1 mg/kg daily for one month, which was then gradually tapered and discontinued at the end of the fourth month.</P>
<P>
<I>Muscle strength assessment scales:</I> A myasthenia muscle strength score and a five-grade functional scale (modified Rankin scale) were used.</P>
<P>
<I>Statistical analyses:</I> An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Failure time estimates (time to clinical deterioration and time to treatment failure) were based on the Kaplan-Meier method, then compared between the randomised groups by the log rank test. The semiparametric Cox's model was used to adjust treatment comparisons of both imbalanced and prognostic baseline variables. Comparison of side effects in the two treatment groups was based on Fischer's test of exact probability. The comparison of functional grades and myasthenia muscle scores at each year were based on the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test.</P>
<P>
<I>Endpoints: </I>Primary endpoints were time to the first episode of clinical deterioration within the first 60 months, defined by the occurrence of either impaired swallowing or respiratory insufficiency, or a drop in the myasthenia muscle score of at least 20 points. Among the 21 deterioration events, nine were observed in the azathioprine group and 12 in the prednisolone group, giving a relative risk of 0.71 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.31). The secondary endpoint was treatment failure within 60 months, defined as an increase of less than two grades in the functional scale after treatment for a year, or the occurrence of two episodes of clinical deterioration. Other endpoints were the functional grade and myasthenia muscle score at the end of each treatment year and the overall rate of side effects.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Palace-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Palace 1998</LINK>
</P>
<P>
<I>Study design:</I> Randomised double-blind controlled trial with participants followed up for three years.</P>
<P>
<I>Sample size:</I> Thirty four participants, 15 randomised to the azathioprine plus prednisolone group and 19 to the prednisolone plus placebo group.</P>
<P>
<I>Setting:</I> People with generalised MG were included if they had raised serum AChR antibodies, disabilities interfering with normal activities despite optimal anticholinesterase treatment, and where appropriate, thymectomy undertaken at least one year before randomisation. Exclusion criteria were previous immunosuppressant therapy, pure ocular MG, past or present malignancy, other severe general medical disease, raised liver enzymes, pregnancy, and age below 16 years. Five participants (26%) in the prednisolone plus placebo group and six (40%) in the azathioprine plus prednisolone group had previous thymectomy.</P>
<P>
<I>Interventions: </I>All participants received initial high-dose prednisolone (1.5 mg/kg or 100 mg on alternate days, whichever was lower). In addition, participants were randomised to receive either azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg daily) or the equivalent dose of a matching placebo. The initial prednisolone dose was maintained until remission developed and then tapered to the minimum required to maintain remission.</P>
<P>
<I>Muscle strength assessment scales:</I> Right-sided strength of neck flexion, elbow extension, first finger abduction, shoulder abduction, hip flexion and hip abduction; walking time, swallowing time, forced vital capacity; and subjective scoring of strength, double vision and swallowing were used.</P>
<P>
<I>Statistical analyses: </I>The prednisolone dose was assessed at 12 and 36 months using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (equivalent to the Mann-Whitney test). Treatment failure (defined as either no remission achieved in the three year follow-up period or each clinical relapse after initiating remission which necessitated an increase in prednisolone dose) was assessed as total numbers using Fischer's exact test and duration of initial remission by the log-rank test. The objective strength measurements and mean subjective scores were analysed with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Side effects were not statistically manipulated. Data from the participants who died or were withdrawn were censured at the time of withdrawal and not included in the final analysis. Intention to treat analysis was not carried out because the authors thought that in most participants these events occurred within six months of entry before the full benefit of the treatment could be expected.</P>
<P>
<I>Endpoints: </I>Primary endpoints were the maintenance dose of prednisolone, number of participants experiencing treatment failure (defined as either no remission achieved in the three year follow-up period or clinical relapse after initial remission necessitating an increase in prednisolone dose), and the duration of the initial remission. The median prednisolone dose did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups at 12 months (exact figures not given), but was significantly reduced at 36 months in the azathioprine plus prednisolone group (0 mg) compared with the prednisolone plus placebo group (40 mg) (P = 0.02). No data were available to calculate the relative risk. No significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of number of participants experiencing treatment failure was reported (exact figures not given). Analysis of those who completed the trial showed that the duration of remission was significantly longer in the azathioprine plus prednisolone group compared with the prednisolone plus placebo group, giving a relative risk of 0.28 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.94). If those who withdrew or died were included as treatment failures, however, the duration of remission was not significantly different between the azathioprine plus prednisolone versus prednisolone plus placebo groups, with a relative risk of 0.67 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.04). A secondary endpoint was mean improvement in strength. The incidence of adverse events was also recorded.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Ciclosporin monotherapy versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1987</LINK>
</P>
<P>
<I>Study design:</I> Randomised double-blind controlled trial with participants followed up for 12 months.</P>
<P>
<I>Sample size: </I>Twenty participants, 10 randomised to each group.</P>
<P>
<I>Setting:</I> People between the ages of 40 and 75 years who had onset of MG within a year and who had not previously had thymectomy or immunosuppressive therapy were eligible if they had moderate to severe generalized disease uncontrolled with anticholinesterase therapy. People with a mediastinal mass, uncontrolled hypertension, or severe hepatic or renal disease were excluded.</P>
<P>
<I>Interventions: </I>Ciclosporin was initially given at a dose of 6 mg/kg daily, and the dose was adjusted by an unblinded investigator based on assessments of blood drug levels and renal function. The dose was also adjusted by a blinded investigator based on adverse events and clinical responses: the dose was increased if there was no response and decreased if improvement was evident.</P>
<P>
<I>Muscle strength assessment scales:</I> The QMG was used.</P>
<P>
<I>Statistical analyses: </I>The principal nonparametric method used was the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Endpoint values were analysed at the planned timepoint or earlier if the planned timepoint was not reached. To determine the extent of correlation between the measures of efficacy, correlation coefficients were calculated by the Spearman rank sum method.</P>
<P>
<I>Endpoints:</I> Primary endpoints were assessed at six months or at an earlier endpoint in cases of treatment failure (defined as progression to insufficiency in either respiration (forced vital capacity &lt; 1200 ml) or swallowing (frequent choking)), drug failure (defined as doubling of the serum creatinine value at entry) or protocol violation (defined as stopping of study medicine for more than five days). The primary endpoints were: changes in QMG, changes in AChR antibody titre, and the number of treatment failures. Similarly, at 12 months of treatment, values for all participants were analysed whether their endpoints were reached at 12 months or earlier. Changes in QMG and AChR antibody titre are reported in the Results section. Six participants in the ciclosporin group and five participants in the placebo group experienced treatment failure, giving a relative risk of 1.20 (95% CI 0.54 to 2.67). Adverse events were also recorded.</P>

</P>
<P>
<I>Study design:</I> Randomised double-blind controlled trial with participants followed up for six months.</P>
<P>
<I>Sample size: </I>Thirty nine participants, 20 randomised to the ciclosporin plus prednisolone group and 19 to the prednisolone plus placebo group.</P>
<P>
<I>Setting:</I> People over the age of 18 years, with or without previous thymectomy, who had prominent generalised MG despite being on moderate or high-dose corticosteroid therapy were eligible. People with poorly controlled hypertension and severe hepatic or renal disease were excluded. The percentage of thymectomies in each group was reported to be similar, although exact figures were not provided.</P>
<P>
<I>Interventions: </I>Ciclosporin was started at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily. The dose was adjusted by an unblinded investigator on the basis of blood drug levels and renal function. Dose was also adjusted monthly by a blinded investigator on the basis of any adverse reactions. Corticosteroid withdrawal was initiated at two months, with a reduction of 10 mg if the dose was 60 mg every other day or less, and 20 mg if the dose was 80 to 100 mg. From the third to the sixth months, the dose was reduced by 10 mg/month. If weakness increased following reduction in corticosteroid dose, the dose was increased. Participants were withdrawn from the study if treatment failure occurred. Treatment failure was defined as progression to insufficiency of respiration or swallowing that was unresponsive to an increase in corticosteroid dose to the patient's entry level dose. Drug failure and protocol violation were as defined in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1987</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<I>Muscle strength assessment scales:</I> The QMG was used.</P>
<P>
<I>Statistical analyses: </I>Change in the QMG was analysed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Changes in the AChR antibody titres and corticosteroid dose were analysed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). To determine the extent of correlation between measures of efficacy, correlation coefficients were calculated by the Pearson Product-Moment method.</P>
<P>
<I>Endpoints:</I> Primary endpoints, measured when participants reached 6 months of treatment or an earlier endpoint, were entry to exit change in QMG, AChR antibody titre and dose of corticosteroids. These are discussed in the Results section. A secondary endpoint was the number of treatment or drug failures. Adverse events were also recorded.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-De-Feo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Feo 2002</LINK>
</P>
<P>
<I>Study design: </I>Randomised, double-blind controlled trial with participants followed up for 12 months.</P>
<P>
<I>Sample size: </I>Twenty three participants, 12 randomised to the cyclophosphamide plus prednisolone group and 11 to the prednisolone plus placebo group.</P>
<P>
<I>Setting:</I> Participants were between the ages of 21 and 65 years and had severe generalised MG. They were eligible to enter the study if systemic corticosteroids had not adequately controlled the disease or if corticosteroid-related side effects were present. Poor disease control was defined by one or more of the following: (1) moderate or severe respiratory involvement (forced vital capacity &lt; 60% predicted); (2) moderate (nasal voice) or severe (permanent nasogastric tube) swallowing impairment; and (3) moderate (inability to hold abducted arms at 90 degrees for between 10 and 90 s while standing) or severe (arms at 90 degrees for less than 10 s) peripheral muscle involvement. Corticosteroid-related side effects considered as inclusion criteria were arterial hypertension, iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, glaucoma, osteoporosis, diabetes, pseudotumour cerebri and psychiatric disorders. Thymectomized participants were enrolled six months after surgery. Both groups had eight participants with previous thymectomy.</P>
<P>
<I>Interventions:</I> Intravenous cyclophosphamide pulses were given at an initial dose of 500 mg/m2 of body surface and titrated according to changes of peripheral muscle strength or side effects. Each cyclophosphamide pulse was prepared and masked by an unblinded investigator based on data recorded by a blinded investigator. During the 12-month study period, treatment pulses were given monthly during the first six months and then every other month.</P>
<P>
<I>Muscle strength assessment scales: </I>The QMG was used.</P>
<P>
<I>Statistical analyses: </I>All participants had at least eight weeks follow-up. Endpoint values were analysed at the planned timepoint or earlier if the planned timepoint was not reached. ANOVA was used to evaluate variations of oral corticosteroid and pyridostigmine doses during the study. The Student's t-test was used to evaluate dose variations of corticosteroids and pyridostigmine between groups. Wilcoxon's rank sum test was used to evaluate muscle strength variations. Chi-squared or Fischer's exact test was used to evaluate incidence of infections, side effects, treatment failures and haematological complications.</P>
<P>
<I>Endpoints: </I>Primary endpoints were changes in the QMG, corticosteroid and pyridostigmine requirements, and the number of treatment failures, the latter defined as ventilatory failure (forced vital capacity &lt; 30% predicted) or the development of swallowing impairment requiring a feeding tube. Changes in the QMG, corticosteroid and pyridostigmine requirements are discussed in the Results section. No significant difference in treatment failures between the two groups was reported (exact figures were not given). Secondary endpoints were the development of treatment-related adverse events.</P>

<I>Study design:</I> Randomised double-blind controlled pilot study with participants followed up for five months.</P>
<P>
<I>Sample size: </I>Fourteen participants, seven in the MMF plus either ciclosporin or prednisolone or no immunosuppressants group, seven in the placebo plus either ciclosporin or prednisolone or no immunosuppressants group.</P>
<P>
<I>Setting: </I>Participants had suboptimally controlled, stable MG. Suboptimal disease control was defined as persistent daily symptoms of fatigable weakness involving ocular, bulbar or extremity muscles. People with MG between ages of 18 and 80, with or without previous thymectomy were eligible. If patients had undergone thymectomy, the procedure must have been performed at least 12 months before entry into the study. Three participants (43%) in the MMF group and five (71%) in the placebo group had undergone thymectomy. Participants could be on concomitant prednisolone (stable dose for four weeks prior to entry) or ciclosporin (stable dose for three months prior to entry), but not azathioprine. Plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin was prohibited during the study and for one month before entry into the study. People with purely ocular disease (MGFA class I), severe respiratory or bulbar weakness (MGFA classes IVb and V), history of thymoma, severe concurrent medical or psychiatric illness, and women who were pregnant or not practicing reliable birth control methods were excluded. Disease stability was assessed during a one-month pre-treatment period, where patients whose QMG scores varied by more than two points between assessments at the beginning and the end of this month were disqualified. A QMG score greater than or equal to five was also required to be eligible for entry into the study to eliminate people with mild disease.</P>
<P>
<I>Interventions: </I>MMF (1 g twice daily) in one group versus placebo in the other group. Five participants in each group were also on prednisolone. One participant in each group was also on ciclosporin. Two participants in each group were on MMF monotherapy.</P>
<P>
<I>Muscle strength assessment scales:</I> The QMG and manual muscle testing was used.</P>
<P>
<I>Statistical analyses:</I> Wilcoxon rank sum tests comparing the MMF with the placebo group were conducted for quantitative measures. Qualitative characteristics were compared using Fisher's exact test.</P>
<P>
<I>Endpoints:</I> The primary endpoint was the change in QMG score compared with baseline (see Results section). Secondary endpoints were changes in manual muscle testing score, AChR antibody titre and the magnitude of the single-fibre EMG abnormalities compared with baseline. The incidence of adverse events was also recorded (<LINK REF="STD-Meriggioli-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Meriggioli 2003b</LINK>). A further analysis of the trial compared pre- and post-treatment single-fibre EMG jitter measurements in the 11 participants who completed the trial, with the measurements carried out at baseline and after five months (<LINK REF="REF-Meriggioli-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meriggioli 2003c</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Nagane-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nagane 2005</LINK>
</P>
<P>
<I>Study design:</I> Randomised, unblinded, non placebo-controlled pilot study with participants followed up for one year.</P>
<P>
<I>Sample size:</I> Thirty four participants, 18 in the tacrolimus plus corticosteroids with/without plasma exchange group, 16 in the no tacrolimus plus corticosteroids with/without plasma exchange.</P>
<P>
<I>Setting:</I> Participants were untreated de novo MG patients between the ages of 21 and 82 years. Exclusion criteria were previous immunosuppressant therapy, elevated levels of serum liver enzymes, renal insufficiency, pregnancy and age younger than 20 years. Seven participants (39%) in the tacrolimus group and six participants (38%) in the no tacrolimus group had thymectomy.</P>
<P>
<I>Interventions: </I>Tacrolimus was administered orally at a dose of 3 mg/day, which is approximately a fifth of the dose given initially to organ transplant patients. For early-phase therapy, participants received tacrolimus or prednisolone or both. In participants who had thymectomy, no pharmacological intervention was performed before the operation, and administration of tacrolimus or prednisolone or both was started within two days of thymectomy. Normal quality of life corresponding to the category 'Minimal Manifestations' (MM) of the MGFA Postintervention Status scale was achieved by administering, as required, early-phase treatment which consisted of oral prednisolone (not exceeding a daily dose of 20 mg), and combined therapy with plasma exchange and high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/day for the first three days). The prednisolone dose was tapered and adjusted to the minimal dose needed to maintain MM. Anticholinesterase medication was prohibited in the early-phase therapy. The endpoint of the early-phase therapy was defined as the time at which MM was reached with the prednisolone dose not exceeding 10 mg/day. For the follow-up phase, participants were treated to maintain MM for one year. In the follow-up phase, plasma exchange plus high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone alone or pyridostigmine was administered as needed to maintain MM.</P>
<P>
<I>Muscle strength assessment scales: </I>The MGFA Postintervention Status scale and the QMG were used.</P>
<P>
<I>Statistical analyses:</I> Differences in the evaluation items of the efficacy of tacrolimus between the two groups were estimated with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Changes in clinical and laboratory parameters in each patient group were estimated with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</P>
<P>
<I>Endpoints: </I>Endpoints of early-phase therapy were frequency of plasma exchange plus high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, and the duration of early-phase treatment. The number of treatments with plasma exchange plus high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was significantly lower in participants treated with tacrolimus compared with those treated without tacrolimus during early-phase treatment, with a mean difference of -1.80 (95% CI -3.12 to -0.48). The period of early-phase treatment was significantly shorter in the group treated with tacrolimus, with a mean difference of -2.10 weeks (95% CI -3.63 to -0.57). Endpoints of follow-up phase therapy were frequency of plasma exchange plus high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone or high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone alone during this phase, and the dose of oral predisolone required at the endpoint. In this follow-up phase, the number of treatments with plasma exchange plus high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was significantly lower for the participants treated with tacrolimus compared with those without tacrolimus, with a mean difference of -0.90 (95% CI -1.72 to -0.08). In addition, the number of treatments with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone alone were significantly lower for the participants treated with tacrolimus compared with those without tacrolimus, with a mean difference of -1.40 (95% CI -2.79 to -0.01). At one year into treatment, the oral prednisolone dose was significantly lower for participants treated with tacrolimus compared with those without tacrolimus, with a mean difference of -3.50 mg (95% CI -5.78 to -1.22). Adverse events were recorded.</P>

<P>All the trials of azathioprine in MG recruited fewer participants than planned owing to the exclusion criterion of previous use of immunotherapy and general difficulties encountered when recruiting for treatment trials in a rare disorder such as MG. For a power of 90% and a significance level of 5%, <LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK> planned a sample size of 105, but recruited only 41 participants. <LINK REF="STD-Palace-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Palace 1998</LINK> planned to recruit 100 participants over three years, but managed only 34. <LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1987</LINK> aimed to recruit 40 participants, but stopped enrolment at six months when 20 participants had been recruited, because analyses had demonstrated efficacy at this endpoint.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Completeness of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>, all 41 participants completed the trial and were followed up for a mean of 30 months. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Palace-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Palace 1998</LINK>, where participants were followed up for three years, six participants were withdrawn from the prednisolone plus placebo group, and four from the azathioprine plus prednisolone group. There were also three deaths in each group. The reasons for withdrawal or death for each of the cases were appropriately documented. After allowance for deaths and withdrawals, eight participants in the azathioprine plus prednisolone group and 10 participants in the prednisolone plus placebo group completed the trial.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1987</LINK> which ran for one year, all 20 participants were followed up. Since analyses at six months demonstrated efficacy, no additional participants were entered into the study after this timepoint and the investigation was continued as a single-blind study. Four of the 10 in the ciclosporin group and five of the 10 in the placebo group completed the trial protocol. Reasons for failing to complete the trial caused by treatment or drug failure or protocol violation were clearly documented. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1993</LINK>, which ran for six months, two of the 20 participants in the ciclosporin plus prednisolone group, and three of the 19 in the prednisolone plus placebo group did not complete the trial protocol. The reasons for this were clearly documented and all participants were followed up.</P>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-De-Feo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Feo 2002</LINK>, 10 of the 12 participants in the cyclophosphamide group, and five of the 11 participants in the placebo group completed 12 months of the trial. The substantially higher number of dropouts in the placebo group prompted early termination of the trial and an interim analysis at one year, although the trial was expected to last for three years. All reasons for dropouts were documented and all participants were followed up.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Meriggioli-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Meriggioli 2003b</LINK> was a pilot study lasting only five months. One of the seven participants in the MMF group and two of the seven in the placebo group did not complete the trial protocol, with reasons appropriately recorded.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Nagane-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nagane 2005</LINK>, two participants in the no tacrolimus group were excluded because they failed to achieve the MM status of the MGFA Postintervention Status scale without exceeding 20 mg prednisolone in the early-phase therapy, which was an inclusion criterion. Eighteen participants in the tacrolimus group and 16 in the no tacrolimus group completed the one year trial with no withdrawals.</P>

<P>We performed a meta-analysis of ciclosporin versus placebo with data from two trials with a total of 59 participants - the ciclosporin monotherapy versus placebo trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1987</LINK>; 20 participants) and ciclosporin plus prednisolone versus prednisolone plus placebo trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1993</LINK>; 39 participants).</P>
<P>For the primary outcome measure of improvement or lack of improvement at six months, 15 of the 30 participants on ciclosporin improved: 14 had mild and one had marked improvement. Six of the 29 participants on placebo had mild improvement. All 15 of the 30 participants on ciclosporin who did not improve were in the 'no change' subset. Of the 23 of the 29 participants in the placebo group who did not improve, 16 were in the 'no change' subset and seven were in the 'worsening' subset. The relative rate of improvement was 2.44 (95% CI 1.13 to 5.27), with no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.33) (see Analysis 01.01). The mean difference in QMG score between the ciclosporin and placebo groups was -0.34 (95% CI -0.52 to -0.17), with no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.48) (see Analysis 02.02).</P>
<P>No data were available for meta-analysis of any secondary outcome measure.</P>
<P>In summary, meta-analysis was possible only for ciclosporin versus placebo and demonstrated that ciclosporin improved MG at six months. The primary and secondary outcome measures in the other included studies were often heterogeneous. Tranformation of outcome criteria into the outcome criteria proposed in our protocol was not possible in most studies, either because of unavailability of the raw data or the use of different outcome scales. It was not possible to analyse subgroups of participants with or without thymectomy as this distinction was not clearly made in the trials. Nor was it possible to analyse subgroups of participants with the same disease severity with or without corticosteroid co-medication as none of the studies addressed this subject. None of the included studies that had relevant primary and secondary endpoint data used the MGFA Clinical Classification to define clinical severity at study entry. Therefore statistical evaluation based on different types of disease severity was not possible. Recording of adverse events varied widely between the studies, making comparison difficult.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Each of the seven randomised controlled studies fulfilling the criteria for inclusion in this review had problems that made it difficult to draw useful clinical conclusions.</P>
<P>All of the studies had relatively few participants, a common problem when recruiting for treatment trials in a rare disorder such as MG. Both azathioprine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palace-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Palace 1998</LINK>) were halted prematurely because of slow recruitment owing to the exclusion criterion of previous immunotherapy. One had 41 participants, well short of its target of 105 (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>), while the other had 34 participants instead of the planned 100 (<LINK REF="STD-Palace-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Palace 1998</LINK>). The trial of ciclosporin versus placebo, which originally aimed for 40 participants, stopped enrolment at six months when interim analysis of data from 20 participants demonstrated efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1987</LINK>). In the other trials, the participant number was not planned and ranged from 14 to 39 (<LINK REF="STD-De-Feo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Feo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meriggioli-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Meriggioli 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagane-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nagane 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is difficult to design immunosuppressant drug trials in MG. Given the known efficacy of corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider_x002d_Gold-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider-Gold 2005</LINK>) and the widespread use of cholinesterase inhibitors in MG, it would be unethical to deny effective treatments to participants. Thus, MG trials have to both assess the efficacy of the intervention and account for any confounding effects of necessary concomitant medication. Participants in all of the trials, except ciclosporin versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1987</LINK>), had other immunotherapies that may have affected the outcome measures. This makes it difficult to judge the absolute efficacy of each immunosuppressant as a monotherapy. </P>
<P>Nor are there good data on the relative efficacy of each immunosuppressant. The combination of differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria, muscle score assessment scales and outcome measures between the studies prevented efficacy comparisons and there are no head-to-head comparison RCTs of immunosuppressant drugs in MG.</P>
<P>Thymectomy is likely to influence the course and severity of MG. However, subgroup analyses between thymectomised and non-thymectomised participants could not be carried out as these data were not extractable from any of the studies. </P>
<P>None of the trials addressed the important outcome measures of quality of life and cost effectiveness.</P>
<P>In this review, the primary outcome measure was improvement in MG or lack of it at six months and the secondary outcome measures were improvement in MG or lack of it at 12 months, the need for other treatment at six months, the number of episodes of worsening during the first year, serum AChR antibody titres after at least six months of therapy, and the occurrence of one or more adverse events at any time after the introduction of treatment. </P>
<P>The two ciclosporin trials were the only studies with data for primary endpoint analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1993</LINK>). In both, the QMG results at six months suggested that ciclosporin improves MG significantly compared with placebo. This conclusion was supported by meta-analysis. However, it is not clear how valid this meta-analysis is. The ciclosporin trials had different designs, ciclosporin versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1987</LINK>) and ciclosporin plus prednisolone versus prednisolone plus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1993</LINK>). It is possible that corticosteroids affected the outcomes of the second trial, thus confounding the meta-analysis and diluting judgement of the absolute efficacy of ciclosporin as a monotherapy . Any conclusions must also be tempered by the fact that both trials had relatively few participants. In addition, evidence of benefit for ciclosporin from secondary endpoint data was inconsistent between the trials or available for only one of the trials. At the 12 month secondary endpoint, QMG improved significantly in the ciclosporin plus prednisolone compared with the placebo plus prednisolone group (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1987</LINK>). The findings on AChR antibody titres at six months were mixed. Ciclosporin plus prednisolone decreased titres compared with prednisolone plus placebo in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1993</LINK>). However, there was no difference in titres between the ciclosporin and placebo groups in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1987</LINK>). There was no significant difference in corticosteroid dose at six months between the ciclosporin and placebo groups (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1993</LINK>). If immunosuppressants are effective in MG, they might be expected to have a corticosteroid sparing action. There were no data on the number of episodes of worsening during the first year of treatment. </P>
<P>Cyclophosphamide is the only other immunosuppressant that has evidence, albeit limited and from one small trial, of clinical benefit in MG (<LINK REF="STD-De-Feo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Feo 2002</LINK>). QMG scores were significantly better with cyclophosphamide plus prednisolone compared with prednisolone plus placebo at the secondary endpoint of 12 months, but not at the primary endpoint of six months. At six months, the prednisolone dose was lower with cyclosphosphamide than placebo, suggesting that cyclophosphamide also has a corticosteroid-sparing effect. There were no data for the other secondary endpoints. </P>
<P>There was no evidence from either of the azathioprine studies that this drug improved MG clinically at six or 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palace-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Palace 1998</LINK>). Neither study had primary endpoint data, although both predated the guidelines recommending the use of the QMG or MGFA Postintervention Status scales (<LINK REF="REF-Jaretzki-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaretzki 2000</LINK>). Moreover, there was no improvement in MG as judged by the MG measurement scales used by these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palace-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Palace 1998</LINK>). Neither trial had data on the need for other treatment at six months. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Palace-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Palace 1998</LINK>), however, there were significant reductions in the prednisolone dose in years two and three in the azathioprine plus prednisolone compared with the placebo plus prednisolone group suggesting that azathioprine has a corticosteroid-sparing effect after at least a year of treatment. This study looked at serial AChR antibody titres in 21 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Palace-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Palace 1998</LINK>). There was a similar decline in median antibody titres in both study groups for 18 months followed by a temporary rise in titres in the prednisolone plus placebo but not the azathioprine plus prednisolone group. However, interpretation of these antibody data is difficult. It is unclear how many patients came from each arm of the trial, there was no statistical analysis and no raw data were available for further study. There were no antibody data from the other azathioprine trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>). Neither trial had data on the number of episodes of worsening during the first year.</P>
<P>The tacrolimus trial did not have data for any of the endpoints used here (<LINK REF="STD-Nagane-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nagane 2005</LINK>). Although there were no data at six months, this trial did use its own endpoints to look at tacrolimus effects on other treatment. The dose of prednisolone required to maintain minimal manifestations was significantly lower at one year in those taking tacrolimus compared with those who did not. In addition, the number of treatments with plasma exchange and high dose methylprednisolone, or high dose intravenous methylprednisolone alone, were all significantly lower in the tacrolimus treated group at one year. These results suggest that tacrolimus reduces the need for other immunotherapy in MG.</P>
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence to evaluate MMF. The only published trial ran for five months and had just 14 participants. However, there are ongoing trials of this drug (<LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanders-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sanders 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>There are no good data for methotrexate in MG, although it has been studied in other autoimmune disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Skeie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skeie 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The reporting of adverse events was variable. Four trials gave detailed descriptions of adverse events. Two were of azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-Gajdos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gajdos 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palace-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Palace 1998</LINK>), one of MMF (<LINK REF="STD-Meriggioli-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Meriggioli 2003b</LINK>). and one of ciclosporin (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1987</LINK>). The other trial of ciclosporin reported only the serious adverse events that led to withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Tindall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tindall 1993</LINK>). The tacrolimus trial mentioned adverse events only briefly (<LINK REF="STD-Nagane-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nagane 2005</LINK>). The cyclophosphamide trial did not report the numbers of patients with adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-De-Feo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Feo 2002</LINK>). The adverse events reported in the RCTs are discussed in the Results section of this review. Clearly, the data are not comprehensive - the trials were small and often short-lasting - and do not allow grading of the relative toxicity of the drugs. </P>
<P>Further information on drug adverse events is available from non-randomised MG trials. In the following section, we summarise the common adverse events and the risks of drug induced-malignancy in the largest available long term follow-up studies of azathioprine, ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide, MMF and tacrolimus. We also looked at the potential risks of drug-induced malignancy reported in selected recent trials in other conditions when this information was unavailable in the MG trials. However, a full discussion is beyond the scope of this review and we recommend that other sources of information, including manufacturers' drug data sheets and large, long-term studies of these drugs in other disorders, are consulted.</P>
<P>In two of the largest azathioprine long term studies, with follow-up ranging from one month to 12 years (<LINK REF="REF-Hohlfeld-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohlfeld 1988</LINK>) and one to 13 years (<LINK REF="REF-Kuks-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuks 1991</LINK>), adverse events occurred in about a third of the total of 145 participants. The most common were leucopenia, macrocytosis, and transient elevation of liver enzymes. Usually, these problems resolved on stopping the drug or reducing the dose. The only serious adverse event was an increased risk of malignancy. Eight patients developed tumours (bronchial carcinoma, lymphoma, ovarian carcinoma, prostate carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma). However, the absolute risk of developing solid tumours with azathioprine treatment in MG is unknown because it is difficult to separate the effects of the drug from age-related increases in the background incidence of cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Kissel-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kissel 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>In two long-term studies of ciclosporin in MG involving a total of 109 participants, with follow-up of six months to 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Ciafaloni-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciafaloni 2000</LINK>) and 22 to 54 months (<LINK REF="REF-Lavrnic-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavrnic 2005</LINK>), the most common serious adverse events were nephrotoxicity, hypertension and malignancy. Elevated serum creatinine occurred in about a fifth of participants. New onset or worsening of hypertension occurred in about a tenth of participants. Six participants developed malignancy - skin cancers, lymphoma or uterine carcinoma. Hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia, myalgia and 'flu-like' symptoms were also commonly seen. </P>
<P>In a study of 42 participants on cyclophosphamide followed up for two to 78 months (<LINK REF="REF-Perez-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 1981</LINK>), the common adverse events were alopecia, leucopenia, nausea and vomiting, skin and nail discolouration, anorexia, haemorrhagic cystitis, and dizziness. No malignancy was reported in this study. However, there is a dose-response relationship between cyclophosphamide and the risk of bladder cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>A retrospective analysis found that about one-third of 85 participants treated with MMF developed adverse events including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and an increased frequency of certain infections (<LINK REF="REF-Meriggioli--2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meriggioli 2003a</LINK>). It is unclear for how long these participants were treated. No malignancies were reported in this study. In addition, there is no evidence that the incidence of malignancy is increased in transplant patients on chronic treatment with this drug (<LINK REF="REF-Haberal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haberal 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Use of tacrolimus for 22 to 26 months was evaluated in 12 MG participants (<LINK REF="REF-Konishi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konishi 2005</LINK>). No serious adverse events occurred. One patient had to discontinue the drug temporarily because of headache and eye pain, while four participants had raised neutrophil and decreased lymphocyte counts that did not require drug withdrawal. In another study of 17 MG participants followed up for four to 58 months, the only adverse event found was increased haemoglobulin A1c in one of three participants with diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-Kawaguchi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawaguchi 2004</LINK>). The incidence of malignancy is increased in renal transplant patients on tacrolimus (<LINK REF="REF-Imao-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imao 2007</LINK>). </P>
<P>The risks of infertility and teratogenicity from immunosuppressant drugs have not been studied in MG. However, these factors should be taken into account when choosing which drug to use in men, as well as women, of reproductive age. </P>
<P>In summary, there are no large RCTs with the statistical power needed to make definitive conclusions on the effects of azathioprine, tacrolimus, MMF, or methotrexate in MG. The MG management guidelines drawn up by panels of MG specialists that recommend azathioprine as the first line immunosuppressive drug in combination with prednisolone do so mainly because of its likely steroid-sparing effect after one year (<LINK REF="STD-Palace-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Palace 1998</LINK>). In addition, the duration of MG remission in this trial was significantly longer in the azathioprine plus prednisolone group compared with the prednisolone plus placebo group - when those who withdrew or died were not considered as treatment failures. Otherwise, the choice of immunosuppressive drug in MG is based more on physician experience than RCT evidence. In this context, tacrolimus, MMF or methotrexate are usually recommended as second line therapies in those intolerant or unresponsive to azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Hohlfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohlfeld 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skeie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skeie 2006</LINK>). Concerns about the risks of severe toxicity with cyclophosphamide and with long-term use of ciclosporin combined with limited experience of these drugs in neurological disorders usually limit their recommendation to those in whom combination therapy with steroids plus azathioprine, tacrolimus, MMF, or methotrexate has failed (<LINK REF="REF-Hohlfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohlfeld 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skeie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skeie 2006</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<UL>
<LI>Good RCT data on the use of immunosuppressant drugs either as monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids are absent. Where RCT data are available, they relate to generalised MG only. </LI>
<LI>The relative efficacy of immunosuppressant drugs - either as monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids - is unknown. </LI>
<LI>Limited evidence from two small RCTs of ciclosporin (as monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids) and one of cyclophosphamide (in combination with corticosteroids) suggests that both can improve MG.</LI>
<LI>Limited evidence from RCTs shows no clear benefit at six or 12 months of the drugs more commonly used in MG - azathioprine (as monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids), MMF (as monotherapy or in combination with either prednisolone or ciclosporin) or tacrolimus (in combination with corticosteroids or plasma exchange or both).</LI>
<LI>There is no randomised controlled trial of methotrexate in MG.</LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<UL>
<LI>Large, randomised double blind placebo-controlled trials with adequate power to investigate the efficacy of immunosuppressant drugs are needed. Recruitment problems are common in trials in rare disorders such as MG and are best overcome by international, multicentre collaborations.</LI>
<LI>Long-term studies of one year and longer are needed. MG is a chronic condition where maintenance of disease control and prevention of relapse are as important as initial response to treatment. </LI>
<LI>Head-to-head studies of immunosuppressant drugs with adequate power to establish the relative efficacy of each drug are needed. </LI>
<LI>Further international consensus on trial design should be sought to determine the optimum inclusion and exclusion criteria (taking into account the recent advances in the immunopathogenesis of MG), MG evaluation scales and outcome measures.</LI>
<LI>Ethically, trials of immunosuppressants in MG should be combination trials with steroids in both the treatment and placebo arms. Thus, trial design must allow assessment of efficacy of the intervention as well as account for any confounding effects of necessary continuing treatment with steroids. </LI>

<P>23 participants, 12 in the cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids group and 11 in the corticosteroids plus placebo group.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Intravenous cyclophosphamide pulses were given at an initial dose of 500 mg/m2 of body surface and titrated according to response or side effects. During the 12-month study period, treatment pulses were given monthly during the first 6 months and then every other month.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary endpoints were changes in the QMG, steroid and pyridostigmine requirements, and the number of treatment failures, the latter defined as ventilatory failure (forced vital capacity &lt; 30% predicted) or the development of swallowing impairment requiring a feeding tube. Cyclophosphamide was reported to be not significantly better than placebo at 6 months as assessed by the QMG. Cyclophosphamide was reported to significantly improve the QMG at 12 months. At six months, cyclophosphamide treated participants were on significantly lower doses of prednisolone (mean 13.3 mg/day) than the placebo group (mean 24 mg/day) (P &lt; 0.05). Data on anticholinesterase medication use were not comprehensively reported or evaluated statistically. There was no significant difference in treatment failures between the two groups.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Prednisolone (1 mg/kg daily for 1 month, subsequently reduced to 0.5 mg/kg daily by the fifth month, and to 0.25 mg/kg daily by the tenth month) versus azathioprine (3 mg/kg daily for one year and then 2 mg/kg daily). In the latter group, participants were also given prednisolone 1 mg/kg daily for 1 month, which was then gradually tapered and discontinued.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Efficacy of azathioprine plus initial prednisolone versus prednisolone at 6 months was not evaluated. No differences in the myasthenia muscle score or the modified Rankin scale were observed between the prednisolone or azathioprine plus initial prednisolone groups at 12 months. Primary endpoints of the study were time to the first episode of clinical deterioration within the first 60 months, defined by the occurrence of either impaired swallowing or respiratory insufficiency, or a drop in the myasthenia muscle score of at least 20 points. Among the 21 deterioration events, 9 were observed in the azathioprine group and 12 in the prednisolone group, giving a relative risk of 0.71 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.31).</P>

<P>34 participants, 18 in the tacrolimus plus corticosteroids with/without plasma exchange group, 16 in the no tacrolimus plus corticosteroids with/without plasma exchange.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Tacrolimus was administered orally at a dose of 3 mg/day. For early-phase therapy, participants received tacrolimus or prednisolone or both. Normal quality of life corresponding to the category 'Minimal Manifestations' (MM) of the MGFA Postintervention Status scale was achieved by administering, as required, early-phase treatment which consisted of oral prednisolone (not exceeding a daily dose of 20 mg), and combined therapy with plasmapheresis and high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/day for the first three days). The prednisolone dose was tapered and adjusted to the minimal dose needed to maintain MM. For the follow-up phase, participants were treated to maintain MM for one year. In the follow-up phase, plasma exchange plus high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone alone or pyridostigmine was administered as needed to maintain MM.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>None of the primary and secondary outcome measures for review were available. In the study, endpoints of early-phase therapy were frequency of plasma exchange plus high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, and the duration of early-phase treatment. The number of treatments with plasma exchange plus high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was significantly lower in participants treated with tacrolimus compared with those treated without tacrolimus during early-phase treatment, with a mean difference of -1.80 (95% CI -3.12, -0.48). The period of early-phase treatment was significantly shorter in the group treated with tacrolimus, with a mean difference of -2.10 (95% CI -3.63 to -0.57). Endpoints of follow-up phase therapy were frequency of plasma exchange plus high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone or high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone alone during this phase, and the dose of oral predisolone required at the endpoint. In this follow-up phase, the number of treatments with plasma exchange plus high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was significantly lower for the participants treated with tacrolimus compared with those without tacrolimus, with a mean difference of -0.90 (95% CI -1.72 to -0.08). In addition, the number of treatments with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone alone were significantly lower for the participants treated with tacrolimus compared with those without tacrolimus, with a mean difference of -1.40 (95% CI -2.79 to -0.01). At one year into treatment, the oral prednisolone dose was significantly lower for participants treated with tacrolimus compared with those without tacrolimus, with a mean difference of -3.50 (95% CI -5.78 to -1.22).</P>

<P>There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in objective or subjective measurement scores at 12 months. Primary endpoints of the study were the maintenance dose of prednisolone, number of participants experiencing treatment failure (defined as either no remission achieved in the three year follow-up period or clinical relapse after initial remission necessitating an increase in prednisolone dose), and the duration of the initial remission. The median prednisolone dose did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups at 12 months (exact figures not given), but was significantly reduced at 36 months in the azathioprine plus prednisolone group (0 mg) compared with the prednisolone plus placebo group (40mg) (P = 0.02). There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of number of participants experiencing treatment failure. Analysis of those who completed the trial showed that the duration of remission was significantly longer in the azathioprine plus prednisolone group compared with the prednisolone plus placebo group, giving a relative risk of 0.28 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.94). If those who withdrew or died were included as treatment failures, the duration of remission was not significantly different between the azathioprine plus prednisolone versus prednisolone plus placebo groups, with a relative risk of 0.67 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.04).</P>

</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>7 of the 10 participants in the ciclosporin group and four of the 10 participants in the placebo group showed mild improvement at 6 months. Therefore, the relative rate of improvement was 1.75 (95% CI 0.74 to 4.14). The ciclosporin group demonstrated significantly greater increase in muscle strength (measured by change in the QMG score) than the placebo group. The mean difference in QMG score between the ciclosporin group and placebo group was -0.46 (95% CI -0.83 to -0.09). 6 of the 10 participants in the ciclosporin group improved at 12 months: 5 had mild improvement and 1 had marked improvement. 1 of the 10 participants in the placebo group had mild improvement. Therefore, the overall relative rate of improvement was 6.00 (95% CI 0.87 to 41.21). The ciclosporin group demonstrated significantly greater increase in muscle strength (measured by change in the QMG score) than the placebo group. The mean difference in QMG score between the ciclosporin group and placebo group was -0.72 (95% CI -1.10 to -0.34). There was no significant mean difference of AChR antibody titre between the two groups at 6 months. Six participants in the ciclosporin group and 5 participants in the placebo group experienced treatment failure, giving a relative risk of 1.20 (95% CI 0.54 to 2.67).</P>

<P>Ciclosporin was started at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily. The dose was adjusted on the basis of blood drug levels, renal function and adverse reactions. Corticosteroid withdrawal was begun at 2 months with a reduction of 10 mg if the dose was 60 mg every other day or lower, and 20 mg if the dose was 80 to 100 mg. From the third to the sixth months, the dose of corticosteroids was reduced by 10 mg/month. If weakness increased following reduction in corticosteroids, the dose was increased. Participants were withdrawn from the study if treatment failed.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary endpoints, measured when participants reached 6 months of treatment or an earlier endpoint, were entry to exit change in QMG, AChR antibody titre and dose of steroids. 8 of the 20 participants in the ciclosporin plus prednisolone group improved. 2 of the 19 participants in the prednisolone plus placebo group improved. Therefore, the overall relative rate of improvement was 5.70 (95% CI 1.46 to 22.18). The ciclosporin group demonstrated significantly greater increase in muscle strength than the placebo group. The mean difference in QMG score between the ciclosporin group and placebo group was -0.31 (95% CI -0.51 to -0.11). The ciclosporin group had a statistically significant percentage reduction of antibody titre compared with placebo at six months, with a mean difference of 62.90 (95% CI 1.22 to 124.58). There was no significant difference in corticosteroid dose between the two groups. The mean difference was 13.60 (95% CI -5.64 to 32.84).</P>

<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>There were major violations of the trial protocol. Patients were initially randomised to either azathioprine or prednisolone with the intention to treat for one year before they crossed over to the other drug. Only four out of the five patients initially randomised to azathioprine were crossed over to prednisolone, two within four weeks of starting the trial - because they did not tolerate azathioprine - and two at the end of one year. The other patient on azathioprine was kept on the drug beyond one year. None of the patients on prednisolone at initial randomisation were crossed over to azathioprine. Therefore, the intended crossover design of the trial was not achieved.</P>

<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Schalke-1990">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>The trial set out to compare ciclosporin with azathioprine. However, it lacked key data. In particular, it is unclear which participants had prior immunosuppression (azathioprine alone, ciclosporin alone or azathioprine plus ciclosporin), and if a washout period was instituted before randomisation. These problems make it difficult to know which drug was actually being evaluated.</P>
