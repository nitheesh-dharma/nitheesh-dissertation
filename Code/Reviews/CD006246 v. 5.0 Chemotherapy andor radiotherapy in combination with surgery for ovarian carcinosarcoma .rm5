<P>Ovarian carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Mullerian tumour) is a rare malignant gynaecological tumour comprising around 1% or less of all ovarian cancers. These tumours contain both carcinomatous (arising from the epithelial tissue, the tissue that lines the cavities and surfaces of structures throughout the body) and sarcomatous tissue (arising from the connective tissue) within them. This tumour usually presents at an advanced stage and has a poor survival rate despite treatment. It is usually treated with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, and sometimes radiotherapy. Various types of chemotherapy drugs have been used to treat the woman before and after surgery (neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings).</P>
<P>There is currently no evidence to determine whether any form of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, in combination with surgery is better or worse for prolonging survival and improving quality of life or toxicity. The review highlights the need for good quality studies comparing various chemotherapy regimens, both pre- and post-surgery, with or without radiotherapy. Multicentre, multinational and collaborative good quality studies are needed to investigate this rare disease.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-28 12:01:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ovarian carcinosarcoma, also known as malignant mixed Mullerian tumour, is a rare malignant gynaecological tumour constituting about 1% or less of all ovarian cancers. In over 80% of cases, there is extra-ovarian intra-abdominal spread at diagnosis. The primary treatment has traditionally been surgical cytoreduction followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Regimes have included cisplatin alone; a combination of doxorubicin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine, cyclophosphamide, taxol; and various other combinations. The effectiveness of these various regimens appears to be mixed. Therefore, there is a need to clarify if there is an optimum neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy after surgical cytoreduction for this rare tumour. Also, it is important to address quality of life (QoL) issues related to treatment, particularly toxicity, as the overall prognosis appears to be poor.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-29 10:19:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ovarian carcinosarcoma is a rare malignant gynaecological tumour comprising around 1% or less of all ovarian carcinomas (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1992</LINK>). Ovarian carcinosarcomas differ from epithelial ovarian tumours in that they contain both carcinomatous (arising from the epithelial tissue, which lines the cavities and surfaces of structures throughout the body) and sarcomatous (mesenchymal, arising from the connective tissue) tissue. The histology of the carcinomatous components is similar to conventional epithelial ovarian carcinoma (serous, endometroid etc.). The sarcomatous component can arise from or resemble the mesenchymal tissue of the ovary (homologous) or can be different to the mesenchymal tissue of the ovary and resemble that found in extra-ovarian sites (heterologous). Special immunohistochemical staining (an investigative tool that provides supplemental information to the routine morphological assessment of tissues) helps in confirming the subtypes mentioned above (<LINK REF="REF-George--1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1991</LINK>). There are various hypotheses which have been examined to explain the presence of carcinomatous and sarcomatous cell types within this tumour. The combination theory suggests that a common stem cell (cell which is capable of giving rise to all cell types) gives rise to both the epithelial and mesenchymal components (<LINK REF="REF-Guarino--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jin--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sonoda-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonoda 2000</LINK>); the conversion theory suggests an origin from a common epithelial clone and an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation-based mechanism (otherwise called epithelial de-differentiation) (<LINK REF="REF-Guarino--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schipf--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schipf 2008</LINK>). In over 80% of cases, there is extra-ovarian intra-abdominal spread at diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1992</LINK>). The diagnosis is confirmed by histology with the presence of malignant epithelial and mesenchymal components. The standard International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging for ovarian epithelial tumour is applied to ovarian carcinosarcoma (<LINK REF="REF-Benedet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benedet 2000</LINK>) and the prognosis is generally poor (<LINK REF="REF-Ariyoshi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ariyoshi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanjani-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanjani 1983</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-01-28 12:01:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary treatment has traditionally been surgical cytoreduction (surgery attempting to remove as much of the tumour as possible) followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Carlson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1995</LINK>) or chemotherapy alone (<LINK REF="REF-Bicher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bicher 1995</LINK>). Treatment guidelines are extrapolated from epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Due to the rarity of this tumour, chemotherapy regimes have often changed over the course of time (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2004</LINK>). Optimal cytoreduction followed by adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy has been practiced based on case series and prospective trials (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tate-Thigpen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tate Thigpen 2004</LINK>). Combination platinum chemotherapy in combination with paclitaxel, doxorubicin, ifosfamide and other agents has been used with varying response rates (<LINK REF="REF-Duska-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duska 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrow-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1991</LINK>). The results of these various regimens appear to be mixed.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-28 12:01:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A review of published cases indicated a high one-year mortality rate of 78% (<LINK REF="REF-Hanjani-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanjani 1983</LINK>) in this rare tumour irrespective of stage. A more recent publication suggested 40% survival at one year (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2003</LINK>). Advanced surgical stage did not affect the median overall survival (OS) in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Terada-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terada 1989</LINK>), but was associated with a poor prognosis in a more recent study (<LINK REF="REF-Ariyoshi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ariyoshi 2000</LINK>). More recent studies have indicated that median survival could be improved with platinum-based chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bicher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bicher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duska-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duska 2002</LINK>). One of the largest reported data series of 47 cases over 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2003</LINK>) indicates that maintaining consistency in treatment plans is difficult and the tumour remains more aggressive than epithelial ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Barnholtz_x002d_Sloan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnholtz-Sloan 2004</LINK>). A case series which compared carcinosarcoma of the ovary with epithelial carcinoma of the ovary showed an inferior response with platinum-based chemotherapy in the former group (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2004</LINK>). There is, therefore, a need to clarify if there is an optimum therapy after surgical cytoreduction or in the neoadjuvant setting for this rare tumour. Also, it is important to address quality of life (QoL) issues related to treatment, particularly toxicity related to treatment, as the overall prognosis appears to be poor.</P>

<P>We did not identify any trials that compared the effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy in combination with surgery for women with ovarian carcinosarcoma<I>. </I>Therefore, there is currently no evidence to determine whether any form of chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, in combination with surgery is better or worse in terms of prolonging survival, QoL or toxicity.</P>
<P>We specified OS and DFS as the primary outcomes of interest. Quality of life should perhaps be the main focus if future trials are conducted since treatment related morbidity is likely to degrade the quality of the time that women live. This is especially important in women with ovarian carcinosarcoma where a number of retrospective studies and case reports have shown very poor survival rates (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2004</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-01-28 12:01:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently carried out a comprehensive search, including a thorough search of the grey literature, and all references were sifted. We were restrictive in our inclusion criteria with regards to types of studies as we planned to only include RCTs, as we suspected that some of the NRS designs were dubious and would have been prone to selection bias. No relevant NRSs appeared to use appropriate statistical adjustment or were of adequate quality. Therefore, we attempted to ensure that we did not overlook any relevant evidence by searching a wide range of sources and ensuring the review was not based on poor quality evidence by excluding case reports and poor quality retrospective studies. We felt it was better to highlight the need for RCTs, or at the very least good quality NRSs, rather than report the results of low quality studies that are very likely to be misleading.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be publication bias, that is studies that did not find the treatment to have been effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility as we did not find any studies that met the inclusion criteria.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-01-28 12:01:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two prospective Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) studies looked at the outcomes of women diagnosed with ovarian carcinosarcoma, but these studies included too few women in order to make reliable comparisons (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tate-Thigpen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tate Thigpen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 1986</LINK> registered 15 women with a diagnosis of ovarian carcinosarcoma who were treated with combinations of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy depending on the stage of the disease. A combination of vincristine, dactinomycin and cyclophosphamide was used in some women. Survival was better in women with early stage disease or with a smaller residual tumour volume.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Tate-Thigpen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tate Thigpen 2004</LINK> studied the cytotoxic effect of platinum in women diagnosed with ovarian carcinosarcoma. The median progression-free interval was 5.2 months and the median OS was 11.7 months (n = 130). Forty-four women were evaluable for response and showed an overall response of 20%. Survival was favourable for women with non-measurable disease and also in women who responded to platinum. Adverse effects were not uncommon. We agree that this is one of the largest prospective series of women with carcinosarcoma ovary studied so far. The recruitment took 20 years, which makes it difficult to compare various cytotoxic drugs along with platinum. Despite the platinum response being similar to uterine carcinosarcoma, it is still lower than the conventional epithelial ovarian tumours, which means that platinum alone as a cytotoxic drug may not be effective in improving survival in ovarian carcinosarcoma. This was confirmed by <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2004</LINK> who compared epithelial ovarian tumours with carcinosarcoma of the ovary in their retrospective case series and found an inferior response to platinum-based chemotherapy in the carcinosarcoma group.</P>
<P>A recent case-control study (<LINK REF="REF-Rauh_x002d_Hain-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rauh-Hain 2011</LINK>) reviewed 50 cases of ovarian carcinosarcoma of the ovary, each case was matched to two women with serous ovarian epithelial carcinoma. Shorter time to recurrence, increased platinum resistance, poorer prognosis with suboptimal cytoreduction and poorer OS were noticed in women with ovarian carcinosarcoma compared to serous epithelial ovarian cancer. <LINK REF="REF-Jonson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonson 2006</LINK> looked at 17 cases of ovarian carcinosarcoma and 87 women with uterine carcinosarcoma and found no difference in survival between the two groups.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-Chun-KC" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chun KC</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cicen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicen 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Duska-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duska 2002</LINK> studies reported a retrospective analysis of 40, 26 and 28 women diagnosed with ovarian carcinosarcoma, respectively, and showed improved survival with optimal debulking and platinum-based combination treatment. A platinum combination with taxanes was used in two studies (<LINK REF="REF-Chun-KC" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chun KC</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duska-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duska 2002</LINK>) and a combination of platinum and Ifosfamide was used in the <LINK REF="REF-Cicen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicen 2008</LINK> study. Recruitment took 15 to 20 years with various chemotherapeutic agents being used over that period of time, which makes it difficult to compare various regimens. A retrospective series of 31 women (<LINK REF="REF-Rutledge-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutledge 2006</LINK>) showed improved survival with optimal debulking and the use of ifosfamide and cisplatin chemotherapy compared to a carboplatin and taxol combination. The median OS was 21 months for the whole group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Signorelli-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Signorelli 2009</LINK> reviewed 41 women with ovarian carcinosarcoma over a period of 11 years. The women underwent surgery and were given platinum-based combination chemotherapy. The overall survival was 20 months. The response to the platinum-based combination (anthracycline, alkylating agent) was good but was associated with high toxicity and the numbers in the two chemotherapeutic regimens were small. <LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 1994</LINK> reported a series of 20 women over a 10-year period. The analysis showed a median survival of 14 months and suggested that platinum and cyclophosphamide may be useful therapy following surgery. <LINK REF="REF-Chang-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1995</LINK> studied 37 women with ovarian carcinosarcoma and found stage to be an independent prognostic factor and single agent platinum to be effective to some extent. <LINK REF="REF-Sutton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 1994</LINK>, in their phase II trial, reviewed 32 women who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy for ovarian carcinosarcoma and were administered ifosfamide; they found ifosfamide to have activity.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2003</LINK> retrospectively reviewed 40 women diagnosed with ovarian carcinosarcoma. Eighty per cent presented with advanced stage disease. More than 50% had bulky disease, associated with worse prognosis, and the majority received platinum-based chemotherapy following surgery. Overall, the one- and five-year survival rates were 40% and 7.5% respectively, which is much lower than for serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma. <LINK REF="REF-Leiser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leiser 2007</LINK> reviewed 30 women with a diagnosis of ovarian carcinosarcoma. All the women had stage III or IV ovarian carcinosarcoma except one who had stage II disease. Fifty-seven per cent had optimal cytoreduction and all women received platinum and taxane as first-line chemotherapy. The three- and five-year survival rates were 53% and 30% respectively. Even though there was a trend towards a better response rate with optimal cytoreduction, it did not affect OS. <LINK REF="REF-Muntz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muntz 1995</LINK> reviewed 27 women with a diagnosis of ovarian carcinosarcoma and found advanced stage to be a significant prognostic factor. Less than 50% of women underwent optimal cytoreduction. The majority received platinum-based chemotherapy. Few women were treated with postoperative radiotherapy. There was a trend towards improved survival with optimal cytoreduction and platinum-based chemotherapy but it was difficult to interpret because of the small numbers.</P>
<P>All the above mentioned studies consistently confirmed that the OS is poor in women with ovarian carcinosarcoma as compared to epithelial serous ovarian carcinoma. Most studies have confirmed that platinum has some activity in this tumour type. Other variables such as suboptimal cytoreduction, feasibility for cytoreduction and increased platinum resistance have been commented upon by some studies. A major improvement in survival has not been seen in this group of women despite extrapolating cytoreduction and platinum-based combination therapy. All the above studies had inadequate or no comparison groups for various adjuvant regimens and most of the studies were retrospective case series, and hence inferences cannot be made scientifically. The difficulty in recruiting women for a prospective trial, which has limitations because of the rarity of the tumour, is obvious.</P>

<P>We found no current evidence to guide clinical practice with regards to various adjuvant treatment regimens in ovarian carcinosarcoma. As ovarian carcinosarcomas are considered a subgroup of ovarian epithelial tumours, they will tend to be treated similarly despite lack of good evidence.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-01-28 12:01:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effectiveness and safety of various neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, with or without radiotherapy, in combination with surgery in ovarian carcinosarcoma a RCT needs to be conducted. Preferably this should be a multicentre, multinational trial that attempts to recruit as many women as possible to increase the power of the trial given the rarity of the disease. We specified OS and DFS as the primary outcome of interest, but QoL along with survival should perhaps be the main focus if future trials are conducted as the prognosis for women with ovarian carcinosarcoma is currently poor and treatment-related morbidity is likely to degrade the quality of the time that the women live.</P>
<P>The Cancer Genome Atlas project has analysed various molecular aberrations that cause high grade serous ovarian epithelial carcinoma, which is important for developing and analysing targeted therapy (<LINK REF="REF-The-Cancer-Genome-Atlas-Research-Network-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2011</LINK>). There are few studies which have looked at molecular abnormalities with abnormal signalling pathways in ovarian carcinosarcoma and genital tract carcinosarcoma (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raji-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raji 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sawada-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawada 2003</LINK>). Further research in this area is critical in developing targeted therapy for this tumour subtype.</P>

<P>We had initially decided to run the searches with an RCT filter but ultimately ran them without as the number of hits was low. We also decided not to include NRSs when no RCTs were identified due to the problem of selection bias and the fact that no studies appeared to use satisfactory statistical adjustment for important prognostic factors. We had initially stated the following in the protocol:</P>
<P>"It is likely that there are no RCTs of treatment for ovarian MMT. If no such trials are identified, the search strategy will be re-run without the RCT filter so that any other papers containing prospective or retrospective data can be collated and listed in excluded studies.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data on outcomes will be extracted as below</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>For time to event (e.g. overall survival) data, we will extract the log of the hazard ratio [log(HR)] and its standard error from trial reports; if these are not reported, we will attempt to estimate them from other reported statistics using the methods of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies  </HEADING>
<P>The risk of bias in included RCTs will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and the criteria specified in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<LI>incomplete outcome data, where we will code a satisfactory level of loss to follow-up for each outcome as:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Yes, if fewer than 20% of women are lost to follow-up and reasons for loss to follow-up were similar in both treatment arms,</LI>
<LI>No, if more than 20% of women are lost to follow-up or reasons for loss to follow-up differed between treatment arms,</LI>

</UL>
<LI>selective reporting of outcomes;</LI>
<LI>other possible sources of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The risk of bias tool will be applied independently by two review authors (TS, AB) and differences will be resolved by discussion. Results will be presented in the risk of bias tables and also in both a risk of bias graph and a risk of bias summary plot. Results of the meta-analyses will be interpreted in light of the findings with respect to risk of bias.</P>

<P>We will not impute missing outcome data for the primary outcome. If data are missing or only imputed data are reported, we will contact trial authors to request data on the outcomes only among participants who were assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed by visual inspection of forest plots, by estimation of the percentage heterogeneity between trials which cannot be ascribed to sampling variation (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), by a formal statistical test of the significance of the heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>) and, if possible, by subgroup analyses (see below). If there is evidence of substantial heterogeneity, the possible reasons for this will be investigated and reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases  </HEADING>
<P>We will not assess the potential for small study effects such as the potential for publication bias because, given the rarity of ovarian carcinosarcoma, there will be an insufficient number of included studies in which to make this assessment. We did not identify any included trials from 1950 to October 2010 so future updates in the short term are unlikely to yield many trials in this area.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis  </HEADING>
<P>If sufficient clinically similar studies are available, their results will be pooled in meta-analyses. Adjusted summary statistics will be used, if available; otherwise unadjusted results will be used.</P>

<LI>For time to event data, HRs will be pooled using the generic inverse variance facility of RevMan 5.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcomes, the RR will be calculated for each study and these will then be pooled. </LI>
<LI>For continuous outcomes, the mean differences between the treatment arms at the end of follow-up will be pooled if all trials measured the outcome on the same scale, otherwise standardised mean differences will be pooled. </LI>
