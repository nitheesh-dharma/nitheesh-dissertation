<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-08 16:04:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Cervical cancer is preceded by cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN). Surgery for CIN is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent invasive carcinoma. An effective chemo-preventive agent might avoid the need for surgery and reduce the cost and morbidity of work-up and treatment. Retinoids are natural and synthetic derivatives of naturally occurring vitamin A. Overall, the retinoids studied are not effective in causing regression of severe CIN3 but may have activity in moderate CIN2. Data are inadequate to allow assessment of whether the retinoids studied are effective in preventing progression of any grade of CIN.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-05-08 16:03:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews">
<P>Invasive cervical carcinoma is preceded by a precancerous phase, cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN), which can be detected on cervical smears and confirmed by colposcopy and biopsy. Moderate and severe cases of intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN2 and CIN3) are treated mainly with surgery to prevent progression to invasive carcinoma. Medical methods of preventing the progression or inducing the regression of CIN are needed. Retinoids are potent modulators of epithelial cell growth and differentiation that may have potential for the treatment of CIN.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-06-01 14:13:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Review Group's Specialised Register and Non-Trials Database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 3, 2010), and MEDLINE and Embase (July 2010).</P>
<P>For the 2013 update, the searches were re-run as follows: CENTRAL, Issue 3, 2013; MEDLINE, April, Week 2, 2013; and Embase, Week 16, 2013. In Novemeber 2015 the searches were updated: CENTRAL, Issue 10, 2015; MEDLINE, Nov, Week 1, 2015; and Embase, Week 46, 2015.<BR/>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-11-03 15:40:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from the trials. Adverse effects information was also collected from the trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-06-01 13:59:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Five RCTs comparing the efficacy of four different retinoids were identified. Two studies examined the effects on CIN2 and CIN3 of the retinoids N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (fenretinide) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (aliretinoin) given orally. Two examined the effect of all-trans-retinoic acid administered topically to the cervix. The fifth study investigated the use of 13-cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin) given orally to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive participants with CIN1 and condyloma.</P>
<P>Four studies reported no significant effect of retinoids on the progression to higher grades of CIN, and the fifth did not report data on progression. In all studies retinoids had no significant effect on regression of CIN3. Two studies reported that retinoids were associated with regression of CIN2. One reported a greater complete regression of CIN2 over that seen with placebo, which was of borderline statistical significance (odds ratio (OR) 0.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 1.02). The other study reported a nonsignificant dose-related trend toward increased rates of complete and partial regression compared with placebo. One study reported significantly worse outcomes in women receiving retinoid (OR for regression 6.00, 95% CI 1.00 to 35.91). In general, the retinoid medications were well tolerated.</P>
<P>In the 2010, 2013 and 2015 updates, no new studies were identified for inclusion, therefore the review has been marked as stable.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-05-08 16:04:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews">
<P>The retinoids studied are not effective in causing regression of CIN3 but may have some effect on CIN2. The data on CIN1 are inadequate. Retinoids are not effective in preventing progression of CIN of any grade. At the doses given for the duration of treatment studied, the retinoids were reasonably well tolerated.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-06-01 14:09:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-05-08 16:04:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>More than 400,000 women are diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of the cervix annually around the world (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2006</LINK>). Invasive carcinoma is preceded by cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN), which can be detected on cervical smears taken as part of screening programs. Treatment of patients with CIN is very effective in reducing the risk of subsequent invasive carcinoma; however, the cost of treatment and follow-up is high, and the surgery involved results in potential side effects that are harmful to the patient. Use of a chemo-preventive agent to treat the disease and avoid the need for surgery is preferred.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-05-08 16:12:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Retinoids comprise a family of polyisoprenoid compounds that include vitamin A (retinol) and its natural and synthetic derivatives. Examples of natural derivatives of vitamin A include all-trans-retinoic acid (tretinoin), 9-cis-retinoic acid (alitretinoin), and 13-cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin), whereas N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (fenretinide) is an example of a synthetic retinoid (<LINK REF="REF-Brtko-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brtko 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence suggesting that retinoids may have a role in the treatment of patients with CIN has evolved over many years. Retinoids are essential for many life functions, including growth, vision, reproduction, metabolism, and hematopoiesis (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 1984</LINK>). Retinoic acid is transported into the cell nucleus by binding proteins, and its eventual actions are mediated through binding to retinoid receptors, which exist in several distinct isoforms (<LINK REF="REF-Ribeiro-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ribeiro 1995</LINK>). Retinoids regulate the normal pathway of epithelial cell differentiation (<LINK REF="REF-Sporn-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sporn 1984</LINK>) and may have a role in inhibiting carcinogenesis by blocking the promotion of already initiated or transformed cells through induction of apoptosis and differentiation (<LINK REF="REF-Niles-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niles 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vitamin A derived from the diet is metabolized to all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid, and most of the effects of vitamin A deficiency can be prevented and reversed by administration of retinoic acid (<LINK REF="REF-Altucci-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altucci 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sporn-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sporn 1984</LINK>). Dietary deficiency of vitamin A is known to be associated with carcinogenesis in human beings and may be associated with the development of cervical cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Bollag-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bollag 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-La-Vecchia-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Vecchia 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Potischman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potischman 2003</LINK>). It has been reported that low serum vitamin A levels are associated with the presence of cervical dysplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Schimizu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimizu 1996</LINK>) and an increased rate of progression of carcinoma in situ to cervical cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Nagata-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagata 1999</LINK>), whereas regression of cervical dysplasia, especially in human papillomavirus (HPV)-16&#65293;positive women, has been reported in association with high plasma vitamin A levels (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In vivo laboratory experiments on animal models have shown that retinoids can suppress the process of carcinogenesis including that of chemically induced tumors (<LINK REF="REF-Bollag-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bollag 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sporn-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sporn 1984</LINK>). Retinoids have an antiproliferative effect on transformed cell lines, including mammary, melanoma, lymphoid, and fibroblastic cells from various species (<LINK REF="REF-Lotan-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lotan 1980</LINK>), as well as on human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (<LINK REF="REF-Bollag-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bollag 1992</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-06-01 14:09:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>In human studies retinoids have been shown to reverse or prevent the progression of premalignant oral lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Hong-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hong 1986</LINK>), to decrease the incidence of second primary tumors in participants with invasive carcinoma of the head and neck (<LINK REF="REF-Hong-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hong 1990</LINK>), and to have actual or potential treatment effects on other cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Altucci-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altucci 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence from laboratory and clinical studies suggests that retinoids might be efficacious in treating participants with cervical dysplasia. The serum level of all-trans-retinoic acid highly influences the progression of cervical lesions to invasive cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Grace-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grace 2006</LINK>), and all-trans-retinoic acid inhibits proliferation of cell lines derived from human cervical neoplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Behbakht-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behbakht 1996</LINK>). A decrease in retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-beta receptor levels is seen in cervical carcinogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Geisen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geisen 1997</LINK>), which is associated with the integration of the HPV genome into the host cell DNA and the induction of production of two viral proteins: E6 and E7 (<LINK REF="REF-McCance-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCance 1988</LINK>). E6 and E7 effectively block the activity of two proteins: p53 and pRB, The result is that cells are allowed to undergo DNA replication in an uncontrolled and unchecked manner. It is interesting to note that retinoids have been shown to regulate the transcription rate of E6 and E7 in some cervical cancer cell lines&#65293;an action that helps to control cell and tumor growth (<LINK REF="REF-Choo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choo 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>The studies were synthesized according to primary outcome variables. The general primary outcome (regression of CIN) was similar across studies ; however, the specifics differed greatly. In particular, length of follow-up and the definition of regression were different across studies, prohibiting a full, formal meta-analysis across all studies. Studies were synthesized when possible (when the outcome variables coincided), and ORs with fixed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by aggregating studies according to the different outcome variables. Forest plots are presented only to give a visual overview of the findings and are not valid for hypothesis testing. A formal, comprehensive meta-analysis of the efficacy of retinoids was not conducted because of the differing durations of follow-up, the various definitions of regression, and inconsistencies in the quantity and level of data reported among studies.</P>

<P>Five studies examined the use of retinoids in RCTs using four different retinoids administered by two different routes. The oral route was used for fenretinide (<LINK REF="STD-Follen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Follen 2001</LINK>), aliretinoin (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2003</LINK>), and isotretinoin (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2002</LINK>). Local application to the cervix via the vaginal route was used for all-trans-retinoic acid (<LINK REF="STD-Meyskens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meyskens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ruffin 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Follen found that 28 of 30 participants took 80% of the pills prescribed and 17% failed to complete the full year of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Follen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Follen 2001</LINK>). In the trial by Alvarez, it was reported that 81% completed the study and, although not statistically significant, 89% of participants in the placebo arm completed the study as compared with 82% in the low-dose aliretinoin group and 71% in the high-dose group (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2003</LINK>). A dropout rate of 22% was reported in the therapy arm and 23% in the placebo arm before treatment was completed in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Meyskens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meyskens 1994</LINK>). Loss to follow-up at the 15-month designated primary endpoint was 44% in the placebo arm and 39% in the treatment arm.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Progression of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia to higher grades</HEADING>
<P>Alvarez reported that after 12 weeks, progression to a higher degree of CIN occurred in 22% receiving placebo, 24% given low-dose aliretinoin, and 6% treated with high-dose aliretinoin (P = 0.116) (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Follen reported that at 12 months (6 months after completion of treatment), 2 out of 14 (14%) progressed in the treatment arm versus 1 out of 16 (6%) in the placebo arm. However, the study did not employ a valid cross-over design. Participants who crossed over were not a random sample of all participants because cross-over was dependent on outcome in the first half of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Follen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Follen 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Ruffin reported that after 12 weeks,6% of those with CIN2 at baseline assigned to treatment and 4% of those receiving placebo progressed to a higher grade of dysplasia (<LINK REF="STD-Ruffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ruffin 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trial by Meyskens did not report data on progression (<LINK REF="STD-Meyskens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meyskens 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Robinson reported that no significant difference in the proportions progressing to CIN2 or CIN3 was noted between treatment and observation arms (P = 0.29), although slightly more of those in the isotretinoin group showed no progression at each time point (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2002</LINK>). Progression was not significantly associated with CD4 levels, but participants younger than 30 years of age had a shorter time to progression than those older than 30 years, independent of treatment with isotretinoin.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Regression of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia</HEADING>
<P>In the Follen study, it was reported that at 12 months, a significantly worse outcome was observed among the women receiving fenretinide, which had not been apparent at 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-Follen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Follen 2001</LINK>). For this reason, the study was stopped early.</P>
<P>Alvarez reported that at 12 weeks, no significant difference in the rate of complete or partial regression was reported among placebo, low-dose aliretinoin, and high-dose aliretinoin groups for CIN2 or CIN3 (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2003</LINK>). However, within the CIN2 subgroup, a trend toward increased rates of partial or complete regression was noted in the treatment groups, although this finding was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2003</LINK>). This appeared to be dose-related in that in the high-dose, low-dose, and placebo groups, regression was seen in 50%, 33%, and 20%, respectively (P = 0.35).</P>
<P>The Meyskens trial showed an effect of borderline significance for treatment compared with placebo on complete regression in participants with CIN2 (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.02, P = 0.06) but no significant difference with CIN3 or for CIN2 and CIN3 combined at 9 to 27 months (<LINK REF="STD-Meyskens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meyskens 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ruffin reported that treatment had no significant effect on regression of CIN2 or CIN3 (<LINK REF="STD-Ruffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ruffin 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Although designed as a secondary endpoint, regression was difficult to assess in the Robinson study because a large number of women were not biopsied and many varied between being biopsy positive and biopsy negative during the study (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Morbidity of retinoid interventions</HEADING>
<P>In all studies, adverse effects are well documented. In general, the retinoid medication was well tolerated.</P>
<P>Follen reported that the maximum toxicity was grade 2 in treatment and placebo arms, and that no significant difference was noted between grade 1 and 2 toxicities in these groups (<LINK REF="STD-Follen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Follen 2001</LINK>). Grade 1 toxicity occurred in 91% of participants in the treatment arm versus 88% of those in the placebo arm, and grade 2 toxicity was reported among 18% of those in the treatment arm versus 23.5% of participants in the placebo arm. No participants stopped the study drug as the result of toxicity.</P>
<P>Meyskens reported no systemic effects in participants who received topical therapy applied to the cervix (<LINK REF="STD-Meyskens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meyskens 1994</LINK>). Most local adverse events occurred in the initial four-day treatment period. Colposcopically visualized cervical and vaginal inflammation was greater in the treatment group. Significantly more vulvar burning, itching, and irritation was noted during the initial treatment period by those receiving retinoid (P = 0.001) (<LINK REF="STD-Meyskens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meyskens 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ruffin, who used a similar study design, also reported no systemic effects (<LINK REF="STD-Ruffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ruffin 2004</LINK>). Self-reported vaginal burning (P = 0.024) and itching (P = 0.0023) and discharge (P = 0.0005) and clinician-assessed cervical erythema (P = 0.0135) and vaginal discharge (P = 0.0122) were all significantly increased over time in those receiving treatment versus placebo, but no participants discontinued treatment as the result of adverse effects.</P>
<P>Alvarez reported no significant difference in clinical symptoms between the three groups (two treatment and one placebo), but in the high-dose aliretinoin group, 74% experienced headaches compared with 47% in the low-dose group and 57% in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2003</LINK>). Of the six aliretinoin participants with severe headaches, only one withdrew and the others were managed with dose modification and analgesics. A statistically but not clinically significant reduction in hemoglobin levels was reported in both aliretinoin groups (mean 0.4 to 0.55 g/dL) versus placebo (0.1 g/dL) )(P = 0.0003). A significant increase in median serum triglycerides was observed in both aliretinoin arms, along with a reduction in median high-density lipoprotein levels. No adverse clinical effects were attributable to any specific alteration in a laboratory parameter in either group.</P>
<P>Robinson reported that 8 out of 50 participants (16%) permanently discontinued retinoid treatment at or before 16 weeks&#65293;5 because of dry skin, hair, or eyes; 1 because of agitation, 1 with an oral ulcer, and 1 with dry eyes and depression. An additional 11 out of 102 subjects developed grade 3 or 4 chemistry abnormalities&#65293;3 while receiving treatment and 8 while on observation. Two of those receiving isotretinoin developed hypertriglyceridemia.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary of results</HEADING>
<P>Overall, the retinoids studied are not effective in causing regression of CIN3. Activity in CIN2 may have occurred in the study by Meyskens, which showed an effect of borderline statistical significance (<LINK REF="STD-Meyskens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meyskens 1994</LINK>), and Alvarez reported a trend across categories of dose (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2003</LINK>). However, Ruffin reported no effect when treating with a more practical regimen than Meyskens had used, albeit without consolidation&#65293;interval dosing (<LINK REF="STD-Ruffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ruffin 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data on CIN1 are inadequate to allow any conclusions on regression. Data are also inadequate to permit assessment of whether the retinoids studied are effective in preventing progression of CIN. At the doses given for the duration of treatment provided, the retinoids studied were reasonably well tolerated.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-06-01 14:01:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The promise shown by retinoids in animal models and in other human cancers has not translated into a consistent effect in preventing the progression or enhancing the regression of CIN.</P>
<P>The reasons for these results are not precisely clear. Within the reported studies are some marked confounding factors. In particular, a statistically significantly greater proportion of participants with CIN3 were included in the treatment groups of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Follen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Follen 2001</LINK>). In addition, the Follen study reported a statistically significantly greater proportion of participants who were smokers in the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Follen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Follen 2001</LINK>). This undermines the capacity of these studies to reliably detect benefit in the treatment groups.</P>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Follen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Follen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyskens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meyskens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ruffin 2004</LINK>) noted high regression rates of CIN2 or CIN3 in participants receiving placebo: 32%, 31%, 29%, and 76% respectively. All were designed with the assumption of a much lower spontaneous regression rate in the placebo arm. Although this did not make a difference in the Follen study (<LINK REF="STD-Follen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Follen 2001</LINK>), the Meyskens and Alvarez studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyskens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meyskens 1994</LINK>) ended up being significantly underpowered to detect treatment effects. Other factors such as possible suboptimal dosing and short duration of treatment may have masked potential treatment effects. The problem is that higher doses and longer duration may cause increased side effects. The level of drug toxicity is relatively more important when chemo-preventive agents are investigated, because participants are otherwise asymptomatic. Retinoids do have the potential to cause serious side effects, including teratogenic (<LINK REF="REF-Soprano-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soprano 1995</LINK>) and other effects (<LINK REF="REF-Mills-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zanardi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanardi 2006</LINK>), and this limitation on dose and duration of treatment may limit any clinical role of these agents. The doses of all-trans-retinoic acid used in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Meyskens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Meyskens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruffin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ruffin 2004</LINK>) were determined in specific phase I studies, whereas the doses of agents used by the other three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Follen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Follen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2002</LINK>) were not tested, and no specific phase I data on duration of retinoid treatment preceded any of these studies (<LINK REF="REF-Follen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follen 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chemo-prevention studies in CIN1 and condyloma are fraught with difficulty, and the Robinson study demonstrates this (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2002</LINK>). However, this trial investigated only HIV-positive women&#65293;a group that clearly needs more research directed at the prevention of progression to invasive carcinoma.</P>
<P>The studies reported here show that in trials composed of poor and underserved women, quality research can be performed with reasonable compliance rates. The prevention of invasive cervical carcinoma must remain a priority, but the development of vaccines against high-risk HPV genotypes may reduce the effort expended to find chemo-preventive agents.</P>
<P>In the 2010, 2013 and 2015 updates, no new studies were identified for inclusion, therefore the review has been marked as stable.</P>

<P>9-Cis retinoic acid (aliretinoin) 25 mg or 50 mg or placebo was administered orally daily for 12 weeks.

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2013-05-08 16:12:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Primary endpoint was histologic grade of CIN on LEEP excision in comparison with pretreatment biopsy. Patients were also evaluated by clinical exam, Pap smear, and colposcopy at three months.<BR/>Regression was defined as reduction in one grade of CIN, and progression as an increase in the severity of CIN. 104 participants were evaluable for response: 37 in the placebo arm, 34 in the low-dose aliretinoin arm, and 33 in the high-dose aliretinoin arm. After 12 weeks, no participant progressed to invasive carcinoma. Progression to a higher degree of CIN occurred in 22% receiving placebo, 24% receiving low-dose aliretinoin, and 6% receiving high-dose aliretinoin (P = 0.116). No significant difference in the rate of complete or partial regression was noted among the placebo (32%) and low-dose (32%) and high-dose (36%) aliretinoin groups, either for CIN2 or for CIN3. However, within the CIN2 subgroup, a trend toward increased rates of partial or complete regression was observed in the treatment groups, although this did not reach statistical significance. It appeared to be dose related in that in the high-dose, low-dose, and placebo groups, regression rates were 50%, 33%, and 20%, respectively (P = 0.349).<BR/>

<P>A significantly greater number of participants had CIN3 relative to CIN2 in the high-dose aliretinoin group. 81% of the 114 participants enrolled completed the study according to protocol. Compliance was monitored with pill counts at 6 and 12 weeks. Patients kept a daily log of drug administration. Telephone calls at 3 and 9 weeks monitored for toxicity and adverse events. HIV status was not mentioned.<BR/>Compliance: 2 participants in the high-dose aliretinoin arm did not initiate drug and were excluded from toxicity and efficacy analyses. One participant in the placebo arm, four in the low-dose aliretinoin arm, and three in the high-dose arm withdrew from the study after drug initiation and were excluded from efficacy analysis, for a total of 104 participants evaluable for efficacy.<BR/>Toxicity: 112/114 enrolled were evaluable for toxicity. 86% developed mild to moderate nonspecific symptoms, and no significant difference was noted between groups. Participants in the high-dose aliretinoin arm (74%) experienced headaches more frequently than those in the low-dose (47%) or placebo (57%) groups. One out of 6 reporting severe headache in the high-dose arm withdrew, and 5 cases were ameliorated with dose modification and analgesics. Compared with placebo among participants receiving aliretinoin, a significant reduction in hemoglobin values was noted, with significant elevation in median serum triglycerides and reduction in median HDL levels, although these changes were not clinically significant.</P>

<P>Primary endpoint was histologic grade of CIN on colposcopic biopsy at 6 months and 1 year compared with pretreatment biopsy.<BR/>Partial regression was defined as CIS/CIN3 to CIN2/CIN1 or HPV infection. Complete regression occurred if CIS/CIN3 or CIN2 regressed to normal. No change occurred if the grade remained the same. Progression was defined as CIN2/3 to CIS, microinvasion or invasive cancer, or CIS progressed to microinvasion or invasive cancer. The control arm included 16 evaluable participants at 6 and 12 months, and the treatment arm consisted of 20 evaluable participants at 6 months and 14 at 12 months. Analysis showed that no confounders affected the response. Baseline severity was imbalanced across treatment groups. 18/22 (82%) in the treatment arm had CIN3 versus 8/17 (47%) in the placebo arm. At 12 months (6 months following completion of treatment), 2 of 14 (14%) progressed in the treatment arm versus 1 of 16 (6%) in the placebo arm, indicating significantly worse outcomes among women receiving 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide (fenretinide); this was not apparent at 6 months. 12-Month results may not be reliable in that the cross-over design was invalid.

<P>Randomized study. Randomization by computer, stratified by CD4 counts. Parallel design without cross-over. Pathologist blinded.<BR/>Multicenter: performed at 26 sites. Time of accrual: 44 months (4/96-12/99).</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2013-05-08 16:12:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews">
<P>117 women. Eligibility included biopsy-proven CIN1 (later amended to allow condyloma), HIV positive, with satisfactory colposcopy and negative ECC. Exclusion criteria included unsatisfactory colposcopy, ECC showing dysplasia, concurrent Pap smear two or more grades more severe than the colposcopically directed biopsy, excisional or ablative therapy for cervical disease within 4 months, the use of retinoid therapy within 3 months, and the use of topical medications for treatment of genital warts within 1 month. Participants were not allowed to take 10 mg/day or more of prednisone or equivalent, tetracycline, vitamin A, or vitamin A&#65293;containing supplements.</P>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2013-05-08 16:12:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Primary endpoint was biopsy-proven progression of LSIL to CIN2/3 or invasive cancer during the duration of the study. 44/56 (78%) assigned to receive isotretinoin completed 20 weeks or had treatment discontinued because of a confirmed endpoint. 8 discontinued before 16 weeks because of toxicity and 4 before 20 weeks by choice without documented toxicity. Eleven developed grade 3 or 4 toxicity during the study; 3 were taking isotretinoin (two had hypertriglyceridemia) and 8 were on the observation arm. 102 completed follow-up. No case of invasive cancer was diagnosed.<BR/>No significant difference was noted in the proportions progressing to CIN2 or CIN3 between treatment and observation arms (P = 0.29), although slightly more participants in the isotretinoin group showed no progression at each time point. Progression was not significantly associated with CD4 levels, but those younger than 30 years of age had a shorter time to progression than those older than 30 years, independent of treatment with isotretinoin (P = 0.046). Regression was difficult to assess because a large number of women were not biopsied and many varied between being biopsy positive and biopsy negative during the study.</P>

<P>Compliance was monitored by pill counts at follow-up visits. No testing of viral load was performed. No significant difference in CD4 counts, smoking, age, or race was noted between the two groups.<BR/>Dropout rate: 78% of the isotretinoin group completed at least 20 weeks or had treatment discontinued because of a confirmed endpoint. 8 discontinued before 16 weeks because of toxicity: 5 dry skin, hair, or eyes; 1 agitation; 1 oral ulcer; and 1 dry eyes and depression. 4 others by choice with no documented toxicity. 102/114 completed follow-up. 6 receiving treatment and 6 on observation failed to return for follow-up. Toxicity was monitored using the Division of AIDS Table for Grading Severity of Adult Adverse Experiences.<BR/>11 developed grade 3 or 4 chemistry abnormalities: 3 on the treatment arm (all occurred late, 2 developed hypertriglyceridemia) and 8 on the observation arm.<BR/>No participants progressed to invasive carcinoma.</P>

<P>All-trans-retinoic acid at 0.16%, 0.28%, or 0.36% or placebo applied to the cervix on an inert sponge and cervical cap for four consecutive days. Questionnaires were completed at baseline visit. Maximum time from cervical biopsy diagnosing dysplasia to delivery of intervention was 12 weeks. All participants underwent a repeat colposcopy by the same provider who did the baseline evaluation, and a biopsy was taken whether the cervix appeared normal or not. All pathology samples were reviewed by a single blinded pathologist. Toxicity was evaluated on days 1 through 5 of treatment and at the week 12 visit.</P>

Mean age, 27.6 years (range, 14-52 years).<BR/>Toxicity monitored on days 1 to 5 of initial treatment and at 12 weeks post completion by participant assessments and clinical and colposcopic evaluations.<BR/>Participant symptoms were self-rated for vaginal burning, vaginal itching, and vaginal discharge on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 = no symptoms and 10 = unbearable). Adverse effects of vaginal discharge and vulvar, vaginal, and cervical erythema were evaluated at each visit by research staff using clinical and colposcopic assessments on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). Local toxicity scores were transformed to yes or no (yes for any report or assessment greater than or equal to one).<BR/>Treatment arm experienced significantly more vulvar burning, itching, and irritation during initial treatment. Local adverse side effects during the maintenance phase were uncommon and mild.</P>
