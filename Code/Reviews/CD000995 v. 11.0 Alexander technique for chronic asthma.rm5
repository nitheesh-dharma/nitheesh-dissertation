<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-10-05 10:49:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During an asthma attack, the airways narrow, causing breathing problems, wheezing and coughing. Asthma can be caused by allergies, pollens, stress or air pollution and can be fatal. The Alexander Technique is a form of therapy involving a series of movements designed to correct posture and bring the body into natural alignment and aid relaxation. The Alexander technique has been used by people with asthma, to try and improve breathing. The review of trials found there was not enough evidence to show the effects of the Alexander Technique in reducing the need to use medication for asthma. More research is needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-05 10:49:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-06 16:54:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Asthma is well-known to be a widespread health problem (data on its prevalence vary between three and six per cent for adults and between eight and twelve per cent in children). While drug treatment can control the symptoms of asthma in most patients, alternative interventions which are effective, low-risk and have long-term benefits would constitute significant advances in asthma management. Reports of respiratory improvements made by those undergoing training in the Alexander technique require evaluation in the context of a systematic review.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-05 10:49:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The technique known as the 'Alexander technique' (AT) was originally developed by an Australian, FM Alexander, in the early years of this century. AT has been defined as "lessons in proprioceptive musculoskeletal education (without exercises)" but can be more simply described as a type of taught therapy involving a series of movements designed to correct posture and bring the body into natural alignment with the object of helping it to function efficiently.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-08-09 11:07:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The chief principle underlying AT can be expressed as: "use affects functioning." By this reasoning, it can also be said that mis-use results in dysfunction. AT sets out to "re-educate" the body to a state of liberated capacity for movement and uninhibited, efficient respiration. Because results of AT training include, in many cases, the decrease of stress and its documented constricting effects on thoracic function, it is argued those who suffer from illnesses which have emotional or stress-related components also stand to gain particular benefits from AT (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drake-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>While AT is a taught discipline and requires practice, it does not involve physical exercise as the term is generally understood. Leading practitioners of AT such as the late Dr Wilfred Barlow have maintained that this is particularly important to remember in the case of sufferers from breathing disorders who emphatically do not require, in his words, "breathing exercises" but instead, "breathing education" (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 1973</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>

<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of the review was to investigate the efficacy of the Alexander technique in the treatment of chronic asthma.</P>

<P>Trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts (please see the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/AIRWAYS/frame.html">Airways Group Module</A> for further details).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-08-09 11:09:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The Alexander technique is well-known amongst performing artists (musicians, singers and actors in particular) throughout most of the developed world. Many such performers practise AT regularly, reportedly in order to enhance voice projection and stamina. Linked to these reported benefits are many anecdotes of improvement amongst performers and non-performers with asthma who find that their symptoms and dependence on medication decreases as they become more proficient in AT (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 1973</LINK>). Clinical literature examining the effects of the Alexander technique on respiratory function, however, is scant.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Austin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Austin 1992</LINK> reported benefit in a group of ten healthy subjects who received 20 private AT lessons at weekly intervals, as against a matched control group who received no treatment and showed no significant changes in respiratory function.<BR/>There was a significant increase in:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the highest forced expiratory flow measured with a peak flow meter (PEF) (9%, p &lt; 0.05)</LI>
<LI>maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) (6%, p &lt; 0.05)</LI>
<LI>maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) (12%, p &lt; 0.04)</LI>
<LI>maximal expiratory mouth pressure (MEP) (9%, p &lt;0.01)</LI>
</OL>
<P>Calls for empirical studies of AT have been made by those with an interest in voice disorders following anecdotal reports of its beneficial effects (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Antoni-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Antoni 1995</LINK>) and these too are suggestive of possible benefits to those who suffer from asthma. Calls for RCTs in the area of pulmonary/respiratory function and other areas have yet to be heard although progress is being made in other areas, e.g. a planned trial in Parkinsons disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 2000</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The currently available evidence is insufficient to assess the potential for Alexander technique in the treatment of asthma. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research on Alexander technique seems justified by both the claims of the practitioners and the popularity of alternative therapies in general, particularly for asthma. Trials should be designed so that standardisation amongst practitioners is quantifiable, perhaps with the assistance of those with responsibility for examination and qualification of AT practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-ATI-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATI 1999</LINK>). Input should also be sought from clinicians whose knowledge reflects current standards of clinical research on asthma. Follow-up is also desirable as it would be important to know whether effects of training, if any are demonstrated, tend to be short-term (i.e. present during the course of instruction alone) or persist following treatment. Measures of cost-effectiveness and quality of life (in the event that the training does enable a reduction in use of medication) should also be planned and evaluated.</P>
