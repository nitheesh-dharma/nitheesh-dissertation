<DESCRIPTION>
<P>We added 11 new trials to the 12 trials that we included in the previous version. Twenty-three trials (628 participants) are now included. We have re-written the Discussion section using standard Cochrane sub-headings. We have expanded the outcomes: previous versions of the review had functional disability, neglect assessments and discharge destination as outcomes. In this update we added a number of secondary outcomes that had been identified as important to stroke survivors. This brings this review into line with other reviews of visual problems after stroke. We have changed the comparisons: for this version of the review we changed the presentation of the statistical comparisons. In particular, we amended the subgroup comparisons of bottom-up and top-down approaches so that analyses included subgroups of types of treatment.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:49:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The benefit of cognitive rehabilitation (therapy) for unilateral spatial neglect, a condition that can affect stroke survivors, is unclear. Unilateral spatial neglect is a condition that reduces a person's ability to look, listen or make movements in one half of their environment. This can affect their ability to carry out many everyday tasks such as eating, reading and getting dressed, and restricts a person's independence. Our review of 23 studies involving 628 participants with stroke found insufficient high quality evidence to tell us the effect of therapy designed for treating neglect. We did find some limited evidence which suggested that such therapy might be helpful, but the quality of this evidence was poor and more research is needed to confirm this finding. People with neglect should continue to receive general stroke rehabilitation services and to have the opportunity to take part in high-quality research.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-24 09:11:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unilateral spatial neglect causes difficulty attending to one side of space. Various rehabilitation interventions have been used but evidence of their benefit is lacking.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:48:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>To assess whether cognitive rehabilitation improves functional independence, neglect (as measured using standardised assessments), destination on discharge, falls, balance, depression/anxiety and quality of life in stroke patients with neglect measured immediately post-intervention and at longer-term follow-up; and to determine which types of interventions are effective and whether cognitive rehabilitation is more effective than standard care or an attention control.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-01-22 16:20:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched June 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2011), EMBASE (1980 to June 2011), CINAHL (1983 to June 2011), PsycINFO (1974 to June 2011), UK National Research Register (June 2011). We handsearched relevant journals (up to 1998), screened reference lists, and tracked citations using SCISEARCH.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:48:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cognitive rehabilitation specifically aimed at spatial neglect. We excluded studies of general stroke rehabilitation and studies with mixed participant groups, unless more than 75% of their sample were stroke patients or separate stroke data were available.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:48:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality. For subgroup analyses, review authors independently categorised the approach underlying the cognitive intervention as either 'top-down' (interventions that encourage awareness of the disability and potential compensatory strategies) or 'bottom-up' (interventions directed at the impairment but not requiring awareness or behavioural change, e.g. wearing prisms or patches).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:49:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We included 23 RCTs with 628 participants (adding 11 new RCTs involving 322 new participants for this update). Only 11 studies were assessed to have adequate allocation concealment, and only four studies to have a low risk of bias in all categories assessed. Most studies measured outcomes using standardised neglect assessments: 15 studies measured effect on activities of daily living (ADL) immediately after the end of the intervention period, but only six reported persisting effects on ADL. One study (30 participants) reported discharge destination and one study (eight participants) reported the number of falls.</P>
<P>Eighteen of the 23 included RCTs compared cognitive rehabilitation with any control intervention (placebo, attention or no treatment). Meta-analyses demonstrated no statistically significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation, compared with control, for persisting effects on either ADL (five studies, 143 participants) or standardised neglect assessments (eight studies, 172 participants), or for immediate effects on ADL (10 studies, 343 participants). In contrast, we found a statistically significant effect in favour of cognitive rehabilitation compared with control, for immediate effects on standardised neglect assessments (16 studies, 437 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.62). However, sensitivity analyses including only studies of high methodological quality removed evidence of a significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Additionally, five of the 23 included RCTs compared one cognitive rehabilitation intervention with another. These included three studies comparing a visual scanning intervention with another cognitive rehabilitation intervention, and two studies (three comparison groups) comparing a visual scanning intervention plus another cognitive rehabilitation intervention with a visual scanning intervention alone. Only two small studies reported a measure of functional disability and there was considerable heterogeneity within these subgroups (I² &gt; 40%) when we pooled standardised neglect assessment data, limiting the ability to draw generalised conclusions.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses exploring the effect of having an attention control demonstrated some evidence of a statistically significant difference between those comparing rehabilitation with attention control and those with another control or no treatment group, for immediate effects on standardised neglect assessments (test for subgroup differences, P = 0.04).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:49:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation interventions for reducing the disabling effects of neglect and increasing independence remains unproven. As a consequence, no rehabilitation approach can be supported or refuted based on current evidence from RCTs. However, there is some very limited evidence that cognitive rehabilitation may have an immediate beneficial effect on tests of neglect. This emerging evidence justifies further clinical trials of cognitive rehabilitation for neglect. However, future studies need to have appropriate high quality methodological design and reporting, to examine persisting effects of treatment and to include an attention control comparator.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-07 16:38:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:49:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Stroke can affect cognitive as well as physical and sensory abilities (<LINK REF="REF-Wade-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1985</LINK>). Cognitive deficits include a disorder of spatial awareness known as unilateral spatial neglect. The most widely quoted definition of neglect is a description of the resulting behavioural disabilities: "fails to report, respond, or orient to novel or meaningful stimuli presented to the side opposite a brain lesion" (<LINK REF="REF-Heilman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heilman 1993</LINK>). This definition does not describe the causal mechanism of neglect but indicates that it is not simply due to sensory or motor defects. Neglect is a disorder which can reduce a person's ability to look, listen or make movements towards one half of their environment. This can also affect their ability to carry out many everyday tasks, such as eating, reading and getting dressed (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1999</LINK>). Stroke may differentially affect our ability to direct our attention in the visual, auditory or tactile modalities. Since different types of neglect can occur, several terms are used in clinical practice, such as visual neglect, motor neglect, hemineglect, and inattention (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1999</LINK>). Although people do sometimes neglect their ipsilesional (same) side, most researchers and clinicians focus on the far more common neglect of contralesional (opposite) side space.</P>
<P>The reported incidence of neglect in stroke patients has varied from as high as 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Massironi-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massironi 1988</LINK>) to as low as 8% (<LINK REF="REF-Sunderland-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sunderland 1987</LINK>). The figures depend on the operational definition, selection criteria for patients and method of assessment employed (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bowen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferro-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferro 1999</LINK>). A previous systematic review found that, in 16 of the 17 studies making the comparison, contralesional neglect occurred more often after right than left hemisphere stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Bowen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowen 1999</LINK>). Cognitive dysfunction, such as neglect, can determine the outcome of rehabilitation by adversely affecting mobility, discharge destination, length of hospital stay, meal preparation and independence in self-care skills (<LINK REF="REF-Barer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barer 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bernspang-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernspang 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neistadt-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neistadt 1993</LINK>). In the light of these functional implications, it is not surprising that the rehabilitation of neglect is an important aim in stroke rehabilitation.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:49:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Cognitive rehabilitation is the collective label for a wide range of therapeutic interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Lincoln-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lincoln 2012</LINK>). These share a common purpose, to reduce the adverse effects that cognitive impairments have on a person&#8217;s ability to perform everyday activities, their social role participation and quality of life. There are two very different approaches known as restitutive and compensatory. Techniques using the restitutive approach aim to alter the underlying cognitive impairment. Compensatory techniques include teaching strategies to make behavioural adjustments. The emphasis in compensatory strategies is on coping with and finding ways of adapting to existing impairments. Restitution approaches are more often used in the early stage of the stroke pathway when plasticity is thought to be greatest, and compensatory strategies are typically used later. However, this is not a hard and fast rule. In most countries cognitive rehabilitation is provided by psychologists and occupational therapists or their assistants, although other professionals are also involved, for example orthopists for prisms.</P>
<P>It is common to categorise neglect interventions as involving either bottom-up or top-down processing (<LINK REF="REF-Parton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parton 2004</LINK>). Top-down approaches aim to train the person to voluntarily compensate for their neglect and require awareness of the disorder. Methods include training in scanning and usually provide feedback (<LINK REF="STD-Pizzamiglio-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pizzamiglio 2004</LINK>). Top-down approaches focus on the level of disability rather than impairment. Bottom-up approaches do not require awareness of the disorder. They aim to modify underlying factors, i.e. to alter the impaired representation of space. Prism-wearing and prism adaptation training are popular recent examples of a bottom-up approach (<LINK REF="STD-Rossetti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rossetti 1998</LINK>). By wearing base-left wedge prisms in spectacles visual space is perturbed to the right making it more likely to be seen. Other examples of bottom-up processing approaches include eye patching and the use of devices to stimulate the neglected side. We included both bottom-up and top-down approaches, and categorised each intervention within this framework.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-06-07 16:38:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The two main reasons for this review are, first, that neglect is a major problem for people with stroke and secondly, there is clinical uncertainty about the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation. Neglect affects long-term outcome. It can impede active participation in stroke rehabilitation programs and decrease independence in activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Jehkonen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jehkonen 2006</LINK>). Several recent reviews have argued that cognitive rehabilitation is effective for people with various cognitive impairments including neglect after a stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jutai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jutai 2003</LINK>) or a traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2009</LINK>). Some of the non-randomised evidence included in these reviews may introduce bias. This updated review aimed to systematically consider the evidence from RCTs on the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation aimed at spatial neglect.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:49:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>To assess whether cognitive rehabilitation improves functional independence, neglect (measured using standardised assessments), destination on discharge, falls, balance, depression/anxiety and quality of life in stroke patients with neglect measured immediately post-intervention and at longer-term follow-up; to determine which types of intervention are effective and whether cognitive rehabilitation is more effective than standard care or an attention control.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2013-05-28 11:28:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the first version of this review we sought all controlled trials in which cognitive rehabilitation was compared with a control treatment. In addition to well-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we considered other studies (such as those described as quasi-random) for inclusion but, if selected, we assigned these a lower methodological quality score. However, in the previous version (2006) and this update, we excluded all non-randomised studies to reduce selection bias. These are listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:49:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>This review was confined to trials that included participants with neglect following stroke. Stroke was confirmed by neurological examination or brain scanning, or both, and neglect by neuropsychological assessment. Thus, we excluded studies that included participants whose deficits were the result of head trauma, brain tumour or any other brain damage unless a subgroup of those with stroke could be identified for which there were separate results, or more than 75% of participants in the sample were stroke patients. We excluded studies of people with general perceptual problems unless a subgroup with neglect could be identified. A separate review has been published on cognitive rehabilitation for people with perceptual problems (<LINK REF="REF-Bowen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowen 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-07 16:38:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>To be included in the review, a clinical trial had to report a comparison between an active treatment group that received one of various cognitive rehabilitation programs for neglect versus a control group that received either an alternative form of treatment or none. Cognitive rehabilitation was broadly defined to include therapy activities designed to directly reduce the level of the neglect impairment or the resulting disability. We excluded drug treatments. Cognitive rehabilitation could include structured therapy sessions, computerised therapy, prescription of aids and modification of the participants' environment as long as these were specific to neglect. The aim was to directly target the neglect rather than to examine whether people with neglect happened to benefit from general rehabilitation services.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:50:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:49:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<OL>
<LI>Ratings on measures of functional disability: we included the following scales: Catherine Bergego Scale, Everyday Neglect Questionnaire, Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living scale, Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Frenchay Activities Index, Rivermead ADL, Edmans EADL, Modified Rankin Scale, Barthel ADL Index, Functional Independence Measure, Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living, and Rehabilitation Activities Profile. When more than one of these scales was reported, we used the scale listed first above. We excluded functional measures designed for a specific study e.g. obstacle avoidance, observation of an ADL task.</LI>
</OL>
<P>For the 2006 update of the review the primary outcome was defined as 'Ratings on measures of functional disability: activities of daily living (ADL) scales: Barthel Index (BI), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Frenchay Activities Index (FAI), or neglect-specific ADL measures'. As this was not a comprehensive list of functional disability measures, we extended the scales listed in order to be more comprehensive and to avoid having to make decisions after the identification of studies. We checked back through the studies included in the 2006 update and this clarification did not lead to any changes to the outcomes included from those studies.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:50:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<OL>
<LI>Performance on standardised neglect assessments: target cancellation (single letter, double letter, line, shape), line bisection. In addition to a conventional subtest score (such as letter cancellation) the behavioural summary score from the Behavioural Inattention Test (BIT) was used when available. In this updated review we removed outcomes of attention and drawing tests to reduce the number of outcomes being reviewed and to concentrate on those most relevant to neglect.</LI>
<LI>Discharge destination: whether a person was discharged to live in their own home or to a care facility was included where available, with deaths before discharge treated as not discharged to their own home.</LI>
<LI>Balance: Berg balance scale, Functional Reach, Get up and go test, Standing Balance test, Step Test or other standardised balance measure. We did not include measures of weight distribution or postural sway during standing, as the relationship between ability to maintain balance and these outcomes is not established.</LI>
<LI>Falls: number of reported falls, Falls Efficacy Scale.</LI>
<LI>Depression/anxiety: e.g. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Beck Depressive Inventory, General Health Questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale.</LI>
<LI>Quality of life and social isolation: EQ5D (Health-related quality of life scale, Quality of Well Being scale, SF36).</LI>
<LI>Adverse events: (any reported adverse events, excluding falls).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The 2006 update of the review only included secondary outcomes (1) and (2). For the 2013 update we extended these to reflect outcomes of importance to people with stroke. No studies had been excluded on the basis of not having suitable outcome measures and we were therefore confident that this change did not require us to repeat any previous searches. We re-appraised all studies included in the 2006 update of the review and extracted data on any of the additional secondary outcomes.</P>

In addition, we searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (1998 to June 2011; <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), EMBASE (1998 to June 2011; <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>), CINAHL (1998 to June 2011; <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>), PsycINFO (1998 to June 2011; <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>), and the National Research Register (June 2011). We developed the search strategies with the help of the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Search Co-ordinator.</LI>
<LI>For the purpose of this and other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Lincoln-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lincoln 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Das-Nair-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das Nair 2007</LINK>), we originally searched simultaneously for trials in four areas of stroke rehabilitation (cognitive rehabilitation, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and treatment for mood disorders) using online computerised bibliographic databases: MEDLINE (1966 to 1998), BIDS EMBASE (1980 to 1998), CINAHL (1983 to 1998), PsycLIT (1974 to 1998) and CLINPSYCH (1980 to November 1994). We conducted these computerised searches using combinations of the following descriptors/key words: stroke/cerebrovascular accidents/neurological disability and randomised controlled/clinical trials/random allocation/double blind method and rehabilitation/remedial therapy/treatment/intervention and cognitive/unilateral neglect/visuospatial/visuoperceptual/memory/attention span/concentration/hemianopia/attentional deficits/activities of daily living/occupational therapy/leisure/dressing/self-care/domiciliary rehabilitation.</LI>
<LI>To ensure that studies not listed in the above databases were not overlooked, in 1999 we handsearched all volumes of the journals listed below. The 1999 handsearch included a broad range of journals as it covered studies in four areas of rehabilitation, only one of which (neglect) was relevant to this specific review. Therefore, for the 2006 update we checked the Master List of journals that is searched by The Cochrane Collaboration (<A HREF="http://www.cochrane.us/masterlist.asp">www.cochrane.us/masterlist.asp</A>). We found that the journals relevant to neglect had been handsearched. The resulting studies would be found from the search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) carried out quarterly by the Cochrane Stroke Group and we did not wish to duplicate effort:</LI>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-06-07 16:23:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The pre-1999 searching and selection activities were carried out simultaneously for four reviews. We carried out the most recent updated searches for this review in 2012.</P>
<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:50:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>For this update one review author (CH or AP) screened the titles of records obtained from searches of the electronic databases and excluded irrelevant papers. Two authors (CH and AB or AP) independently assessed the abstracts of the remaining papers and we obtained the full text of papers that were considered possibly relevant. At least two review authors (NBL, AB for 1999 and 2006 versions; NBL, AB, CH and AP for 2013 version) independently selected studies to be included in this review using the four inclusion criteria (types of trials, participants, interventions and outcome measures). We independently assessed the methodological quality of the studies, with reference to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK>), selected, entered, and cross-checked data for analysis. We resolved disagreements by discussion.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:50:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We extracted study characteristics and outcome data. We recorded the following information: method of participant assignment, adequacy of concealment, adequacy of matching at baseline, description of intervention, sample size, numbers lost to follow-up, types of dependent variable(s), blinding at outcome assessment, reported results and publication details. If these data were not available or unclear from the reports then we contacted the study authors for further information or clarification. We used intention-to-treat analyses where possible. We categorised the type of intervention as either a bottom-up or top-down processing rehabilitation approach; two review authors categorised each intervention independently and resolved any differences through discussion involving another review author.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:51:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>For the 2006 update we assessed all studies for quality of allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessor, and rated those assessed to be at low risk of bias as 'A'. We rated those assessed to be of unclear risk of bias or high risk of bias as 'B'. For this version of the review two review authors independently documented risk of bias for all new studies, classifying each as being at 'high risk', 'low risk' or 'unclear risk' for the following potential biases, using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK>, Chapter 8).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Allocation concealment (selection bias): studies with adequate concealment included those that used either central randomisation at a site remote from the study, computerised allocation in which records were in a locked readable file that could be assessed only after entering participant details, or the drawing of opaque envelopes. Studies with inadequate concealment included those using open list or table of random numbers, open computer systems, or drawing of non-opaque envelopes. Studies with unclear concealment included those with no or inadequate information.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias): adequate masking included studies that stated that a masked (blinded) outcome assessor was used, and did not identify any 'unmasking'. Inadequate blinding included studies that did not use a masked outcome assessor, or where the report clearly identified that 'unmasking' occurred during the study. We documented blinding as unclear if there was no or insufficient information to judge whether or not an outcome assessor was masked.</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias): studies adequately addressing incomplete outcome data either had: no missing outcome data; missing outcome data that were unlikely to be related to true outcome; missing outcome data that were balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups; a reported effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes that were not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size; or missing data that had been imputed using appropriate methods. Studies inadequately addressing incomplete outcome data either had: missing outcome data that were likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; a reported effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size; or as-treated analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation. We documented the addressing of incomplete outcome data as unclear if there was insufficient information to allow us to assess this.</LI>
<LI>Free of systematic differences in baseline characteristics of groups compared: we assessed a study to be at low risk of bias if there were no differences between groups at baseline; at high risk of bias if there were systematic differences in baseline characteristics of the groups; and at unclear of bias if baseline data were not reported, or if it was unclear whether differences were systematic or random.</LI>
<LI>Adjustment for baseline differences in the analyses: we assessed a study to be at low risk of bias if either there were no baseline differences (i.e. adjustment is not required) or if appropriate adjustment for the baseline differences had been computed. We assessed a study to be at high risk of bias if there were baseline differences and no adjustment had been computed. We reported this as unclear if there was insufficient information to allow us to assess this.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For the 2006 version of the review, we only documented information on allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessor. We systematically assessed risk of bias relating to other methodological features in the earlier studies during this update.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:51:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Where a cross-over design was used we only included data from the first treatment period. Where initial participants were randomised but later allocations were non-randomised, we only included the study if we could extract the data on those randomised. If not we excluded the study.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-06-07 16:23:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We treated activities of daily living (ADL) data, such as the Barthel Index (BI), as continuous measures and we requested or calculated the mean and standard deviation (SD) data. We are aware that there is a difference of opinion regarding how to deal with ordinal level ADL scales. We have treated them as interval level measures, as in practice it makes relatively little difference. This is supported by a study of parametric versus nonparametric methods in stroke trials, which recommended that means and SDs should be reported (<LINK REF="REF-Song-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2005</LINK>). We analysed outcomes as the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We used random-effects models.</P>
<P>For all analyses of continuous data, we entered data so that a higher score represented a favourable outcome, and the right label of the graph favoured the experimental group. For some of the neglect assessments studies reported outcomes for which a low score was better; for example for 'number of errors' in cancellation tests and 'line bisection'. We multiplied these outcomes, for which a low score was better, by -1 in order to pool them with other neglect assessments for which the direction of effect was opposite.</P>
<P>We used odds ratios (ORs) for 'discharge destination', comparing the numbers discharged to their own homes. We treated deaths before discharge as 'not discharged to their own home'. In this way those discharged home were compared with those not discharged home. We calculated ORs for the outcome 'falls', comparing the number of events (falls) within each group.</P>
<P>We used the Cochrane Review Manager 5.1 software for all analyses (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-10-21 10:37:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We compared a rehabilitation approach with any other control for both immediate and persisting effects. The controls used were standard care, no treatment or 'attention control' (i.e. where the control group were given extra hours of contact in addition to their standard care to ensure the experimental and control groups had similar amounts of attention from a therapist). We also compared alternative neglect therapies.</P>

<P>We planned to carry out subgroup analysis to explore the effect of comparison with an attention control, compared with comparison with no treatment or standard care.</P>
<P>In this update we also added a subgroup comparison of bottom-up or top-down interventions (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of the intervention</LINK>). We categorised bottom-up approaches as either prisms, patching or other interventions, and top-down approaches as either feedback or cueing, visual scanning training or mental imagery.</P>

<P>The results of this review are based on 23 studies involving 628 participants.</P>
<P>In the 2006 version of this review we included 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (306 participants). We did not document details of the searching process and identification of these RCTs. Details of 22 studies that we excluded during the 2006 update, when we removed quasi-randomised trials, are documented as excluded studies.</P>
<P>For the 2006 version, we identified one RCT of spatial neglect and placed it in 'Studies awaiting assessment' (<LINK REF="STD-Cubelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cubelli 1993</LINK>). We have subsequently been unable to get further information relating to this study, and have therefore moved it to excluded studies. In the 2006 version, we listed three ongoing RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Kerkhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kerkhoff 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossetti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rossetti 2005</LINK>; Turton 2005). The latter has been completed and entered into this update as <LINK REF="STD-Turton-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Turton 2010</LINK> (replacing Turton 2005). Multiple publications by Kerkhoff made it difficult to identify which publication corresponded with the <LINK REF="STD-Kerkhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kerkhoff 2005</LINK> study that had been identified through personal communication in 2006. However, we identified a report published in 2006 that we have assumed refers to the previously ongoing study. This study did not randomly allocate participants to groups and we have therefore excluded <LINK REF="STD-Kerkhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kerkhoff 2005</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> for more information). We have not been able to gain further information for <LINK REF="STD-Rossetti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rossetti 2005</LINK> and have therefore left this as an ongoing study. We did not identify any additional ongoing trials for this update.</P>
<P>For this update, we identified 11 additional RCTs. One review author (CH or AP) considered 4875 titles and excluded 4402 obviously irrelevant studies, leaving 473 for consideration. Two review authors (CH, AB or AP) applied selection criteria to these 473 abstracts and classified 63 as possibly relevant. Two review authors (CH, AB or AP) assessed the full papers of these 63 abstracts, leading to the inclusion of 11 RCTs. There was insufficient information for four studies: we have categorised these as studies awaiting classification. We added details of 12 of the 48 excluded studies to the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table; the remainder were very obviously not relevant to this review. We did not document details of searches prior to this update, but <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> illustrates the results of the 2012 searches, added to the 12 studies included in 2006.</P>

<P>All studies were of people with neglect after stroke. However, some studies reported that participants also had visual sensory deficits. Complete hemianopia was present in three of the six participants in the experimental group and one of six participants in the control group in <LINK REF="STD-Luukkainen_x002d_Markkula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luukkainen-Markkula 2009</LINK>, and in three out of 18 participants in the experimental group and in three of the 20 participants in the control group in <LINK REF="STD-Mizuno-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mizuno 2011</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1990</LINK> some of the participants may have had visual sensory deficits (visual field defects or scanning problems) as well as or instead of neglect: there were 12 out of 18 participants with a visual sensory deficit in the experimental group and 15 of 21 participants in the control group.</P>

In some cases it was not clear where participants were recruited, and whether or not they were inpatients (<LINK REF="STD-Ferreira-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ferreira 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerkhoff-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Kerkhoff 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroder-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schroder 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Welfringer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Welfringer 2011</LINK>).

Three studies explicitly mentioned an age exclusion criterion: <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 2002</LINK> excluded participants who were aged over 80 years, <LINK REF="STD-Mizuno-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mizuno 2011</LINK> only included participants aged between 41 and 89 years, and <LINK REF="STD-Welfringer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Welfringer 2011</LINK> only included participants aged between 20 and 75 years. Many studies excluded participants on the basis of previous dementia or stroke, or current cognitive or communication problems, on the grounds that these would adversely affect responsiveness to therapy. In one study the neglect data were extracted from a larger study (<LINK REF="STD-Edmans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Edmans 2000</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions studied</HEADING>
<P>A broad range of interventions were investigated (for full details see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). For 21 of the 23 included studies, the experimental intervention could be classified as either being a top-down (12) or bottom-up (9) rehabilitation approach. The remaining two were both classified as being a mix of top-down and bottom-up approaches.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Top-down approaches</HEADING>
<P>Twelve studies investigated the effect of top-down approaches to rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Cherney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cherney 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cottam-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cottam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edmans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Edmans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fanthome-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fanthome 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferreira-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ferreira 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerkhoff-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Kerkhoff 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luukkainen_x002d_Markkula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luukkainen-Markkula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rusconi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rusconi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberg-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberg 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Welfringer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Welfringer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiart-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wiart 1997</LINK>). The intervention included some sort of visual scanning training in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cherney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cherney 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cottam-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cottam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferreira-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ferreira 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerkhoff-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Kerkhoff 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luukkainen_x002d_Markkula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luukkainen-Markkula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberg-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberg 1977</LINK>); a form of feedback or cueing in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Edmans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Edmans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fanthome-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fanthome 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rusconi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rusconi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiart-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wiart 1997</LINK>); and mental practice or imagery in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ferreira-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ferreira 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Welfringer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Welfringer 2011</LINK>). Some approaches involved multiple strategies, for example in <LINK REF="STD-Wiart-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wiart 1997</LINK> a therapist participated, actively guiding and giving feedback whilst the participant used the fitted pointer. <LINK REF="STD-Fanthome-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fanthome 1995</LINK> used specially adapted glasses which gave auditory feedback if the participant failed to scan the neglected side; <LINK REF="STD-Wiart-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wiart 1997</LINK> fitted participants with a 'vest' with a metal pointer attached. Some interventions involved training with a therapist. For example, various scanning tasks were used to demonstrate the participant's deficit and show how a strategy could improve performance (<LINK REF="STD-Cherney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cherney 2002</LINK>). A therapist was present in both arms of the <LINK REF="STD-Rusconi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rusconi 2002</LINK> study but only provided cueing and feedback in the 'experimental' arm. This latter study is an example of cognitive rehabilitation versus an attention control, as participants in both arms received equal amounts of time/attention from a therapist. What differed was the nature of the therapy, i.e. whether or not cueing and feedback were provided by the therapist. In two studies both randomised treatment groups received a top-down approach; <LINK REF="STD-Ferreira-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ferreira 2011</LINK> compared one group receiving a visual scanning intervention with another receiving mental practice, and <LINK REF="STD-Kerkhoff-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Kerkhoff 2012a</LINK> compared a group receiving optokinetic stimulation with another receiving standard visual scanning training. Both these studies were classified as comparisons of one cognitive rehabilitation approach versus another.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Bottom-up approaches</HEADING>
<P>Ten studies investigated the effect of bottom-up approaches to rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Fong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalra-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kalra 1997</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Luukkainen_x002d_Markkula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luukkainen-Markkula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mizuno-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mizuno 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nys-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nys 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turton-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Turton 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeloni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeloni 2002</LINK>). Four of these studies investigated fitting prisms to spectacles in order to shift the image towards the neglected side (<LINK REF="STD-Mizuno-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mizuno 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nys-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nys 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turton-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Turton 2010</LINK>). Three studies investigated the effect of half-field eye patching, using glasses or goggles (<LINK REF="STD-Fong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeloni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeloni 2002</LINK>). One study investigated a therapy-directed intervention comprising spatio-motor cueing aimed at integrating attention and limb movement (<LINK REF="STD-Kalra-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kalra 1997</LINK>), and another investigated an 'arm-activation' intervention where the affected limb performed active arm exercises in the neglected part of space (<LINK REF="STD-Luukkainen_x002d_Markkula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luukkainen-Markkula 2009</LINK>). The principle behind these approaches is that movements of the affected limb in the neglected part of space will result in improvements in attention skills and appreciation of spatial relationships on the affected side. <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 2002</LINK> provided a 'limb activation device' fitted to the wrist, leg or shoulder.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mixed top-down and bottom-up approaches</HEADING>
<P>Two of the 23 studies investigated interventions that comprised both top-down and bottom-up approaches to rehabilitation. <LINK REF="STD-Polanowska-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Polanowska 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schroder-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schroder 2008</LINK> both compared a visual scanning intervention (a top-down approach) with a visual scanning intervention combined with a type of electrical stimulation (a bottom-up approach). Both studies compared one cognitive rehabilitation approach with another. The group receiving the additional electrical stimulation was labelled the experimental group and the control was the group receiving visual scanning only (or visual scanning plus placebo electrical stimulation). <LINK REF="STD-Schroder-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schroder 2008</LINK> included two experimental groups: one receiving visual scanning plus transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) and one receiving visual scanning plus optokinetic stimulation (OKS). For analysis we have entered these as two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Schroder-2008-TENS" TYPE="STUDY">Schroder 2008 TENS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schroder-2008-OKS" TYPE="STUDY">Schroder 2008 OKS</LINK>) and have entered half the control group within each 'study'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparison interventions</HEADING>
<P>We classified 18 of the 23 studies as having a comparison of cognitive rehabilitation versus any other control (<LINK REF="STD-Cherney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cherney 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cottam-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cottam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edmans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Edmans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fanthome-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fanthome 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalra-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kalra 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mizuno-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mizuno 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nys-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nys 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rusconi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rusconi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turton-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Turton 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberg-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberg 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Welfringer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Welfringer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiart-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wiart 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeloni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeloni 2002</LINK>). Eleven of these 18 studies compared an experimental intervention with an attention control (<LINK REF="STD-Cherney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cherney 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edmans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Edmans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalra-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kalra 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mizuno-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mizuno 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nys-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nys 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rusconi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rusconi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turton-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Turton 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiart-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wiart 1997</LINK>). The remaining seven compared an experimental treatment with no treatment or standard care (<LINK REF="STD-Cottam-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cottam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fanthome-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fanthome 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberg-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberg 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Welfringer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Welfringer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeloni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeloni 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies compared two different active treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Ferreira-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ferreira 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerkhoff-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Kerkhoff 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luukkainen_x002d_Markkula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luukkainen-Markkula 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polanowska-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Polanowska 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroder-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schroder 2008</LINK>). We did consider that the 'arm-activation' intervention investigated by <LINK REF="STD-Luukkainen_x002d_Markkula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luukkainen-Markkula 2009</LINK> could have been classified as an attention control. However, the dose of intervention given to this group was not the same as the dose given to the visual scanning intervention group (20 to 30 hours for the arm activation group and 10 hours for the visual scanning group). Furthermore, this intervention was considered to be based on principles of spatio-motor cueing, where the affected limb is moved within the neglected part of space and this comparison intervention was therefore classified as a bottom-up approach, and <LINK REF="STD-Luukkainen_x002d_Markkula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luukkainen-Markkula 2009</LINK> categorised as comparing one active cognitive rehabilitation intervention with another active cognitive rehabilitation intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose of interventions</HEADING>
<P>The nature of the interventions was usually well described, as were the number, frequency and duration of therapy sessions. The number of sessions varied from four (<LINK REF="STD-Nys-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nys 2008</LINK>) to 40 (<LINK REF="STD-Rusconi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rusconi 2002</LINK>) over a duration of one to 12 weeks. Sessions ranged from daily to once a week and lasted from 30 to 75 minutes each. The <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1990</LINK> study provided the highest 'dose' of rehabilitation as participants in the experimental arm wore their prisms during all daytime activities for four weeks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen of the 23 included studies measured functional disability during activities of daily living, the primary outcome of interest. Five reported the Barthel Index (BI) (<LINK REF="STD-Edmans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Edmans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalra-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kalra 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rusconi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rusconi 2002</LINK>); four the Functional Indepedence Measure (FIM) (<LINK REF="STD-Ferreira-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ferreira 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tsang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiart-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wiart 1997</LINK>) and one the Catherine Bergego scale (<LINK REF="STD-Turton-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Turton 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mizuno-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mizuno 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Luukkainen_x002d_Markkula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luukkainen-Markkula 2009</LINK> assessed both the Catherine Bergego Scale and FIM; we used data for the Catherine Bergego Scale within meta-analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Nys-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nys 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Polanowska-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Polanowska 2009</LINK> stated that the BI was administered but no useable data were provided. Similarly, one study used the Frenchay Activities Index but no data were available (<LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only six studies reported ADL outcomes at follow-up (persisting effects) (<LINK REF="STD-Ferreira-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ferreira 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fong-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mizuno-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mizuno 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turton-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Turton 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiart-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wiart 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mizuno-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mizuno 2011</LINK> recorded follow-up at the time of hospital discharge, rather than at a set time following the end of the intervention.</P>
<P>Twenty-two of the 23 included studies (all except <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 2002</LINK>) reported a standardised assessment of neglect. One study reported discharge destination (<LINK REF="STD-Kalra-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kalra 1997</LINK>). In addition, one study reported that the Beck Depression Inventory was administered, but no data were provided post-intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Luukkainen_x002d_Markkula-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Luukkainen-Markkula 2009</LINK>); and one study reported the frequency of falls during the study period (<LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1990</LINK>).

<P>The original version of this review included 22 studies that were quasi-randomised: these were removed from the review in the 2006 update and were listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table.

Thus, we have included 18 studies in comparisons of a cognitive rehabilitation approach versus any control, and have included five studies in a comparison of one cognitive rehabilitation approach versus another.</P>
<P>For the comparisons of a cognitive rehabilitation approach versus any control we pooled data within analyses of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>measures of functional disability immediately after the end of rehabilitation or on discharge (10 studies, 343 participants);</LI>
<LI>measures of functional disability persisting over time (five studies, 143 participants);</LI>
<LI>standardised neglect assessments immediately after the end of rehabilitation or on discharge (16 studies, 437 participants);</LI>
<LI>standardised neglect assessments persisting over time (eight studies, 172 participants).</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each of these comparisons and outcomes we also completed various subgroup analyses; for example for the immediate effect on measures of functional disability we explored the type of control group (attention control or other/no-treatment control). We also explored the type of rehabilitation approach (bottom-up or top-down) and the various types of bottom-up and top-down interventions. We completed sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of studies with adequate allocation concealment and adequate blinding only.</P>
<P>We included data for two additional outcomes within the comparison of cognitive rehabilitation versus any control: immediate effect. These were discharge destination (one study, 50 participants) and frequency of falls (one study, 39 participants).</P>
<P>For the comparison of one cognitive rehabilitation approach versus another we combined data within analyses of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>measures of functional disability immediately after the end of rehabilitation or on discharge (two studies, 21 participants);</LI>
<LI>measures of functional disability persisting over time (two studies, 22 participants);</LI>
<LI>standardised neglect assessments immediately after the end of rehabilitation or on discharge (five studies (six comparisons), 98 participants);</LI>
<LI>standardised neglect assessments persisting over time (four studies (five comparisons), 86 participants).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We calculated a standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model for all comparisons and outcomes, with the exception of discharge destination and frequency of falls when we calculated an odds ratio (OR).</P>

<P>All except one of the 23 included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Robertson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 2002</LINK>) provided data on standardised tests of neglect that were suitable for inclusion, although there was no one measure common to all studies and some used more than one measure. We used a pre-specified hierarchical system to select one neglect test outcome from each study. Thus 19 of the 20 studies comparing cognitive rehabilitation versus any control and all three studies comparing one cognitive rehabilitation approach with another have data pooled in meta-analyses.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:55:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>In this updated version of the review, we included 11 new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) bringing the total to 23 trials (628 participants).</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:55:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>A summary of the results of the key analyses is shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Meta-analyses demonstrated no statistically significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation compared with control for persisting effects on measures of functional disability (five studies, 143 participants) or standardised neglect assessments (eight studies, 172 participants), or for immediate effects on activities of daily living (ADL) (10 studies, 343 participants). In contrast, we found a statistically significant effect in favour of cognitive rehabilitation compared with control for immediate effects on standardised neglect assessments (16 studies, 437 participants). However, sensitivity analyses (including only studies of high methodological quality) removed evidence of a significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation. Thus, while the studies included within this review appear to provide some evidence of an immediate effect of cognitive rehabilitation standardised neglect assessments, this finding is not sustained when only studies of the highest quality are examined.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses exploring the effect of having an attention control (as opposed to a control that did not equalise the time participants spent with a therapist) demonstrated that there was some evidence of a statistically significant difference between the subgroup comparing cognitive rehabilitation with attention control and the subgroup comparing cognitive rehabilitation with another control or a no-treatment group (i.e. for immediate effects on measures of neglect). This indicates that part of the effect of these interventions could be the time spent with the therapist, and demonstrates the importance of attention control groups within trials of therapist-led interventions.</P>
<P>In addition to the studies comparing bottom-up and top-down cognitive rehabilitation approaches each against a control, we identified five studies comparing one cognitive rehabilitation intervention with another. These included three studies comparing a visual scanning intervention with another cognitive rehabilitation intervention, and two studies (three comparison groups) comparing a visual scanning intervention plus another cognitive rehabilitation intervention with a visual scanning intervention alone. Only two small studies reported a measure of functional disability and there was considerable heterogeneity within these subgroups (I² &gt; 40%) when we pooled standardised neglect assessment data, limiting our ability to draw generalised conclusions.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Key findings from this updated review</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>23 RCTs (628 participants) evaluated a range of cognitive rehabilitation interventions for people with neglect after stroke. Most studies measured outcomes using standardised neglect assessments. Many reported immediate effects on ADL, but few reported persisting effects on ADL. Other meaningful outcomes such as discharge destination, falls, mood, quality of life or adverse events were rarely or never reported.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Methodological quality was generally poor or poorly described, and sample sizes small. Interventions were generally well-described and trialists were helpful in providing additional unpublished methodological details.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>There was some limited evidence that cognitive rehabilitation may have an immediate effect on neglect impairment. However, there was considerable heterogeneity and evidence that this effect was not sustained when studies with high risk of bias were removed.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>There was some evidence of subgroup differences between studies with and without an attention control group, highlighting the need for attention control in rehabilitation research.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Despite 23 completed studies, there is still insufficient evidence to draw generalised conclusions about the effect of cognitive rehabilitation interventions on functional ability in ADL or on standardised neglect assessments. This is largely because adequately powered, appropriately designed trials do not yet exist. Further research must ensure low risk of bias, evaluate persisting effects on ADL measures and ideally include an attention control.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Patients' and carers' views on the acceptability of interventions and on appropriate outcome measurement were strikingly absent from the literature.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods</HEADING>
<P>Both included and excluded study authors were helpful in providing unpublished data. This review therefore presents a considerable amount of unpublished data and previously unpublished clarification of the methods used by the original authors. In contrast to the problems of methodological reporting, the reporting quality of the rehabilitation approach used has generally improved. This enabled us to add comparisons of the two main theoretical approaches to cognitive rehabilitation, bottom-up and top-down.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Almost all participants in the included studies had right hemisphere stroke, and the majority of the studies were completed in inpatient settings. It is, therefore, appropriate only to generalise from the results of these studies to the population of inpatients with neglect following right hemisphere stroke. Rehabilitation for people with long-term persisting neglect may be different for those in the earlier stages of recovery.</P>
<P>Studies generally had small sample sizes, limiting our ability to make generalisations. We observed no trends in the sample size over years, with the majority failing to address issues of statistical power. The available studies should provide sufficient data to enable power calculations for future studies, and we urge researchers to design appropriately powered studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The included studies investigated a variety of bottom-up and top-down rehabilitation interventions and some may challenge our treatment of them as a single entity. However, this review was designed to establish whether cognitive rehabilitation interventions were more beneficial than control, and to that end pooling the studies was appropriate. We also carried out subgroup comparisons according to mode of intervention (bottom-up or top-down) and subdivided into specific treatments (e.g. visual scanning, prisms, patching). Although these studies differed in the number, frequency and duration of therapy sessions, these were generally well-described and the interventions were similar, providing evidence that is applicable to clinical settings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons</HEADING>
<P>Eleven of the 23 included studies had an attention control group, and six had either a no-treatment or a standard care control. These comparisons are appropriate to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation, providing results that should be generalisable. Our subgroup analyses comparing studies with and without an attention control group provided some evidence of a significant difference between these subgroups for immediate effect on neglect, demonstrating the importance of attention control groups for future trials of cognitive rehabilitation interventions.</P>
<P>Five of the included studies compared two cognitive rehabilitation approaches. Considerable heterogeneity and variations in the approaches studied make it difficult to draw generalised conclusions from these studies. Further research is clearly required to identify the relative effectiveness of different cognitive rehabilitation approaches.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The majority (15 out of 23) of studies reported our primary outcome of interest, a measure of functional disability during activities of daily living, but only six reported these outcomes at follow-up. This lack of follow-up data on functional disability limited our ability to determine the persistence or maintenance of functional recovery.</P>
<P>Almost all (22 out of 23) of the studies reported a standardised neglect assessment. In previous versions of this review, we extracted and analysed all reported neglect assessments separately. However, for this update, we decided it was more clinically relevant to extract results of only one neglect assessment from each study, according to a pre-defined hierarchy, and to combine these assessments in order to determine a pooled estimate of effect on neglect.</P>
<P>There were very few data on other outcomes, such as discharge destination, falls or depression. These are known to be of importance to stroke survivors and including these in future research would improve the completeness of the evidence base.</P>

<P>The method of randomisation was generally poorly described and the published papers were often not sufficiently detailed to determine whether allocation concealment was adequate. We assessed six of the included studies to be at high risk of bias due to inadequate allocation concealment, and there was insufficient information for a further six studies. We assessed the majority of the studies (14 out of 23) to have adequately blinded outcome assessment, although three studies did not, and six failed to provide this information.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:55:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>As the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for reducing the disabling effects of neglect and increasing independence remains unproven, no rehabilitation approach can be supported or refuted from current randomised controlled trials. However, there is some very limited evidence that cognitive rehabilitation may have an immediate effect on performance of tests of neglect. Until robust evidence is available, clinical practice should follow national clinical guidelines and clinicians are strongly encouraged to participate in high quality trials. People with neglect should continue to receive general stroke rehabilitation services and to have the opportunity to take part in high quality research.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-07 15:55:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>There is sufficiently compelling evidence to encourage further trials of cognitive rehabilitation for neglect. However, future studies need to improve on methodological and reporting issues and should describe the different types of neglect. Key procedural aspects, such as randomisation, concealment, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of assessors, must be sufficiently described. In fact the process of random allocation appears to be misunderstood. We found several studies that were described as randomised but which had instead used alternate allocation or other methods that risked selection bias. Trialists are referred to the <LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK> for a description of acceptable methods of randomisation. Concealment and blinding appear to be confused with each other but again are well described in the <LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK>. By its nature, cognitive rehabilitation is likely to be restricted to single-blind trials (of outcome assessors) as blinding of participants and therapists is not usually achievable. Cross-over trials are not appropriate for cognitive rehabilitation as the effects of one approach may contaminate the next. As rehabilitation aims to promote independence and the maintenance of treatment effects it is not logical to expect the 'washout' effect that is possible with some drug therapies.</P>
<P>Furthermore, trials need to have adequate statistical power to detect a clinically meaningful difference. Power was very rarely mentioned in neglect trials and the small sample sizes used were unlikely to be adequate. Sample specification and the description of selection methods could also be improved. Neglect is a heterogeneous condition and it is unlikely that a single rehabilitation approach is appropriate for all types and severities. Future trials should provide adequate sample description, theoretical justification, and consider using stratified randomisation to avoid imbalance of any factors likely to confound the trial. Future studies must avoid using non-random allocation methods (such as matching) as this risks introducing bias. Trials should assess both functional activities of daily living and neglect at a follow-up assessment (i.e. persisting effects) as the maintenance of function is of key importance. Trialists should also consider other outcomes that are of importance to stroke survivors, including falls and quality of life. Part of the effect of therapist-led interventions may well be the time spent with a therapist and future trials should include an attention control.</P>
<P>There is scope for both pragmatic and explanatory RCTs. Explanatory trials provide evidence on efficacy, examining whether a single rehabilitation approach (such as prism adaptation) can work in an optimum situation. These typically involve more homogeneous samples with little co-morbidity, treated by research therapists with protected time in a controlled environment. There is also a need for pragmatic RCTs to provide evidence on effectiveness and, ideally, cost effectiveness of rehabilitation in a realistic clinical setting. Finally, completeness of follow-up and intention-to-treat analysis are necessary. Previous analyses tended to be per protocol and therefore do not indicate the acceptability of rehabilitation to service users. A high drop-out rate may be an important indication of effectiveness and future neglect trialists are recommended to consult the <LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK> for a good discussion of intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>This review is ongoing and the authors would be grateful to receive information on ongoing studies for a future update.</P>

<P>The broader study of perceptual problems completed the following measures by different assessors immediately after the 6 weeks treatment: an independent blinded assessor completed the BI, Edmans ADL Scale, and RPAB. This assessor completed the ADL scales following interviews with unblinded nursing staff. The unblinded ward OT also completed the BI and Edmans ADL Scale. An unblinded physiotherapist completed the RMA gross motor score.

<P>Electrical somatosensory stimulation of the left hand combined with conventional visual scanning training, 1 month duration of 20 session of 45 minutes duration each, 5 days per week. This stimulation lasted for the first 30 of the 45 minutes. Electrical stimulation was provided by 2 electrodes on the hand giving a maximum intensity of 15 mA. Visual scanning used 2 programs from RehaCom computerised system to get active purposeful exploration of visual field (1. saccadic training - seek stimuli within detailed background, 2. attention and concentration - detected and identify stimuli then seek their counterpart on the opposite side within a detailed background). Visual scanning also used some paper and pencil tasks to improve scanning when reading and writing; drawing and copying; analysing form and content of complex visual  stimuli.

<P>Postulated mechanism of action: visual scanning training aims to remind and motivate participants to scan to the left to build the habit of voluntarily scanning their neglected space. Requires awareness by the participant which is not always present. Hence the use of passive (non-volitional)  physiological approaches such as sensory stimulation. Assumes manipulated sensory inputs are linked to auto levels of orientation behaviour. But effects seem transitory so this study attempts to combine active training of visual scanning with passive stimulation to enhance activation of right hemisphere attention system and improve visual exploration of extra-personal space</P>
<P>All participants received visual scanning training - the only difference was the electrical stimulation</P>
<P>Authors state in the paper that 11 participants reported a tingling sensation during a trial electrostimulation period. During the study itself, however, only 1 participant noted such a sensation; afterwards it was noted this person was in the sham group</P>

<P>Clarification of randomisation procedure sought but not obtained, and unlikely to be given the age of this article. The timescale of publication (and a statement in the results) suggests the participants in this study were not in the Weinberg 1977 study; however, this has not been confirmed by the authors. On the other hand the 1979 paper does not explicitly mention 'neglect' and may instead be a trial of visual perception. Given the amount of uncertainty about this study's fit to the inclusion criteria, inability to obtain confirmation and clarification about this old study, lack of detail on randomisation and concern to avoid duplicating data by including this and the 1977 article we decided to exclude the 1979 article from this version of the review.</P>

<P>Personal communication with author: "The method of randomization was carried out as follows: A clerk of the rehabilitation ward offered a pair of brown envelopes to an entering patient. One envelope included the AA group and the other envelope contained the VS group. The first patient picked one of the envelopes and the following patient entering the study was randomized automatically into the other group. This arrangement of paired randomization was necessary for the resources of the ward." Consequently the allocation of the second patient would be known to researchers</P>
