<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Improving self-esteem may help to prevent the development of psychological and behavioural problems which are common in children and adolescents. Strong evidence exists for the benefits of exercise on physical health, but evidence for the effects of exercise on mental health is scarce. This review of trials suggests that exercise has positive short-term effects on self-esteem in children and young people, and concludes that exercise may be an important measure in improving children's self-esteem. However, the reviewers note that the trials included in the review were small-scale, and recognise the need for further well-designed research in this area.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Psychological and behavioural problems in children and adolescents are common, and improving self-esteem may help to prevent the development of such problems. There is strong evidence for the positive physical health outcomes of exercise, but the evidence of exercise on mental health is scarce.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if exercise alone or exercise as part of a comprehensive intervention can improve self-esteem among children and young people.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Computerised searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL), CINAHL, PsycINFO and ERIC were undertaken and reference lists from relevant articles were scanned. Relevant studies were also traced by contacting authors. Dates of most recent searches: May 2003 in (CENTRAL), all others: January 2002.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials where the study population consisted of children and young people aged from 3 to 20 years, in which one intervention arm was gross motor activity for more than four weeks and the outcome measure was self-esteem.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to collect missing data or for clarification when necessary.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-three trials with a total of 1821 children and young people were included. Generally, the trials were small, and only one was assessed to have a low risk of bias. Thirteen trials compared exercise alone with no intervention. Eight were included in the meta-analysis, and overall the results were heteregeneous. One study with a low risk of bias showed a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 1.33 (95% CI 0.43 to 2.23), while the SMD's for the three studies with a moderate risk of bias and the four studies with a high risk of bias was 0.21 (95% CI -0.17 to 0.59) and 0.57 (95% CI 0.11 to 1.04), respectively. Twelve trials compared exercise as part of a comprehensive programme with no intervention. Only four provided data sufficient to calculate overall effects, and the results indicate a moderate short-term difference in self-esteem in favour of the intervention [SMD 0.51 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.88)].</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The results indicate that exercise has positive short-term effects on self-esteem in children and young people. Since there are no known negative effects of exercise and many positive effects on physical health, exercise may be an important measure in improving children's self-esteem. <BR/>These conclusions are based on several small low-quality trials.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-13 04:10:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Epidemiological studies using well-validated instruments have shown prevalence rates of psychological and behavioural problems in children and adolescents at levels between 10 and 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Sonuga_x002d_Barke-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonuga-Barke 1997</LINK>). These instruments have cut-off points set at levels that identify problems affecting the child's and/or the family's daily function. The data suggest that up to one-third of these children (i.e. 4-7% of the total child population) are considered to be in need of psychological treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Prior-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prior 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>The question of how to prevent psychological problems in children and young people has been of major interest for several years (<LINK REF="REF-Caplan-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caplan 1964</LINK>). Efforts have mainly been directed towards managing aspects of risk, but resilience research (<LINK REF="REF-Garmezy-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garmezy 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haggerty-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haggerty 1996</LINK>) has led to an increasing awareness of positive factors in the environment, social relations and individuals that protect against the development of problems. The negative effects of risk factors seem to be reduced or neutralised through confidence in one's own sense of personal value and through better mechanisms for coping with psychological stress. Among individual qualities, self-concept is one of the indicators given most attention. </P>
<P>Self-concept is our perception of self, and considerable research has identified several areas of importance: academic, social, emotional and physical self-concept (<LINK REF="REF-Harter-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harter-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harter 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sonstroem-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonstroem 1988</LINK>). Self-esteem is the value we place on our self. The two terms self-concept and self-esteem are often used synonymously, although self-esteem is actually measured in the trials. Therefore self-esteem is the term used in this review. </P>
<P>There is strong evidence for positive physical health outcomes of living a physically active life (<LINK REF="REF-Blair-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pate-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pate 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Erikssen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erikssen 1998</LINK>). Since the 1970s, there has also been an increasing body of research on psychological health outcomes of physical activity, and the results indicate positive effects for adults (<LINK REF="REF-Bouchard-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouchard 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fox-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1992</LINK>). Studies and reviews indicate a similar positive effect of physical activity on depression, anxiety, and behavioural problems like hyperactivity and conduct problems in children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Biddle-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biddle 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Calfas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calfas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mutrie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mutrie 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>The effect of physical activity on self-esteem in children has also been investigated, and one meta-analysis concluded that directed play or/and physical education programmes contributed to the development of self-esteem in elementary school-age children (<LINK REF="REF-Gruber-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruber 1986</LINK>). This and other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Calfas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calfas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mutrie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mutrie 1998</LINK>) have not been updated since initial publication. Other narrative reviews in which the effects of exercise on self-esteem were examined have included children as part of a wider investigation of links between exercise and self-esteem (<LINK REF="REF-Spence-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spence 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fox-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 2000</LINK>). Given the existence of new evidence, and in the light of a possible reduction in children's physical activity/physical performance over recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Ekeland-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekeland 1999</LINK>), there is a need for an updated review of the effectiveness of exercise-based interventions in promoting self-esteem and related concepts.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if exercise interventions can improve self-esteem among children and young people.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All relevant randomised controlled trials and "quasi-randomised" trials, e.g. those that use alternate allocation, date of birth, etc.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Children aged from 3 years to young people up to 20 years of age. <BR/>Trials which also included children and young people with psychotic or borderline conditions, autism, physical handicap, eating disorders and chronic somatic/physical diseases were not included.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The interventions included gross motor, energetic activity, for example, running, swimming, ball games and out-door play of moderate to high intensity, or strength training, in contrast to "ordinary" physical activity (for example, routine physical education (PE) classes, walking to school or play-time activities of low intensity). The minimum duration of the intervention had to be 4 weeks. The control group may be children receiving no intervention or children on a waiting list. "No intervention" arms could include children engaged in ordinary physical activity (which may be statutorily required, e.g. routine PE classes) but who are not otherwise engaged in organised gross motor, energetic activity.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>All measurements of children's self-esteem.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>This review was prepared at the same time as two associated Cochrane reviews with the preliminary titles: "Exercise-based interventions in treatment of aggression and behaviour problems in children and young people" and "Exercise-based interventions in treatment of depression and anxiety in children and young people". Searching was conducted simultaneously for all three reviews. </P>
<P>Searching was done using the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) (Issue 2,2003), MEDLINE (1966-2002), EMBASE(1982-2002), CINAHL (1982-2002), PsycINFO (1887-2002) and ERIC (1965-2002). The authors of included studies were contacted, and manual searches were carried out in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (1998-2002) to identify randomised controlled trials. </P>
<P>The search strategy below was used to search the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and modified as necessary to search the other databases mentioned: <BR/>CHILD*:ME <BR/>CHILD* <BR/>TEEN* <BR/>(YOUNG next PERSON*) <BR/>(YOUNG next PEOPLE*) <BR/>(((YOUTH* or ADOLESCEN*) or BOY*) or GIRL*) <BR/>STUDENT* <BR/>((((((#1 or #2) or #3) or #4) or #5) or #6) or #7) <BR/>MENTAL-DISORDERS*:ME <BR/>ATTENTION-DEFICIT-AND-DISRUPTIVE-BEHAVIOR-DI*:ME <BR/>AFFECTIVE-SYMPTOMS*:ME <BR/>AGGRESSION*:ME <BR/>DEPRESSION*:ME <BR/>SELF-INJURIOUS-BEHAVIOR*:ME <BR/>STRESS-PSYCHOLOGICAL*:ME <BR/>EMOTIONS*:ME <BR/>MENTAL-COMPETENCY*:ME <BR/>ADAPTATION-PSYCHOLOGICAL*:ME <BR/>PERSONALITY-DEVELOPMENT*:ME <BR/>BODY-IMAGE*:ME <BR/>MENTAL-HEALTH*:ME <BR/>((((((((((((#9 or #10) or #11) or #12) or #13) or #14) or #15) or #16) or #17) or #18) or #19) or #20) or #21) <BR/>(MENTAL* next DISORDER*) <BR/>(ADJUSTMENT* next DISORDER*) <BR/>(ANXIETY next DISORDER*) <BR/>(PHOBIC near DISORDER*) <BR/>PHOBI* <BR/>(STRESS next DISORDER*) <BR/>ADHD <BR/>(ATTENTION next DEFICIT) <BR/>(DISRUPTIVE near (BEHAVIOR or BEHAVIOUR)) <BR/>HYPERACTIV* <BR/>(CONDUCT near DISORDER*) <BR/>((BEHAVIOR or BEHAVIOUR) next DISORDER*) <BR/>(TIC near DISORDER*) <BR/>(TOURETTE* next SYNDROME) <BR/>(MOOD* near DISORDER*) <BR/>(AFFECTIVE next SYMPTOM*) <BR/>AGGRESS* <BR/>DEPRESS* <BR/>(((((((((((((((((#23 or #24) or #25) or #26) or #27) or #28) or #29) or #30) or #31) or #32) or #33) or #34) or #35) or #36) or #37) or #38) or #39) or #40) <BR/>(DYSTHYMIC next DISORDER*) <BR/>((SEASONAL next AFFECTIVE) next DISORDER*) <BR/>(NEUROTIC near DISORDER*) <BR/>(SELF-INJURIOUS next BEHAVIOR*) <BR/>(SELF-INJURIOUS next BEHAVIOUR*) <BR/>(SELF and INJUR*) <BR/>(PSYCHOLOGICAL near STRESS*) <BR/>ANXIET* <BR/>FEAR* <BR/>FRUSTRAT* <BR/>HAPPINESS* <BR/>HAPPY <BR/>LONEL* <BR/>(MENTAL* next COMPETEN*) <BR/>(PSYCHOLOGICAL near ADAPTATION*) <BR/>(PERSONALITY near DEVELOP*) <BR/>SELF-CONCEPT* <BR/>(SELF next CONCEPT*) <BR/>SELF-IMAGE* <BR/>(SELF next IMAGE*) <BR/>SELF-ESTEEM <BR/>(SELF next ESTEEM) <BR/>SELF-HARM* <BR/>(SELF next HARM*) <BR/>SELF-MUTILAT* <BR/>(SELF next MUTILAT*) <BR/>(BODY next IMAGE*) <BR/>((((((((((((((((((((((((((#42 or #43) or #44) or #45) or #46) or #47) or #48) or #49) or #50) or #51) or #52) or #53) or #54) or #55) or #56) or #57) or #58) or #59) or #60) or #61) or #62) or #63) or #64) or #65) or #66) or #67) or #68) <BR/>(MENTAL next HEALTH*) <BR/>(WELL next BEING) <BR/>(WELL-BEING or WELLBEING) <BR/>((#70 or #71) or #72) <BR/>(((#22 or #41) or #69) or #73) <BR/>EXERCISE*:ME <BR/>EXERCISE-THERAPY*:ME <BR/>PHYSICAL-EDUCATION-AND-TRAINING*:ME <BR/>SPORTS*:ME <BR/>PLAY-AND-PLAYTHINGS*:ME <BR/>PLAY-THERAPY*:ME <BR/>DANCING*:ME <BR/>DANCE-THERAPY*:ME <BR/>EXERCIS* <BR/>(EXERCIS* near THERAP*) <BR/>(PHYSICAL near (EDUCAT* or TRAIN*)) <BR/>SPORT* <BR/>PLAY* <BR/>DANC* <BR/>(((((((((((((#75 or #76) or #77) or #78) or #79) or #80) or #81) or #82) or #83) or #84) or #85) or #86) or #87) or #88) <BR/>((#8 and #74) and #89)</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. SELECTION OF TRIALS <BR/>Titles and abstracts from the searches were screened by one reviewer (EE) who excluded the studies clearly not relevant to the topic, such as studies of adults, not randomised controlled trials, and not exercise interventions. The rest were retrieved by EE, and judged independently by EE and FH against the inclusion criteria. If there was uncertainty or disagreement, a third reviewer (KBH) was consulted. </P>
<P>2. QUALITY ASSESSMENT <BR/>Two reviewers (EE and FH) independently assigned each selected study to quality categories described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>). Uncertainty or disagreement was resolved by discussion with KBH. When further information was needed, the authors of studies were contacted for clarification. Blinding of providers and patients is unlikely to be applicable and was not used as a criterion to assess the internal validity of included trials. The following five criteria were used: </P>
<P>a) Concealment of allocation <BR/>ADEQUATE: (A) indicates adequate concealment of the allocation (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); <BR/>UNCLEAR: (B) indicates uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment is not known); <BR/>INADEQUATE: (C) indicates that the allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (for example, open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number). </P>
<P>b) Outcome assessment <BR/>MET: assessor unaware of the assigned treatment when collecting outcome measures <BR/>UNCLEAR: blinding of assessor not reported and cannot be verified by contacting investigators <BR/>NOT MET: assessor aware of the assigned treatment when collecting outcome measures. </P>
<P>c) Co-intervention <BR/>MET: interventions other than exercise avoided, controlled or used similarly across comparison groups. <BR/>UNCLEAR: use of interventions other than exercise not reported and cannot be verified by contacting the investigators <BR/>NOT MET: dissimilar use of interventions other than exercise across comparison groups, i. e. differences in the care provided to the participants in the comparison groups other than the intervention under investigation. </P>
<P>d) Losses to follow-up <BR/>MET: losses to follow up less than 20% and equally distributed between comparison groups <BR/>UNCLEAR: losses to follow up not reported <BR/>NOT MET: losses to follow up greater than 20%.</P>
<P>e) Intention-to-treat <BR/>MET: intention to treat analysis performed or possible with data provided <BR/>UNCLEAR: intention to treat not reported, and cannot be verified by contacting the investigators <BR/>NOT MET: intention to treat analyses not done and not possible for reviewers to calculate independently. </P>
<P>Studies were grouped as those with a low risk of bias (all criteria MET), those with a moderate risk of bias (3-4 criteria MET), and those with a high risk of bias (less than 3 criteria MET). Other methodological issues are documented in "Table of Included Studies." </P>
<P>3. DATA MANAGEMENT<BR/>Data were extracted independently by each reviewer, and compared using data extraction sheets and the "double entry" feature in RevMan 4.2.1. Data concerning population, age, baseline characteristics, characteristics of activity/activities and duration, compliance, and outcome measures were extracted for both all groups within each trial. Where it was not possible to extract data because they were not available or further information was needed, the first author of the paper was contacted for clarification. Authors of seven trials provided us with further information on design, methodological quality or results: <LINK REF="REF-Field-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tuckman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuckman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Platzer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platzer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salokun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salokun 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2002</LINK>. The data thus received are presented in the "Table of Included Studies." </P>
<P>4. ASSESSMENT OF HETEROGENEITY <BR/>Heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi-squared test of heterogeneity along with visual inspection of the graph. </P>
<P>5. DATA SYNTHESIS <BR/>Overall effects from the studies for which data were available were calculated. For studies not providing sufficient data to calculate overall effects, a qualitative summary is provided. Since self-esteem is a continuous outcome, and was measured with similar, but not identical, instruments across studies, standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated. There was considerable clinical heterogeneity between trials with differences in study quality, differences in the type or length/period of the intervention and differences in participant characteristics. Statistical heterogeneity was also identified. Therefore overall effects were calculated using a random effects model. Where studies contained more than one eligible intervention versus a control group, the Ns, means and standard deviations were pooled for use in the analysis. This was required in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1989</LINK>, where one group received jogging, one swimming, one dancing and one weight-lifting. Still, the results from the weight-lifting arm were excluded in a sensitivity analysis. In another trial, data were combined from two intervention arms; strength-training with discussion and strength-training with leisure counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Munson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Munson 1985</LINK>). </P>
<P>6. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES<BR/>Primary analyses were based on available data from all included studies relevant to the comparison and outcome of interest. In order to assess the robustness of conclusions to quality of data and clinical heterogeneity, sensitivity analyses were performed in terms of studies of different levels of methodological quality, differences in the type or length of the intervention, and differences in participant characteristics. </P>

<P>Sixty studies were retrieved, but only 23 were included. The excluded studies were not randomised studies, were studies with short time interventions or no gross motor activity, or we did not define outcome measures as measures of self-esteem (see table of excluded studies). Two of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Marsh-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Marsh 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hilyer-1979b" TYPE="STUDY">Hilyer 1979b</LINK>) used two different interventions, and the analysis therefore includes 25 comparisons. Eighteen of the included studies were carried out in the USA, two in Canada, one in Nigeria and one in Australia. They included 24 to 288 participants aged from 3 to 19.8 years. The participants varied widely, including healthy children; children with learning disabilities and/or emotional disturbances; young offenders; children with low self-image and children with deficits in gross motor skills. The interventions lasted for between 4 and 20 weeks and included aerobic interventions, strength-training interventions, skills training and combinations of these. Some interventions combined the exercise with counselling, skills training and social activities, otherd focused only on exercise.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-11-13 04:10:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-three trials with a total of 1821 children and young people were included. Two of the references included two quite different interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Marsh-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Marsh 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hilyer-1979a" TYPE="STUDY">Hilyer 1979a</LINK>). These we subdivided into separate studies (<LINK REF="STD-Marsh-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Marsh 1988b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hilyer-1979b" TYPE="STUDY">Hilyer 1979b</LINK>) giving at total of 25 studies in the analysis. Two other studies also had more than one intervention, but these interventions were considered similar (<LINK REF="STD-Ford-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Munson 1985</LINK>), and therefore calculated as one intervention in the meta-analysis. The duration of most of the interventions varied from 4 to 14 weeks. Only one study had an intervention period of as much as 9 months (<LINK REF="STD-Elstein-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Elstein 1977</LINK>). Outcomes were measured at the end of the interventions, and no follow-up results were given.</P>
<P>When different scores on self-esteem were used, the overall self-esteem score, often called global self-esteem score in the papers, was used in the analysis. In additional to represent the total score of these items, some assessment instruments differentiate between different domains of self-esteem, while others only give a global representation of self-esteem. To make comparisons possible, this review only consider measurements of global self-esteem. Six studies were cluster-randomised trials and were not included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Boyd-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruya-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Bruya 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elstein-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Elstein 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luebke-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Luebke 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Platzer-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Platzer 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salukon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Salukon 1994</LINK>). A further seven did not report the results in a way that makes it possible to calculate overall effects (<LINK REF="STD-Basile-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Basile 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hilyer-1979a" TYPE="STUDY">Hilyer 1979a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hilyer-1979b" TYPE="STUDY">Hilyer 1979b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marsh-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Marsh 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marsh-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Marsh 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGowan-1974" TYPE="STUDY">McGowan 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuckman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tuckman 1986</LINK>) . Therefore, 12 studies provided sufficient data to be include in the meta-analysis. Since the outcomes were measured with similar, but not identical, instruments, SMD was calculated.</P>
<P>From a clinical point of view, the context in which the physical activity was carried out might be of importance to the outcomes. We therefore differentiated between studies that focused on exercise only and studies explicitly focusing on skill-training, counselling, the social setting or other motivational factors as a part of the exercise intervention (not specified in the protocol).</P>

The number of participants included in this meta-analysis was 214 in the exercise group and 166 in the control group. The overall SMD random effect model was 0.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.81) in favour of the exercise intervention. Since the heterogeneity was significant (p = 0.037), we analysed the studies in strata of methodological quality. The subtotals for the study with a low risk of bias showed a SMD of 1.33 (95% CI 0.43 to 2.23) in the same direction (<LINK REF="STD-Alpert-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Alpert 1990</LINK>), the studies with a moderate risk of bias showed a non-significant SMD of 0.21 (95% CI -0.17 to 0.59) and the studies with a high risk of bias had a SMD of 0.57 (95% CI 0.11 to 1.04). Five studies in this comparison were not included in the meta-analysis because of cluster-randomised design or missing data (<LINK REF="STD-Salukon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Salukon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuckman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tuckman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Basile-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Basile 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hilyer-1979a" TYPE="STUDY">Hilyer 1979a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marsh-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Marsh 1988a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hilyer-1979a" TYPE="STUDY">Hilyer 1979a</LINK> (high risk of bias) found a significant improvement (p &lt; 0.01) for a subgroup of participants: those with a low self-concept at baseline. The cluster-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Salukon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Salukon 1994</LINK>, moderate risk of bias) reported a significant treatment effect (p = 0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Tuckman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tuckman 1986</LINK> (moderate risk of bias), and <LINK REF="STD-Basile-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Basile 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marsh-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Marsh 1988b</LINK> (high risk of bias) reported no significant effect.</P>
<P>a) Sensitivity analysis<BR/>Since the interventions and participants could be considered heterogeneous, we employed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results. Because there might be a difference in effect between aerobic exercise and strength training, we made an analysis where the intervention group receiving weight training in <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1989</LINK> were excluded. This resulted in almost the same total score, SMD 0.50 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.03). No other studies had strength training as the only intervention. The duration of the intervention was also thought to have an important role. In a meta-analysis including only studies with an intervention duration of 10 weeks or more (<LINK REF="STD-MacMahon-1987" TYPE="STUDY">MacMahon 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacMahon-1988" TYPE="STUDY">MacMahon 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Munson 1988</LINK>), the SMD decreased marginally [0.46 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.75)].</P>
<P>It might also be of interest if the interventions had a possible different effect in healthy children and children at risk or with defined problems. The total SMD for studies with healthy children are not significant [SMD 0.53 (95% CI -0.04 to 1.09)] (<LINK REF="STD-Alpert-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Alpert 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herman_x002d_Tofler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Herman-Tofler 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ford-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ford 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Percy-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Percy 1981</LINK>), whilst analysis of studies with children at risk or with defined problems resulted in a significant SMD of 0.49 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.82) (<LINK REF="STD-MacMahon-1987" TYPE="STUDY">MacMahon 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacMahon-1988" TYPE="STUDY">MacMahon 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Munson 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>b) Analysis not pre-specified in the protocol<BR/>Many of the studies included in this review are small, and the randomisation procedures not appropriate. This may lead to baseline differences. When excluding the studies with clear baseline differences in self-esteem measures, the overall SMD increased marginally to 0.51 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.9).</P>
<P>
<B>2. EXERCISE AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE INTERVENTION VERSUS NO INTERVENTION </B>(see also <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>)<BR/>This group of interventions included 12 studies, with only four in the meta-analysis. The number of participants included in the meta-analysis was 89 in the exercise group and 72 in the control group. The results show an overall SMD of 0.51 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.88). No studies in this group had a low risk of bias, but in studies with a moderate risk of bias, the SMD was non-significant at 0.32 (95% CI -0.11 to 0.74) and in those with a high risk of bias, the SMD was 0.76 (95% CI 0.12 to 1.40). Studies not included in the meta-analysis because of a cluster-randomised design or missing data all had a high risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Elstein-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Elstein 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hilyer-1979b" TYPE="STUDY">Hilyer 1979b</LINK> and one cluster-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Platzer-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Platzer 1976</LINK>) found a significant treatment effect. <LINK REF="STD-Luebke-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Luebke 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marsh-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Marsh 1988b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McGowan-1974" TYPE="STUDY">McGowan 1974</LINK> and one cluster-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bruya-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Bruya 1977</LINK>) showed no significant differences between intervention and control groups.</P>
<P>a) Sensitivity analysis<BR/>In this comparison, it was not possible to categorise the interventions, and no studies had interventions less than 10 weeks. When the single study with healthy participants was excluded from the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1982</LINK>), the SMD increased to 0.64 (95% CI 0.22 to 1.06). When the study with obvious baseline differences in self-esteem (<LINK REF="STD-Munson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Munson 1985</LINK>) was excluded, there was no clear difference [SMD 0.55 (95% CI 0.07 to 1.03)].</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The objective of this review was to determine if exercise interventions can improve self-esteem among children and young people. Sixty studies were retrieved for this review, but 37 were excluded because of no randomisation, no appropriate interventions or self-esteem not an outcome measure. The results, based on 25 comparisons with participants aged 3 to 20 years, indicate that exercise can improve self-esteem. This compares well to the meta-analysis of Gruber (<LINK REF="REF-Gruber-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruber 1986</LINK>). </P>
<P>Only one of the included studies met all five methodological criteria and was assessed to have a low risk of bias. Eight had MET three or four methodological quality scores, and were categorised as studies with a moderate risk of bias. The remaining 14 studies had a high risk of bias. With these different methodological weaknesses in the studies, the analyses were carried out by categorising studies into three quality levels. There was a wide range of interventions in the included studies, and in this review they are grouped into two main comparisons, one where the focus was exercise only (13 studies) and one where the exercise was combined with skills training, counselling or social aspects (12 studies). </P>
<P>Because of cluster randomisation or insufficient data to calculate effect sizes, meta-analysis could be accomplished for only 12 studies, eight that looked at exercise only and four that looked at exercise combined with other aspects. Both these meta-analyses show an overall significant treatment effect, but there was no significant change in studies with a moderate risk of bias. Of the studies not included in the meta-analysis, seven showed a significant treatment effect and six did not. </P>
<P>It is questionable whether a meta-analysis is appropriate in this review. There were differences in participants, types of interventions and methods of measurements, and the test for heterogeneity in the exercise-only comparisons was significant. We therefore performed sensitivity analyses. The effect size changed only marginally when weight-lifting results, intervention with duration shorter than 10 weeks or studies with differences in baseline measures of self-esteem were excluded. The only change in SMD of any possible important value was an increase in total SMD when healthy participants were excluded from the analysis of exercise interventions as a part of a comprehensive intervention. This is consistent with findings in many types of interventions or preventive programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Durlak-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durlak 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Self-esteem was measured using instruments that are well accepted and reasonably well tested for reliability and validity, with the possible exception of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Platzer-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Platzer 1976</LINK>), where the quality of the method is not known. There were no follow-up data to demonstrate the extent to which the effects of programmes were maintained over longer periods of time, and none of the studies included factors indicating the degree of fun or enthusiasm among participants in the programmes. Whether the treatment effects were of clinical importance remains unclear. </P>
<P>All the included studies used more or less "ordinary activity" as control treatment. The comparisons are therefore not between exercise and complete physical inactivity, although some studies have an upper limit for HR for activity in the control group. This means that the possible treatment effect of exercise might be underestimated in this review. The effect was also somewhat surprising considering the short duration of the interventions. The research included in this review cannot tell us anything about what kind of exercise, and in which setting, gives positive effects.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of this review are necessarily limited due to the small number of participants in the included studies and the lack of studies with a low risk of bias. Despite the methodological problems referred to, the results indicate that exercise might be effective in improving self-esteem among children and young people, at least in the short term and for children and young people at risk. For exercise as part of a comprehensive intervention the size of the effect is moderate. For exercise alone the effect is about the same, but the results are heterogeneous. Since exercise has no known negative effects, and many positive effects on somatic health, it might be an important instrument in improving children's self-esteem.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review reflects the paucity of rigorous research evaluating the effectiveness of exercise on children's self-esteem. The field needs to be further investigated by well-designed randomised controlled trials, and there is a need of follow-up data to demonstrate the extent to which the effect of programmes are maintained over time and linked to attempts to clarify clinical meaning.</P>
