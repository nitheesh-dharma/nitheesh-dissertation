<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-28 03:40:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women may experience cramping pain and discomfort following the birth of their baby as the uterus contracts and returns to its pre-pregnancy size. These after pains are caused by involutionary contractions and usually last for two to three days after childbirth. They are more evident for women who have previously had a baby. Breastfeeding stimulates the uterus to contract and increases the severity of after birth pains. This review is about pain relief for after pains experienced by women following vaginal birth.</P>
<P>Types of analgesia used to relieve the pain include paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) included aspirin and naproxen, opioids including codeine and non-pharmacological methods such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). The results from 18 randomised controlled trials involving 1498 women, of which nine (750 women) had data that could be included in the review meta-analyses, indicated that aspirin and other NSAIDs including naproxen were more effective at relieving uterine cramping pain than paracetamol or a placebo. NSAIDs included naproxen, aspirin, ketorolac and flurbiprofen. Only naproxen is still used in women who are breastfeeding. Aspirin is not recommended for use by breastfeeding women as there is concern that it will be passed to the baby in the breast milk. Codeine was not always more effective than a placebo or NSAIDs in the included studies and can sedate breastfed babies. Women offered codeine for pain relief should be informed about the potential for adverse effects for their babies. Codeine should only be prescribed for breastfeeding women with after birth pain if there is no alternative and their breastfed infants should be closely monitored for sedation and signs of codeine toxicity. Information about the safety of the NSAIDs for breastfeeding women and their babies was limited.</P>
<P>The majority of analyses in this review included only one study with small numbers of participants. The average year of the included studies is 1981 and therefore further research is recommended comparing NSAIDs currently available and known to be safe for women who are breastfeeding and their babies.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-04-06 12:26:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>We have included 18 studies (involving 1498 women) in this review. However, only nine of the included studies (with 750 women) reported 24 comparisons of analgesia with other analgesia or placebo and had data that could be included in our meta-analyses. The majority of studies investigated pharmacological analgesics and these were grouped into classes for this review. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were significantly better than placebo at relieving pain from uterine involution as assessed by their summed pain intensity differences (SPID) (mean difference (MD) 4.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.87 to 5.82; three studies, 204 women) and summed pain relief scores (MD 5.94; 95% CI 3.83 to 8.01; three studies, 204 women). NSAIDS were compared with opioids in one small study of 23 women reporting SPID and summed pain relief and found no difference. A larger study of 127 women found NSAIDs to be significantly better than opioids at reducing pain intensity six hours following study intervention (MD -0.70; 95% CI -1.04 to -0.35). Opioids were compared with placebo in three studies that could be included in meta-analyses; one small study of 23 women reporting SPID and summed pain relief and found no difference. One study of 95 women found no difference in pain intensity six hours following the study intervention. A third study of 108 women found significantly more women in the placebo group reported no pain relief than women in the opioid group (risk ratio 0.10; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.23). Aspirin was significantly better than paracetamol when pain intensity score was assessed six hours after study intervention (MD 0.85; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.41; one study 48 women) at relieving pain from uterine involution. Paracetamol was not better than placebo when pain intensity was assessed six hours after the study intervention in one study of 48 women.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-04-11 10:40:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) including aspirin were better than placebo at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution following vaginal birth. NSAIDs were better than paracetamol and paracetamol was not better than placebo, though numbers of participants for these comparisons were small. Data for opioids compared with NSAIDs and opioids compared with placebo were conflicting, with some measures showing similar effect and others indicating NSAIDs were better than opioids and opioids were not better than placebo. There were insufficient data to make conclusions regarding the effectiveness of opioids at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution.</P>
<P>The median year of publication of included studies was 1981; therefore more research is needed to assess the effectiveness of current pharmacological and non-pharmacological analgesia at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution following vaginal birth.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-04-06 12:29:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Women may experience differing types of pain and discomfort following the birth of their baby. This may include incisional pain after a caesarean section, perineal pain following perineal trauma or episiotomy during vaginal birth, nipple pain from breastfeeding and cramping after birth pains associated with involution of the uterus. Following birth, the uterus returns to its normal size through involution, a process of intermittent uterine contractions. These involutionary contractions may be painful and are commonly felt for two or three days after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Ladewig-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ladewig 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence and severity of after birth pains is not widely reported. However, multiparous women usually experience more pain as the lost tone of the uterus of the multiparous woman contracts and relaxes alternately. This is also true of a uterus that is greatly distended as in a multiple pregnancy or polyhydramnios (<LINK REF="REF-Ladewig-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ladewig 1990</LINK>). It has been further hypothesised that childbirth can induce central neural changes that increase predisposition for pain during the postpartum period suggesting multiparous women's perception of uterine cramp pain is increased through a process of central sensitisation of nociceptive neurons (<LINK REF="REF-Holdroft-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holdroft 2003</LINK>). Endogenous oxytocin released during breastfeeding stimulates the uterus to contract and increases the severity of after birth pains felt by the mother. Thus after birth pains may hinder successful breastfeeding, reducing the mother's ability to care for her new baby and may impair the establishment of good-quality mother-baby interactions as has been shown with perineal pain (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1991</LINK>). In contrast, the uterus of the primiparous woman remains contracted after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Ladewig-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ladewig 1990</LINK>), hence these women do not commonly experience after birth pains. It has been documented that some women consider their after birth pains to be a major burden requiring powerful analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Mander-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mander 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of randomised trials comparing the safety and effectiveness of various analgesics have been published. After birth pains and perineal tissue injury after vaginal birth are established clinical pain models for the investigation of efficacy of new analgesic agents (<LINK REF="REF-Bloomfield-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloomfield 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Windle-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Windle 1989</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-04-06 12:54:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Analgesia is any agent used to relieve pain. Analgesia includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Pharmacological analgesia can be further classified: simple analgesics (including paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) like aspirin and naproxen) and opioid analgesics (including codeine and morphine) (<LINK REF="REF-MIMS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">MIMS 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Paracetamol and codeine are commonly used analgesics following childbirth. Paracetamol is secreted in small amounts into breastmilk and not considered hazardous (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bitzen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bitzen 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Notorianni--1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Notorianni 1987</LINK>). Codeine is considered moderately safe in breastfeeding women (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK>). However, it has been suggested in the literature that babies may become sedated by maternal intake of codeine (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Findlay-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Findlay 1981</LINK>), and one case of a baby succumbing to codeine toxicity has been described (<LINK REF="REF-Koren-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koren 2006</LINK>). Women offered codeine for pain relief should be informed about the potential for adverse effects. Codeine should only be prescribed for breastfeeding women with after birth pain if there is no alternative and their breastfed infants should be closely monitored for sedation and signs of codeine toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Koren-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koren 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK> in Medications and Mothers' Milk does not recommend aspirin use in breastfeeding women, although there is evidence that only extremely small amounts of salicylic acid are secreted into breastmilk (<LINK REF="REF-Erickson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erickson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Findlay-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Findlay 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Non-pharmacological analgesia may include massage, heat packs, cold packs, hypnotherapy, acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-03-30 23:04:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Analgesia can decrease pain or perception of pain in several ways. Systemic analgesic drugs can be categorised into different classes. Simple analgesics like paracetamol inhibit central nervous system prostaglandin synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Rang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rang 2007</LINK>). NSAIDs including aspirin and naproxen have an anti-inflammatory action (<LINK REF="REF-Rang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rang 2007</LINK>). Narcotic analgesics including codeine and morphine reduce perception of pain by inhibiting pain-transmission neurons and reducing the psychological response to pain (<LINK REF="REF-Rang-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rang 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Non-pharmacological analgesia may work through a number of mechanisms; TENS is thought to inhibit nociception (<LINK REF="STD-Olsen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Olsen 2007</LINK>).<BR/>

</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-04-11 10:41:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women may experience pain after birth from several sources, including uterine involution and perineal trauma. Management of pain after birth is important and can impact on a woman's return to normal activities and caring for her baby.</P>
<P>There is very little in the literature to guide women and clinicians in the management of pain from uterine cramping/involution. The aim of this review is to systematically assess what is known about the effectiveness and safety of analgesia for relief pain from uterine cramping/involution.</P>
<P>
<I>The Cochrane Library</I> now has a generic protocol for meta-analyses of interventional studies for perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Chou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 2010</LINK>). The first review using this protocol assessing paracetamol (acetaminophen) has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Chou-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chou 2010a</LINK>). This review will contribute to what is known about the management of postpartum pain.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>).

If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if we detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if we considered an average treatment effect across trials clinically meaningful. We treated the random-effects summary as the average range of possible treatment effects, and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain intensity (x hours)</HEADING>
<P>Pain intensity is a simple assessment of pain intensity at a time point, typically measured at baseline before the study intervention and again at various time points after the study intervention. Women were asked to rate their pain using a four- or five-point scale with zero representing no pain and three or four representing the worst pain. We calculated mean and standard deviation for all observations at a single time point and compared between study groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summed pain intensity difference (SPID)</HEADING>
<P>A commonly used measure was the summed pain intensity difference. Typically, women were asked before the study intervention to rate their pain intensity using a four- or five-point scale with zero representing no pain and three or four representing the worst pain. Following administration of the study intervention, women were again asked to rate the intensity of their pain using the same scale. The difference between the two measurements was calculated, the post-study intervention observation pain intensity was subtracted from the baseline observation pain intensity, giving a pain intensity difference. This was repeated at intervals following administration of the study intervention, and the calculated pain intensity differences for each time point were summed, giving one numeric value (SPID) for each participant. High SPID values indicate greater pain relief. Mean and standard deviation of the SPID values were calculated and compared between study groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summed pain relief score</HEADING>
<P>Women were asked to grade their pain relief at various time points after the study intervention using a four- or five-point scale with zero representing no pain relief and three or four representing complete pain relief. These observations were repeated a set number of times after the study intervention and summed giving a single summed pain relief score for each participant, mean and standard deviation were calculated for each study group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Global rating</HEADING>
<P>Typically women were asked at the final observation to rate the effect of the study intervention on a numeric scale, often zero to 10, with zero representing the worst pain relief they have ever had and 10 being the best. The score was summed for each study group and mean and standard deviations calculated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain reduction greater than 50%</HEADING>
<P>Women were asked to grade their pain relief at various time points after the study intervention using a four- or five-point scale with zero representing no pain relief and three or four representing complete pain relief. These observations were repeated a set number of times after the study intervention. Pain reduction greater than 50% was determined by the presence or absence of a fall of greater than 50% in the level of pre-study intervention pain intensity at any time during the first three hours after study intervention. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Visual analogue scale one to four at 30 minutes</HEADING>
<P>Women were asked to rate their pain 30 minutes after the study intervention using a visual analogue scale numbered one to ten with one representing no pain and ten representing the worst pain.Their scores were dichotomised to scores of one to four inclusive or scores of five to ten inclusive. RR and 95% CIs were calculated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain analogue score</HEADING>
<P>A single measure on a visual scale of zero to 10 with the lowest value representing the least pain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain analogue score compared with baseline</HEADING>
<P>A 20 cm line marked zero (no pain) and 100 (worst pain ever experienced) was used; women marked this visual analogue scale to represent their pain intensity before the study intervention and at intervals after the study intervention. Observations at four hours post-intervention were obtained and a percentage change from baseline was calculated; ie the first baseline observation was 100% pain intensity, subsequent measurements were measured as a percentage of the baseline measurement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Visual analogue scale difference</HEADING>
<P>Women rated the pain on a 100 mm visual analogue scale, with 0 mm representing 'no pain' and 100 mm representing 'pain as bad as it could be'. Assessment was repeated at two and four hours after the study intervention and subtracted form baseline giving a pain intensity difference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">No pain relief</HEADING>
<P>The number of women who did not experience any pain relief after the study intervention was reported and RR and 95% CIs were calculated.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-04-11 10:43:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has found non-steroidal ant-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including aspirin, to be better than placebo for relieving pain due to uterine cramping/involution after vaginal birth.</P>
<P>NSAIDs including aspirin were better than placebo at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution following vaginal birth. NSAIDs were better than paracetamol and paracetamol was not better than placebo though numbers of participants for these comparisons were small. Data for opioids compared with NSAIDs and opioids compared with placebo were conflicting, with some measures showing similar effect and others indicating NSAIDs were better than opioids and opioids were not better than placebo. There were insufficient data to make conclusions regarding the effectiveness of opioids at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution.</P>
<P>There is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of paracetamol. There was a trend towards paracetamol being less effective than aspirin and naproxen and not better than placebo. Finding paracetamol to be less effective than NSAIDs is consistent with findings of a review of NSAIDs for primary dysmenorrhoea or uterine cramping pain associated with menstruation (<LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2010</LINK>). Codeine was better than placebo but not better than aspirin.</P>
<P>The included studies reported little, if any, information on the safety of the various forms of analgesia for use by women who were breastfeeding.</P>
<P>There is limited information about the safety of the NSAIDs for breastfeeding women and their babies. The following NSAIDs have been included in this review; aspirin, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, ketorolac, metamizole and naproxen.</P>
<P>The World Health Organization working group on drugs in lactation determined that aspirin is not safe for use during breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1988</LINK>). Although extremely small amounts of aspirin are secreted in breastmilk, it has been implicated in Reye Syndrome and should be avoided (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fenoprofen, flurbiprofen and ketorolac have been studied in a limited number of women; they are difficult to detect in breastmilk following recommended dosages, and are considered safe for breastfeeding women (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK>). </P>
<P>Metamizol has been removed from sale in many countries due to serious adverse effects including agranulocytosis and aplastic anaemia. It has been studied in a very small number of breastfeeding women and detected in small amounts in their breastmilk. Metamizole is generally not recommended, as safer alternatives are available (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Naproxen is considered moderately safe for breastfeeding women in short-term use. It has a longer half-life and one case has been documented of an infant with prolonged bleeding, haemorrhage and acute anaemia. Long-term use of naproxen in breastfeeding women may be hazardous (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK>). </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Safety of other classes of drugs included in this review</HEADING>
<P>Paracetamol, a simple analgesic, has been well researched in breastfeeding women; amounts passed into breastmilk are considered too small to be hazardous and in recommended doses it is considered safe (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK>). </P>
<P>Codeine, a mild opiate, can be detected in small amounts in breastmilk; infant apnoea has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1985</LINK>) and there has been one infant death linked to codeine usage (<LINK REF="REF-Koren-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koren 2006</LINK>). Despite this, codeine is considered safe in moderation (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hereditary polymorphisms of the drug-metabolising enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) mean that some individuals lacking this enzyme will find codeine ineffective (<LINK REF="REF-Cascorbi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cascorbi 2003</LINK>). Between one and three percent of middle-Europeans and up to 29% of Ethiopians display CYP2D6 gene duplications and are ultra-rapid metabolisers of codeine to morphine (<LINK REF="REF-Cascorbi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cascorbi 2003</LINK>); because of this, they may pass potentially fatal concentrations of morphine to their infants through breastmilk. One such infant death has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Koren-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koren 2006</LINK>). Codeine may cause constipation (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK>). Women should be informed of the risks and the infants of breastfeeding women who take codeine preparations observed for signs of sedation and codeine toxicity. </P>
<P>Morphine has not been well studied in breastfeeding women; however, it is thought to be the opiate of choice in lactating women. The limited information available suggests that the amount detected in breastmilk of women receiving morphine via patient controlled analgesia pumps is unlikely to be clinically relevant in stable breastfeeding infants (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK>). Morphine taken orally is poorly absorbed (approximately 26% of the dose), therefore infants would absorb approximately one-quarter of the small amount of morphine found in breastmilk of women using morphine for pain relief. It is possible that sedation of newborn infants and respiratory problems may occur with higher doses of morphine.</P>
<P>Nalbuphine is a potent synthetic narcotic similar in potency to morphine. In a study of 20 women, less than 0.02% of the adult dose was detected in breastmilk and no known complications have been reported regarding infant ingestion of breastmilk of women given nalbuphine (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Paracetamol and oxycodone: oxycodone is an opioid analgesic derived from opium. This combined analgesic is considered moderately safe for breastfeeding women and their infants (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>The average year of the included studies is 1981; the majority of analyses in this review are based on single studies with small numbers of participants, and drugs in common use today such as ibuprofen have not been tested for this condition. As previously stated, many of the randomised controlled studies included in this review were intended to investigate the drugs in use and postpartum women were a convenient sample to test.

<P>The median year of publication of included studies was 1981; more research is needed to include current pharmacological and non-pharmacological analgesics.</P>
<P>The review authors believe there is sufficient information regarding pharmacological analgesia versus placebo. A well controlled study should compare drugs in current use known to be safe in this population.</P>
<P>There is insufficient information regarding non-pharmacological analgesia and these should be assessed in well designed controlled randomised studies.</P>
