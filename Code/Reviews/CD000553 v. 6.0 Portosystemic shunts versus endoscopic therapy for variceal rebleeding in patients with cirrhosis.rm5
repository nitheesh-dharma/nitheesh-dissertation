<WHATS_NEW NOTES="&lt;p&gt;This is the first systematic review of all trials of portosystemic shunts versus endoscopic therapy for the long-term management of variceal haemorrhage. This includes comparisons of surgical total portocaval shunts versus endoscopic therapy and distal splenorenal shunts versus endoscopic therapy in addition to transjugular intrahepatic portocaval shunts (the most popular current shunt option) versus endoscopic therapy. The whole field is placed into historical perspective, showing that all three forms of shunts have their disadvantages. Although this review does not provide direct comparisons between shunt options, as yet there are no clear data that show the most popular current option to be superior to endoscopic therapy nor surgical shunting.&lt;/p&gt;">

<P>A third of deaths from cirrhosis are due to variceal bleeding. Randomised clinical trials have compared three types of portosystemic shunting separately against endoscopic therapy. The shunts included in these trials have been total portocaval shunts, distal splenorenal shunts, and transjugular intrahepatic portocaval shunts. The authors found that when compared to endoscopic therapy all three types of shunt lowered the rate of rebleeding at the cost of a higher incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, without any statistically significant difference in survival.<BR/>

<P>To compare the effects of shunts (total surgical shunt (TS); distal spleno-renal shunts (DSRS) or transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunts (TIPS) with endoscopic therapy (ET, sclerotherapy and/or banding) for prevention of variceal rebleeding in patients with cirrhosis.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were collected to allow intention-to-treat analysis where possible. For each outcome, a pooled estimate of treatment effect (log hazard ratio for time to outcome, Peto odds ratio for binary outcomes, and differences in means for continuous outcomes) across trials was calculated. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-two trials evaluating 1409 patients were included. All trials had problems of method. Shunt therapy compared with ET demonstrated significantly less rebleeding (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.30) at the cost of significantly increased acute hepatic encephalopathy (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.59 to 2.69) and chronic encephalopathy (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.62). There were no significant differences regarding mortality (hazard ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.21) and duration of in-patient stay (weighed mean difference 0.78 day, 95% CI -1.48 to 3.05). The proportion of patients with shunt occlusion or dysfunction was 3.1% (95% CI 0.4 to 10.7%) following TS (two trials), 7.8% (95% CI 3.8 to 13.9%) following DSRS (four trials), and 59% (range 18% to 72%) following TIPS (14 trials).</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-09 22:05:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Variceal haemorrhage is a formidable clinical challenge. Bleeding from gastro-oesophageal varices is a significant cause of early mortality, at 30% to 50% for a first bleed (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bornman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bornman 1994</LINK>). Those who survive a first bleed are more likely than not to have further bleeding episodes in the first few days of the initial bleed (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1982</LINK>). There is general agreement that early and vigorous resuscitation should be undertaken, preferably in specialist units (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1997</LINK>). Early endoscopy has emerged to be mandatory not only to ascertain the cause of such bleeding but also to achieve haemostasis (<LINK REF="REF-Grace-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grace 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Once preliminary control of bleeding has been achieved, regular endoscopic measures are used to prevent rebleeding in most centres. This requires multiple visits of the patient to the hospital and sometimes is associated with recurrent bleeding episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Terblanche-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terblanche 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 1996</LINK>). However, rebleeding is significantly less frequent during and after endoscopic variceal obliteration, compared to controls (<LINK REF="REF-Pagliaro-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagliaro 1989</LINK>). Adjunct measures include long-term beta-blocker treatment to reduce portal hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1997</LINK>). More recently, variceal banding has appeared as a more effective measure than sclerotherapy to prevent rebleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Laine-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laine 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>One way of decompressing the varices and hence preventing rebleeding is to create a portosystemic shunt. Portosystemic shunts have been classified according to their haemodynamic consequences into total surgical shunts (TS), which have no prograde hepatopetal flow through the portal vein, and selective or partial shunts, which preserve pre-existing hepatopetal portal vein flow (<LINK REF="REF-Sutton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 1994</LINK>). The distal spleno-renal shunt (DSRS) is a selective shunt that has been associated with improved preservation of liver function and hence lower morbidity as compared to TS, although a lower mortality has not been conclusively demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 1995</LINK>). The selectivity of DSRS can further be improved if the venous collaterals between the splenic vein and pancreas are disconnected, an additional procedure that is particularly important in alcoholics (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the early 1990s the radiologically placed transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been popularised (<LINK REF="REF-LaBerge-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaBerge 1993</LINK>). It is inserted radiologically by minimal access and can usually be placed more quickly than a surgical shunt (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1997</LINK>). In essence it is a side-to-side portosystemic shunt. TIPS can, however, have serious acute and chronic complications and has a small but significant mortality rate (<LINK REF="REF-Casado-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casado 1998</LINK>). Stenosis and occlusion rates have been reported to exceed 75% at two years in randomised trials using TIPS (<LINK REF="REF-Papatheodoridis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatheodoridis 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since shunts are usually a once only treatment and have been associated with low rebleeding rates, can a case be made for wider use of shunting as a more effective and safer alternative to long-term endoscopic measures? No previous Cochrane review has addressed this question, although several meta-analyses have been published in the past two decades. Surgical shunts have been compared to medical therapy in two previous meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Pagliaro-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagliaro 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spina-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spina 1992a</LINK>), but TS have not been compared to ET. Pagliaro and co-workers reported results comparing prophylactic TS in patients who had no history of previous variceal bleeding, and the medical arm did not include ET (<LINK REF="REF-Pagliaro-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagliaro 1989</LINK>). The second meta-analysis compared DSRS versus ET (<LINK REF="REF-Spina-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spina 1992a</LINK>), whilst two published reports assess TIPS versus ET (<LINK REF="REF-Luca-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luca 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papatheodoridis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatheodoridis 1999</LINK>, which has recently been up-dated by Burroughs et al <LINK REF="REF-Burroughs-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burroughs 2002</LINK>). To comprehensively address the question we have conducted a systematic review to compare the outcome of shunts (TS, DSRS, and TIPS) versus endoscopic therapy (ET, sclerotherapy and/or banding) in the long-term management of variceal bleeding, by assessment of the rate of rebleeding, as well as the incidence of encephalopathy, complications, in-patient stay (cost) and survival following either form of treatment. We have combined comparison of various types of shunt with ET in a single review to obtain a more complete picture of alternatives, while guarding against over-simplification of the comparisons. While drawing issues related to each shunt together, this review also provides improvements in methods of data analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2002</LINK>), inclusion of up-dated studies (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Rikkers-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rikkers 1993</LINK>), and application of standardised methods in evaluating the different types of shunt. In addition, possible improvements in the future design and conduct of randomised trials in this important area have been addressed. </P>

<B>Data extraction<BR/>
</B>Standardised forms were used to extract the following data: patient characteristics, trial design, pattern of patient recruitment, exclusions, losses to follow-up, and cross-over patients.<BR/>
<BR/>Data extracted in relation to the shunt groups included suitability for shunt, whether the shunt was emergency or elective, and in patients undergoing DSRS, whether spleno-pancreatic disconnection was undertaken. Data were also extracted on the timing and method of assessing shunt patency.</P>
<P>The following data were sought for each treatment group after randomisation: estimates of log hazard ratio and its variance for time to rebleeding, time to the development of encephalopathy and time to death; incidence of rebleeding, encephalopathy and procedure-related complications; surrogate measures of cost such as total length of hospital stay during the follow-up period. When a trial had more than two arms, data were extracted only from the arms which corresponded to the treatment options compared in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis<BR/>
</B>Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method, whenever possible, ie, with all randomised patients included in the analysis within the group into which they were randomised. In some trials, however, this approach was not clearly stated or insufficient information was given (<LINK REF="STD-Cello-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cello 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rikkers-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rikkers 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GDEAIH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">GDEAIH 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sauer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sauer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_V-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-V 1999</LINK>), so authors were contacted to retrieve pertinent data. Further information was not given, however, so the information reported was used. For each outcome in each comparison (TS versus ET, DSRS versus ET, TIPS versus ET) a pooled estimate of treatment effect was calculated as a hazard ratio (HR) for time to event outcomes, odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes, and differences in means (weighted mean difference (WMD)) for continuous outcomes across the trials. If estimates of log HR and its variance were not quoted directly in trial reports, alternative aggregate data (eg, log rank test P-value) were extracted, and methods proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2002</LINK> were used to estimate log HR and its variance. In the output of the RevMan analyses 'odds ratio' actually means HR when observed-expected number of events and the variance of each trial has been entered into RevMan analyses as individual patient data (IPD). Where information was insufficient for estimation of HR, binary data were used to calculate the OR (eg, rebleeding and encephalopathy data). Further details and discussion of the reliability of results is given in <LINK REF="REF-Tudur-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudur 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>Data were analysed with both the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model meta-analyses, but only the fixed effect results were reported unless the analyses produced contradictory results for significance, in which case the most conservative estimate was reported.</P>

<P>After removing duplications, a total of 66 trial reports or abstracts were identified by the search strategies and assessed for inclusion in the review. Twenty-seven trials did not meet the inclusion criteria. Thirteen trial reports were excluded, the reasons for which are given in the table entitled 'Characteristics of excluded studies'. Twenty-six trial reports or abstracts met the inclusion criteria. Due to duplicate publications of the same trial, these 26 reports refer to 22 randomised clinical trials. For the four trials with duplicate or up-dated publications, the most recent report was used for data retrieval from three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cello-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cello 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rikkers-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rikkers 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-P_x002d_Layrargues-2001" TYPE="STUDY">P-Layrargues 2001</LINK>) and the report that included the most relevant information was used for data retrieval from the fourth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Teres-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Teres 1987</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review has compared a range of portosystemic shunting procedures (TS, DSRS, and TIPS) with ET. All types of shunt were found to be significantly more effective at preventing recurrent variceal haemorrhage. However, all forms of shunting were also associated with an increased incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, a major disadvantage of shunting that was most obvious following TIPS. There was no marked difference in cost between shunting and ET, although full interpretation of the cost analysis was not possible because of divergent reporting. Considerable caution is required in the interpretation of these results. TIPS was found to be associated with a longer hospital stay than ET in fixed-effect model analysis, but this was associated with significant clinical as well as statistical heterogeneity and the significance disappeared in a random-effects model analysis. Where data could be collected, the TS or DSRS versus ET comparisons suggested no notable difference in treatment costs. Nor was there any evidence of a difference in survival between any type of shunt and ET. Whilst death tended to result from bleeding in patients treated with ET, death tended to result from liver failure in patients treated with TS, DSRS, or TIPS. Therefore, in the absence of surveys of patient preference, published guidelines recommend ET as the preferable first line long-term treatment in the secondary prevention of recurrent variceal haemorrhage from cirrhotic portal hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Jalan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jalan 2000</LINK>). In centres where expertise for shunting exists or where ET fails, the option of shunting should be considered after an informed discussion with the patient. It is necessary to note that the treatment of these patient requires dedicated specialist team effort and the chosen treatment has to be given in an optimal manner to achieve results equivalent to those of randomised clinical trials studied and selected series (<LINK REF="REF-Orloff-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orloff 1995</LINK>). Thus patients who develop clinically significant rebleeding after ET in non-specialist hospitals should be referred early for shunting in specialist centres.</P>
<P>Systematic study of three different shunts (TS, DSRS, and TIPS), which were predominant during three different eras (TS in the 1960s to 1970s, DSRS in the 1970s to 1980s, and TIPS in the 1990s to 2000s), provides both a historical perspective and insight into the multiple options in the treatment of a difficult condition. The design and conduct of randomised clinical trials have developed during the last several decades. Thus it could be misleading to combine the three groups of trials in order to provide an overall assessment of ET versus shunting. Although there was minimal heterogeneity in the three comparisons, the patients in each trial were drawn from different populations, and subjects in trials of differing design. Even though randomised trials from the 1960s to the 1990s have been combined in a single meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Antman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 1992</LINK>), we were hesitant to combine the three groups of trials. When we did so, however, we observed no introduction of major heterogeneity.</P>
<P>TS has not previously been compared with ET in a meta-analysis, so it was interesting not only to study this comparison, but also to place randomised clinical trials comparing TS versus ET alongside comparisons of DSRS versus ET, as well as TIPS versus ET. It was expected that a gain from a very low rebleeding rate following TS would be lost by a high incidence of new or worsened encephalopathy, associated with total decompression and diversion of all portal blood flow. However, the results show only a trend towards a higher encephalopathy rate in the TS groups. There could be several reasons for this apparent discrepancy. Firstly, <LINK REF="STD-Cello-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cello 1987</LINK> recruited only patients who were Child-Pugh grade C for both trial arms, and such patients are more prone to encephalopathy because of their poor hepatic functional reserve, compared to patients of Child-Pugh grades A and B. Secondly, a significant proportion of patients were not evaluated for encephalopathy in the trial reported by <LINK REF="STD-Isaksson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Isaksson 1996</LINK> (seven in the TS group and five in the ET group). Thirdly, the trials of TS versus ET were undertaken in an earlier era, when the conduct and reporting of randomised clinical trials were at an earlier stage of development, and the issue of encephalopathy has since received greater attention.</P>
<P>DSRS resulted in a trend to more episodes of new encephalopathy or worsening of pre-existing encephalopathy than ET, without this trend reaching statistical significance. DSRS also resulted in an almost identical incidence of chronic encephalopathy as ET. These data are in agreement with those of others, who conducted a meta-analysis of four trials comparing DSRS versus ET (<LINK REF="REF-Spina-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spina 1992a</LINK>). The meta-analysis of DSRS versus ET reported here includes a further report of one of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rikkers-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rikkers 1993</LINK>) that has not changed the overall conclusion. It is not possible to comment on the value of spleno-pancreatic disconnection in DSRS, as there were insufficient data to allow a sub-group analysis. However, when contrasted with data on the other forms of shunt, the apparently low frequency of encephalopathy associated with DSRS suggests that the preservation of prograde portal flow by this procedure is advantageous. Interestingly the survival analysis shows significant heterogeneity. <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 1990</LINK> reported a survival benefit for the ET arm whereas <LINK REF="STD-Rikkers-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rikkers 1993</LINK> produced results in the opposite direction. The likely explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the trial design of the Emory group (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 1990</LINK>) who employed successful shunt rescue in a significant proportion of patients within the ET group (12 patients rebled after ET with a survival rate of 58%).</P>
<P>TIPS resulted in a significantly higher incidence of new or worsened encephalopathy, as well as a significantly higher incidence of chronic encephalopathy. In all instances, however, this was reported to be treatable and did not lead to disabling encephalopathy. A further important complication in the TIPS group was shunt insufficiency or dysfunction as well as shunt occlusion, as a result of thrombosis. Such TIPS failure was the commonest cause of rebleeding in this group. As the follow-up period of most trials was short (under two years), one would expect that the rate of rebleeding would increase over time in the TIPS group. Therefore, vigorous surveillance is necessary for the early recognition and treatment of TIPS dysfunction, which reached 77% at one year in a study from the Barcelona group (<LINK REF="REF-Casado-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casado 1998</LINK>). The development of covered TIPS stents has reduced the frequency of shunt dysfunction and occlusion (Bureau 2004), but trials of covered TIPS versus ET have yet to be undertaken. The drawback of encephalopathy remains with covered TIPS, so such trials might not alter our overall conclusions about the place of shunting. Two previous meta-analyses have compared uncovered TIPS with ET (<LINK REF="REF-Luca-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luca 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papatheodoridis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatheodoridis 1999</LINK>, which has been up-dated by Burroughs et al <LINK REF="REF-Burroughs-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burroughs 2002</LINK>). Although both groups of authors draw similar conclusions about TIPS to ours, greater confidence can be placed in our conclusions because of more robust methods. As most of the outcome variables are time dependent, these are better studied by time-to-event analysis, using the novel techniques described here, rather than as binary outcomes, as in previous meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Buyse-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buyse 1987</LINK>). Furthermore, both groups of authors allude to surgical shunts as an alternative that is preferable in some patients, but present no data to support this assertion (<LINK REF="REF-Luca-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luca 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papatheodoridis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatheodoridis 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>A lower incidence of encephalopathy following DSRS than following TIPS is plausible. DSRS diverts oesophageal, gastric, and splenic blood only from the portal circulation, whereas TIPS also diverts flow from the mesenteric veins, carrying more of the products of digestion and absorption implicated in the pathogenesis of encephalopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Weissenborn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissenborn 1992</LINK>). A randomised trial comparing DSRS with TIPS (140 patients, refractory to medical treatment of banding/medication, less than 65 years, Child-Pugh grade A or B) with follow-up between two and eight years has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2006</LINK>). The results suggest DSRS and TIPS are similarly efficacious in the control of refractory variceal bleeding in Child-Pugh class A and B patients. Reintervention is significantly greater for TIPS (82%) compared with DSRS (11%). Interpretation of data is being performed to address economic comparison (personal communication). Because both procedures have equivalent outcomes, the choice is dependent on available expertise and ability to monitor the shunt and reintervene when needed. These recommendations are in keeping with those derived from studies of an alternative shunt, the narrow diameter (8 mm) portocaval shunt, which is a short shunt (under 3 cm) usually fashioned from ringed polytetrafluoroethylene (<LINK REF="REF-Bismuth-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bismuth 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarfeh-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarfeh 1986</LINK>). This shunt is considered a partial shunt as it maintains pre-existing prograde portal flow, albeit at a reduced level. Randomised clinical trials have shown this shunt to result in significantly lower rates of encephalopathy than TS (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1994</LINK>) and to result in significantly fewer treatment failures than TIPS (<LINK REF="REF-Rosemurgy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosemurgy 1997</LINK>). It has the advantage of being easier to undertake than DSRS, making it more applicable in an emergency setting. The narrow diameter portocaval shunt has not been compared to ET in any randomised clinical trial, so it was not included in this systematic review.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials comparing endoscopic injection sclerotherapy with variceal ligation (banding) indicates that banding is associated with a lower rate of rebleeding, fewer sessions to achieve obliteration, and fewer complications (<LINK REF="REF-Laine-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laine 1995</LINK>). However, at the time of an endoscopy conducted out of hours by a less experienced clinician who is confronted by active bleeding, sclerotherapy is likely to be safer. </P>
<P>We have not attempted to assess the effect of pharmacotherapy in this systematic review, even though a few trials used pharmacotherapy in the ET arm. Sensitivity analyses excluding these trials did not change the overall results, especially in relation to rebleeding. The addition of pharmacotherapy is rational when no portal decompression has been undertaken, even though there is a need for further trials to test this approach. Nor has this systematic review addressed the possibility of pharmacotherapy instead of ET. However, ET is probably more effective in preventing rebleeding than propranolol (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1997</LINK>), and although the complication rate is higher, it is not prohibitive, particularly with banding (<LINK REF="REF-Sarin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jalan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jalan 2000</LINK>). Again, more randomised clinical trials are needed to compare banding with pharmacotherapy.</P>
<P>This systematic review has shown considerable variation in the quality of randomised trials in cirrhotic portal hypertension, the majority of which were unclear with respect to generation of allocation sequence and allocation concealment. This may raise the risk of selection bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). None of the trials performed blinded outcome assessment. This may raise the risk of assessment bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, a number of trials had unclear reporting of follow-up, which may introduce attrition bias. The statistical power of trials is also a major problem in this field, where modest survival advantages are unlikely to be detected unless large-scale, multicentre randomised trials are undertaken incorporating hundreds of patients. Further issues have been highlighted at the Baveno Consensus Conferences (Baveno I, <LINK REF="REF-de-Franchis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Franchis 1992</LINK>; Baveno II, <LINK REF="REF-de-Franchis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Franchis 1996</LINK>; Baveno III, <LINK REF="REF-de-Franchis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Franchis 2001</LINK>), including appropriate forms of randomisation and blinding, as well as the need for accurate data on all evaluable patients, trial events, and costs. In particular the need for accurate data on the timing and assessment of all individual components of Child-Pugh grading should be emphasised, especially for encephalopathy. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Endoscopic therapy should be the first-line treatment in the prevention of variceal rebleeding but in centres with expertise and experience in shunting procedures the latter options should carefully be discussed with the patient. When recurrent rebleeding occurs after endoscopic therapy, selected shunting procedures should be offered at an early stage to those who are fit to undergo these procedures.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We propose adequately powered, adequately conducted, properly reported multicentre trials in this important area. Since a survival benefit has not been shown for either therapy there is a need for larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods. The issue of cost has not been adequately addressed. Patient recruitment will continue to be an impediment and the only way around this is the pooling of resources across different centres with similar interests. Furthermore, trial reporting should be such that it facilitates future meta-analyses. These recommendations are not specific to the comparisons addressed here, but have implications for randomised clinical trials in the management of portal hypertension in general.</P>
<P>Importantly only three trials reported as full publications employed variceal banding as a means of obliterating varices (<LINK REF="STD-Jalan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jalan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-P_x002d_Layrargues-2001" TYPE="STUDY">P-Layrargues 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sauer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sauer 2002</LINK>). We suggest that future trials employ banding in the endoscopic therapy arm.</P>
<P>Future trials should be reported following the CONSORT recommendations<I> </I>(www.consort-statement.org).</P>
