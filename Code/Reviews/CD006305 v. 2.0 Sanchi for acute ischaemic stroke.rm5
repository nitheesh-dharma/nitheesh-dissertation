<P>Sanchi is one of the most widely used medicinal herbs in China but the present evidence does not allow a conclusion to support its routine use for acute ischaemic stroke. There are very few drugs supported for routine use for acute ischaemic stroke by current evidence. Sanchi may be a potential remedy, which acts through several mechanisms. This review of eight trials, involving 660 participants, indicated that sanchi improved short-term outcome. However, the evidence from the small sample size and inferior quality of the studies does not support its routine use for acute ischaemic stroke. Well-designed trials are required.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-02 14:45:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Eight trials involving 660 participants were included. Seven of the eight studies were of poor quality. Follow-up time was less than one month in six trials. Only two trials provided data for the number of participants who were dead or dependent at the end of 28 days of treatment, indicating a significantly lower rate of death and dependency in the sanchi group than in the control group (relative risk (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.45 to 0.88). One trial reported higher Barthel index scores in the sanchi group. Pooled analysis of seven trials indicated that sanchi might improve neurological deficit more than control with a significant difference (RR 0.29, 95%Cl 0.18 to 0.47). The total case fatality rate was lower than 1% indicating that participants probably had mild strokes. Few adverse events were reported. Data were limited in respect of stroke recurrence and quality of life.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-25 09:02:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-02 16:13:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is the third leading cause of death in many countries and the second leading cause of death in China with large economic and human burdens as a consequence. Ischaemic stroke is the most common form of stroke, which is due to a sudden blockage of an artery in the brain. In previous Chinese research, ischaemic stroke accounted for 60% of all strokes (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2003</LINK>) while it was as high as 88% in the report of American Heart Association (<LINK REF="REF-AHA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA 2006</LINK>). Although many drug therapies for acute ischaemic stroke have been studied, current evidence only supports aspirin as a routinely prescribed drug (<LINK REF="REF-Horn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IST-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">IST 1997</LINK>). Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 160 to 300 mg daily, given orally or per rectum in patients who cannot swallow, started within 48 hours of onset of presumed ischaemic stroke has a modest benefit of reducing the risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke without a major risk of early haemorrhagic complications, and improves long-term outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2003</LINK>). Thrombolytic treatment within three hours after ischaemic stroke can reduce the resultant disability but is limited to highly selected patients because of the high risk of bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2003</LINK>). Other frequently used drugs, such as anticoagulants, neuroprotective agents, and corticosteroids, may have some effect on stroke but routine use in acute ischaemic stroke is not supported by the available data (<LINK REF="REF-Gubitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gubitz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saver-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saver 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In China, many Chinese herbal medicines, or their products, may ameliorate the microcirculation and are regularly given to patients suffering from acute ischaemic stroke. However, most of the constituents of the pharmacological preparations used in the trials supporting their use cannot be specified precisely. This is in marked contrast to industrially manufactured pharmacological agents used in Western medicine in which the chemical constituents, their quantities, and the percentage of any impurities or contaminants are very precisely known, and the variation between different production batches is kept within specified limits. Variation between formulations and batches of treatments is an inevitable consequence of the nature of Chinese Traditional Medicine (although the Chinese Government also specifies the limits of variation that are acceptable). This variation is a factor that may contribute to any heterogeneity between different study results. One must also accept that the overall treatment concept for Chinese Traditional Medicine is different to Western medicine and herbal medicines may play an alternative and complementary role to pharmaceutical drugs. A number of clinical trials studying a herbal medicine or its extract for use in a disease may show a trend of efficacy but the conclusion should be given cautiously. Some herbal medicines such as ginkgo biloba (<LINK REF="REF-Zeng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeng 2005</LINK>) and Dan Shen agent (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2004</LINK>) have been assessed for acute ischaemic stroke by Cochrane systematic reviews. There was no convincing evidence to support their routine use to promote recovery after stroke. Some other herbal medicines such as chuanxiong (<LINK REF="REF-Jia-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jia 2006</LINK>), puerarin (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2004</LINK>), and tongxinluo capsule (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2004</LINK>) are also under assessment by Cochrane systematic reviews.</P>
<P>Sanchi (Radix notoginseng; other names include jinbuhuan, tianqi, panlongqi, xueshen, tiansanqi, shensanqi. The commercial brand names of sanchi patent medicine include: xuesetong, xuesaitong, xueshuantong, lulutong, zhengkangnaoming, sanchitongshu, xinnaotai ), the dried root of the Araliaceae plant sanchi (Panax notoginseng (Burk.) FH Chen), is one of the most widely used herbal medicines for acute ischaemic stroke. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) are the main active components of sanchi. Many saponins in Radix notoginseng are similar to those in Radix ginseng but most notoginsenosides are dammarane-type tetracyclic triterpene saponins. There are no oleanane-type saponins and ginsenosides Rb1and Rg1 constitute the major portion of saponins in sanchi. Some saponins only exist in sanchi, such as notoginsenosides R1, R2. The stalk, leaf, flower, and fruit of the sanchi plant contain similar saponins. In addition, sanchi as a herbal medicine contains other active components such as dencichine, amylose, flavonol glycosides, flavones and naphtha (<LINK REF="REF-Bao-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bao 2006</LINK>). Experimental studies indicate that PNS may have the function of dilating cerebral blood vessels, increasing cerebral blood supply (<LINK REF="REF-Ma-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1992</LINK>), suppressing the aggregation of platelets, preventing thrombosis (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2003b</LINK>), reducing serum lipid (<LINK REF="REF-Lv-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lv 2004</LINK>), preventing atherosclerosis (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005a</LINK>), decreasing oxygen free radicals (<LINK REF="REF-Dong-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dong 1990</LINK>) and inflammatory reactions (<LINK REF="STD-Li-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1999a</LINK>), alleviating cerebral edema (<LINK REF="REF-Yao-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yao 2002</LINK>), enhancing cerebral cell proliferation and reducing infarction volume after ischaemic-reperfusion injury (<LINK REF="REF-Hu-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hu-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 2004b</LINK>), relieving pain, calming (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2005b</LINK>), and promoting intelligence and memory (<LINK REF="REF-Guo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guo 2004</LINK>). Of all the PNS, Rg1 has the strongest anti-platelet activity (<LINK REF="REF-Kuo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuo 1990</LINK>). The dencichine, quercitrin, and calcium ion components of sanchi actively stop bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2005b</LINK>). So far there are mainly two types of sanchi agents, one of which is composed of PNS (commercial names: xueshuantong, xuesetong, lulutong, zhengkangnaoming) and another newer agent (commercial name: sanchitongshu capsule) is mainly composed of panaxatriol saponins (PTS) with higher concentrations of Rg1.</P>
<P>Based on pharmacological experiments, sanchi may be effective in preventing and treating stroke as well as promoting recovery. Many clinical trials are conducted each year, however there is uncertainty whether the existing evidence is of sufficient scientific rigor to recommend sanchi agents for routine treatment. We aimed to perform a systematic review based on evidence from randomised controlled studies of sanchi for acute ischaemic stroke to provide the best available evidence to inform clinical practice.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective was to assess the ability of sanchi agents to increase disability-free survival in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. The secondary objectives were to assess the effects of sanchi agents on neurological impairment, quality of life, recurrence of ischaemic stroke, and to determine any adverse reactions.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2008-07-02 16:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sanchi agents with placebo or open control (no placebo) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. We telephone interviewed the study authors if the studies were alleged to be RCTs with poor reporting of methodology and excluded those that were not properly randomised.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trials including patients of any age or sex with acute ischaemic stroke (within 30 days of onset) were eligible. The clinical definition of ischaemic stroke followed the criteria of the World Health Organization, with computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to exclude haemorrhagic stroke. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Sanchi agents versus placebo or no intervention, regardless of administration route, dosage, or length of treatment. Co-interventions were allowed if offered equally to both arms of the trial. </P>
<P>Compound sanchi agents that contained other herbal extracts or other active elements were excluded because the other components may interfere with the evaluation of the efficacy of sanchi. Sanchi agents compared to other active treatment were also excluded.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-07-03 11:58:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The primary outcome measure was the number of patients in each intervention group who were dead or dependent at the end of scheduled follow up. Being dependent was defined as dependent on others in activities of daily living, for example a Barthel Index scored of 60 or less or a modified Rankin Scale graded 3 to 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Sulter-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sulter 1999</LINK>), or similar classification of other scales.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures included the following.<BR/>(1) Adverse events: nausea, vomiting, allergic reaction, tachycardia, haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct, and unexplained organ abnormalities (such as hepatic, haematological, cardiac, and respiratory). The number of patients who developed at least one adverse event listed above would be evaluated.<BR/>(2) Measures of neurological deficit before and after sanchi preparation were administered. The measures could focus on specific impairment (such as motor deficit or cognitive impairment) or global neurological deficit (such as the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, the Canadian Neurological Scale, the European Stroke Scale, the Scandinavian Stroke Scale, or the modified Edinbergh-Scandinavia stroke scale revised by the Second or the Fourth Nationwide Conference of Cerebrovascular Disease).<BR/>(3) Death from all causes: (a) within the first two weeks of treatment, and (b) during the whole follow-up period.<BR/>(4) Recurrent ischaemic stroke during the treatment period and during follow up.<BR/>(5) Quality of life, if assessed by the included trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Comparisons were made between sanchi agents and placebo or no treatment and where the same co-intervention is given in the two arms.</P>
<P>According to the protocol, we planned to perform meta-analyses according to the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). We used the Review Manager software, RevMan 4.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). We presented dichotomous data as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We calculated the RR with 95% CI by both fixed-effect and random-effects models (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). In cases of discrepancy between the two models we would report both results, otherwise we would report only the results from the fixed-effect model. Analyses would be performed by the intention-to-treat principle whenever possible. We would impute missing binary data using the last reported observed response ('carry forward'). We would also perform 'worst-case' scenario analysis (counting patients with incomplete or missing data as treatment failures) to assess the impact of missing data. We only performed meta-analysis if studies were clinically similar enough, otherwise we would analyse the studies separately.</P>
<P>We tested the overall effect using the Z score with significance set at P &lt; 0.05. We quantified heterogeneity with I squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>), and it was judged substantial if it was greater than 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This can be interpreted as the percentage of variation observed between the studies that is attributable to between-study differences rather than sampling error (chance). We planned to assess possible sources of heterogeneity by sensitivity and subgroup analyses as described below. We planned to test publication bias by using the funnel plot or other corrective analytical methods depending on the number of clinical trials included in the systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>We planned to perform subgroup analyses in order to explore effect size difference using the method of Deeks et al (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). We considered subgroups according to:<BR/>(1) intervention - different constituent of sanchi agents, for instance, pure extract or all the components of sanchi; the route of administration (oral or intravenous); dose (low and high, based on data);<BR/>(2) the timing of treatment after stroke onset (that is, within 72 hours, 14 days, 30 days);<BR/>(3) the timing of outcome measurement, which may vary between studies. In general, our aim was to group outcomes into three stages for analysis - early (immediately after treatment course, within one week), medium term (within eight weeks after treatment), and long term (beyond eight weeks after treatment);<BR/>(4) severity of disease (post hoc).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We planned to explore possible reasons for heterogeneity in studies and examine the effects of excluding study subgroups by repeating the analysis:</P>
<P>(1) taking account of quality, as specified above;<BR/>(2) excluding unpublished studies (if there are any);<BR/>(3) excluding any trials with long duration or large studies to establish how much they dominate the results;<BR/>(4) excluding trials using the following filters: diagnostic criteria, language of publication, source of funding (industry versus other), and country.</P>
<P>However, we could not perform meaningful sensitivity analyses in this review because of the small number of trials.</P>

<P>We retrieved a total of 131 alleged RCTs of sanchi in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke. We excluded 119 trials for the following reasons (<I>see </I>
<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>): sanchi preparations were compared with other active medicines in 71 trials; the interventions were sanchi preparations plus other active medicines (chemical drugs or other herbal components) compared to different control interventions in 25 trials; the comparisons were of different commercial brands of sanchi or different routes of administration in three trials; not all the participants were diagnosed with ischaemic stroke in four trials; duration of stroke onset to randomisation was longer than one month in two trials; 19 trials were excluded because of inappropriate randomisation after confirmation by telephone interviewing the primary authors of 29 alleged RCTs without a description of the randomisation procedure in the publications. Some of the trials were excluded for more than one reason listed above and thus a trial could appear more times in this list due to multiple exclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Four trials are awaiting assessment because we failed to contact the authors to find out the randomisation procedure they used (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>). Therefore, we included eight RCTs involving 660 participants in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000c" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>); the data for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) were still unpublished (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>All the included studies are of randomised controlled parallel study designs. One of the trials was a multicentre, double-blind trial (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>). All the trials were conducted in China.</P>
<P>The number of participants in each trial ranged from 40 to 140. One study enrolled participants within 24 hours of stroke onset (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2003</LINK>), one within 36 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>), one within 48 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>), two within 72 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2000c" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>) and three within one month (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>). All the participants were given brain CT or MRI examinations to exclude haemorrhage. The age of the participants in the included studies ranged from 47 to 81 years. There were more males than females. Baseline characteristics, including gender, age, and severity of disease, were comparative in all the studies except one (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>), in which the neurological function score and the Barthel index were significantly higher in the treatment group. Details of past history and accompanying diseases were assessed in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000c" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>), and the size of the infarction area was reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2003</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>) mentioned that none of the participants in the two arms were in a coma, or had severe intracranial hypertension, abnormality of the liver, kidneys or haemopoietic system, or severe diabetes mellitus.</P>
<P>Six trials studied panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), the other two (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>) studied panaxatriol saponins (PTS), both extracted from sanchi, to compare with no treatment or placebo. Co-interventions were given equally to both arms. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) mentioned aspirin as part of the co-interventions in both groups and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) mentioned antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy or both. Co-interventions in the other studies were treatments for controlling symptoms. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>) used PNS capsules (xuesaitong soft capsule) 240 mg per day for 28 days. Five studies used injections of panax notoginseng saponins as the treatment intervention, with dosage ranging from 200 mg to 525 mg per day and scheduled treatment period ranging from 14 to 20 days. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>) used PTS capsules (sanchitongshu capsule) 200 mg each time, three times a day for 28 days. Sanchi preparations used in the included studies were produced by different companies.</P>
<P>The follow-up period in most studies was less than one month. These trials ended when treatment discontinued. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) followed participants up to three months. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>) did not mention how long follow up was but deaths were reported up to one month after drug discontinuation.</P>
<P>Two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>) reported the number of participants in each intervention group who were dead or dependent at the end of scheduled follow up, according to the classification of the degree of disability regulated by the Fourth Nationwide Conference of Cerebrovascular Disease. Patients with degrees 4 to 7 are dependent on others in activities of daily living, similar to the 3 to 5 grade of the Rankin scale. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) reported the mean degree of dependency. One study (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) measured the Barthel Index before and after the study but did not report the number of participants who scored lower than 60. Neurological deficit before and after treatment was measured with the European Stroke Scale (ESS) in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) and with the modified Edinburgh-Scandinavian Stroke Scale (MESSS) in the other seven trials. Seven studies provided data for the proportion of participants with improvement in neurological deficit according to the MESSS. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>) measured the mean decrease in score of the neurological deficit (MDSND) at one, two, three and four weeks after randomisation. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) reported the mean neurological deficit score (MESSS). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>) reported deaths and recurrence of stroke during follow up after one month of randomisation. One study (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) reported events of adverse reactions, two studies mentioned that no adverse reaction was found in either group (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>).

One study (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) used computer software to generate random numbers. The other four studies mentioned 'random allocation', but there was no description about which methods were used. After telephoning the trial authors, we learned that they used random number table (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2000c" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) random numbers were packed in sealed opaque envelopes. None of the other studies mentioned allocation concealment in the articles. After telephone interviewing the authors, we learned that two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) used an opaque and sealed envelope to conceal the allocation sequence. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000c" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>) did not use any measure to conceal the allocation sequence. The author of one study said she forgot the details of the methodology performed in the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>). We failed to contact the authors of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>) for information about allocation concealment.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) used double blinding of participants and investigators. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>) mentioned single blinding of participants. The other studies did not mention blinding. After telephone interviewing the authors we learned that four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000c" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) used single blinding of participants, and one (<LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>) used blinding of care givers and outcome assessors. The methodology in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>) might be questionable as we could obtain no definite information from the author by telephone interview.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Withdrawal, drop out and loss-to-follow-up rate, and intention to treat</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) reported withdrawals and exclusions but intention-to-treat analyses were carried out. None of the other studies mentioned any withdrawals, drop outs or losses to follow up, nor intention-to-treat analysis. The authors of two studies told us by telephone that there might be some drop outs or withdrawals but they could not provide the primary data (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore, only one of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) was classified as of high methodological quality according to the above criteria, and the methodological quality of the other trials was generally poor with a high risk of bias. However, in this study there was no balance for prognostic factors, and those in the treatment group were in better health. This could certainly result in a better outcome in the treated group at the end of follow up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Death or dependence at final follow up</HEADING>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>) involving 165 participants reported the number being dependent according to the fourth Nationwide Conference of Cerebrovascular Disease and reported no cases of death, indicating that treatment with sanchi agents was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of being dead or dependent at the end of 28 days of treatment (RR 0.63, 95%Cl 0.45 to 0.88) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). However, no trial reported activities of daily living after one month as a longer-term effect. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) reported the mean degree of dependency, according to the Fourth Nationwide Conference of Cerebrovascular Disease, in which the larger the number was, the more dependent the patients were, indicating that the mean degree of dependency was significantly lower when using sanchi injection than not using it at the end of 15 days after randomisation (MD -1.03, 95% Cl -1.71 to -0.35) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) reported the mean score (MD 17.22, 95% Cl 12.76 to 21.68) and mean increased score of the Barthel index (the higher the Barthel Index score, the better activities of daily living) (MD 5.4, 95% Cl 0.97 to 9.83) after treatment indicating that activities of daily living were significantly improved in the sanchitongshu capsule group than in the control group after treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>

<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) there were eight participants in the treatment group and six participants in the control group who had slight adverse events such as stomach discomfort, nausea, and diarrhoea. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>) mentioned that there were no adverse events in either group. The other studies did not mention adverse reactions. There was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.54) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of neurological deficit before and after sanchi preparation is administered</HEADING>
<P>We made a small change in this outcome measure from the published protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2007</LINK>) by including continuous data, because continuous data, such as decreased MESSS score, could also reflect the efficacy of different interventions in improving neurological deficit.</P>
<P>Seven studies involving 597 participants reported the number of participants who achieved an improvement of their neurological deficit (the higher the MESSS score, the more severe the neurological deficit, a MESSS score reduced by more than 18% was achieving improvement). The overall result indicated that there were significantly more participants who achieved no improvement in neurological deficit in the control group than in the sanchi group after 14 to 28 days of treatment (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.47) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). There was no significant heterogeneity between studies, with I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 0.43. The result was not significantly changed (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.54) by sensitivity analysis after excluding one unpublished study (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
<P>To investigate the effect size differences, we carried out subgroup analyses. In the subgroup analysis of the different constituents of drugs, there were no significant differences between PNS (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.55) and PTS (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.61) compared to control in improving neurological deficit favouring treatment in both subgroups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). In the subgroup analysis of treatment within 72 hours, data were available from the four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000c" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>) which used sanchi injection. No data were available for the subgroup of treatment within seven to 14 days. In the subgroup of treatment within 30 days of stroke onset, data were available from the three trials which used sanchi capsule (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>). So the results of subgroup analysis according to different timing of treatment were the same as those according to different drug types (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). Sanchi capsule given within one month of stroke onset (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.45) was more efficacious in improving neurological deficit than sanchi injection given within 72 hours of stroke onset (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.80) compared to control, but the effect size difference was of no significance. Not all the studies classified the severity of stroke, so we did not perform that subgroup analysis. Timing of outcome measures was medium term (14 to 28 days) for all the studies which provided data for neurological deficit, so we did not carry out a subgroup analysis according to different timing of outcome measures.</P>
<P>In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Peng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2004</LINK>) which reported the mean MESSS, the score for neurological deficit was shown to be lower in the sanchi injection group than in the control group after treatment, with statistical significance (MD -5.39, 95% CI -7.76 to -3.02) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) indicating participants in the sanchi group had better neurological function after treatment. In the study (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) which reported mean ESS (the higher the score, the better the neurological function), the score for neurological function in the sanchi group was much higher than in the control group indicating that participants in the sanchi group had better neurological function after treatment (MD 12.36, 95% Cl 9.5 to 15.22) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>) which reported mean decreased score of neurological deficit, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups for improvement of neurological deficit at the end of the fourth week (MD 0.5, 95% Cl -1.09 to 2.09) after randomisation. The study (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>) which reported mean increased score of ESS showed significant difference in improvement of neurological function favouring the sanchi group (MD 7.78, 95% Cl 4.76 to 10.80) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>), a subgroup analysis of disease severity was performed. There was no statistically significant difference in improvement of neurological deficit between participants with different severity of stroke treated with sanchi although the moderate stroke group (MESSS 16 to 30) showed a significantly better result treated with sanchi (MD 2.51 95% Cl 0.35 to 4.67) while the mild stroke group (MESSS 0 to 15) (MD -1.44 95% Cl -5.03 to 2.15) and the severe stroke group (MESSS 31 to 45) (MD -0.11 95% Cl -3.37 to 3.15) did not show a difference (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>).</P>

The pooled analysis indicated that sanchi preparations had better treatment effect in improving neurological deficit than control. However, the inferior quality of all the trials and the asymmetric funnel plot showed that there might be a high risk of bias in assessing the treatment effect. The mortality was extremely low in the studies indicating that the researchers tended to choose patients with mild stroke. Due to the limited number of trials, the small sample size and poor reporting, there was not enough evidence to assess outcome of death or dependency at the end of follow up, adverse reaction, stroke recurrence, or quality of life . We cannot conclude which drug form or route to be more effective, when to begin treatment with sanchi after stroke onset, what degree of disease severity achieves the best treatment effect, or the difference of shorter-term or longer-term outcome.</P>
<P>The duration of follow up in the trials was generally short. Most of the included studies except two (<LINK REF="STD-He-2007" TYPE="STUDY">He 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>) ended after treatment discontinuation within one month. As a result, the follow-up time was insufficient to assess the long-term effects of death and dependency at the end of follow up over two months. It has been increasingly recognised that high-quality trials in acute stroke should measure outcome at the level of death and disability as well as quality of life which are considered to be of primary importance for the patients. However, all the included trials focused on improvement of neurological deficit in the short term. Only two trials reported the number of participants who were dead or dependent and one study reported the mean Barthel index at 28 days. No data were available for long-term death and dependency or quality of life.</P>
<P>Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1996</LINK>) reported three cases of death and there were no deaths in the other included studies from the data they provided. As a result, the case fatality rate was very low (less than 1%: three deaths out of 660 cases of acute ischaemic stroke in the included studies) compared with that of many other trials of acute ischaemic stroke, such as the CAST trial in China (<LINK REF="REF-CAST-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAST 1997</LINK>), while case fatality in the IST study was close to 10% (<LINK REF="REF-IST-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">IST 1997</LINK>). That the case fatality rate was so low in this review probably meant that only participants with mild clinical signs were entered in the studies. The trial investigators in some trials may tend to choose patients with mild stroke to avoid potentially severe adverse events, because sanchi was used alone rather than in combination with the classic antiplatelet drugs and participants may be exposed to higher risk of stroke recurrence and worse prognosis. Furthermore, most participants were followed up within a short time and deaths in the longer term were not reported.</P>
<P>There was a high risk of bias in assessing treatment effect in this review because of the inferior quality of the included trials. Poor reporting of methodology is common in clinical trials conducted by a single unit in China rather than multi-centre trials which usually have well designed methodology and reporting. However, we did not find any published multi-centre trials with a large sample size to fulfil our inclusion criteria. There have been many alleged RCTs of sanchi in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke reported every year, but only a few met our inclusion criteria. We excluded most of the trials because sanchi was compared to other active drugs which had no confirmed effect or because sanchi was confounded by other active medicinal components. Then there were still many alleged RCTs which appeared to fulfil our inclusion criteria, yet we only selected very few because we learned by telephone interviewing the primary authors that most of the studies adopted inappropriate randomisation procedures to generate the allocation sequence and most of the authors did not know what true randomisation was. Of the several included studies, randomisation was far from adequate because of the failure to conceal allocation. Empirical research has shown that a lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with a high risk of selection bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Concerning blinding, most of the included studies performed single blinding for participants. The authors told us that participants were blinded because the study investigators did not tell them what groups they were allocated to but there were no measures to ensure blinding. Study investigators were exposed to the assigned interventions which may lead to performance bias. The people responsible for assessing outcomes were aware of the assigned interventions which may lead to detection bias. The number of participants was imbalanced between the two groups in two of our included trials. The authors told us there were some losses of participants but could not provide the primary data, thus no intention-to-treat analysis was performed. This can cause attrition bias. None of the included studies evaluated sample size and the small sample size of each trial increased the risk of bias. The asymmetric funnel plot further indicated that publication bias might exist.</P>
<P>Most of the sanchi preparations in the included studies were panax notoginseng saponins extracted from the sanchi plant. However, they were produced by different companies. Due to the variability in production procedure, the concentration, purity, and efficacy might differ to some degree. The dosage adopted in these trials also differed and there was no consensus on small, standard, or large dosage. Thus we were unable to do subgroup analyses regarding the effect size of different dosages.<BR/>

<BR/>
In all the included trials, co-interventions were given to both treatment and control groups. However, the co-interventions might vary among participants and be imbalanced between the two groups, which could also affect the study results. It is a little confusing that in four studies antiplatelet drugs were not mentioned as part of collateral treatment, as aspirin has been recommended for early routine use in patients with ischaemic stroke because it has a modest benefit of reducing the risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke without a major risk of early haemorrhagic complications and improves long-term outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2003</LINK>). It may be hazardous to expose participants in the control group to a higher risk of stroke recurrence by not giving them antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, co-intervention without antiplatelet drugs may decrease the external validity of the evidence and may cause ethical problems. Aspirin should be given to both groups as a co-intervention.</P>
<P>Although pooled analyses were performed in this review, interpretation of the results must be cautious due to the inferior quality of the included trials and the small sample size. There is a need for well-designed, larger RCTs of sanchi preparations in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
<P>It is good news that the Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Centre of the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Cochrane Centre, the Ministry of Education Virtual Research Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine, the Chinese Clinical Trial Register, the West China Hospital of Sichuan University, as well as 48 professional medical journals in China, have taken the first step to issue a Joint Statement of Establishing Chinese Clinical Trial Registration and Publishing System which will promote the transparency and quality of Chinese clinical trials. If all clinical trials register and all the journals only publish the registered trials, then study quality will be better guaranteed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-07-07 10:23:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The effect of treatment with sanchi is implausibly large in our review but the methodology of the studies is poor (the trials were either not double blind or not balanced for prognostic factors) and the results are hardly credible. There is no clear evidence to suggest benefit of sanchi in acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-23 10:44:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is a need for more randomised clinical trials with high methodological quality, large numbers of participants and good reporting to provide stronger evidence. In particular, such trials should assure adequate randomisation and allocation concealment, blinding of participants, drug providers and outcome assessors, good reporting of methodology and losses of participants using intention-to-treat analysis. In addition, they should have appropriate control interventions using placebo or no treatment. No confounded medicine should be added to the treatment intervention. Co-intervention should be concordant in the two groups in a trial. Basic drug therapy for ischaemic stroke, such as aspirin, may be given to both groups. Follow up should be longer. Functional outcome, such as death or dependency at the end of follow up over two months, should be measured as the primary outcome. Sample size should be large enough to provide adequate statistical power. Finally, we recommend all clinical trials are appropriately registered before they start, for example on the Chinese Clinical Trial Register's website.</P>
