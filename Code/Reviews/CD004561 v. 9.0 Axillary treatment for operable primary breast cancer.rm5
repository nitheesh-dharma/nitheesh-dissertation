The review also aimed to learn whether complete removal of all underarm nodes could be replaced by procedures that remove only a small number of lymph nodes.</P><P><B>Background</B></P><P>Surgical removal of underarm (axillary) lymph nodes is often part of the initial surgical treatment for patients with operable breast cancer. If cancer has spread to these lymph nodes, patients are advised to undergo additional treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, to help treat their disease. If cancer has not spread to these lymph nodes, patients are spared extra treatments (with extra side effects). Surgical removal of lymph nodes can lead to short-term surgical complications (such as infection and wound healing problems) and long-term problems (such as shoulder stiffness, pain and arm swelling (lymphoedema)) when fluid accumulation causes restricted function and discomfort.</P><P>Modern strategies use a stepwise approach by first removing a small number of nodes and removing the others only if cancer is found at the first stage. This first stage can consist of &#8216;random&#8217; axillary sampling, whereby the surgeon removes a small number of nodes (typically four) that can be felt. Alternatively, surgeons can use sentinel node techniques to identify those nodes most likely to contain cancer, leading to removal of as few nodes as possible. For patients with cancer in the sentinel nodes (or sample), complete removal of all underarm lymph nodes (axillary lymph node dissection) is usually recommended; however, radiotherapy to the axilla can also be given to obliterate any cancer cells in the lymph nodes. Some studies have explored alternative approaches such as no surgical treatment to the underarm nodes.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>The evidence is current to March 2015. The review identified 26 randomised controlled trials that compared axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with alternative approaches involving less axillary surgery. Patients in these trials had operable primary breast cancer, and some trials included patients with palpably enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Ten trials including 3849 patients compared ALND with no axillary surgery. Six trials including 1559 patients compared ALND with axillary sampling. Seven trials including 9426 patients compared ALND with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Four trials including 2585 patients compared ALND (with or without radiotherapy) with radiotherapy alone.<BR/></P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>Moderate-quality evidence suggests that patients treated with approaches involving lesser axillary surgery (such as axillary sampling or SLNB) do not have a reduced chance of survival compared with those treated with ALND. Moderate-quality evidence indicates that overall survival is slightly reduced in patients who receive radiotherapy (but no axillary surgery) when compared with ALND. If survival is assumed to be 81% five years after surgery with ALND, then the evidence suggests it would be between 77% and 81% after treatment with radiotherapy alone.</P><P>Moderate-quality evidence suggests that patients who have no axillary lymph nodes removed at all are at increased risk of locoregional recurrence (regrowth of cancer, in the breast, mastectomy scar area or underarm glands). If it is assumed that 86% of patients receiving ALND are free of locoregional recurrence five years after surgery, evidence suggests that the corresponding figure for patients who have no lymph nodes removed at all would be between 66% and 76%. For patients treated with axillary sampling, low-quality evidence suggests that between 73% and 87% would be free of locoregional recurrence at five years.</P><P>Axillary recurrence rates were reported only in SLNB versus ALND trials, and researchers remain uncertain about the best treatment for this outcome because rates were very low (occurring in less than 1% of patients).</P><P>Low-quality evidence suggests that patients treated with ALND are at increased risk of lymphoedema compared with those treated with SLNB or no axillary surgery. On the basis of this evidence, we would expect that out of every 1000 patients receiving ALND, 132 would experience lymphoedema at one year after surgery, compared with between 22 and 115 of those receiving SLNB. Other long-term harms such as pain, impaired arm movement and numbness were also more likely with ALND than with SLNB.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-10-13 12:04:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-05 14:42:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Axillary surgery is an established part of the management of primary breast cancer.

Studies were at low or unclear risk of selection bias. Blinding was not done, but this was only considered a source of bias for outcomes with potential for subjectivity in measurements. We found no RCTs of axillary sampling versus SLNB, axillary sampling versus no axillary surgery or SLNB versus no axillary surgery.</P><P><B><I>No axillary surgery versus ALND</I></B><BR/>Ten trials involving 3849 participants compared no axillary surgery versus ALND. Moderate quality evidence showed no important differences between overall survival of women in the two groups (HR 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.17; 3849 participants; 10 studies) although no axillary surgery increased the risk of locoregional recurrence (HR ranging from 1.10 to 3.06; 20,863 person-years of follow-up; four studies). It was uncertain whether no surgery increased the risk of distant metastasis compared with ALND (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.30; 946 participants; two studies). Low-quality evidence indicated no axillary surgery decreased the risk of lymphoedema compared with ALND (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.43; 1714 participants; four studies).</P><P><B><I>Axillary sampling versus ALND</I></B><BR/>Six trials involving 1559 participants compared axillary sampling versus ALND. Low-quality evidence indicated similar effectiveness of axillary sampling compared with ALND in terms of overall survival (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.21; 967 participants; three studies) but it was unclear whether axillary sampling led to increased risk of local recurrence compared with ALND (HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.12; 1404 participants; three studies). The relative effectiveness of axillary sampling and ALND for locoregional recurrence (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20; 406 participants; one study) and distant metastasis was uncertain (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.49; 406 participants; one study). Lymphoedema was less likely after axillary sampling than after ALND (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.81; 80 participants; one study).</P><P><B><I>SLNB versus ALND</I></B><BR/>Seven trials involving 9426 participants compared SLNB with ALND. Moderate-quality evidence showed similar overall survival following SLNB compared with ALND (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.25; 6352 participants; three studies; moderate-quality evidence). Differences in local recurrence (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.77; 516 participants; one study), locoregional recurrence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.24; 5611 participants; one study) and distant metastasis (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.53; 516 participants; one study) were uncertain. However, studies showed little absolute difference in the aforementioned outcomes. Lymphoedema was less likely after SLNB than ALND (OR ranged from 0.04 to 0.60; three studies; 1965 participants; low-quality evidence). Three studies including 1755 participants reported quality of life: Investigators in two studies found quality of life better after SLNB than ALND, and in the other study observed no difference.</P><P><B><I>RT versus ALND</I></B><BR/>Four trials involving 2585 participants compared RT alone with ALND (with or without RT)<I>. </I>High-quality evidence indicated that overall survival was reduced among women treated with radiotherapy alone compared with those treated with ALND (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.21; 2469 participants; four studies), and local recurrence was less likely in women treated with radiotherapy than in those treated with ALND (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; 22,256 person-years of follow-up; four studies). Risk of distant metastasis was similar for radiotherapy alone as for ALND (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.25; 1313 participants; one study), and whether lymphoedema was less likely after RT alone than ALND remained uncertain (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.44; 200 participants; one study).</P><P><B><I>Less surgery versus ALND</I></B><BR/>When combining results from all trials, treatment involving less surgery was associated with reduced overall survival compared with ALND (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.16; 12,864 participants; 19 studies). Whether local recurrence was reduced with less axillary surgery when compared with ALND was uncertain (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.09; 24,176 participant-years of follow up; eight studies). Locoregional recurrence was more likely with less surgery than with ALND (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.78; 26,880 participant-years of follow-up; seven studies). Whether risk of distant metastasis was increased after less axillary surgery compared with ALND was uncertain (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.20; 2665 participants; five studies).

The Union Internationale Contre le Cancer staging system for breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-UICC-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">UICC 1987</LINK>) reflects how, when left untreated, cancer cells may spread locally to breast tissue and lymph glands in the axilla (stages I to III) and through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body (stage IV).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-06 19:50:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Removal of regional lymph nodes during attempts to achieve a curative excision for management of most cancers has a long history (<LINK REF="REF-Halsted-1895" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halsted 1895</LINK>). Its aim consists of both local control of axillary disease and determination of stage to permit appropriate adjuvant therapy. Axillary surgery is a key component of breast cancer management, with UK clinical guidelines specifying that minimal surgery (preferably sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)) should be performed to stage the axilla for patients with early invasive breast cancer and clinically negative axillary lymph nodes (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>).</P><P>Several alternative approaches to axillary surgery may be used.</P><OL><LI>Axillary clearance - removal of all nodal tissue in the axilla by dissection up to the level of the axillary vein (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1998</LINK>) - was previously the standard practice in many units. Full axillary clearance carries increased morbidity when compared with breast surgery alone, with 10% to 15% incidence of chronic arm lymphoedema (<LINK REF="REF-Kissin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kissin 1986</LINK>), 9% incidence of late seroma, 2.2% infection rate, 12% breast oedema and 0.3% risk of damage to the long thoracic nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Senofski-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senofski 1991</LINK>). Other problems include shoulder stiffness ("frozen shoulder"), which can be severe (<LINK REF="REF-Kissin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kissin 1986</LINK>). Immediate axillary node clearance is not considered appropriate in the absence of evidence of cancer spread determined by biopsy before surgery.</LI><LI>Axillary node sampling - removal of four or five axillary nodes from the lower axilla (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1998</LINK>) - involves removal of individual nodes, leaving axillary fat and most nodes and lymphatics intact. As a result, virtually none of the complications listed for axillary clearance are associated with this procedure. Women whose sampled axillary nodes contain cancer may need subsequent axillary clearance or radiotherapy. This previously popular approach was once considered appropriate.</LI><LI>Sentinel lymph node biopsy (<LINK REF="REF-Kelley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelley 1998</LINK>) - a procedure in which the lymphatic pathway from the site of breast cancer is tracked with the use of a radio-isotope or blue lymphatic dye - allows biopsy of the first lymph node or nodes (sentinel node).

Quality of life data were limited to three trials. Sentinel lymph node trials provided limited data on long-term overall survival and breast cancer recurrence; these trials were often designed to compare quality of life and adverse effects. Substantial heterogeneity in adverse event trial results was often due to differences among adverse event definitions between trials.</P><P>Some trials reported data in a way that precluded inclusion in the time-to-event meta-analysis, and although we contacted study authors, we obtained no additional data.</P><P>Applicability of some of the comparisons in this review to current breast cancer practice is questionable, particularly for comparisons involving no axillary surgery. Use of adjuvant therapies differs between current practice and many of the included trials - more effective adjuvant systemic therapies are available today. Similarly, RT regimens used in the older trials are most likely less effective and are associated with more side effects:</P><P>Patients with breast cancer today are likely to differ from those who participated in older trials, and breast cancer is more likely to be detected at an earlier stage.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-12-13 14:05:59 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson"><P>The included studies were at low or unclear risk of selection bias. Selection bias was typically unclear because trial publications did not fully report methods of random sequence generation or allocation concealment used and study authors did not reply when we contacted them to request additional information about conduct of the trial. We performed sensitivity analyses for trials with adequate allocation concealment and found that these results generally were consistent with findings of the main analyses.</P><P>Risk of attrition bias tended to be lower for survival and for breast cancer recurrence than for adverse events. This sometimes occurred because adverse event assessments were done for a subset of the trial population. This subgroup of participants assessed for adverse events could be systematically different from the trial population as a whole, especially in the case of assessment for long-term adverse events when patients may have died or may have been too sick to participate.</P><P>The included trials did not include blinding (and it was probably infeasible), but this was considered a source of bias only for outcomes with potential subjectivity in measurement (i.e. breast cancer recurrence and adverse events). Detection bias could lead to overestimation of adverse events in patients with more extensive axillary surgery. Similarly, patients receiving less extensive axillary surgery could be checked more carefully for breast cancer recurrence.</P><P>For these reasons, we downgraded the quality of the evidence for adverse effects (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-10-11 12:08:12 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson"><P>The meta-analyses of time-to-event outcomes conducted for this review used the fixed-effect model because only fixed-effect meta-analytical methods are available in <LINK REF="REF-RevMan" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan</LINK> for &#8216;O&#8211;E' and 'Variance&#8217; outcomes.

This is particularly the case for <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK> (which compares overall survival with more surgery vs less surgery), in which the underlying assumption of the fixed-effect model is unlikely to be true, given the different types of interventions and patient populations included.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-07 10:53:04 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P><LINK REF="REF-Kell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kell 2010</LINK> reported a meta-analysis of seven trials of SLNB versus axillary clearance (<LINK REF="STD-Addenbrookes-2" TYPE="STUDY">Addenbrookes 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ALMANAC" TYPE="STUDY">ALMANAC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GIVOM-Sentinella" TYPE="STUDY">GIVOM Sentinella</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milan" TYPE="STUDY">Milan</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SNAC" TYPE="STUDY">SNAC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ACOSOG-Z0011" TYPE="STUDY">ACOSOG Z0011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSABP-B_x002d_32" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP B-32</LINK>).

The current review observed an increase in overall mortality with RT with no axillary surgery compared with axillary clearance, but the absolute difference at five years was on the order of a few percent (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>), and had a random-effects model been possible, greater uncertainty would surround this estimate.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-08 00:58:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-12-08 00:58:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review confirms the evidence base for the current widespread approach to staging of disease and treatment of the axilla in patients with operable early breast cancer. Evidence showing a small but significant survival benefit with ALND (when compared with no axillary surgery) and the impact that this procedure has on systemic therapy planning and provision of prognostic information is balanced against increased incidence of harmful side effects, particularly lymphoedema. Full axillary clearance of the clinically and radiologically uninvolved axilla is no longer considered acceptable practice. In the absence of any direct comparisons, both sentinel node biopsy and axillary node sampling are considered appropriate choices for axillary staging followed by treatment with surgery or RT.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-07 11:27:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Emerging evidence (<LINK REF="STD-ACOSOG-Z0011" TYPE="STUDY">ACOSOG Z0011</LINK>) suggests that overall survival is not improved by further surgical lymph node clearance of the axilla in a subset of patients undergoing breast conservation with surgery and RT to the breast, and systemic therapy has resulted in revised American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines pertaining to treatment when one or two sentinel nodes contain metastases (<LINK REF="REF-Lyman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyman 2014</LINK>).

The review authors recognise that, unlike comparisons 1 through 6, comparison 7 does not address the effectiveness of axillary surgery. A regimen in comparison 1 - full axillary surgery plus radiotherapy - was standard practice but has been largely discontinued because of the illogic of irradiating the axilla subsequent to removal of the lymph nodes. The regimen in comparison 7 - no axillary surgery with radiotherapy - reflects more current practice; although it is considered irrelevant to a younger, fitter population, some clinicians still consider it a viable treatment option for older women.</P></PUBLIC_NOTES></MAIN_TEXT><STUDIES_AND_REFERENCES MODIFIED="2018-01-08 00:10:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">

Sentinel lymph node biopsy with the use of radio-tracer has been routinely performed in (c)N0 patients in our institute for ten years by now. In 2014 we initiated a study to evaluate the role of the sentinel node biopsy in patients who had undergone neoadjuvant systemic therapy."</P><P>Study author emailed again on 13/7/15, as no clear response had been received to the second question in our original email, i.e. exactly which interventions did patients receive to the axilla (e.g. what is a Patey-Dyson modified mastectomy). Our second email was re-sent on 17/8/15, as no response had been received. To date, we have received no response.</P></CHAR_NOTES></AWAITING_CHAR><FOOTNOTES/></CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES><CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES MODIFIED="2017-10-11 12:08:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson" SORT_BY="STUDY" USER_DEF_1_ENABLED="NO" USER_DEF_2_ENABLED="NO" USER_DEF_3_ENABLED="NO"><ONGOING_CHAR MODIFIED="2017-10-11 12:08:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson" STUDY_ID="STD-AMAROS"><CHAR_STUDY_NAME MODIFIED="2017-10-11 12:08:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson"><P><LINK REF="STD-AMAROS" TYPE="STUDY">AMAROS</LINK></P></CHAR_STUDY_NAME><CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2016-12-07 17:49:16 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P><U>Study design</U>: RCT (multi-centre, non-inferiority)</P><P><U>Country</U>: Europe</P></CHAR_METHODS><CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2016-12-07 17:49:42 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P><U>Inclusion criteria</U>: patients with operable unifocal invasive breast cancer (5-30 mm) and clinically node negative</P><P><U>Exclusion criteria</U>: metastatic disease, previous treatment of the axilla by surgery or radiotherapy, previous treatment of cancer (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin and in situ carcinoma of the cervix), pregnancy</P></CHAR_PARTICIPANTS><CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-07 17:50:22 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Women were randomised before surgery and SLNB to the treatment they would receive if their SLNB proved positive.
