<TITLE>Non-corticosteroid treatment for nephrotic syndrome in children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-10 16:30:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Children with nephrotic syndrome lose excessive amounts of protein from their bloodstream into their urine, causing swelling, especially in the face, stomach and legs. The risk of infection also increases because important proteins used by children's immune systems have been lost. Corticosteroid drugs, such as prednisone, can stop protein loss, but often happens again (relapse). Giving children further corticosteroids can lead to poor growth, cataracts, osteoporosis and high blood pressure.</P>
<P>To find out if there was evidence about non-corticosteroid drugs for children with nephrotic syndrome, and to assess what the benefits and harms of these drugs were, we analysed 32 studies that enrolled 1443 children. The studies compared several drugs and found that cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, cyclosporin, levamisole and rituximab reduced the risk of relapse in children with frequently relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome.</P>
<P>We found that more studies are needed that compare different drug treatments to determine how these medicines should be used in children with nephrotic syndrome.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-17 12:35:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>About 80% to 90% of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) have relapses. Of these children, around half relapse frequently, and are at risk of adverse effects from corticosteroids. Non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications are used to prolong periods of remission in these children; however, these medications have significant potential adverse effects. Currently, there is no consensus about the most appropriate second line agent in children who are steroid sensitive, but who continue to relapse. This is the third update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2005 and 2008.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-17 16:53:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 32 studies (1443 children) of which one study is still ongoing. In the 31 studies with data, risk of bias assessment indicated that 11 (37%) and 16 (53%) studies were at low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment respectively. Six (29%) studies were at low risk of performance and detection bias. Twenty seven (87%) and 19 (60%) studies were at low risk of incomplete and selective reporting respectively. Alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil) significantly reduced the risk of relapse at six to 12 months (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.60) and 12 to 24 months (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.46) compared with prednisone alone. There was no significant difference in relapse risk at two years between chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.13). There was no significant difference at one year between intravenous and oral cyclophosphamide (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.29). Cyclosporin was as effective as cyclophosphamide (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.35) and chlorambucil (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.53) at the end of therapy while levamisole (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.89) was more effective than steroids alone. However the effects of cyclosporin and levamisole were not sustained once treatment was stopped. In one small study cyclosporin significantly reduced the relapse rate compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MD 0.75, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.49). Limited data from a cross-over study suggested that cyclosporin was more effective than mycophenolate mofetil in maintaining remission. In steroid- and cyclosporin-dependent disease, rituximab significantly reduced the risk of relapse at three months compared with conventional therapy. Mizoribine and azathioprine were no more effective than placebo or prednisone alone in maintaining remission.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-10-17 12:35:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight-week courses of cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil and prolonged courses of cyclosporin and levamisole reduce the risk of relapse in children with relapsing SSNS compared with corticosteroids alone.

However clinically important differences in efficacy are possible and further comparative studies are still needed.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-10 18:41:30 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nephrotic syndrome is a condition in which the glomeruli of the kidney leak protein from the blood into the urine. Nephrotic syndrome results in hypoproteinaemia and generalised oedema. In children, the incidence of nephrotic syndrome in Europe, North America and New Zealand is about 2/100,000 children younger than 15 to 18 years (<LINK REF="REF-Arneil-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arneil 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-el-Bakkali-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">el Bakkali 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKinney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKinney 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schlesinger-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesinger 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2007</LINK>). Most children have minimal change disease, in which changes on light microscopy are minor or absent. The cause of minimal change nephrotic syndrome is unknown.</P>
<P>The first-line treatment for children presenting with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is oral corticosteroids. Of children who present with their first episode of nephrotic syndrome, 80% to 90% will achieve remission with corticosteroid therapy, and have steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) (<LINK REF="REF-Koskimies-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koskimies 1982</LINK>). However, 80% of children experience a relapsing course with recurrent episodes of oedema and proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Koskimies-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koskimies 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarshish-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarshish 1997</LINK>), and of these children, half relapse frequently either a few weeks after ceasing corticosteroids (frequently relapsing SSNS) or while on reducing doses of corticosteroids (steroid-dependent SSNS) (<LINK REF="REF-ISKDC-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISKDC 1982</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-10-17 16:53:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications have been sought that provide longer periods of remission and enable corticosteroids to be withdrawn or the dose reduced. The alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil) were shown in controlled studies to produce prolonged remissions in children with SSNS who relapsed frequently (<LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grupe-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Grupe 1976</LINK>). The potential of these alkylating agents for carcinogenesis and infertility (<LINK REF="REF-Fairley-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairley 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Queshi-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Queshi 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rapola-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapola 1973</LINK>) has limited their use to one or two courses and led to investigation of other immunosuppressive agents. Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporin and tacrolimus), levamisole, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine, mizoribine, vincristine and rituximab have also been used to treat relapsing SSNS (<LINK REF="STD-Abeyagunawardena-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Abeyagunawardena 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abramowicz-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Abramowicz 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BAPN-1991" TYPE="STUDY">BAPN 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hogg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niaudet-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Niaudet 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoshioka-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yoshioka 2000</LINK>). However these newer medications, while potentially less toxic, have been less effective in maintaining prolonged remissions once the medication has been ceased (<LINK REF="STD-BAPN-1991" TYPE="STUDY">BAPN 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niaudet-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Niaudet 1992</LINK>). Recent guidelines recommend alkylating agents, levamisole, calcineurin inhibitors and MMF in these children but there is no consensus as to the most appropriate first line non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medication for frequently relapsing and steroid-dependent SSNS (<LINK REF="REF-French-NS-Guideline-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">French NS Guideline 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gipson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gipson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IPNS_x002d_IAP-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">IPNS-IAP 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-KDIGO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDIGO 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lombel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lombel 2013</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-10-17 12:35:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the immunological mechanisms involved in SSNS are not well understood, evidence is accumulating for the involvement of T and B cells in these immune mechanisms. In keeping with this is the response of childhood nephrotic syndrome to corticosteroids. While corticosteroids lead to remission in most children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, most children relapse one or more times and many experience significant adverse effects, which include growth retardation, obesity, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, hypertension and ocular changes. Several non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications with different mechanisms of action have been used to treat children with frequently relapsing SSNS; several have been demonstrated to provide more prolonged periods of remission compared with corticosteroids alone. However, these medications have different adverse effects, so their use has to be carefully balanced against the frequency and severity of adverse effects with corticosteroids. It is therefore important to review in detail the studies of non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive drugs in SSNS to determine the benefits and harms of these medications.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-10-17 12:35:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001, and last updated 2008. The review has demonstrated that the non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil and levamisole) reduce the risk of relapse in children with relapsing SSNS compared with corticosteroids alone. In addition, it has also been demonstrated that cyclosporin does not differ significantly in efficacy during administration compared with alkylating agents. Since the last update in 2008, several new medications (MMF, tacrolimus and rituximab) have become widely used in children with relapsing SSNS. In case series, MMF has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of relapse during therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bagga-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagga 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fujinaga-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujinaga 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hogg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hogg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendizabal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mendizabal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Novak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novak 2005</LINK>). Tacrolimus is widely used in North America in preference to cyclosporin because of the side effect profile; case series suggest that tacrolimus is as effective as cyclosporin (<LINK REF="REF-Dotsch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dotsch 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2012</LINK>) but with some different adverse effects. A single small study (<LINK REF="STD-Ravani-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ravani 2011</LINK>) and several observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Guigonis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guigonis 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kemper-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemper 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prytula-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prytula 2010</LINK>) suggest that rituximab is a valuable additional medication in children with steroid- and calcineurin-dependent nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, it was important to update this review to include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing these newer medications to prednisone or another non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug for relapsing SSNS.</P>

<P>The review was initially undertaken by five authors. For the initial review and the updates the search methods described were used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies that could be relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts were screened independently by four authors, who discarded studies that were irrelevant (e.g. studies of lipid lowering agents) although studies and reviews that might include relevant data or information on studies were retained initially. Authors independently assessed abstracts, and if necessary the full text, of these studies to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Any further information required from the original author was requested by written correspondence and any relevant information obtained in this manner was included in the review. If necessary, disagreements could be resolved in consultation.</P>

<P>In the search for the initial review (<LINK REF="REF-Durkan-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durkan 2001a</LINK>), of the 832 titles and abstracts screened, 24 studies were identified by full text review to be RCTs or quasi-RCTs. One study assessing levamisole (<LINK REF="STD-Kirubakaran-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Kirubakaran 1984</LINK>) was excluded because the primary outcome could not be determined. One study in Japanese language could not be translated for assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Tohjoh-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tohjoh 1994</LINK>). Two studies involved ineligible interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trompeter-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Trompeter 1978</LINK>) and two studies involved ineligible populations (<LINK REF="STD-Tejani-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tejani 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Urdaneta-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Urdaneta 1983</LINK>).

<P>A search of databases in August 2003 found no new studies. In 2004 seven RCTs involving children with relapsing SSNS treated with non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications were identified; five were identified from handsearching of conference proceedings and were in abstract form only. Four studies were excluded; two assessed herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine (<LINK REF="STD-Fong-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fong 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zou 1997</LINK>), one assessing lefluonomide (<LINK REF="STD-Ni-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ni 2003</LINK>) and one comparing cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Naigui-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Naigui 1997</LINK>) were excluded because the intervention was ineligible for this review or both children and adults were included and the paediatric data could not be separated. Therefore 20<B> </B>studies (25 reports) were included in the 2005 updated review (<LINK REF="REF-Durkan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durkan 2005</LINK>). The three newly included studies were <LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yoshioka-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yoshioka 2000</LINK>.</P>
<P>A further search in January 2007 identified 18 studies; of these five were RCTs not previously included, one study was an abstract of a previously included study (<LINK REF="STD-Abramowicz-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Abramowicz 1970</LINK>), one was an abstract describing an ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-Gruppen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gruppen 2006</LINK>) and 11 were excluded (not randomised (8); reviews (2); mixed population of primary and secondary nephrotic syndrome (1)). In September 2007 an additional study was identified in abstract form. The 2008 update of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2008</LINK>) therefore contained 26 studies (34 reports), including six new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abeyagunawardena-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Abeyagunawardena 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abeyagunawardena-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Abeyagunawardena 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Saran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Saran 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cerkauskiene-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cerkauskiene 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Donia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dorresteijn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dorresteijn 2007</LINK>) and an ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-Gruppen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gruppen 2006</LINK>) for a total of 27 studies (35 reports) (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2008</LINK>).</P>

We excluded 19 studies (20 reports); 11 studies (12 reports) involved ineligible interventions, five studies (five reports) involved adult patients, one study (one report) included children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and two studies (two reports) were not RCTs.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Alkylating agents</HEADING>
<P>Six studies in children with relapsing SSNS showed that oral cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil substantially reduced the risk of relapse compared with prednisone alone (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). These interventions typically reduced the risk of relapse in comparison with prednisone by about 50% for one year during and after a treatment course. In a direct comparison, there was no significant difference in efficacy between cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil. Since corticosteroids were used in combination with the study agents in most studies, there were insufficient data available to determine the efficacy of alkylating agents in comparison with placebo or no immunosuppressive treatment.</P>
<P>What would the benefits and harms be of using an alkylating agent in a child with relapsing nephrotic syndrome? Cohort studies (<LINK REF="REF-Koskimies-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koskimies 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarshish-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarshish 1997</LINK>) showed that between 35% and 53% of children relapse frequently at some time during their disease. Intervention with immunosuppressive medications would only be undertaken in this group of children whose risk for further recurrences approaches 100% with corticosteroid treatment alone. The meta-analysis shows that the RR of relapse is 0.42 so the risk of relapse following a course of an alkylating agent is reduced from 100% to about 42%. Hence, on the benefit side of the equation, assuming that all children will relapse, 58 fewer children would relapse for every 100 children treated with an alkylating agent (<LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 1995</LINK>). On the harm side of the equation, for every 100 children treated with an alkylating agent, between five and 11 children will suffer a significant infection and seven children would have to cease drug therapy because of leucopenia (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Children, who relapse only once during the first six months after the initial course of prednisone treatment, have only a 10% risk of developing frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Tarshish-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarshish 1997</LINK>). Thus only 10/100 such children are considered at risk of relapsing frequently. Since alkylating agents, if administered to such children would reduce the risk of relapse by about 58%, only about 6/100 children would benefit while the number suffering adverse effects would be unchanged. Thus, the benefits of treatment would outweigh the harms only in children who relapse frequently.</P>
<P>Cyclophosphamide was significantly more effective in maintaining remission when administered for eight weeks compared with two weeks but there was no significant difference in efficacy between eight and 12 weeks of cyclophosphamide. The efficacy of intravenous cyclophosphamide did not differ significantly from that of oral cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Calcineurin inhibitors and mycophenolate mofetil</HEADING>
<P>In comparative studies the efficacy of cyclosporin did not differ significantly from alkylating agents during administration, but unlike cyclosporin, the benefit of the alkylating agents was generally sustained beyond the on-treatment period (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). The relative efficacy of MMF compared with cyclosporin remains unclear because of limited data. Comparison between dosing based on cyclosporin levels and fixed low dose cyclosporin indicated that the former was more effective in maintaining remission. Although tacrolimus is widely used as an alternative to cyclosporin to avoid the cosmetic effects of cyclosporin, no comparative RCTs of these medications were identified. Adverse effects of hypertension and kidney dysfunction occurred in 13% and 10% of children respectively (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>)<I>.</I>

Six studies limited enrolment to children with frequently relapsing (<LINK REF="STD-Rashid-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rashid 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sural-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sural 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1993</LINK>) and steroid-dependent SSNS (<LINK REF="STD-Abeyagunawardena-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Abeyagunawardena 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Saran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Saran 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BAPN-1991" TYPE="STUDY">BAPN 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rashid-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rashid 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Dayal-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dayal 1994</LINK> enrolled children following a relapse regardless of the frequency of relapse. Thus, it was unlikely that the difference in efficacy between <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1993</LINK> and the other studies related to different patient populations.</P>
<P>Levamisole was administered twice weekly but on consecutive days in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1993</LINK>) to provide a monthly dose of 20 mg/kg. It was administered on alternate days in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abeyagunawardena-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Abeyagunawardena 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Saran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Saran 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BAPN-1991" TYPE="STUDY">BAPN 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rashid-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rashid 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sural-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sural 2001</LINK>) to provide a monthly dose of 35 mg/kg. The interval between doses was thus shorter and the total dose higher in the five studies demonstrating efficacy in frequently relapsing and steroid-dependent patients. This difference in dose frequency and total dose may be responsible for the difference in efficacy. Few side effects were reported in the levamisole studies. However, important side effects reported in other studies include neutropenia and disseminated vasculitis (<LINK REF="REF-Barbano-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbano 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palcoux-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palcoux 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>In a two comparative studies the efficacy of cyclophosphamide did not differ significantly from levamisole (<LINK REF="STD-Donia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Donia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sural-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sural 2001</LINK>) but there was significant heterogeneity between studies.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-10-17 12:35:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although study data showed that non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications were more effective than corticosteroids alone, head-to-head studies have not demonstrated a clear benefit of one over any other in preventing relapse of nephrotic syndrome. Comparative studies of cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, cyclosporin, levamisole and MMF have been done but, because of insufficient power, clinically important differences in treatment effects have not been completely excluded. For example, using the upper and lower bounds of the 95% CI of the RR estimate obtained from the single comparative study of chlorambucil versus cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil could reduce the risk of recurrence by 20% or could double the risk of recurrence compared with cyclophosphamide. Similarly, compared with alkylating agents, cyclosporin could reduce the risk of relapse by 45% or could more than double the risk of relapse at the end of therapy. Adequately powered RCTs are required to determine which of the five medications is most effective.</P>
<P>Ideally, additional comparative studies of alkylating agents with calcineurin inhibitors, levamisole or MMF and of calcineurin inhibitors with levamisole, MMF and rituximab should be undertaken. In particular, studies evaluating MMF, tacrolimus and rituximab are required. A single very small RCT favoured cyclosporin over mycophenolate for the relapse rate but there was considerable imprecision in the results (<LINK REF="STD-Dorresteijn-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dorresteijn 2007</LINK>). Preliminary results of a larger cross-over study suggested that cyclosporin was more effective than MMF, but the complete results are awaited (<LINK REF="STD-Gellermann-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gellermann 2011</LINK>). A single small study (<LINK REF="STD-Ravani-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ravani 2011</LINK>) suggested that rituximab was a valuable addition in children with steroid- and calcineurin-dependent nephrotic syndrome.</P>
<P>No studies comparing tacrolimus with cyclosporin were identified.</P>
<P>Until further adequately-powered comparative studies are available, the choice between non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications must be based upon other non-effectiveness considerations, such as local availability or licensing, costs, and physician and patient preferences concerning duration of treatment and frequency and nature of complications.</P>
<P>By stratifying recruited patients into those with frequently relapsing disease and steroid-dependent disease, studies could also test the hypothesis that alkylating agents are more effective in the frequent relapsing group and cyclosporin is more effective in the steroid-dependent group as suggested by post-hoc analysis of published studies of alkylating agents (<LINK REF="STD-APN-1982" TYPE="STUDY">APN 1982</LINK>), uncontrolled studies of cyclosporin (<LINK REF="REF-Hulton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niaudet-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niaudet 1987</LINK>) and a review of 26 studies (controlled studies and cohort studies) which found that on average the two- and five-year sustained remission rates following treatment with either cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil were 72% and 36% in frequently relapsing SSNS compared with 40% and 24% in steroid-dependent SSNS (<LINK REF="REF-Latta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latta 2001</LINK>). Guidelines published in the USA already suggest different hierarchies for the use of non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications in frequently relapsing compared with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Gipson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gipson 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Follow-up of participants in the studies of alkylating agents was two years or less. This was insufficient to determine the risk of low sperm count and infertility, which are known to be long-term complications of prolonged courses of alkylating agents (<LINK REF="REF-Latta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latta 2001</LINK>). None of the studies included in the review specifically addressed the issue of fertility as an adverse effect of alkylating agent therapy. The total doses of cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil were equal to or less than the generally accepted maximum cumulative dose of 168 mg/kg and 11.2 mg/kg respectively (<LINK REF="REF-KDIGO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDIGO 2012</LINK>) except for early studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alatas-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Alatas 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baluarte-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Baluarte 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiu-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grupe-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Grupe 1976</LINK>). However, long-term follow-up of SSNS patients into adult life has identified a reduction in parenthood in patients who had received any alkylating agent therapy with patients with two or more courses of alkylating agents having a significantly higher risk of not having children compared with patients with a single course (<LINK REF="REF-R_x00fc_th-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rüth 2005</LINK>). Consequently the KDIGO guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-KDIGO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDIGO 2012</LINK>) recommend that second courses of alkylating agents not be given.</P>

<P>This review has several potential problems because of the limitations of the primary data. Overall, study quality was poor, with only a third and a half of studies reporting sequence generation and allocation concealment at low risk of bias respectively (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Studies with inadequate allocation concealment can exaggerate the efficacy of the experimental treatment by 30% to 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and meta-analyses of low quality studies may overestimate the benefit of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). In addition, only 20% of studies were considered at low risk of performance and detection bias. These observations make the need for adequately powered, well designed and reported studies even more necessary.</P>
<P>Many therapies were only investigated in single small studies and could not be assessed in summary of findings tables. Six studies (157 participants) evaluated alkylating agents in comparison with prednisone or placebo or both (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Two studies (83 participants) compared intravenous with oral administration of cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>) and two studies (95 participants) compared alkylating agents with cyclosporin (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). The quality of the evidence was considered to be low in these comparisons because of small numbers of participants and unclear allocation concealment in some studies. Seven studies (375 participants) compared levamisole with prednisone or placebo or both (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). The quality of the evidence was considered to be low because of inconsistency in the results and significant heterogeneity between studies resulting in imprecision in results.</P>
<P>Because studies are not generally designed to evaluate harms of interventions unless the primary outcome is a harm-benefit composite such as death, the number of serious adverse effects (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) reported here with alkylating agents and cyclosporin may be an underestimate and may not be directly applicable to larger groups of children treated under non-trial conditions. Nevertheless a review (<LINK REF="REF-Latta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latta 2001</LINK>) of 38 articles on the treatment of relapsing SSNS involving 866 children who received 902 courses of cyclophosphamide and 638 children who received 671 courses of chlorambucil found similar frequencies of adverse effects to our review.</P>
<P>The effects of publication bias could not be formally assessed because of the small number of studies for each medication. Subgroup analysis was not possible because of the small number of studies for each intervention.</P>

<P>Our findings are generally in keeping with recently published guidelines. Both the recent USA (<LINK REF="REF-Gipson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gipson 2009</LINK>) and Indian guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-IPNS_x002d_IAP-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">IPNS-IAP 2008</LINK>) recommend that cyclophosphamide should be given for 12 weeks, while the KDIGO (<LINK REF="REF-KDIGO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDIGO 2012</LINK>) and French guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-French-NS-Guideline-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">French NS Guideline 2008</LINK>) recommend eight to 12 weeks of therapy. Similarly older guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Bargman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bargman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brodehl-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodehl 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IPNG_x002d_IAP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">IPNG-IAP 2001</LINK>) recommend 12 weeks of cyclophosphamide for frequently relapsing and steroid-dependent SSNS. In part, this may reflect the differences in information sources used. For example, a study which has been influential in shaping guidelines about cyclophosphamide use, found that 12 weeks of cyclophosphamide was more effective than eight weeks in preventing relapse in children with steroid-dependent SSNS (<LINK REF="REF-APN-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APN 1987</LINK>). However, this study used historical controls, which may be associated with an overestimate of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Sacks-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacks 1982</LINK>).

<P>This review was not able to determine which medication should be preferred initially for relapsing SSNS since data from studies were inadequate to determine which medication should be used first.

In contrast, <LINK REF="REF-Gipson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gipson 2009</LINK> suggest different orders of administration for frequently relapsing and steroid-dependent SSNS with cyclophosphamide preferred as the initial medication for frequently relapsing disease and a calcineurin inhibitor preferred for steroid-dependent disease.</P>

<P>This systematic review of RCTs showed that oral or intravenous cyclophosphamide, oral chlorambucil and levamisole substantially reduce the incidence of relapse in children with relapsing SSNS. Cyclosporin appears to be as effective as alkylating agents during therapy. However, relapse commonly occurs when cyclosporin therapy is terminated, while remission is generally maintained following completion of a course of alkylating agents. There were insufficient data to determine the relative efficacies of cyclosporin and MMF. While tacrolimus is widely used, there were no studies comparing it with cyclosporin. Currently, there are inadequate data on efficacy and harms available from RCTs to determine which medication should be preferred initially. Thus, the decision as to which medication should be used in a child with frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent SSNS will largely depend on patient and physician preference following discussion of the need for prolonged courses of cyclosporin or levamisole compared with eight to 12 week courses of the alkylating agents to maintain remission, the possible side effects, and the costs of courses of alkylating agents, and those of prolonged courses of cyclosporin or levamisole.</P>

<P>Further adequately powered RCTs are needed to identify clinically important differences in efficacy among the non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive drugs in widespread use. Such RCTs would assist clinicians in determining which non-corticosteroid medication should be preferred in the initial treatment of relapsing SSNS. Before-after studies have demonstrated that cyclosporin and MMF are effective in relapsing nephrotic syndrome so comparisons of these medications with prednisone are unlikely to be performed.

<LI>levamisole or MMF versus cyclophosphamide.</LI>
<LI>tacrolimus versus cyclosporin particularly in terms of adverse effects.</LI>
