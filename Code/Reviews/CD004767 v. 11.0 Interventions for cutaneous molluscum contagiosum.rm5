<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-05-09 09:57:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence for the effect of any treatment on the common viral skin infection molluscum contagiosum. We excluded people with a repressed immune system or sexually transmitted molluscum contagiosum.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Molluscum contagiosum in healthy people is a self limiting, relatively harmless viral skin infection. It mainly affects children and adolescents and is rare in adults. It occurs worldwide, but seems much more frequent in geographic areas with warm climates. Molluscum contagiosum usually presents as single or multiple pimples filled with an oily substance. People may seek treatment for social and cosmetic reasons and because of concerns about spreading the disease to others. Treatment is intended to speed up the healing process.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the literature to July 2016. We included 22 trials (total of 1650 participants). Twenty of the studies evaluated topical treatment, and two studies evaluated treatment taken by mouth (oral). Comparisons included physical therapies, as well as topical and oral treatments. Most studies were set in hospital outpatient or emergency departments, and were performed in North America, the UK, Asia, or South America. Participants were of both sexes and were mainly children or young adults. Follow-up duration varied from 3 to 28 weeks after randomisation. Only five studies had longer than 3 months' follow-up.</P>
<P>Five studies reported commercial funding, three studies obtained medication for free from pharmaceutical companies, 12 studies did not mention the source of funding, one study reported charity funding, and one study reported they had had no financial support.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found that many common treatments for molluscum, such as physical destruction, have not been adequately evaluated. Some of the included treatments are not part of standard practice.</P>
<P>We found moderate-quality evidence that topical 5% imiquimod is probably no more effective than vehicle (i.e. the same cream but without imiquimod) in achieving short-, medium-, and long-term clinical cure. High-quality (and thus more certain) evidence showed that topical 5% imiquimod is no better than placebo at improving molluscum up to three months after the start of treatment.</P>
<P>High-quality evidence showed that 5% imiquimod differed little or not at all in the number of side effects compared to vehicle. However, moderate-quality evidence suggests that there are probably more application site reactions when using topical 5% imiquimod compared with vehicle.</P>
<P>Low-quality evidence, based on one or two mostly small studies, revealed the following results for the outcome short-term clinical cure: 5% imiquimod less effective than cryospray or 10% potassium hydroxide; 10% Australian lemon myrtle oil more effective than olive oil; 10% benzoyl peroxide cream more effective than 0.05% tretinoin; 5% sodium nitrite co-applied with 5% salicylic acid more effective than 5% salicylic acid alone; and iodine plus tea tree oil more effective than tea tree oil or iodine alone. We found more uncertain (low-quality) evidence to suggest that 10% potassium hydroxide is more effective than saline; homeopathic calcarea carbonica is more effective than placebo; 2.5% solution of potassium hydroxide is less effective than 5% solution of potassium hydroxide; and 10% povidone iodine solution and 50% salicylic acid plaster are more effective than salicylic acid plaster alone.</P>
<P>Except for the severe application site reactions of imiquimod, none of these treatments led to serious adverse effects (low-quality evidence). Pain during treatment application, redness, and itching were among the most reported adverse effects.</P>
<P>We found no differences between the treatments assessed in the other comparisons.</P>
<P>We found no randomised trials for several commonly used treatments, such as expressing lesions with an orange stick or topical hydrogen peroxide. Since most lesions resolve within months, unless better evidence for the superiority of active treatments emerges, molluscum contagiosum can be left to heal naturally.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>For topical imiquimod, the quality of the evidence for clinical cure, short-term improvement, and adverse effects was moderate to high. For all other comparisons, the quality of the evidence for short-term clinical cure and adverse effects was low. Common limitations of the included studies were that the numbers of participants were small, the investigators were not blinded, and participants who did not complete the study (numerous in some studies) were not included in the analyses.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-03 23:30:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin infection that is caused by a pox virus and occurs mainly in children. The infection usually resolves within months in people without immune deficiency, but treatment may be preferred for social and cosmetic reasons or to avoid spreading the infection. A clear evidence base supporting the various treatments is lacking.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006, and updated previously in 2009.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-03-16 15:54:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of specific treatments and management strategies, including waiting for natural resolution, for cutaneous, non-genital molluscum contagiosum in people without immune deficiency.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-09 09:29:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We updated our searches of the following databases to July 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We searched six trial registers and checked the reference lists of included studies and review articles for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field to identify further relevant randomised controlled trials.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-08 14:00:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found 11 new studies for this update, resulting in 22 included studies with a total of 1650 participants. The studies examined the effects of topical (20 studies) and systemic interventions (2 studies).</P>
<P>Among the new included studies were the full trial reports of three large unpublished studies, brought to our attention by an expert in the field. They all provided moderate-quality evidence for a lack of effect of 5% imiquimod compared to vehicle (placebo) on short-term clinical cure (4 studies, 850 participants, 12 weeks after start of treatment, risk ratio (RR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.93), medium-term clinical cure (2 studies, 702 participants, 18 weeks after start of treatment, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.14), and long-term clinical cure (2 studies, 702 participants, 28 weeks after start of treatment, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.17). We found similar but more certain results for short-term improvement (4 studies, 850 participants, 12 weeks after start of treatment, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.47; high-quality evidence). For the outcome 'any adverse effect', we found high-quality evidence for little or no difference between topical 5% imiquimod and vehicle (3 studies, 827 participants, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.07), but application site reactions were more frequent in the groups treated with imiquimod (moderate-quality evidence): any application site reaction (3 studies, 827 participants, RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.77, the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) was 11); severe application site reaction (3 studies, 827 participants, RR 4.33, 95% CI 1.16 to 16.19, NNTH over 40).</P>
<P>For the following 11 comparisons, there was limited evidence to show which treatment was superior in achieving short-term clinical cure (low-quality evidence): 5% imiquimod less effective than cryospray (1 study, 74 participants, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78) and 10% potassium hydroxide (2 studies, 67 participants, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.93); 10% Australian lemon myrtle oil more effective than olive oil (1 study, 31 participants, RR 17.88, 95% CI 1.13 to 282.72); 10% benzoyl peroxide cream more effective than 0.05% tretinoin (1 study, 30 participants, RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 4.79); 5% sodium nitrite co-applied with 5% salicylic acid more effective than 5% salicylic acid alone (1 study, 30 participants, RR 3.50, 95% CI 1.23 to 9.92); and iodine plus tea tree oil more effective than tea tree oil (1 study, 37 participants, RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.57) or iodine alone (1 study, 37 participants, RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.50). Although there is some uncertainty, 10% potassium hydroxide appears to be more effective than saline (1 study, 20 participants, RR 3.50, 95% CI 0.95 to 12.90); homeopathic calcarea carbonica appears to be more effective than placebo (1 study, 20 participants, RR 5.57, 95% CI 0.93 to 33.54); 2.5% appears to be less effective than 5% solution of potassium hydroxide (1 study, 25 participants, RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.01); and 10% povidone iodine solution plus 50% salicylic acid plaster appears to be more effective than salicylic acid plaster alone (1 study, 30 participants, RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.16).</P>
<P>We found no statistically significant differences for other comparisons (most of which addressed two different topical treatments). We found no randomised controlled trial evidence for expressing lesions or topical hydrogen peroxide.</P>
<P>Study limitations included no blinding, many dropouts, and no intention-to-treat analysis. Except for the severe application site reactions of imiquimod, none of the evaluated treatments described above were associated with serious adverse effects (low-quality evidence). Among the most common adverse events were pain during application, erythema, and itching. Included studies of the following comparisons did not report adverse effects: calcarea carbonica versus placebo, 10% povidone iodine plus 50% salicylic acid plaster versus salicylic acid plaster, and 10% benzoyl peroxide versus 0.05% tretinoin.</P>
<P>We were unable to judge the risk of bias in most studies due to insufficient information, especially regarding concealment of allocation and possible selective reporting. We considered five studies to be at low risk of bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-04 00:09:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No single intervention has been shown to be convincingly effective in the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. We found moderate-quality evidence that topical 5% imiquimod was no more effective than vehicle in terms of clinical cure, but led to more application site reactions, and high-quality evidence that there was no difference between the treatments in terms of short-term improvement. However, high-quality evidence showed a similar number of general side effects in both groups. As the evidence found did not favour any one treatment, the natural resolution of molluscum contagiosum remains a strong method for dealing with the condition.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-05-05 12:49:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Molluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection most frequently encountered in children (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2013</LINK>). The infection is caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus, which is classified within the family of poxviruses (<I>Poxviridae</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Buller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buller 1991</LINK>). The virus is assumed to be the only remaining poxvirus that specifically affects human beings (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infection follows after contact with infected people or contaminated objects (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2013</LINK>). Molluscum contagiosum usually presents as single or multiple (usually no more than 20) painless, spherical, shiny, pearly white papules that classically have a central dimple. Their size may vary from tiny 1 mm papules to large nodules over 1 cm in diameter. The lesions may itch (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to the common form of benign skin tumours (mostly found in children), there is also a sexually transmitted variant of molluscum contagiosum that occurs on genital, perineal, pubic, and surrounding skin (<LINK REF="REF-Czelusta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czelusta 2000</LINK>). Molluscum contagiosum lesions may also appear in or around the mouth (<LINK REF="REF-Whitaker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitaker 1991</LINK>). Molluscum contagiosum has also been observed with other diseases in people with immune deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mansur-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansur 2004</LINK>). People with HIV infection are particularly prone to molluscum contagiosum; prevalence in this population has been reported to range from 5% to 18% (<LINK REF="REF-Hira-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hira 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Husak-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Husak 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matis 1987</LINK>). The focus of this review was the common form of molluscum contagiosum only.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Molluscum contagiosum occurs worldwide. Previous reviews have reported that it as more frequent in geographic areas with warm climates, but this may be due to selective publication of local outbreaks (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2014</LINK>). Infection is rare in children under the age of 1 year, typically occurring in the 2- to 5-year-old age group (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1998</LINK>). The age of peak incidence is reported to be between the ages of 2 and 3 years in Fiji (<LINK REF="REF-Postlethwaite-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Postlethwaite 1967</LINK>), and between 1 and 4 years in the Congo (formerly Zaire) (<LINK REF="REF-Torfs-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torfs 1959</LINK>). In Papua New Guinea the annual incidence rate for children under 10 years of age was 6% (<LINK REF="REF-Sturt-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturt 1971</LINK>). Population-based occurrence rates are scarce for high-income countries. In a large questionnaire study among parents of children attending kindergartens and elementary schools, the reported prevalence of molluscum contagiosum was 5.6% and 7.4%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Niizeki-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niizeki 1984</LINK>). Much higher prevalence rates have been reported during outbreaks in closed communities (<LINK REF="REF-Overfield-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overfield 1966</LINK>). In 1878 an outbreak in an English school was reported involving 9 children (<LINK REF="REF-Liveing-1878" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liveing 1878</LINK>). A recent meta-analysis of five cross-sectional surveys among children (age range 0 to 16 years) resulted in a pooled prevalence rate of 2.8% (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 5.9) (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the USA, the estimated number of physician visits for molluscum contagiosum from 1990 to 1999 was 280,000 per year (<LINK REF="REF-Molino-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molino 2004</LINK>). One out of 6 Dutch children aged 15 years have visited their doctor for molluscum contagiosum at least once (<LINK REF="REF-Koning-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koning 1994</LINK>). There is generally no difference in incidence between males and females (<LINK REF="REF-Koning-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koning 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Relyveld-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Relyveld 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sturt-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturt 1971</LINK>); however, an unequal sex ratio was found in studies from Japan (<LINK REF="REF-Niizeki-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niizeki 1984</LINK>), Alaska (<LINK REF="REF-Overfield-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overfield 1966</LINK>), and Fiji (<LINK REF="REF-Hawley-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawley 1970</LINK>), where boys were affected more often. This is probably due to habits associated with the spread of the infection, such as swimming (<LINK REF="REF-Niizeki-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niizeki 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Postlethwaite-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Postlethwaite 1967</LINK>). Outbreaks may occur among children who bathe or swim together. A history of eczema was found in 62% of children with molluscum contagiosum in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Braue-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braue 2005</LINK>). In the adolescent and adult age groups sexual transmission becomes important.</P>

<P>The estimated incubation period varies from 14 days to 6 months (<LINK REF="REF-Sterling-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterling 1998</LINK>). Lesions enlarge slowly and may reach a diameter of 5 to 10 mm in 6 to 12 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Sterling-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterling 1998</LINK>). After trauma (e.g. scratching) or spontaneously after several months, inflammatory changes result in the production of white fluid, crusting, and eventual destruction of the lesions. The duration of both the individual lesion and of the entire episode is highly variable. Crops of molluscum may appear to come and go for several months, and although most cases are self limiting and resolve within six to nine months, some may persist for more than three or four years.</P>
<P>A Japanese study described spontaneous resolution on average 6.5 months after infection in 205 out of 217 children (94.5%) affected by molluscum contagiosum (<LINK REF="REF-Takemura-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takemura 1983</LINK>). One month after the first consultation with the dermatologist, 23% of the children were cured. A recent community cohort study in the UK, <LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2015</LINK>, followed 306 children with molluscum contagiosum aged 4 to 15 years. Only 19% of the children were reported to have received treatment. Mean time to resolution was 13.3 months; 30% had not resolved by 18 months, and 13% had not resolved by 24 months.</P>
<P>Secondary bacterial infection can occur, and when severe can result in scarring. This must be distinguished from the milder inflammatory reactions that molluscum lesions show after a scratching or when they are starting to resolve spontaneously, which may prompt parents to take their child to the general practitioner thinking they have become infected (<LINK REF="REF-Highet-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Highet 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Particularly in atopic people (who are prone to asthma, hay fever, or eczema), there is a tendency for a patch of eczema (which is often particularly itchy) to develop around one or more of the lesions a month or more after their arrival (<LINK REF="REF-Beaulieu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaulieu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Oreo-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Oreo 1956</LINK>). Erythema annulare centrifugum (a widespread rash of red inflammatory rings) has also been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Vasily-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasily 1978</LINK>). Chronic conjunctivitis and superficial punctate keratitis may likewise complicate lesions on or near the eyelids (<LINK REF="REF-Haellmigk-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haellmigk 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Redmond-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redmond 2004</LINK>). The eczema and conjunctivitis diminish naturally when the molluscum lesion is removed.</P>
<P>Molluscum contagiosum behaves differently in HIV-infected individuals. As immunodeficiency progresses, molluscum contagiosum becomes more common and resistance to therapy increases. Frequently, multiple lesions in atypical areas such as the face and neck can be found (<LINK REF="REF-Husak-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Husak 1997</LINK>). Only limited data are available on the course of the disease in this group of people.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-05 12:51:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In people without an immune deficiency molluscum contagiosum is a self limiting disease (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2013</LINK>). Therapy is often not necessary for recovery, and awaiting spontaneous resolution is an important management strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Takemura-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takemura 1983</LINK>). Most lesions resolve within months without scarring in otherwise healthy people (<LINK REF="REF-Ordoukhanian-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ordoukhanian 1997</LINK>). Treatment is intended to accelerate this process. Destruction of the lesions and the production of an inflammatory response are means by which resolution of the lesions could be hastened (<LINK REF="REF-Sterling-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterling 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reasons to treat molluscum contagiosum include the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>alleviating discomfort, including itching;</LI>
<LI>cosmetic reasons;</LI>
<LI>social stigma associated with many visible lesions;</LI>
<LI>limiting its spread to other areas of the body and to other people;</LI>
<LI>preventing scarring and secondary infection; and</LI>
<LI>preventing trauma and bleeding of lesions.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There are a large number of treatment options for molluscum contagiosum (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for an overview). These treatment options can be divided into three major categories:</P>
<UL>
<LI>physical destruction of the lesions;</LI>
<LI>topical agents (i.e. those applied directly to the lesions); and</LI>
<LI>systemic treatment (i.e. those affecting the whole body).</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the past, many authors have recommended physical destruction as the preferred method for treatment of molluscum contagiosum (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stulberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stulberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1991</LINK>). Dermatology textbooks mention removal of the lesion with a sharp curette (curettage) or the application of liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy) as being simple and usually effective treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Lowy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sterling-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterling 1998</LINK>). Gentle squeezing or pricking with a sterile needle are alternatively recommended destructive therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1996</LINK>). Most of these therapies need to be repeated at three to four weekly intervals. Treatment may be painful and may result in scarring (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1987</LINK>). Squeezing of lesions may even lead to the formation of large abscesses due to the disruption of virus into the deeper layer of the skin (dermis) (<LINK REF="REF-Brandrup-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandrup 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Topical preparations such as podophyllotoxin, liquefied phenol, tretinoin, cantharidin, or potassium hydroxide are also used (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Metkar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Metkar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saryazdi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Saryazdi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silverberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverberg 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Syed-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Syed 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 1999</LINK>). In children, prior application of local anaesthetic cream may reduce the pain of treatment involving physical destruction or local inflammation (<LINK REF="STD-de-Waard-1990" TYPE="STUDY">de Waard 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosdahl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Rosdahl 1988</LINK>), although severe side effects have been reported in a case of excessive application of lidocaine-prilocaine (<LINK REF="REF-Wieringa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wieringa 2006</LINK>). Other proposed topical treatments include immune response modifiers such as imiquimod and cidofovir.</P>
<P>Systemic treatment with cimetidine has been suggested as a possible treatment because of its systemic immunomodulatory effects; it increases lymphocyte proliferation and inhibits suppressor T-cell function (<LINK REF="REF-Orlow-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orlow 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sterling-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterling 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Little data are available with regard to prevailing practice. In a survey among paediatric dermatologists in the USA in 2008, respondents seemed to favour cantharidin, followed by imiquimod, watchful waiting, curettage, and cryotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Coloe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coloe 2009</LINK>). This differs from, for example, general practice in the Netherlands, where waiting for natural resolution is the most popular option (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Linden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Linden 2005</LINK>). A more recent survey among physicians from various specialties in the USA showed that treatment preferences differed widely between specialties (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2013</LINK>).<BR/>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-05-04 04:02:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The working mechanism differs according to the type of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2013</LINK>). Curettage aims to remove the lesions entirely. Other techniques like pricking with a needle, cryotherapy, or pulsed-dye laser aim at damaging the lesion, which may in itself induce an immune response. Topical preparations such as podophyllotoxin, tretinoin, cantharidin, or potassium hydroxide are supposed to evoke a local inflammatory response. Application of phenol or trichloroacetic acid also aims to destroy the lesions. Another topical preparation, imiquimod, supposedly induces an immune response. Cimetidine is a systemic immune modulator. Antiviral agents, especially cidofovir, have been used both systemically and locally (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>Molluscum contagiosum is a common reason for consultation in family practice and dermatology. Many treatment options are available, some of which are painful and some that may leave scars. A decision may be made in favour of active therapy to prevent further spread, relieve symptoms, prevent scarring, and for cosmetic and social reasons. Indeed, many parents are concerned about the stigma associated with the lesions. Children with molluscum may be excluded from attending nursery and from participating in physical activities such as swimming. However, the scientific basis for treatment is unclear. Consequently, many practitioners find themselves in a dilemma as to whether or not to promote active treatment and, if they do decide on an active treatment strategy, are unclear as to which is the best option. We carried out this systematic review to evaluate treatment options for molluscum contagiosum.</P>

<P>We did not initially specify secondary outcomes (2) and (7) in the protocol, but added them afterwards since we considered improvement at the end of the study important, as was disease-related quality of life. For secondary outcome (2), we would combine 'improvement' and 'cure' (even though cure alone was a seperate outcome) because 'improvement' would be hard to interpret without also including those who were cured. For example: suppose in group A, 30% of participants were cured and another 20% improved. In group B, 40% of participants were cured and 10% improved. Comparing improvement rates between A and B (20% versus 10%) is misleading, whereas combining cure and improvement (50% versus 50%) is not.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>Eight trials were performed in North America, five in the UK, eight in Asia, and one in South America (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most included studies were set in hospital outpatient or emergency departments. Only people without immune deficiency (non-HIV participants) and non-genital molluscum contagiosum participants were included in the studies. Participants therefore consisted primarily of children and young adults (adolescents).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The 22 included studies involved a total of 1650 randomised molluscum participants, more than three times as many as in the previous version of this review. The number of participants in each study ranged from 20, in <LINK REF="STD-Manchanda-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Manchanda 1997b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Short-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Short 2006</LINK>, to 379, in <LINK REF="STD-Paller-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Paller 2005b</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Design</HEADING>
<P>Most of the studies had two trial arms. Four studies had three arms (<LINK REF="STD-Leslie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leslie 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Machado-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Machado 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markum-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Markum 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohkuma-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ohkuma 1990</LINK>), and one study had four arms (<LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2006</LINK>).

We chose not to include the cross-over study because fewer than five molluscum participants were assigned to one of the treatment arms. See below for more details on the study designs. Follow-up duration ranged from 3 to 28 weeks after randomisation. Only five studies had longer than 3 months' follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Mutairi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Mutairi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Antony-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Antony 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eichenfield-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eichenfield 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leslie-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leslie 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paller-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Paller 2005b</LINK>).</P>

<P>We describe here the prespecified outcomes found for all comparisons. Comparisons are sorted by type of treatment. Only two comparisons were addressed by more than one study and allowed pooling of study data: topical imiquimod versus vehicle cream (four studies), and imiquimod versus potassium hydroxide (two studies). For each comparison we have only reported the outcomes that were addressed in the included studies. If an outcome is not reported on, this is because the outcome was not assessed by the study/studies within that comparison.</P>
<P>Where included studies used the term 'complete clearance' or 'free of lesions' or 'cured or &gt; 90% cleared', we classed these as our primary outcome 'short-term clinical cure (up to three months after start of treatment)' or our secondary outcome 'medium- and long-term cure (after three months and up to six months, and after six months, respectively)', and where they referred to 'partial clearance', we took this to mean our secondary outcome 'improvement'.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-05 04:22:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-two studies, with a total of 1650 participants, examined the effects of topical (20 studies) and systemic (2 studies) interventions. Altogether, we could extract evaluable data for 24 comparisons.</P>
<P>We found limited evidence of low quality from 11 comparisons for the short-term cure efficacy of the following topical treatments: cryospray when compared to 5% imiquimod; 10% potassium hydroxide compared to 5% imiquimod; 5% sodium nitrite co-applied with 5% salicylic acid compared to 5% salicylic acid alone; tea tree oil combined with iodine compared to tea tree oil or iodine alone; 10% Australian lemon myrtle oil compared to olive oil; and 10% benzoyl peroxide compared to 0.05% tretinoin. We found some evidence to suggest that 10% potassium hydroxide is more effective than saline; 5% solution of potassium hydroxide is favoured compared to 2.5% solution of potassium hydroxide; 10% povidone iodine solution plus 50% salicylic acid plaster is favoured compared to salicylic acid plaster alone; and homeopathic calcarea carbonica is favoured compared to placebo. We found no statistically significant differences for the other comparisons not including imiquimod.</P>
<P>The addition of three unpublished trial reports, with a total of over 800 participants, resulted in high- to moderate-quality evidence for the comparison of topical 5% imiquimod versus vehicle. We conclude that compared to vehicle, topical 5% imiquimod is probably no more effective in terms of clinical cure, makes little or no difference in terms of short-term improvement or local side effects, but appears to induce more application site reactions.</P>
<P>Overall, study limitations included lack of blinding, many dropouts, and no intention-to-treat analysis. Small study sizes resulted in broad confidence intervals and may have led to important differences being missed. None of the evaluated treatment options were associated with serious adverse effects, except for 5% imiquimod (severe application site reactions).</P>
<P>Although this update of our original review identified 11 new studies for inclusion, the overall conclusions have hardly changed, due to the small size of most of the studies and methodological shortcomings. We found no strong evidence either for or against the most commonly used treatment options for molluscum contagiosum. The evidence identified by this systematic review is therefore insufficient to propose any one intervention for molluscum contagiosum.<BR/>
</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-05-08 13:55:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of the 11 trials added during the 2016 update, only three contributed to comparisons for which trials had been found in previous versions of this review. The other eight addressed new comparisons, thus increasing the fragmentation of the evidence. There remains an evidence gap regarding many promoted and used treatment options for molluscum contagiosum, with many interventions assessed by single, low-quality studies. For example, of the two studies that included a curettage arm (<LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Machado-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Machado 2010</LINK>), the outcomes of <LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2006</LINK> were not suitable for inclusion in this review, and <LINK REF="STD-Machado-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Machado 2010</LINK> was a very small study, with 50 participants divided over three study arms. We could include only two studies on cryotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Mutairi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Mutairi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Handjani-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Handjani 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the small sample sizes of the low-quality, single-study comparisons that were included and for which no differences were found, it is possible that clinically relevant differences could be found if treatments would be evaluated in larger samples.</P>
<P>About half of the studies did not compare an active treatment to some sort of placebo, but rather compared two active treatments. This implies that for these interventions, the magnitude of benefit compared to placebo or doing nothing is unclear.</P>
<P>Several issues remain unclear due to lack of details in the published papers. For example, it is unclear whether duration of treatment, as used in <LINK REF="STD-Ormerod-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ormerod 1999</LINK>, can be taken as a valid indicator for time to cure given dropouts and other possible reasons for stopping treatment. Although <LINK REF="STD-Antony-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Antony 2001</LINK> did not report on adverse events, the 50% loss to follow-up rate in the trial might have been caused by adverse effects of the treatment. It is unclear which dosing regimen was used in <LINK REF="STD-Manchanda-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Manchanda 1997b</LINK> when evaluating calcarea carbonica.</P>
<P>Several of the outcomes important to participants and clinicians were not measured in most of the studies we found, or not at all; these included recurrences, and, especially, spread to other people and quality of life.</P>
<P>We initially chose our primary outcome measure to be clinical cure after one month, calculated from the last day of treatment. However, this may not be the most appropriate outcome measure to cover the variety of treatments for molluscum. For example, when comparing a method of physical destruction (e.g. curettage) with a topical treatment that is applied during several days or weeks, our primary outcome measure might favour the first type of treatment. For this update we have adapted our primary outcome to make it more manageable: short-term clinical cure (up to three months after start of treatment). A time point beyond one month after start of treatment for assessing cure was also suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Mc-Cuaig-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mc Cuaig 2011</LINK>, commenting on the 2009 update of this review. An example of when time to cure since the last day of treatment is not appropriate is when treatment is continued until resolution of all lesions (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Ohkuma-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ohkuma 1990</LINK>). Although no clear-cut solution seems available, and so far few trials have studied physical destruction (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Hanna-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Machado-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Machado 2010</LINK>), it is advisable to always consider multiple outcome measures and also to take the burden of treatment into account.</P>
<P>We could perform a meta-analysis for only two comparisons: 5% imiquimod versus its vehicle and 5% imiquimod versus 10% potassium hydroxide.</P>
<P>We excluded studies on genital molluscum contagiosum and in participants with immune deficiency, so our conclusions do not apply to these participant groups, as the need for treatment is probably higher and may require different treatments.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-05-05 13:03:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 22 studies with a total of 1650 participants in this update. Most of the included studies had small sample sizes, with a median study size of just over 30 molluscum participants, and only five studies with more than 100 participants. This impacted on our GRADE assessments. The small studies may have limited power, which was reflected in the wide confidence intervals around the risk ratios. In addition, many of the studies had large losses to follow-up, up to 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Antony-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Antony 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Furthermore, most of the included studies used a control treatment that was not a placebo. Examples of comparator treatments in these studies were olive oil, saline, and alcohol, which may have had potential treatment effects. It was therefore difficult to compare the net effect of interventions due to the absence of a placebo group.</P>
<P>We could assign a low risk of bias for only a small proportion of items in the 'Risk of bias' table (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The lack of reported details on several methodological issues and follow-up periods, together with the small number of participants, gives rise to doubts about the validity of the results of some of the studies. We were not able to assess publication bias in this review, for example by constructing a funnel plot, due to the lack of directly comparable studies.</P>
<P>Notably, we judged five of the nine studies included in the 2016 update to be at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Coloe-Dosal-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Coloe Dosal 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eichenfield-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eichenfield 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markum-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Markum 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paller-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Paller 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paller-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Paller 2005b</LINK>), suggesting a trend toward better study design or reporting, or both. However, with the exception of the three 'imiquimod versus vehicle' studies, most of the studies added during this update were small. The imiquimod studies overall had a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Eichenfield-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eichenfield 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paller-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Paller 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paller-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Paller 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Theos-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Theos 2004</LINK>), therefore we did not downgrade the outcomes in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> for this domain.</P>
<P>As most of the evidence included in this review was based on low-quality studies, we were unable to reach a robust conclusion regarding the objective of the review.<I>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-05-05 04:54:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite conducting a thorough search, we cannot be certain that we did not miss relevant randomised trials. One study is ongoing, and several others are awaiting classification and have not yet been incorporated into the review. Given that 19 of the included studies were performed or published, or both after 2000, we expect more studies comparing treatments for molluscum contagiosum to be published in the coming years.</P>
<P>We made several amendments to the original protocol, some of which were 'data-driven' in the sense that we encountered situations that we had not expected when we developed the protocol. This may have introduced bias.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-05-08 13:40:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At the time of the 2009 update of this review, we had found one other systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitt 2008</LINK>). This review included six randomised trials, all of which were also included in our review. The conclusions of this review were similar to ours. During the 2016 update, we identified a new partly systematic (they described their databases, search strategy, and search date, but did not select studies or extract data in couples, did not state clear inclusion criteria, and did not assess risk of bias) review (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2013</LINK>), which addressed not only epidemiology, virology, and immunology of molluscum contagiosum, but also clinical management. They summarised the findings of the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Wouden-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Wouden 2009</LINK>), and mentioned three new trials (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Mutairi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Mutairi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-K_x00f6_se-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kse 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Seo 2010</LINK>), the first two of which have been included in this update, and the last which is awaiting assessment. They concluded that no evidence-based consensus has been reached on which is the best treatment for molluscum contagiosum in people without immune deficiency.</P>
<P>The cure rates found in the non-randomised study by <LINK REF="STD-Weller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 1999</LINK> for physical expression and phenol ablation (75% and 77% of lesions, respectively, after one month) compare favourably to the 23% of children found cured in the Japanese cohort study on the natural history of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Takemura-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takemura 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the vehicle group of the 3M studies, clearance rates were 12% within 3 months; 27% after 3 to 6 months; and 40% beyond 6 months. Another, more recent cohort study from the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2015</LINK>), where only a small proportion of children were reported to have received treatment, found somewhat lower cure rates: around 10% after 6 months; 40% after 12 months; 75% after 18 months; and 80% after 24 months. Comparing these figures, 'vehicle' seems to work better than no treatment at all.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-05-05 05:17:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We can provide no reliable evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum at present, except for 5% imiquimod, which based on moderate-quality evidence from three unpublished studies is probably no more effective in terms of clinical cure than its vehicle but is probably more harmful in terms of applications site reactions, and based on high-quality evidence is no more effective than its vehicle in terms of short-term improvement.</P>
<P>We found only a few randomised controlled trials that addressed physical destruction of molluscum lesions; these studies were small and at serious risk of bias. Until robust evidence emerges for effective and safe treatment, expectant management, that is awaiting spontaneous resolution of the molluscum lesions, remains a strong option for treating the condition. The studies in <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK> may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-05-05 05:24:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Additional well-designed, adequately powered, and preferably blinded randomised controlled studies are needed to provide high-quality clinical trial evidence upon which to base clinical decision-making. Future studies evaluating treatments for molluscum contagiosum should, as a priority, focus on commonly promoted and commonly used options for treatment (e.g. curettage, cryotherapy, salicylic acid) and preferably include a placebo or vehicle arm as long as no high-quality evidence supporting a treatment option is available. When comparing different types of treatments, the use of the double-dummy technique should be considered where possible. Regarding sample sizes, we suggest following GRADE guidance for information size (<A HREF="http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/">www.gradeworkinggroup.org</A>).</P>
<P>Limited data on the natural history of molluscum contagiosum is available. Additional studies into the rate of resolution without active interventions are therefore needed, preferably assessing this after various follow-up times (e.g. 1, 3, 6, and 12 months). This will help guide decisions concerning the use of active treatments.</P>
<P>Outcome measures of future trials should not only include cure, but also recurrence rates, spread of the disease to other people, disease-related quality of life, and scarring.</P>
<P>A standardised outcome measure (e.g. time to resolution of the lesions or resolution after three months) would make studies easier to compare. However, the difference in the nature of treatments, for example repeated topical application of a chemical substance versus physical destruction of the lesions, will probably hamper the harmonisation of timing of outcome measurement.</P>
<P>Statistical power must be considered in conjunction with outcomes that are meaningful for people with molluscum contagiosum. For example, it is likely that a treatment that results in statistically fewer lesions may not be considered worthwhile because this reduction may not be sufficient to improve appearance or quality of life. People should be able to weigh costs and benefits, taking into account resolution of lesions, adverse effects, and treatment burden.</P>
<P>Molluscum contagiosum is a common disease in people with immune deficiency (e.g. people living with HIV). There is also a sexually transmitted variant that affects sexually active people without immune deficiency, which we excluded from this review. There is a need for reviews of studies of treatments for these important subgroups of people with molluscum contagiosum.</P>

<P>The title of the published protocol was inadvertently left as 'Interventions for molluscum contagiosum in children', although a decision had been made not to restrict the review to children.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Differences between the protocol and the current update</HEADING>
<P>For differences between other published versions, please see the 'Differences between protocol and review' sections within the original publications.</P>
<P>
<B>Objectives</B>: In the protocol, we had planned to assess the effects of treatments, but in this and the previous updates we broadened this to include management strategies because waiting for natural resolution is a recognised option for dealing with molluscum contagiosum. We amended the text from that which was in the protocol to make our objectives more clear.</P>
<P>
<B>Types of studies</B>: In the protocol, we said that "studies should compare one or more treatments with another, with placebo, or with no treatment (waiting for natural response)"; we removed this sentence in this and previous updates because it refers to comparisons rather than studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Types of interventions</B>: We had planned to include randomised trials of all treatments for molluscum contagiosum, but narrowed this to include only treatments aimed at eradicating molluscum contagiosum lesions, and excluded studies on other aspects of the treatment of molluscum contagiosum, for example on reducing pain in the studies that assessed the effect of using an analgesic EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics) cream before the actual intervention took place. This was because the analgesic was not used to eradicate the molluscum lesions.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes</B>: We decided that our original choice for 'short-term clinical cure' of one month was not realistic, and therefore changed it to three months. We have also clarified our primary outcome to make it more manageable: short-term clinical cure (up to three months after treatment). (Please see <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK> for a more detailed description of why we felt the original choice was not realistic.) We also deleted the term 'elevated' in the description, as we felt it was unnecessary and could possibly cause confusion, the implication being that there are elevated and non-elevated forms of the lesion.</P>
<P>Where included studies used the term 'complete clearance' or 'free of lesions' or 'cured or &gt; 90% cleared', we classed these as our primary outcome 'short-term clinical cure (up to three months after start of treatment)' or our secondary outcome 'medium- and long-term cure (after three months and up to six months, and after six months, respectively)'. Where studies have referred to 'partial clearance', we took this to mean our secondary outcome 'improvement'.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes</B>: We did not initially specify the outcome 'disease-related quality of life' in the protocol, but added it afterwards as we considered it to be a relevant additional measure.</P>
<P>We also added 'short-, medium-, and long-term improvement (including cure, intervals as above)' as a secondary outcome as we considered it to be important. For this outcome we combined 'improvement' and 'cure' (even though cure alone was a seperate outcome) because 'improvement' would be hard to interpret without also including those who were cured. For example: suppose in group A, 30% were cured and another 20% improved. In group B, 40% were cured and 10% improved. Comparing improvement rates between A and B (20% versus 10%) is misleading, whereas combining cure and improvement (50% versus 50%) is not.</P>
<P>
<B>Electronic searches</B>: We expanded the number of trial registries that we planned to search when we became aware of the existence of these registries and in line with current Cochrane Skin practices. For similar reasons, we added Google as an additional electronic search strategy.</P>
<P>
<B>Selection of studies</B>: If a randomised controlled trial included a variety of skin diseases, of which one was molluscum contagiosum, the number of molluscum participants needed to be at least five in the active treatment and placebo groups in order to reduce the role of extremely small studies. We added this criterion after the protocol was approved when we found a study that included 10 molluscum participants with a 9:1 distribution over the two treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Caballero-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Caballero 1996</LINK>). The criterion also applied to <LINK REF="STD-Manchanda-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Manchanda 1997a</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Selection of studies</B>: If the setting of the study was not explicitly mentioned in the text, we assumed it to be carried out at the affiliation of the first author. Also, if the full text of a study was not available, we considered published abstracts for this update, as we have done this for previous versions of the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</B>: In this update, we assessed each study using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), as this is now required. Also items (5), (6) and (7), which differed from the original protocol or were absent, were added or amended for the 2009 update as recommended. In previous versions of this review, items (3) and (4) were combined. For the 2016 update we further clarified how we decided what constituted an 'adequate' assessment and therefore low risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Measures of treatment effect: </B>Following the recent Cochrane Skin Group recommendations, we decided post hoc to re-analyse results from individual studies with borderline significance and with low numbers of events (fewer than 10 in total) or a total sample size of less than 30, using Fisher&#8217;s exact test. The resulting P value was leading in interpreting the results.</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis: </B>We had planned to express dichotomous results as odds ratios, but changed this to risk ratios and as a number needed to treat where appropriate because these are easier for most readers to understand. We decided to report numbers needed to treat only for comparisons with more than one study and only in the case of statistically significant differences, the latter because numbers needed to treat for differences that are statistically not significant produce large and uncertain confidence intervals.</P>
<P>When the same comparison between two interventions was made in more than one study, and studies appeared to have been executed in similar groups and settings, we planned to use statistical tests for homogeneity between studies. In those studies where the available data were sufficiently homogenous and where a pooled estimate of the treatment effect made sense, we planned to conduct a meta-analysis. However, we could not implement these plans in most cases due to lack of data.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of reporting biases</B>: Subsequent to the protocol, we aimed to assess reporting bias by comparing the published trial publications with the study protocol, but no protocols were available.</P>
<P>
<B>Unit of analysis issues: </B>In our methods we planned to use special analytic techniques for paired (split-body) designs; however, we were unable to do this as the paired data were not available to us.</P>
<P>
<B>Dealing with missing data</B>: Although this was not specified in the protocol, we considered participants who dropped out or were lost to follow-up as treatment failures.</P>
<P>
<B>Unit of analysis issues/Assessment of heterogeneity/Sensitivity analysis:</B> We had planned analyses not documented in the protocol, including the use of sensitivity analyses to examine the effects of excluding studies with lower reported methodological quality, as well as how to analyse cross-over trials and within-participant designed trials. However, we did not undertake these analyses because of the small number of studies for each comparison.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis</B>: We planned to use sensitivity analyses to examine the effects of excluding studies with high risk of bias. However, we did not undertake these analyses because of the small number of studies for each comparison.</P>
<P>
<B>Summary of findings:</B> We developed 'Summary of findings' tables subsequent to our protocol. We have produced one for this update.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence: </B>We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each primary outcome and key secondary outcomes.</P>
