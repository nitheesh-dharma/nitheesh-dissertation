<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-24 09:57:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hospital patients can develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs and pelvic veins immediately after surgery or if they are not mobile because of a medical illness. Symptoms vary from none to pain and swelling in the legs. A blood clot can move from the leg to the lungs, with the danger of pulmonary embolism (PE) and death. Usually the DVT clears up or has long-term effects such as high venous pressure in the leg, leg pain, swelling, darkening of the skin or inflammation.</P>
<P>DVT can be prevented using compression or drugs. Drugs may cause bleeding, which is a particular concern in surgical patients. Graduated compression stockings (GCS) help prevent blood clots forming in the legs by applying varying amounts of pressure to different parts of the leg. We identified 19 randomised controlled trials (2745 analytic units made up of 1681 individual patients and 1064 individual legs). Eight trials compared wearing stockings to no stockings and 10 compared stockings plus another method with that method alone in patients undergoing surgery. The other methods used were Dextran 70, aspirin, heparin, and mechanical sequential compression. Of the 19 trials, nine included patients undergoing general surgery, six included patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, and only one trial included medical patients. The compression stockings were applied on the day before surgery or on the day of surgery and were worn up until discharge or until the patients were fully mobile. In the majority of the included studies DVT was identified by the radioactive I<SUP>125</SUP> uptake test. Overall, included studies were of good quality.</P>
<P>Our review confirmed that GCS reduce the risk of DVT in hospitalised surgical patients. It also demonstrated that GCS may reduce the risk of developing DVT in the thighs (proximal DVT) and PE in such patients, though these results were based on a much smaller number of participants. The incidence of adverse effects and complications associated with wearing GCS was poorly reported in the included studies. Limited evidence was available for hospitalised medical patients, with only one study suggesting the effectiveness of GCS in preventing DVT in such patients.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-24 05:38:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nineteen RCTs were identified involving 1681 individual patients and 1064 individual legs (2745 analytic units). Of these 19 trials, nine included patients undergoing general surgery, six included patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, and only one trial included medical patients. Graduated compression stockings were applied on the day before surgery or on the day of surgery and were worn up until discharge or until the patients were fully mobile. In the majority of the included studies DVT was identified by the radioactive I<SUP>125</SUP> uptake test. Overall, included studies were of good quality.</P>
<P>In the treatment group (GCS) of 1391 units 126 developed DVT (9%) in comparison to the control group (without GCS) of 1354 units where 282 (21%) developed DVT. The Peto odds ratio (OR) was 0.33 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.41) with an overall effect favouring treatment with GCS (P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>Based on results from eight included studies, the incidence of proximal DVT was 7 of 517 (1%) units in the treatment group and 28 of 518 (5%) units in the control group. The Peto OR was 0.26 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.53) with an overall effect favouring treatment with GCS (P = 0.0002). Based on results from five included studies, the incidence of PE was 5 of 283 (2%) participants in the treatment group and 14 of 286 (5%) in the control group. The Peto OR was 0.38 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.96) with an overall effect favouring treatment with GCS (P = 0.04). Limited data were available to accurately assess the incidence of adverse effects and complications with the use of GCS.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-24 05:59:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-24 05:59:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The occurrence of one or more factors of Virchow's triad (stasis of blood, endothelial injury and hypercoagulability of blood) in the venous system often leads to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (<LINK REF="REF-Virchow-1858" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virchow 1858</LINK>). Diagnosis of DVT is difficult as the patient history is not specific and symptoms vary from no symptoms to pain and swelling in the legs. The sequelae of DVT vary from complete resolution of the clot without any ill effects through to death due to pulmonary embolism (PE).</P>
<P>Historically, the prevalence of DVT in the community was 0.2% and about 25% of hospitalised patients developed DVT (<LINK REF="REF-Clagett-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clagett 1988</LINK>). More recent data from control arms of randomised controlled trials suggest that the incidence of DVT in surgical patients is 29%, compared to 24% in medical patients, and the incidence of symptomatic PE is 3%, and 1%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Morbidity due to DVT includes post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), which encompasses chronic venous hypertension causing limb pain, swelling, hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin), dermatitis (inflammation of the skin), ulcers and lipodermatosclerosis (a hardening of the skin that may gain a red or brown pigmentation and is accompanied by wasting of the subcutaneous fat). Data from a prospective multicentre cohort study found that 43% of patients with symptomatic DVT developed features of PTS at two year follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mortality associated with DVT is greatest in the first 30 days, at 3% to 6%, though the risk of death remains increased even at long-term follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00f8_gaard-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Søgaard 2014</LINK>). Various reports suggest that 28% to 41% of patients with DVT subsequently develop a PE, which is associated with an increase in risk of 30 day mortality to approximately 12% (<LINK REF="REF-White-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients who are at risk of developing DVT are categorised into three groups of low, moderate and high risk according to the International Consensus Statement (<LINK REF="REF-ICS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICS 2013</LINK>) and Thromboembolic Risk Factor (THRIFT) consensus group guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-THRIFT-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">THRIFT 1992</LINK>). However, guidelines on prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2010</LINK>) no longer categorise patients into low, moderate and high risk groups. Instead, these guidelines look at risk factors for developing DVT in hospitalised patients on an individual basis.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-09-20 13:16:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both mechanical and pharmacological methods are used in the prevention of DVT. Pharmacological methods alter the blood coagulation profile and the major disadvantage of this is the risk of bleeding, which may be of particular concern in surgical patients. For example, the altered coagulation may lead to joint haematomas following joint replacement surgery and intracranial haemorrhage following head injury or neurosurgery. Mechanical methods include techniques such as intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) and wearing of graduated compression stockings (GCS), which have a physiological action and are used in moderate and high risk patients.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-09-20 13:16:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The exact mechanism by which GCS function is unknown. However, there is evidence to suggest that they exert graded circumferential pressure distally to proximally and, when combined with muscular activity in the limb, are thought to displace blood from the superficial to the deep venous system via the perforating veins. It is argued that this effectively increases the velocity and volume of flow in the deep system thereby potentially preventing thrombosis (<LINK REF="REF-Benko-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benko 2001</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-09-20 13:16:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the theoretical effectiveness and widespread use of compression stockings their clinical effectiveness needs further appraisal. Improper application of stockings may potentially cause complications such as oedema of the legs, DVT and arterial ischaemia. Stockings may also be contraindicated for medical reasons. The extent to which the leg profile of patients may limit effectiveness has not been addressed. Recommendations regarding the ideal length of stockings (knee length versus thigh length) are not the subject of this review. This is assessed by a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Sajid-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sajid 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two review authors (AS, MJD) independently assessed the risk of bias for all the included studies using five domains: adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and other biases. The assessment tool outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) was used to assess whether the studies were free of potential bias and studies were marked accordingly as 'Yes' (low risk), 'No' (high risk) and 'Unclear'. If inadequate information was available, the risk of bias was reported to be 'Unclear'. Discrepancies between the review author's opinions were discussed and a consensus was reached.</P>

<P>The effectiveness of treatment (that is the use of GCS) was assessed by recording the incidence of DVT in the treatment (stockinged) group compared to that in the control (non-stockinged) group.

<P>Analysis of the cumulative data was performed using Peto's odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model.

The exception was <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1989</LINK>, which involved neurosurgical patients aged 16 years and above. One trial involved patients with myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 1993</LINK>), aged 70 years and over; and one trial involved patients undergoing cardiac surgery, aged 18 to 81 years (<LINK REF="STD-Shirai-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Shirai 1985</LINK>).</P>

Both these groups were combined for the purposes of this review. One patient in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1989</LINK> wore knee-length stockings due to obesity.

<P>In all trials GCS were applied either on the day of admission or on the day of operation. This was not critically evaluated on the assumption that all patients were fully mobile prior to surgery.

One further trial was excluded as it used a retrospective control group (<LINK REF="STD-Caprini-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Caprini 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Incidence of DVT was not assessed in five of the trials considered during the selection of studies for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Benko-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Benko 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ibegbuna-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ibegbuna 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manella-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Manella 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1994</LINK>). One trial solely relied on a clinical diagnosis of DVT and did not use an objective method for confirmation (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkins-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkins 1952</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 1988</LINK>) was excluded as it relied solely upon the use of the Tc<SUP>99m</SUP> plasmin test as, according to the authors, it is faster and less labour intensive compared to other tests. This test has high sensitivity (91% to 100%) but low specificity (33% to 67%) and consequently has not gained widespread use for diagnosing DVT (<LINK REF="REF-Bergqvist-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergqvist 1990</LINK>). Therefore, it was likely that a number of positive results in this study may have been false positives, which may have accounted for the high reported incidence of DVT. This necessitated the confirmation of positive results using another method, which was not done in this study. Furthermore, the method of randomisation, which was not described, did not appear to be reliable as there was a substantial difference in the number of patients allocated to the GCS group (74 patients) and the GCS + heparin group (89 patients). Furthermore, these groups may not have been comparable due to considerable bias between the type of abdominal surgery that patients in each group underwent.</P>
<P>Similarly, one further trial was excluded as it was unclear whether the protocol for diagnosis of DVT was standardised throughout the study (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>). It was also not clear whether all patients or only selected patients were scanned routinely, how symptomatic DVTs or PEs were 'objectively' diagnosed and whether this was standardised throughout the study. It seemed that some patients were scanned using ultrasound and some using venography. If this was the case, the split between the two methodologies was not clear. Furthermore, patients with asymptomatic DVT only seemed to have been assessed proximally; it was unclear whether they were also examined for more distal DVTs. It was not clear which veins were examined for proximal DVTs and whether this was standardised throughout the study. The authors were contacted to seek clarification, however these queries remained unanswered at the time of publication.</P>
<P>Seven trials were not adequately randomised and were thus excluded from this review (<LINK REF="STD-Borow-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Borow 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ibarra_x002d_Perez-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ibarra-Perez 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inada-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Inada 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ishak-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Ishak 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liavag-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Liavag 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moser-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moser 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pitto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pitto 2008</LINK>). One additional trial was excluded due to unclear randomisation, cause of dropouts and method of monitoring the occurrence of DVT in trial participants (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1993</LINK>). The method of randomisation was not made clear in one French trial and this was therefore excluded from this review (<LINK REF="STD-Marescaux-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marescaux 1981</LINK>). One trial was not amenable to analysis as the figures were difficult to interpret (<LINK REF="STD-Mellbring-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mellbring 1986</LINK>), and was therefore also excluded.</P>
<P>Four trials were excluded as they did not use the correct type of stockings (that is GCS), which was a pre-specified criterion for inclusion. Of these, two trials used pneumatic compression (<LINK REF="STD-Ramos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ramos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westrich-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Westrich 1996</LINK>), one trial used Tubigrip (<LINK REF="STD-Rosengarten-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rosengarten 1970</LINK>) and one trial used thick elastic compression stockings instead of thromboembolic deterrent stockings (<LINK REF="STD-Flanc-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Flanc 1969</LINK>). The type of stocking used was not clear in one French trial (<LINK REF="STD-Patel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 1988</LINK>), which was thus excluded.</P>
<P>Stockings reduce the cross-sectional area of the deep veins making the calf muscle pump more effectively and thereby improve blood flow. Authors of the CLOTS trial have suggested that severe leg weakness in patients with acute stroke may therefore account for the ineffectiveness of stockings in this patient group (<LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK>). Two trials on patients with acute stroke (<LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muir-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Muir 2000</LINK>) were thus excluded from this review but included in a separate Cochrane review focusing on patients with acute stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Naccarato-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naccarato 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four trials were only published as abstracts, making it difficult to accurately assess their methodology and to extract data (<LINK REF="STD-Bolton-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Bolton 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brunkwall-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Brunkwall 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perkins-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perkins 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sultan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sultan 2011</LINK>). Further information provided by the authors of the <LINK REF="STD-Sultan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sultan 2011</LINK> trial showed that not all patients participating in this trial had been hospitalised, and this trial therefore did not meet our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>The study design for two studies could not be adequately assessed as the reports were not published in English (<LINK REF="STD-Celebi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Celebi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wille_x002d_Jorgensen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wille-Jorgensen 1986</LINK>).

<P>Results should be read with caution, paying particular attention to the notes under <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> as these may influence the analysis. This is because of the variations within the included trials, for example the use of the opposite limb as the control, differing background prophylactic methods used and the age difference in some of the trials. These are discussed in detail. However, in all of the included trials a statistically significant difference between the treated patients (those that used GCS) and the control group (those that did not use GCS) was demonstrated; that is, the analyses did favour stockings and there was no obvious difference between subgroups.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence of DVT</HEADING>
<P>As part of the 2014 update, trials assessing the effectiveness of GCS as the sole method of prophylaxis were merged together with trials using a background method of thromboprophylaxis for all patients in addition to the use of GCS in the treatment group. This resulted in a total of 2745 analytic units (1681 individual patients and 1064 individual legs) in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In the treatment group (GCS), 126 of the 1391 units developed DVT in comparison to 282 of the 1354 units in the control group (no GCS): Peto's odds ratio (OR) of 0.33 (95% Cl 0.26 to 0.41). This amounted to a 9% incidence of DVT in the treatment group in comparison to 21% in the control group.</P>
<P>The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic for this analysis suggested 0% heterogeneity, with P &gt; 0.1 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). This was supported by the corresponding forest plot (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), using Peto's ORs, which showed that results for all studies were within or on the 95% CI suggesting minimal publication bias.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis by specialty</HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analysis was performed based upon the specialty under which the participants were managed (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). There was no significant difference between specialty subgroups regarding the effectiveness of stockings in reducing the incidence of DVT (P = 0.08). The majority of participants were general surgical patients, who accounted for 1378 of 2745 participants (50%). Amongst this cohort the incidence of DVT was 44 of 687 (6%) in the treatment group and 140 of 691 (20%) in the control group, based on results from 9 of 19 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Allan-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allan 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holford-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Holford 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scurr-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Scurr 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scurr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Scurr 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torngern-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Torngern 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsapogas-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Tsapogas 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wille_x002d_Jorgensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wille-Jorgensen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wille_x002d_Jorgensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wille-Jorgensen 1991</LINK>) (Peto's OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.38).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence of proximal DVT</HEADING>
<P>Proximal DVTs are felt to be of greatest clinical significance as they are more likely to embolise to the pulmonary veins and can thereby potentially result in fatal PE. The incidence of proximal DVT in the two experimental arms of the included trials was therefore assessed. Eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fredin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fredin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalodiki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kalodiki 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scurr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Scurr 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1989</LINK>) provided data for the incidence of proximal DVT amongst 1035 included units (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The incidence of proximal DVT was 7 of 517 (1%) units in the treatment group and 28 of 518 (5%) units in the control group (Peto's OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.53). There was no significant difference between subgroup specialities regarding the effectiveness of stockings in reducing the incidence of proximal DVT (P = 0.79).</P>

Routine screening for PE was only conducted in two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Holford-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Holford 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalodiki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kalodiki 1996</LINK>), using perfusion-ventilation scintigraphy. This method was used to confirm clinically apparent PE in the remaining studies, except in one trial where PE was diagnosed at autopsy (<LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1989</LINK>). The incidence of PE was 5 of 283 (2%) participants in the treatment group and 14 of 286 (5%) in the control group (Peto's OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.96) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). These results should be interpreted with caution in light of the aforementioned limitations in reporting of the incidence of PE in the included trials.</P>
<P>One further trial (<LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1989</LINK>) reported that one patient was diagnosed with PE at autopsy but did not state which group this patient belonged to. The cause of death of this patient was, however, found to be cerebral oedema. Two further trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fredin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fredin 1989</LINK>) reported a cumulative incidence of three cases of PE but did not specify which group these patients belonged to. One further trial (<LINK REF="STD-Torngern-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Torngern 1980</LINK>) reported that none of the participants suffered fatal PE.

<P>The 19 RCTs that were analysed showed that application of GCS significantly decreased the occurrence of DVT in hospitalised patients (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of proximal DVT was reported in eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fredin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fredin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalodiki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kalodiki 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scurr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Scurr 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1989</LINK>) and the incidence of PE was reported in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holford-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Holford 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalodiki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kalodiki 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wille_x002d_Jorgensen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wille-Jorgensen 1985</LINK>). A lower incidence of proximal DVT (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) and PE (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) was noted amongst patients fitted with GCS. However, the low incidence rate coupled with a relatively small sample size limits the power of these meta-analyses, thereby making it difficult to confidently infer the effectiveness of GCS in preventing these outcomes.</P>
<P>GCS on their own are effective in decreasing the risk of DVT, but the data obtained suggest that they are more effective on the background of another prophylactic method (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). However, it has to be stressed that results for the use of GCS over a background method of thromboprophylaxis should be viewed with some caution as this group of trials was heterogeneous; the background prophylaxis varied between Dextran 70, heparin, aspirin and sequential compression. The extent of influence of individual background prophylaxis could not be assessed since further grouping would have reduced the number of patients so much that the data would not be valid.</P>
<P>Few adverse events were reported. In one trial some patients removed their stockings earlier than they should have done, presumably due to discomfort (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 1996</LINK>). No other trials reported complications associated with wearing stockings. In one trial some patients developed post-phlebitic changes (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 1993</LINK>). In contrast, bleeding complications related to the associated use of heparin, Dextran or aspirin were mentioned in four studies, but the numbers were too small and not uniform enough to make any definitive comment (<LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fredin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fredin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalodiki-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kalodiki 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wille_x002d_Jorgensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wille-Jorgensen 1991</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-11-24 07:34:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review predominantly includes patients undergoing general surgical and orthopaedic surgical procedures (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) and thus provides good evidence for the use of GCS amongst these patient groups. However, only one RCT included medical patients (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 1993</LINK>) and no trial included low risk patients. Hence we cannot comment on the benefits of using GCS in these patient groups.</P>
<P>The available evidence is based predominantly on the use of above-knee stockings. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 1996</LINK>) looked at the difference between thigh-length GCS versus no stockings and knee-length GCS versus no stockings. In six trials the length of the GCS used was not made explicit (<LINK REF="STD-Allan-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Allan 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohlund-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlund 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wille_x002d_Jorgensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wille-Jorgensen 1991</LINK>). The numbers were too small to draw any conclusions as to the efficacy of DVT prevention based on the length of the stockings used. Therefore, based on this review, there is insufficient evidence to recommend below-knee or above-knee stockings. This is not the remit of this review but is the subject of another Cochrane review, which recently reported insufficient high quality evidence to determine whether knee-length and thigh-length stockings differ in their effectiveness in reducing the incidence of DVT in hospitalised patients (<LINK REF="REF-Sajid-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sajid 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the RCTs were uniform in detailing or recommending the duration of time that GCS should be worn post-operatively; that is, up until discharge, until mobilisation or up until the next clinic visit. This aspect is important because we know from clinical experience that DVT can still occur at home after discharge, and there have been a number of incidences of death after discharge that were due to DVT and PE. This is further supported by the results from the Million Women Study (<LINK REF="REF-Sweetland-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweetland 2009</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-11-24 07:37:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nineteen RCTs have been included in this meta-analysis providing 2745 analytic units to determine the effectiveness of the use of GCS in hospitalised patients (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). This sample size provides robust evidence to advocate the use of GCS in the clinical setting, especially amongst surgical patients since most included patients underwent either general surgical or orthopaedic surgical procedures (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Only one included trial considered medical participants (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 1993</LINK>), making it difficult to make a judgement regarding this subgroup of patients.</P>
<P>Furthermore, subgroup analysis based on type of procedure, length of stockings used, or type of background prophylaxis is limited by the small sample sizes. We cannot make a confident assessment of the variation in effectiveness of GCS over these parameters.</P>
<P>Overall, the included studies are of good quality and provide robust evidence for the effectiveness of GCS in preventing DVT.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-11-24 07:51:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interestingly, all but one of 19 trials included in this review were conducted before the CONSORT guidelines for reporting RCTs were published (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 1996</LINK>). Most importantly, 11 of 19 trials either did not report or used an inappropriate method of randomisation (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> section). A sensitivity analysis was therefore performed to assess the associated potential risk of bias, which found no significant difference in the effectiveness of stockings in reducing the incidence of DVT amongst trials which reported an appropriate method of randomisation and those that did not (P = 0.51, <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six of the 19 included RCTs involved the use of the other leg as the control (<LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scurr-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Scurr 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scurr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Scurr 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shirai-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Shirai 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torngern-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Torngern 1980</LINK>). It is possible that GCS applied to one leg could have an effect on the other leg of the same patient (<LINK REF="REF-Spiro-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiro 1970</LINK>), although there is no clear evidence for this. If this is true, it may bias the results of these studies. None of the included studies randomising individual legs reported the use of a matched or paired analysis to address statistical bias due to ignoring the pairing. This may result in these studies receiving too little weight in the meta-analysis due to wider confidence intervals, and thereby possibly disguising clinically important heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). However, since the studies are underweighted rather than overweighted the analysis is conservative. Despite such concerns, all these trials have demonstrated that GCS significantly reduced the risk of DVT compared to when GCS were not applied. A sensitivity analyses performed to assess this further found stockings to be effective in reducing the incidence of DVT irrespective of whether the unit of randomisation was individual legs or individual patients (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). In other words, there was no difference in the effectiveness of stockings in reducing the incidence of DVT irrespective of the unit of randomisation (P = 0.06).</P>
<P>As part of this update, we merged trials using stockings as the sole method of thromboprophylaxis and those using stockings over a background method of thromboprophylaxis, thereby introducing a potential bias. Both these groups of trials, however, demonstrated a reduced incidence of DVT, with or without a background method of thromboprophylaxis (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>), with no significant difference in the magnitude of effect (P = 0.07).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Flordal-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flordal 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Lensing-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lensing 1993</LINK> have previously highlighted poor efficacy of using FUT as the only diagnostic modality for DVT. In this review, 7 of the 19 included trials solely relied on FUT to diagnose DVT. A sensitivity analysis was therefore performed to assess the associated potential risk of bias by the inclusion of these studies (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>). This analysis noted that results of trials using phlebography to confirm the diagnosis of DVT following a positive FUT, and those using other modalities for the diagnosis of DVT (ultrasonography, or phlebography alone), also strongly favoured the use of stockings in diminishing the risk of DVT. There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of stockings in reducing the incidence of DVT between subgroups of diagnostic modalities (P = 0.17).</P>
<P>After excluding stroke patients, only one RCT was identified that involved a medical specialty. This was in patients following a myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 1993</LINK>). Thus it is difficult to confidently comment on the effectiveness of GCS in preventing DVT in medical patients and further trials are required in this cohort of patients.</P>
<P>Two trials that were only published as abstracts (<LINK REF="STD-Brunkwall-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Brunkwall 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perkins-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perkins 1999</LINK>) were not included as they did not provide sufficient information to assess the study design. Objective diagnosis of all instances of DVT was required to ensure accuracy of results and two trials were therefore excluded from this review as they did not seem to meet this requirement (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilkins-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkins 1952</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is important to note that visual interpretation of the funnel plot demonstrated a borderline risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) in assessing the effectiveness of stockings in preventing DVT (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). However, no clear evidence of publication bias was noted in meta-analyses for the incidence of proximal DVT and PE (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-11-24 07:52:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results from this review are comparable to those of a previous health technology assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Roderick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roderick 2005</LINK>), which found a 66% risk reduction with the application of GCS stockings and a 60% risk reduction when GCS stockings were used on a background of another prophylactic method. The variation in the degree of risk reduction reported by that review, as compared to our results, may be because their analyses were based upon the number of patients originally randomised in the included trials and included patients who were later excluded. Furthermore, a number of trials included in <LINK REF="REF-Roderick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roderick 2005</LINK> did not meet our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>NICE have published guidance for reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism amongst hospitalised patients (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Their recommendations are consistent with our finding that GCS are more effective than no prophylaxis. However, NICE recommends that GCS should not be prescribed to patients admitted for stroke. This was based primarily on the <LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK> trial in which large proportions of patients were prescribed aspirin, which may have influenced the results. It also raises the issue of lack of evidence concerning the use of mechanical prophylaxis in medical patients.</P>

<P>There is robust evidence in this review that the use of GCS in post-surgical patients significantly reduces the risk of DVT, with or without other methods of background thromboprophylaxis, where clinically appropriate. Therefore, GCS should be considered in all surgical patients at risk of development of DVT unless they have specific contraindications.</P>

<P>There is scope for more research in this field.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Studies are needed to evaluate whether specific target groups such as patients with malignancy, a past history of DVT or hypercoagulable states would benefit from the use of GCS.</LI>
<LI>Studies are needed to investigate the duration of DVT prophylaxis after discharge from hospital that is required to prevent DVT episodes at home.</LI>
<LI>The complications associated with the use of GCS have not been specifically addressed in any of these RCTs. This needs to be examined further, particularly in specific groups such as orthopaedic patients, because concerns have been raised that consequent complications may outweigh their benefits if GCS are worn improperly.</LI>
<LI>Randomised controlled trials are needed:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>in patients with medical illness as opposed to surgical illness,</LI>
<LI>to compare above-knee with below-knee GCS,</LI>
<LI>to compare GCS against other methods of prophylaxis.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Finally, the cost implications for any health service providers, and comparison with other methods, need to be assessed.</LI>

<P>Previous versions of this review divided trials into two groups: GCS as sole method of thromboprophylaxis (that is those which compared GCS alone versus no thromboprophylaxis) and GCS as adjuvant method of thromboprophylaxis (that is those which compared GCS over a background of method of thromboprophylaxis versus background method of thromboprophylaxis alone).

<P>This study excludes for inadequate reason the two most recent, largest and relevant studies on this topic (<LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>). Both studies showed no benefit to stockings and if included within the review would have meant the conclusions would be changes completely to showing no conclusive benefit of stockings. Most of the included studies are old, small patients numbers and only presented asymptomatic thrombosis events. All of questionable relevance to current practice. Given these studies showing no benefit of stocking and potential for harm I feel the Cochrane review is inaccurate and should not be allowed and if it cannot be immediately updated to included these studies the review should be withdrawn.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2015-10-28 22:43:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mr Parker highlights the exclusion of two trials from this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK>), stating "inadequate reason" for their exclusion. The reasons for excluding both these trials are clearly stated in our review, and revisited below.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK> trial was excluded as it focused on patients hospitalised following acute stroke. The authors of this trial have clearly stated that a potential mechanism of action of GCS (i.e. increasing velocity of venous blood flow by improving effectiveness of the calf muscle pump) is lost in patients with severe leg weakness following acute stroke. This patient group, and consequently the CLOTS trial, has therefore been excluded from our review, and is the focus of a separate Cochrane review exclusively focusing on stroke patients (<LINK REF="REF-Naccarato-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naccarato 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2007</LINK> study was excluded following thorough critical review, as it was unclear whether a standardized protocol was used throughout the study. We noted a number of discrepancies in this trial (such as variation in the use of imaging modalities and how an &#8220;objective&#8221; diagnosis of symptomatic DVTs was made), and felt it was unclear whether all patients or only selected patients were routinely scanned for DVT. This placed this study at high risk of bias due to lack of consistency in outcome measurement, and it was therefore excluded from this review. With regards to adverse events, 7 of 391 patients (2%) in the Cohen study were stated to have experienced an adverse event related to the wearing of stockings. However, the nature or severity of these events was not reported. Overall, frequency of adverse events was comparable in the fondaparinux-only and fondaparinux+GCS groups. We attempted to contact the authors of this trial to seek further clarification and received no response. Nevertheless, despite the high potential risk for bias associated with this study, its inclusion would not have changed the overall findings on meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Though a number of studies included in this review had small numbers, our conclusions are based upon meta-analyses of 2745 analytic units, making our findings robust and reliable.</P>
<P>In conclusion we see no reason to change the findings of our review.</P>
