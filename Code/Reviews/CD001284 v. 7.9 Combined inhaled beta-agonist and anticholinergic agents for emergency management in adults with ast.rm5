<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We looked at if combined treatment of short-acting beta-agonists and anticholinergics were more effective to improve outcomes in adults with asthma who were treated in emergency departments compared to treatment with beta-agonists alone.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Asthma attacks result from airway passages to the lungs becoming constricted due to inflammation, resulting in wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. People experiencing asthma attacks often go to emergency departments, and are usually treated using short-acting inhaled beta-agonists, although some patients may be treated with short-acting inhaled anticholinergics. </P>
<P>Some research looks at whether treating people with asthma in emergency departments with a combination of beta-agonists and anticholinergics is more effective than beta-agonists alone.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The search was current to July 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 23 studies that compared the effectiveness of combined treatment with beta-agonists and anticholinergics versus treatment with beta-agonists alone. A total of 2724 adult participants were enrolled in the studies. Salbutamol (also called albuterol) was the most common beta-agonist investigated and ipratropium bromide was the most common anticholinergic assessed. </P>
<P>
<B>Study fundin</B>
<B>g sources</B>
</P>
<P>We found that most studies did not report sources of funding (14 studies); one study was supported by a hospital; another received support from a pharmaceutical company, but indicated that there was no involvement from the company in conducting or reporting research. Two studies were part-funded and four were funded by pharmaceutical companies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Patients with severe asthma who received combined treatment of beta-agonists and anticholinergics were less likely to be admitted to hospital. An estimated 65 fewer patients per 1000 would require hospital admission after receiving combined inhaled therapy in the emergency department. Among patients with mild -to-moderate asthma, combined inhaled therapy was less effective in preventing admission to hospital compared with people with severe asthma. Patients receiving combined treatment were less likely to return to the emergency department with worsening asthma symptoms and had better outcomes in most lung function tests. On the other hand, 103 more participants per 1000 who receive combined inhaled therapy would experience side effects compared to people who receive beta-agonists alone.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Quality of the evidence that combination inhaled therapy can improve health outcomes compared to treatment with beta-agonists alone ranged from very low to moderate. Our confidence about the effects of combination inhaled therapy on hospital admissions, peak expiratory flow, percent change in peak expiratory flow from baseline, and relapse was moderate because of the overall risk of bias among included studies. Factors associated with inconsistency and imprecision were additional aspects that reduced the quality of the evidence for forced expiratory volume in one second, and percent predicted peak expiratory flow.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Inhaled short-acting anticholinergics (SAAC) and short-acting beta&#8322;-agonists (SABA) are effective therapies for adult patients with acute asthma who present to the emergency department (ED). It is unclear, however, whether the combination of SAAC and SABA treatment is more effective in reducing hospitalisations compared to treatment with SABA alone.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>To conduct an up-to-date systematic search and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of combined inhaled therapy (SAAC + SABA agents) vs. SABA alone to reduce hospitalisations in adult patients presenting to the ED with an exacerbation of asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:24:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS, LILACS, ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global and evidence-based medicine (EBM) databases using controlled vocabulary, natural language terms, and a variety of specific and general terms for inhaled SAAC and SABA drugs. The search spanned from 1946 to July 2015. The Cochrane Airways Group provided search results from the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials which was most recently conducted in July 2016. An extensive search of the grey literature was completed to identify any other potentially relevant studies.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Included studies were randomised or controlled clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of combined inhaled therapy (SAAC and SABA) to SABA treatment alone to prevent hospitalisations in adults with acute asthma in the emergency department. Two independent review authors assessed studies for inclusion using pre-determined criteria.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated individual and pooled statistics as risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model and reporting heterogeneity (I). For continuous outcomes, we reported individual trial results using mean differences (MD) and pooled results as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs using a random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>We included 23 studies that involved a total of 2724 enrolled participants. Most studies were rated at unclear or high risk of bias. </P>
<P>Overall, participants receiving combination inhaled therapy were less likely to be hospitalised (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.87; participants = 2120; studies = 16; I = 12%; moderate quality of evidence). An estimated 65 fewer patients per 1000 would require hospitalisation after receiving combination therapy (95% 30 to 95), compared to 231 per 1000 patients receiving SABA alone. Although combination inhaled therapy was more effective than SABA treatment alone in reducing hospitalisation in participants with severe asthma exacerbations, this was not found for participants with mild or moderate exacerbations (test for difference between subgroups P = 0.02). </P>
<P>Participants receiving combination therapy were more likely to experience improved forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV&#8321;) (MD 0.25 L, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.48; participants = 687; studies = 6; I = 70%; low quality of evidence), peak expiratory flow (PEF) (MD 36.58 L/min, 95% CI 23.07 to 50.09; participants = 1056; studies = 12; I = 25%; very low quality of evidence), increased percent change in PEF from baseline (MD 24.88, 95% CI 14.83 to 34.93; participants = 551; studies = 7; I = 23%; moderate quality of evidence), and were less likely to return to the ED for additional care (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98; participants = 1180; studies = 5; I = 0%; moderate quality of evidence) than participants receiving SABA alone. </P>
<P>Participants receiving combination inhaled therapy were more likely to experience adverse events than those treated with SABA agents alone (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.20; participants = 1392; studies = 11; I = 14%; moderate quality of evidence). Among patients receiving combination therapy, 103 per 1000 were likely to report adverse events (95% 31 to 195 more) compared to 131 per 1000 patients receiving SABA alone.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Overall, combination inhaled therapy with SAAC and SABA reduced hospitalisation and improved pulmonary function in adults presenting to the ED with acute asthma. In particular, combination inhaled therapy was more effective in preventing hospitalisation in adults with severe asthma exacerbations who are at increased risk of hospitalisation, compared to those with mild-moderate exacerbations, who were at a lower risk to be hospitalised. A single dose of combination therapy and multiple doses both showed reductions in the risk of hospitalisation among adults with acute asthma. However, adults receiving combination therapy were more likely to experience adverse events, such as tremor, agitation, and palpitations, compared to patients receiving SABA alone.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Acute asthma is a common cause for visits to the emergency department (ED). Although most people with acute asthma are safely discharged home, some require admission to hospital for continued care. Of those presenting to an ED for acute asthma, approximately 11% (<LINK REF="REF-Hasegawa-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasegawa 2013</LINK>) to 13% (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2010</LINK>) were hospitalised in Japan and Canada respectively. The percentage of people who reported being hospitalised for asthma in the previous year ranged from 7% in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2000</LINK>), 9% in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2002</LINK>), 15% in the Asia-Pacific region (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2003</LINK>) and 22% in Latin America (<LINK REF="REF-Neffen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neffen 2005</LINK>). The direct costs (including prescriptions, hospitalisations, clinic and ED visits) for asthma in the United States are approximately USD 5.1 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1997</LINK>), while in Canada, direct costs were approximately CAD 306 million (<LINK REF="REF-Krahn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krahn 1996</LINK>). In Europe the estimated total costs of asthma are approximately EUR 17.7 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Braman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braman 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Generally, adults presenting to the ED with acute asthma are treated with inhaled bronchodilators. There are two inhaled bronchodilators which have been proven to be particularly effective in reducing airway bronchospasm: short-acting anticholinergics (SAAC; <LINK REF="REF-Aaron-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaron 2001</LINK>) and short-acting beta&#8322; -agonists (SABA; <LINK REF="REF-Price-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 1989</LINK>). While SABA agents have become the first-line treatment for people with acute asthma, some researchers have examined if there could be a synergistic effect in combining SAAC with SABA to improve important outcomes, such as improvements in pulmonary function, reduced hospitalisations, and improved quality of life.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>The combination of inhaled SAAC and SABA agents potentially improves pulmonary function because each has a different mechanism of action designed to reduce airway bronchospasm. While SABA agents are known for their strong bronchodilating effect through their effect on airway smooth muscle and quick onset of action, SAAC agents act through different receptors, reduce airway secretions, and are weaker bronchodilators. Although SAAC agents have a slower onset of action, they are longer-acting (<LINK REF="STD-Lanes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lanes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rebuck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rebuck 1987</LINK>). The combination of inhaled SAAC and SABA agents may provide prolonged and enhanced bronchodilation, and reduce need for hospitalisation compared to traditional treatment with SABA agents alone. Indeed, <LINK REF="STD-Rebuck-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Rebuck 1987</LINK>, found that one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV&#8321;) was significantly improved among patients receiving combined inhaled therapy of SAAC and SABA agents than those receiving either SAAC or SABA agents alone. Additional studies suggest that combination inhaled therapy may provide greater improvements in pulmonary function than treatment with SABA agents alone (<LINK REF="STD-Garrett-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Garrett 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakano-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Although some evidence supports the use of combination inhaled therapy, some studies found no significant difference between combination inhaled therapy or SABA alone in changes to pulmonary function or hospitalisation (<LINK REF="STD-Cydulka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cydulka 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FitzGerald-1997" TYPE="STUDY">FitzGerald 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Salo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1999</LINK>). Accordingly, some reviews have attempted to pool and summarise the available evidence. A Cochrane review that considered children with acute asthma found combination inhaled therapy reduced the risk of hospitalisation, improved pulmonary function, and reduced the risk of adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2013</LINK>). With regard to adults with acute asthma, a pooled analysis of three studies reported a small benefit from combination inhaled therapy to improve pulmonary function and reduce risk of hospitalisation (<LINK REF="STD-Lanes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lanes 1998</LINK>). Similarily, a systematic review of 16 studies found that combination inhaled therapy reduced hospitalisation and improved pulmonary function in adults with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2005</LINK>). However, it is important to note that <LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2005</LINK> included studies that assessed patients either in the ED or hospital, as well as studies that provided patients with either long-acting anticholinergics (LAAC) or SAAC agents as part of the combination inhaled therapy. </P>
<P>Since 2005, there have been several studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cydulka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cydulka 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hossain-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hossain 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Salo 2006</LINK>) which may impact the results of earlier systematic reviews. We found sufficient new evidence on the use of combination inhaled therapy (SAAC + SABA agents) vs. SABA alone for the treatment of acute asthma to indicate that a Cochrane review was necessary. The aim of this Cochrane review was to provide patients and healthcare professionals with current evidence to inform updating asthma guidelines on the use of combination inhaled therapy for adults in the ED.</P>

<P>Studies including adult (aged &#8805; 16 years) participants presenting to an ED or other equivalent acute care setting with an uncomplicated exacerbation of asthma were considered for inclusion in this review. The asthma diagnosis needed to have been made using international or national clinical criteria or spirometric assessment results or both. Studies involving children or patients already admitted to hospital were excluded. Studies that enrolled participants with either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma were included only if COPD participants made up fewer than 20% of the total participant population, or if outcome data from the asthma only participants could be extracted for analysis.

These included: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005 to July 2015), ACP Journal Club (1991 to July 2015), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (second quarter 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (June 2015), Cochrane Methodology Register (third quarter 2012), Health Technology Assessment (second quarter 2015), and NHS Economic Evaluation Database (second quarter 2015). This search spanned from 1946 to July 2015. We also searched the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials which was most recently conducted on July 2016 (<LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>Search terms were adapted for each database using controlled vocabulary (e.g. MESH, EMTREE, etc.) and natural language terms and a variety of specific and general terms for beta&#8322;-agonists and short-acting anticholinergic drugs. Searches in MEDLINE and Embase were restricted to adult populations. No other limits were applied including year of publication or language. Articles published in languages other than English and unpublished articles were included. We sought translation of studies by fluent bilingual speakers, but if this could not occur, articles were translated using Google Translate. </P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>For dichotomous variables, individual and pooled statistics were calculated as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model. For clinically rare dichotomous events, such as adverse events, odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% CI using a random-effects model. A random-effects model was chosen over fixed-effect because it was assumed that the intervention effect would vary among included studies due to factors other than the intervention due to heterogeneity in study methodology, participant characteristics, co-interventions and interventions received. For continuous outcomes, individual trial results were reported using mean differences (MD) and pooled results as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs using a random-effects model. The weights given to each study in the pooled analysis were based on the inverse variance method.</P>

<P>Data were extracted by review authors (TN, AD, RC, BV) and checked for reliability (SWK). Studies were pooled only if they represented similar populations, outcomes, and designs, and the review authors judged that clinical heterogeneity was sufficiently low. The PRISMA checklist was used to ensure that standard outcomes were reported (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2009</LINK>). Statistical analyses were performed using <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>. We compiled a summary of findings table for outcomes including hospitalisations, adverse events, PEF, percent change from baseline PEF (%), FEV&#8321;, percent change FEV&#8321; (%), and relapse using GRADEpro (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).

The occurrence of other outcomes, such as hospitalisation and adverse events, was not provided. Attempts to contact the study authors to obtain additional data for the asthma population were unsuccessful, and as a result, only results for pulmonary function could be included in the meta-analysis.</P>

An attempt was made to estimate and categorise exacerbation severity among the included studies based on the pulmonary function eligibility criteria established by the study, in addition to the percentage of patients hospitalised in the SABA alone group, as developed and reported in a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2000b</LINK>). If studies reported forced expiatory volume in one second (FEV&#8321;) or peak expiratory flow (PEF) of less than 50% predicted, the overall severity of acute asthma among participants was considered to be severe (<LINK REF="STD-Cydulka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cydulka 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakano-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 2000</LINK>). Studies reporting FEV&#8321; or PEF of less than 70%, or a peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) of less than 200 L/minute, were estimated to have an overall exacerbation severity of mild, moderate, or severe based on the proportion of participants who were hospitalised. A percentage of hospitalisations of less than 10%, between 10% and 30%, and over 30% in the comparison groups were used to estimate the overall exacerbation severity of participants as mild (<LINK REF="STD-Kamei-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kamei 1999</LINK>), moderate (<LINK REF="STD-Diaz-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diaz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FitzGerald-1997" TYPE="STUDY">FitzGerald 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garrett-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Garrett 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karpel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Karpel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owens-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Owens 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Salo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solarte-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Solarte 2004</LINK>), or severe (<LINK REF="STD-Kohistani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kohistani 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1999</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). If studies did not report an eligibility criterion based on pulmonary function, then the overall estimate of acute asthma severity was based on the proportions of participants hospitalised in the SABA alone group and classified as either mild (<LINK REF="STD-Aggarwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aggarwal 2002</LINK>) or moderate (<LINK REF="STD-Diaz-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diaz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solarte-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Solarte 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Sensitivity analysis found that despite the removal of high risk of bias studies, participants receiving combination inhaled therapy were less likely to be hospitalised compared with participants receiving SABA alone (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.90; participants = 513; studies = 6; I = 22%; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). Similar results were very similar using random-effects (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.87; participants = 2120; studies = 16; I = 12%) and fixed-effect models (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.85; participants = 2120; studies = 16; I = 12%; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>There were 11 studies involving 1392 participants that compared the frequency of adverse events after treatment with combination inhaled therapy vs. SABA alone. Participants who received combination inhaled therapy were more likely to experience adverse events than those who received SABA agents alone (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.20; participants = 1392; studies = 11; I = 14%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pulmonary function</HEADING>
<P>We assessed six studies that compared changes in FEV&#8321; between combination inhaled therapy and SABA alone. Participants who received combination inhaled therapy were more likely to exhibit improved FEV&#8321; by the end of the study period (MD 0.25 L, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.48; participants = 687; studies = 6); however, heterogeneity was high (I = 70%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>). In contrast, no significant differences were found in percent change in FEV&#8321; between participants who received combination inhaled therapy or SABA alone (MD 21.28% predicted, 95% CI -5.62 to 48.18; participants = 578; studies = 5), although heterogeneity was very high (I = 84%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). </P>
<P>There were 12 studies that assessed lung functions using PEF.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>By using a comprehensive search strategy, and techniques to mitigate selection and publication bias, we identified 23 studies that included 2724 adult participants which compared combination inhaled treatment with inhaled short-acting anticholinergics (SAAC) and short-acting beta&#8322;-agonists (SABA) to treatment with inhaled SABA alone for the management of adults with acute asthma in the emergency department (ED). Only RCTs, CCTs and trials involving direct comparisons were eligible for inclusion. However, a lack of available data in two studies meant that 21 studies were included in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome; even fewer studies could be meta-analysed for the secondary outcomes. </P>
<P>The overall quality of the included studies was moderate to low; most were assessed at unclear risk of bias, and some at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>We identified several important findings regarding the effectiveness of combination therapy to mitigate hospitalisations. </P>
<P>First, combination inhaled therapy was shown to be more effective in reducing hospitalisations compared to treatment with inhaled SABA alone, particularly in participants with severe exacerbations who are at high risk for hospitalisation. Caution is warranted in the interpretation of this subgroup analysis due to the heterogeneity in assessing asthma severity employed across the studies. </P>
<P>Second, the benefit combination inhaled therapy does not appear to be related to whether or not participants were administered systemic corticosteroids. It is important to note, however, that co-interventions were inconsistently reported across the studies, so it is possible that more studies could have provided corticosteroids in the ED, but did not report it. </P>
<P>Third, combination inhaled therapy appears to be effective regardless of whether or not ipratropium bromide or other SAACs were provided. </P>
<P>Finally, there was inconclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of single versus multiple doses of combined inhaled therapy to prevent hospitalisation. Additional studies assessing direct comparisons between single and multiple doses of combination inhaled therapy are needed to directly compare these approaches. Overall, the effectiveness of combined inhaled therapy to prevent hospitalisations were robust in the face of sensitivity analyses which included random-effects vs. fixed-effect results and study quality.</P>
<P>Participants who received combination inhaled therapy were more likely to experience improvements in pulmonary function testing representing higher forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV&#8321;), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and higher percent improvement in PEF. Standard recommendations for the minimally clinically important difference in most guidelines are 12% (<LINK REF="REF-Global-Initiative-for-Asthma-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Global Initiative for Asthma 2016</LINK>); however, data from asthma trials suggest minimally clinically important difference change from baseline percentages for FEV (10%) and PEF (6%) may be even lower (<LINK REF="REF-Santanello-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santanello 1999</LINK>). In addition, participants receiving the combination inhaled treatment experienced less relapses after discharge. No significant differences were noted between participants receiving combination inhaled therapy or SABA alone with regard to percent improved FEV&#8321; and the need for additional bronchodilators in the ED. Although it is unclear why no significant improvement in percent improved FEV&#8321; was found, despite an improvement in FEV&#8321;, results showed considerable inconsistency and imprecision. Furthermore, although the effect was moderate, caution is warranted in the interpretation of these results due to the heterogeneity in assessing and reporting airway obstruction employed across the studies.</P>
<P>Participants who received combination inhaled therapy were more likely to report adverse events compared to those treated with SABA agents alone. Despite this finding representing a picture of the overall symptoms experienced by participants, studies frequently failed to report in sufficient detail on the frequency of individual adverse events, such as dry mouth, termor, palpitations, and headache. As such, although results from this review suggest that participants who received combination inhaled therapy were more likely to report adverse events, we were unable to report on which particular adverse event participants could experience. </P>
<P>These findings provide important outcomes that should assist clinicians in informing patients and balancing treatment benefit with risk. It is important to note that most adverse events would not be considered serious and many would be self-limiting.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Overall, we believe the completeness and applicability of the evidence to be high. This is a moderately-sized review with 23 studies including 2724 participants. The studies were conducted in EDs in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Pacific regions. </P>
<P>Most included studies enrolled adult participants with a minimum age of 18 years. There were two studies which set the minimum age for enrolment as 13 years and 15 years (<LINK REF="STD-Aggarwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aggarwal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Canete-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Canete 1991</LINK>), respectively. After consideration, it was decided that these studies would be included in the review because the stated median ages were frequently between 30 and 42, suggesting that most included participants were adults aged over 16 years. </P>
<P>We included only studies in which participants presented to the ED with acute asthma. Studies that included participants with either asthma or other airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COP, were excluded unless data were available for only asthma participants, or if the sample of asthma participants made up at least 80% of the study population. </P>
<P>Most included studies assessed hospitalisation as a primary outcome. As a result, we believe the review results are applicable to adults presenting to the ED with acute asthma. Unfortunately, some proposed secondary outcomes, such as quality of life, symptoms scores, and ED length of stay, were not reported widely and could not be included in the meta-analysis as planned. In addition, pulmonary function measures and adverse events were inconsistently reported, and in some cases, were reported incompletely in the text, and could not be extracted for meta- analysis. Our attempts to contact study authors to provide clarification of their data were successful in some cases (<LINK REF="STD-Cydulka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cydulka 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garrett-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Garrett 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Salo 2006</LINK>), particularly with regard to frequency of adverse events.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>The quality of the included studies was generally considered to be low or unclear. We assessed 14 studies at high risk of bias due to lack of double blinding, incomplete reporting of adverse events, and receiving industry funding with no clarification of the role that company had on outcome reporting or manuscript preparation (<LINK REF="STD-Diaz-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diaz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FitzGerald-1997" TYPE="STUDY">FitzGerald 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garrett-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Garrett 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamei-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kamei 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karpel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Karpel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakano-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nakano 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Driscoll-1989" TYPE="STUDY">O'Driscoll 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owens-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Owens 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rahman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rashid-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rashid 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solarte-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Solarte 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1999</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-Cydulka-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cydulka 2010</LINK> was assessed as being a high quality study. </P>
<P>On GRADE assessment, the overall quality of outcomes reported ranged from very low to moderate. The primary outcome, hospitalisation, was reduced to moderate quality because most studies were assessed at unclear or high risk of bias, frequently due to inadequate (or no) reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment or blinding. The quality of the evidence for adverse events was considered moderate due to the high risk bias relating to selective reporting. </P>
<P>Despite that the quality of the evidence for PEF, percent change PEF from baseline, and relapse were considered moderate (due to overall unclear and high risk of biases found in the studies), the quality of the evidence regarding FEV&#8321; and percent change in FEV&#8321;, was found to be low and very low respectively due to inconsistency and imprecision of the results. </P>
<P>A limitation of this review is that the included studies tended to be small, and despite the low-moderate statistical heterogeneity identified across the outcomes of this review, clinical heterogeneity, including participant characteristics, treatment dosing, and settings (in regard to different healthcare systems) exists. </P>
<P>Differences in admission criteria may have influenced the results of this review, because studies may have applied more liberal or conservative admission criteria. Only five of the included studies provided defined admission criteria, and it is unclear what criteria the remaining studies used to decide whether or not participants should be hospitalised. Moreover, the influence of funding, such as payment models for admission, and hybrid models of care, such as short-stay units and observation units, on these results could not be determined from the available data.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>As with all reviews, there was a risk of potential screening and study selection bias, although strategies were applied to minimise this risk. Extensive searches of electronic databases, grey literature, and the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials were conducted with no limits on language, publication type or year of publication. Several articles published in languages other than English were identified, and were included or excluded based on the information translated from the text. Where information provided in studies did not inform a clear inclusion or exclusion decision, attempts were made to contact the authors to clarify information provided in the text. Screening and study selection was completed independently by several trained review authors in an effort to limit the possibility of bias. Despite this, it is recognised that some articles may have been missed. The funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) was not indicative of potential publication bias for the primary outcome.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Our results align with previous systematic reviews which found combination inhaled therapy to be more effective in reducing hospitalisation and improving pulmonary function measures than treatment with SABA alone in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoodly-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stoodly 1999</LINK>) and children (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2005</LINK>) with acute asthma. <LINK REF="STD-Lanes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lanes 1998</LINK>, a pooled analysis of three studies (<LINK REF="STD-FitzGerald-1997" TYPE="STUDY">FitzGerald 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Garrett-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Garrett 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Karpel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Karpel 1996</LINK>) also reported a significant reduction in hospitalisation and improvement in FEV&#8321; among participants who received combination therapy. </P>
<P>There were several disagreements between findings of this review and previous reviews. <LINK REF="STD-Rodrigo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rodrigo 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2005</LINK> reported a similar rate of adverse events, such as tremor, between participants who received combination inhaled therapy and SABA alone, whereas we found more side effects with combination therapy. The reason for this difference is likely due to the increased number of studies included in this review, as well as additional information which was received from study authors regarding the occurrence of adverse events. In addition, we reported similar effectiveness of single and multi-dose combination inhaled therapy to mitigate hospitalisation, which appears to differ from other reviews. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2005</LINK> reported a "trend" toward reduced risk of hospitalisation in adults receiving multi-dose combination therapy; however, unlike this review, the authors did not conduct a statistical subgroup comparison of the trials using multiple or single doses of combination inhaled therapy. Furthermore, we identified more studies for inclusion than <LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2005</LINK>, and featured a more up-to-date and extensive search of the electronic and grey literature, which is likely to be the greatest contributor to reported differences in results.</P>

<P>Overall, combination inhaled therapy appears to be effective in reducing the risk of hospitalisation among adult patients at high risk for hospitalisation presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute asthma.</P>
<P>In particular, combination inhaled therapy is more effective at preventing hospitalisation in adult patients with severe exacerbations who are at increased risk for hospitalisation, compared to those patients with mild-moderate exacerbations who are at a lower risk of hospitalisation.</P>
<P>It is unclear whether there is a difference between single or multiple doses of combination inhaled therapy in mitigating hospitalisation.</P>
<P>The beneficial effects of combination inhaled therapy appear to be independent of co-treatment with corticosteroids in the ED.</P>
<P>While effective at mitigating the risk for hospitalisations, patients who received combination inhaled therapy were at increased risk for adverse events.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-04 21:12:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Additional research comparing the effectiveness of combination inhaled therapy for mild, moderate, and severe exacerbations of asthma is needed to better understand how to optimise care. Researchers need to improve on reporting of the severity of acute asthma among study participants.</P>
<P>Additional research conducting direct comparisons between the effectiveness of multiple vs. single doses of combination inhaled therapy is needed.</P>
<P>Additional research needs to examine the effects of combination inhaled therapy on ED length of stay, quality of life, and symptom scores. Further standardisation of techniques to assess pulmonary function are required.</P>
<P>Additional research is needed to better understand the relationship of combination inhaled therapy and relapse proportions.</P>
<P>We included several studies which reported no differences in the frequency of adverse events; however, these studies provided no data for inclusion in the text of the study. This prohibited several studies from being included in the meta-analysis. It is very important for studies examining interventions to provide results for important outcomes such as adverse events. Around half of the included studies did not report data on the overall occurrence of adverse events, and even fewer provided details on the specific adverse events experienced. Despite the lack of reporting, a significant difference in the frequency of adverse events was found. Consistent reporting of the frequency of adverse events in future research is needed.</P>
<P>Future researchers need to clearly report methods of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, participant attrition rates during study recruitment, and sources of funding. Several included studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry with no statements indicating companies' influence on the study or the content of the manuscript.</P>

<P>There are several differences between the initial protocol and the final review.</P>
<UL>
<LI>We made changes to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. LAAC agents, such as tiotropium were explicitly excluded from the review as a result of a decision to focus primarily on SAAC agents before searching the electronic databases.</LI>
<LI>Studies including participants aged 16 years or older were eligible for inclusion in the review, rather than 18 years or older as stated in the protocol. This change was made to allow for any variations in defining adult populations globally. The included studies enrolled primarily </LI>
<LI>participants over the age of 18 years. No studies reported mean ages between 16 years and 17 years.</LI>
<LI>In addition to the search provided by the Cochrane Airways Group, the review presents results of searches of seven electronic databases using keywords and subject headings provided by a health librarian.</LI>
<LI>In the protocol, the grey literature search consisted solely of handsearching the top 20 respiratory care journals; however, for the review, this was expanded to include: a forward search on SCOPUS of the sentinel paper, Google Scholar, clinical trial registries, reference lists of reviews and included studies, and handsearching the top three evidence-based emergency medicine journals.</LI>
<LI>We amended secondary outcomes measures proposed in the protocol, and excluded physiological measures, such as vital signs and SaO&#8322;.</LI>
<LI>Because there were few adverse events reported, we calculated OR analyses.</LI>
<LI>Risk of bias assessment was completed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, as recommended by Cochrane, rather than the Jadad.</LI>
<LI>Changes regarding data analysis included calculating random-effects risk ratios for dichotomous variables for individual studies instead of odds ratios as mentioned in the protocol. Due to the rare occurrence of adverse events, OR analysis were calculated.</LI>
<LI>Heterogeneity was assessed using the more widely accepted I statistic with I values of 25, 50, and 75% representing low, moderate, and high degrees of heterogeneity respectively.</LI>
<LI>The reported subgroups based on single-dose vs. multiple doses for all of the reported comparisons were not assessed in the final review; however, they were reported for the primary outcome. In addition, sensitivity analysis based on the Jadad score, Cochrane criteria, dosing agents and time of assessment was not assessed in the review.</LI>
<LI>The final review included a summary of findings table of the primary outcome and important secondary outcomes, including an assessment of the quality of evidence using GRADE, which was not included in the initial protocol.</LI>
<LI>The text of the final review varied considerably from the initial protocol due to a change in the authors involved in the study and its preparation of the final manuscript</LI>
<LI>The use of ipratropium bromide vs. other SAAC was added in the final review as a subgroup comparison.</LI>
<LI>Based on feedback provided by post peer review comments, the methods of estimating and categorising exacerbation severity was modified to include the pulmonary function eligibility criteria, in addition to the percentage of patients hospitalised in the SABA alone group.</LI>
