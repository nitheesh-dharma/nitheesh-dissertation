Both IUI and ICI can be performed in natural cycles or following ovarian stimulation.</P><P>Ovarian stimulation can be performed with gonadotrophins, which are injected, or clomiphene citrate, which is available as a tablet. One of the risks of ovarian stimulation is multiple pregnancies. Therefore, the first few cycles of IUI and ICI are usually performed without ovarian stimulation.</P><P>It is important that IUI and ICI are performed at a specific time in the woman's menstrual cycle (as close to ovulation as possible). Various techniques of determining the best timing for IUI and ICI in natural cycles are available, such as keeping basal temperature charts, checking cervical mucus scores, testing blood or urine levels of luteinising hormone (LH), or monitoring with ultrasounds.</P><P>We compared IUI and ICI with each other, and also compared different types of each technique.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>We found six randomised controlled trials, including 708 women. Two studies compared IUI and ICI in natural cycles. Two studies compared IUI and ICI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles. Two studies compared the timing of IUI and ICI. The evidence is current to December 2017.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any clear difference between IUI and ICI in live birth rates, in either natural cycles or in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles. As there was only one live birth in the small study using natural cycles, we could not make any meaningful comparison between the groups. The evidence on gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles suggested that if the live birth rate following ICI was assumed to be 30%, the chance of live birth rate following IUI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles would be between 24% and 80%. For IUI and ICI in natural cycles, no multiple pregnancies were reported. In gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles, IUI was associated with higher multiple pregnancy rates than ICI. The evidence suggested that if the risk of multiple pregnancy following ICI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles was assumed to be 10%, the risk of multiple pregnancy following IUI would be between 10% and 46%. </P><P>We concluded that the evidence was too limited to encourage or discourage either IUI or ICI, in natural cycles or with ovarian stimulation in donor sperm treatment.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>Following GRADE assessment, we found that the evidence for all outcomes was of very low quality. The main limitations were risk of bias, due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious imprecision, due to the limited number of studies and small study sizes.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-02-05 09:52:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Elena Kostova"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-12 21:32:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The first-line treatment in donor sperm treatment consists of inseminations that can be done by intrauterine insemination (IUI) or by intracervical insemination (ICI).</P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-01-12 22:23:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To compare the effectiveness and safety of intrauterine insemination (IUI) and intracervical insemination (ICI) in women who start donor sperm treatment.</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2018-01-12 21:37:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL in October 2016, checked references of relevant studies, and contacted study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies.

They may also be used to prevent transmission of human immunodeficiency virus after sperm washing has failed, and to prevent vertical transmission of a genetic defect. In lesbian couples or single women, it is a commonly used technique to achieve pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vernaeve-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vernaeve 2004</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-01-12 22:20:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Donor sperm can be introduced by intrauterine insemination (IUI) or by intracervical insemination (ICI). For both insemination techniques, the use of cryo-preserved sperm is mandatory to prevent transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus, and Hepatitis B and C, although pregnancy rates are lower compared to fresh sperm (<LINK REF="REF-ARSM-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARSM 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Subak-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subak 1992</LINK>).</P><P>The sperm can be inseminated in natural cycles or in cycles with ovarian stimulation.</P><P>In natural cycles, the timing of insemination may be determined with a basal body temperature chart in combination with cervical mucus scores (<LINK REF="REF-Insler-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Insler 1977</LINK>). Another method to detect ovulation is by measuring urinary luteinising hormone (LH). The advantage of this test is that women can perform the urinary LH tests at home. Detection of a rise in the LH level can also be done in the clinic, with daily blood samples. Finally, transvaginal ultrasound, in combination with ovulation induction by the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), may be used to time the insemination (<LINK REF="REF-Cantineau-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantineau 2014</LINK>).</P><P>In cycles with ovarian stimulation, women receive clomiphene citrate, an anti-oestrogen, or gonadotrophins to induce the growth of up to three follicles. The timing of insemination is determined by transvaginal ultrasound, combined with hCG-triggered ovulation.</P><P>The main difference between IUI and ICI is the processing of the sperm. In IUI, the sperm is processed. There are two preparation techniques; one is to freeze the sperm without processing, thaw the sperm when needed, and process the sperm against a density gradient centrifugation, wash it with culture medium, or both. The other is to process the sperm against a density gradient centrifugation, wash it with culture medium, or both, before freezing the sperm, and then thaw the sperm when needed. There is no evidence that one technique is superior to the other (<LINK REF="REF-Boomsma-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boomsma 2007</LINK>). After thawing, the sperm is inseminated into the uterine cavity.</P><P>In ICI, the sperm is cryo-preserved without processing, and thawed when needed. After thawing, the sperm is inseminated at the external cervical os, using a cap or a straw. The cervical cap acts as an ectocervical reservoir, placed in the cervical canal for a few hours (<LINK REF="STD-Coulson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Coulson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flierman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Flierman 1997</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-01-12 22:22:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In IUI, the sperm is processed and inseminated into the uterine cavity. In ICI, the sperm is not processed, and is inseminated at the external cervical os. The inseminated sperm then has to fertilize the released oocyte. Both IUI and ICI are often combined with ovarian stimulation; multiple pregnancies are a side effect, occurring in between 10% and 40% of women (<LINK REF="REF-Fauser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauser 2005</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-01-12 22:22:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The present review is an update and extension of a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Besselink-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besselink 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Besselink-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besselink 2008</LINK> had compared IUI with ICI, and pooled the data of natural cycles with cycles with ovarian stimulation. In this update, we disentangled ovarian stimulation from the natural cycle, and added other cointerventions that might influence pregnancy rates in donor sperm treatment.</P><P>It is unclear which insemination technique, IUI or ICI, is more effective in terms of live birth rate. Summarising the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of IUI and ICI in donor sperm treatment will help women and gynaecologists to make informed decisions about their choices for donor sperm treatment.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-01-12 22:23:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To compare the effectiveness and safety of intrauterine insemination (IUI) and intracervical insemination (ICI) in women who start donor sperm treatment.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-01-17 03:47:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-01-17 01:37:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2018-01-10 19:19:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included randomised controlled trials.

We found four studies that compared IUI and ICI, two of which performed IUI and ICI in natural cycles, and two performed IUI and ICI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles.</P><P>There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any real difference in live birth rates between IUI and ICI in natural cycles. There were more clinical pregnancies following IUI in natural cycles compared to ICI in natural cycles. There were no multiple pregnancies reported following IUI or ICI in natural cycles. Also, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any clear difference in live birth rates between IUI and ICI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles. There were more clinical pregnancies following IUI than ICI in gonadotrophin stimulated cycles. IUI was associated with higher multiple pregnancy rates than ICI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles.</P><P>We found two studies on timing of insemination; one on timing of ICI and one on timing of IUI. None of the studies reported on the primary outcomes of live birth and multiple pregnancy rates.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-01-16 13:34:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The studies included in this review were clinically heterogeneous. Studies differed in population, intervention, and laboratory techniques, and used different inclusion criteria. Two studies included couples with azoospermia or oligospermia, one study included couples with azoospermia and men with a genetic defect, two studies included single women, and one study included lesbian couples. This may have biased outcomes, since it is known that in heterosexual couples, partners of azoospermic men conceive more quickly after donor sperm treatment, compared to partners of men with spermatozoa in their ejaculates, suggesting that in heterosexual couples, unknown female factors also contribute to subfertility of these couples (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>).</P><P>One study included women after one to six failed IUI attempts. This may have caused bias, since women who became pregnant in the first cycles were not included in this study (<LINK REF="STD-Blockeel-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Blockeel 2014</LINK>).</P><P>The studies also differed in treatment regimens. One study started ovarian stimulation on the second day of the menstrual cycle with 150 IU of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (recFSH (<LINK REF="STD-Matorras-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 1996</LINK>)), while one study started on the fourth or fifth day of the menstrual cycle with 75 IU of human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) followed by 150 IU of hMG on the sixth and seventh day (<LINK REF="STD-Wainer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wainer 1995</LINK>). Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was administrated on the day that two or more follicles were larger than 17 mm and oestrogen levels were higher than 400 pg/mL, and IUI was performed 36 hours after ovulation was triggered (<LINK REF="STD-Matorras-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 1996</LINK>). Another study administrated hCG if one to three follicles were larger than 15 mm, and IUI was performed 38 hours after ovulation was triggered (<LINK REF="STD-Wainer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wainer 1995</LINK>). In ICI with ovarian stimulation, insemination was performed twice, with a cervical cap &#8212; 12 and 36 hours after ovulation was triggered. Cancellation of the cycle was mentioned in one study when more than six follicles reached 17 mm or more (<LINK REF="STD-Matorras-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 1996</LINK>). Studies on IUI and ICI in natural cycles performed one insemination, on the day after the urinary luteinising hormone (LH) level surge. In ICI, inseminations were performed with a straw. The number of motile sperm used for insemination differed between studies, from 1.58 million post wash to 43.7 million. It was difficult to assess if differences in sperm count influenced pregnancy outcomes, since studies on the effect of sperm count on pregnancy rates in donor sperm treatment are lacking.</P><P>One study in natural cycles, and one study in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles did report on live births, and one study in natural cycles and two studies in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles did report on multiple pregnancy rates. Most of these trials were published between 1992 and 1993, when clinical pregnancy rate was still an accepted endpoint. Nowadays, it is common to use live birth as a primary outcome, and multiple pregnancies as a reflection of the quality of care or safety.</P><P>Finally, studies on IUI or ICI that compared natural cycles with gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles were lacking.</P><P>In conclusion, it was uncertain which insemination technique, IUI or ICI, resulted in higher live birth rates. Differences in inclusion criteria, treatment regimens, number of motile sperm used for insemination, primary outcomes, and small study sizes made it difficult to compare studies on the effectiveness and safety of IUI and ICI in natural cycles. Moreover, studies on IUI and ICI in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles used differences in stimulation protocols, cancellation rates for the number of follicles, and number of motile sperm used for insemination.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-01-13 00:39:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Following the GRADE assessment, we found that evidence for all outcomes was of very low quality; the main limitations were risk of bias, mainly due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious imprecision. None of the studies described the method they used for allocation concealment, we judged one study to have a high attrition bias, and two to have high risk of potential bias associated with the inclusion of anovulatory women receiving clomiphene citrate.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-01-16 12:02:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Strengths of this review included a comprehensive systematic search for eligible studies, rigid inclusion criteria for RCTs, and independent data extraction and analysis by two review authors. The possibility of publication bias was minimized by searching for both published and unpublished studies, such as abstracts from meetings. We may have introduced bias in our assumptions about missing data. We assumed that if further data were not available, missing participants had failed to achieve pregnancy. This may have caused under-reporting of pregnancies and adverse events. As with any review, we cannot guarantee that we found all eligible studies.</P><P>One of our peer reviewers noted that our review did not include studies of cointerventions associated with donor sperm treatment, apart from comparisons of the timing. Potential cointerventions are luteal support, type of trigger, and single versus double insemination. These comparisons were outside the planned scope of the current review, and we were not aware of any relevant randomised evidence. However, we may consider extending the scope of the review in future updates.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-01-13 00:45:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We added RCTs on the timing of IUI and ICI to the previous Cochrane review, which focused their conclusions on clinical pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Besselink-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besselink 2008</LINK>). Our results concerning pregnancy outcomes were comparable. </P><P>A previous non-Cochrane review and meta-analysis suggested that IUI resulted in higher clinical pregnancy rates than ICI (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1999</LINK>). The authors pooled data of the four RCTs that were also included in our review with the results of three cross-over studies. As pre-cross-over data were not retrievable, these results could not validly be used.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-16 13:33:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-01-13 00:49:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a clear difference in live birth rates between intrauterine insemination (IUI) and intracervical insemination (ICI) in natural or gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles in women who started donor sperm treatment. There was no evidence available for the effect of timing on live birth following either IUI or ICI. Very low-quality evidence suggested that in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles, ICI may be associated with a higher clinical pregnancy rate than IUI, but also with a higher risk of multiple pregnancy. </P><P>We concluded that the evidence was too limited to choose between IUI or ICI, in natural cycles or with ovarian stimulation, in donor sperm treatment.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-01-16 13:33:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We suggest that further research is needed. Most women requiring donor sperm treatment are fertile women. In these women, primary treatment should be aimed at facilitating conception leading to a live birth without increasing the risks of multiple pregnancy rates. Therefore, we suggest that further research should focus on (cost) effectiveness of IUI versus ICI in natural cycles in women who are starting donor sperm treatment.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-01-13 00:50:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We thank Marian Showell for preparing the search strategy.
