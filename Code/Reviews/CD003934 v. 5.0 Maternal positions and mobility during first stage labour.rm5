<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-08 15:47:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Annemarie Lawrence">
<P>There is little doubt that women should be encouraged to utilise positions which give them the greatest comfort, control and benefit during first stage labour. As women in most western societies now lie in bed for the entire duration of their labour, it is important that they understand the risks and benefits of the positions they choose.</P>
<P>This review included 25 studies (involving 5218 women). Although many studies were not of high quality, and most of the women were low risk, they did show that the first stage of labour may be approximately one hour and twenty minutes shorter for women who are upright or walk around. As every contraction is potentially painful, and prolonged labour can be an overwhelming and exhausting process resulting in an increased need for medical intervention, this is a meaningful outcome for women. Indeed other important outcomes for women who were upright and mobile compared with lying down in bed included a reduction in the risk of caesarean birth, less use of epidural as a method of pain relief, and less chance of their babies being admitted to the neonatal unit. More research of better quality is still needed to validate these results for all women in labour. However, based on the results of this review we recommend that wherever possible, women should be encouraged and supported to use upright and mobile positions of their choice during first stage labour, as this may enhance the progress of their labour and may lead to better outcomes for themselves and their babies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-11 09:54:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is more common for women in both high- and low-income countries giving birth in health facilities, to labour in bed. There is no evidence that this is associated with any advantage for women or babies, although it may be more convenient for staff. Observational studies have suggested that if women lie on their backs during labour this may have adverse effects on uterine contractions and impede progress in labour, and in some women reduce placental blood flow.</P>

<P>We used methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> for carrying out data collection, assessing study quality and analysing results. Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted data for each study. We sought additional information from trial authors as required.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-21 19:54:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Annemarie Lawrence">
<P>Results should be interpreted with caution as the methodological quality of the 25 included trials (5218 women) was variable.</P>
<P>For Comparison 1: Upright and ambulant positions versus recumbent positions and bed care, the first stage of labour was approximately one hour and 22 minutes shorter for women randomised to upright as opposed to recumbent positions (average MD -1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.22 to -0.51; 15 studies, 2503 women; random-effects, T<SUP>2</SUP> = 2.39, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 203.55, df = 14, (P &lt; 0.00001), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 93%). Women who were upright were also less likely to have caesarean section (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.94; 14 studies, 2682 women) and less likely to have an epidural (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.99, nine studies, 2107 women; random-effects, T<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.02, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 61%). Babies of mothers who were upright were less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, however this was based on one trial (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89, one study, 200 women). There were no significant differences between groups for other outcomes including duration of the second stage of labour, or other outcomes related to the well being of mothers and babies.</P>
<P>For Comparison 2: Upright and ambulant positions versus recumbent positions and bed care (with epidural: all women), there were no significant differences between groups for outcomes including duration of the second stage of labour, or other outcomes related to the well being of mothers and babies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-11 09:58:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Annemarie Lawrence">
<P>There is clear and important evidence that walking and upright positions in the first stage of labour reduces the duration of labour, the risk of caesarean birth, the need for epidural, and does not seem to be associated with increased intervention or negative effects on mothers' and babies' well being. Given the great heterogeneity and high performance bias of study situations, better quality trials are still required to confirm with any confidence the true risks and benefits of upright and mobile positions compared with recumbent positions for all women. Based on the current findings, we recommend that women in low-risk labour should be informed of the benefits of upright positions, and encouraged and assisted to assume whatever positions they choose.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-11 10:43:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Annemarie Lawrence">
<P>In cultures not influenced by Western society, women progress through the first stage of labour in upright positions and change position as they wish with no evidence of harmful effects to either the mother or the baby (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1989</LINK>). Women in the developed world too, when encouraged, will choose a number of different positions as the first stage of labour progresses (<LINK REF="REF-Carlson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fenwick-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenwick 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rooks-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooks 1999</LINK>), even though it is more common nowadays for them to labour in bed (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simkin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simkin 1989</LINK>). Some studies have suggested that as a woman reaches five to six centimetres dilatation, there is a preference to lie down (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1980</LINK>). This may explain why women in randomised trials frequently have difficulty maintaining the position to which they have been assigned (<LINK REF="REF-Goer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goer 1999</LINK>), and suggests that there may not be a perfect universal position for women in the first stage of labour.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-08-08 15:48:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heralding the onset of second stage labour, first stage labour involves a co-ordinated series of complex physiological changes which results in full dilatation of the cervix. In readiness for birth of the baby (second stage) and separation and delivery of the placenta and membranes (third stage), the process of first stage labour may occur gradually over a period of days, or rapidly over a period of minutes. There are many factors which influence the duration and successful completion of first stage labour. These include the intensity and frequency of uterine contractions, whether the membranes have ruptured or not, the position and size of the baby or babies, the positioning and functioning of the placenta, the adequacy of the pelvis, and the physical and psychological well being of the mother.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-04-11 00:35:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women who are in early labour are encouraged to remain in upright and mobile positions such as sitting, standing and walking until they are ready to give birth to their babies. There are many variations to being upright and mobile, but the key component is the ability for women to move and change position more quickly and easily as their labour progresses. Upright and mobile positions can be commenced and maintained in different places such as the home, shower or bath. They can be used with a variety of props such as a recliner chair or birthing ball. They can be alternated with other upright positions and can include comfort measures such as rocking the hips from side to side, leaning on a partner for support and intimacy and providing access to the lower back for massage or heat therapy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-04-24 09:49:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Upright and mobile positions use gravity to aid descent of the fetal head into the pelvis. As the head is applied directly and evenly on the cervix, uterine contractions are intensified in strength, regularity and frequency. It is this uterine efficiency which aids cervical dilatation and successful completion of the first stage of labour. Study findings (<LINK REF="STD-Caldeyro_x002d_Barcia-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Caldeyro-Barcia 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lupe-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lupe 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mendez_x002d_Bauer-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendez-Bauer 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ueland-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ueland 1969</LINK>) have indicated that although contractions increased in strength in the upright or lateral position compared to the supine position, they were often negatively affected when a labouring woman lay down after being upright or mobile. This effect can often be reversed if the woman returns to an upright position. As effective contractions are vital to aid cervical dilatation and fetal descent, they have an important role in helping to reduce dystocia (slow progress in labour) (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rooks-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooks 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Upright and mobile positions are also less likely to cause compression of the abdominal blood vessels by the pregnant uterus and this maximises uterine blood flow to the placenta and fetus during labour. Numerous studies show that a supine position in labour may have adverse physiological effects on the condition of the woman and her baby and on the progression of labour. The weight of the pregnant uterus can compress the abdominal blood vessels, compromising the mother's circulatory function including uterine blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Abitbol-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abitbol 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huovinen-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huovinen 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marx-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marx 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ueland-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ueland 1969</LINK>), and this may negatively affect the blood flow to the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Cyna-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cyna 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rooks-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooks 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2000</LINK>). A recent study found an association between women who sleep supine during pregnancy and stillbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Stacey-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stacey 2011</LINK>). A related Cochrane review focuses on maternal position for fetal malpresentation in labour <LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>Moving about can increase a woman's sense of control in labour by providing a self-regulated distraction from the challenge of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 1997</LINK>). Women who labour in water can move more easily than on land (<LINK REF="REF-Cluett-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cluett 2009</LINK>) and there is evidence to suggest immersion in water may reduce pain in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2012</LINK>). Support from another person also appears to facilitate normal labour (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2012</LINK>). Increasing a woman's sense of control may have the effect of decreasing her need for analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lupe-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lupe 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rooks-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooks 1999</LINK>) and it has also been suggested that upright positions in the first stage of labour may increase women's comfort (<LINK REF="REF-Simkin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simkin 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>Recumbent (lying down) positions in the first stage of labour are often promoted by care providers because they provide convenient access to the mother for abdominal palpation, fetal monitoring and vaginal examinations. Indeed some developments in technology such as fetal monitoring, epidurals for pain relief and the use of intravenous infusions have made it difficult and potentially unsafe for women to move about during labour. It is important, therefore, to assess the available evidence so that maternal positions which are shown to be safe and effective during first stage labour are actively encouraged. Clinicians providing care in first stage labour also need to provide clear, consistent, and evidence based explanation, so that women will understand both the risks and benefits of the positions they use and enable them to make informed decisions about the position choices they think will afford them most comfort.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-08-11 10:04:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the RevMan software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials examined the same intervention, and where we judged the trials&#8217; populations and methods to be sufficiently similar. If we suspected clinical heterogeneity was sufficient to expect the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary. We only performed this analysis if we considered the average treatment effect across trials was clinically meaningful. We defined heterogeneity as substantial if a given meta-analysis resulted in an I² value greater than 30%, and there was inconsistency among trials in the direction or magnitude of effects (judged visually in the forest plot), or a low (less than 0.10) P value in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials is discussed. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of T² and I².</P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Diaz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Diaz 1980</LINK> ) was excluded because more than 30% of the intervention group were excluded post-randomisation, as they did not comply with the protocol. This high rate of attrition meant it was difficult to interpret results. In the <LINK REF="STD-Hemminki-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hemminki 1983</LINK> study, women in the two groups received different packages of care, so it was not possible to separate out the treatment effect of maternal position on outcomes. It remains unclear if <LINK REF="STD-McCormick-2007" TYPE="STUDY">McCormick 2007</LINK> was successfully completed or not.</P>
<P>In some studies, the intervention did not compare mobility or upright positions with recumbent positions; for example, <LINK REF="STD-Cobo-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Cobo 1968</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2001</LINK> examined lying in bed on one side rather than the other, or lying supine. <LINK REF="STD-Liu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1989</LINK> compared semi-upright position with the lying flat position. These positions were both defined as recumbent positions for the purpose of this review. In some studies position/mobility was compared with an alternative intervention, for example the <LINK REF="STD-Hemminki-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hemminki 1985</LINK> study included women experiencing delay in labour and compared the use of immediate oxytocin with ambulation and delayed oxytocin. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Read-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1981</LINK> examined oxytocin in labour. There were a couple of epidural studies, the <LINK REF="STD-COMET-2001" TYPE="STUDY">COMET 2001</LINK> study compared women receiving different types of epidural, whereas, <LINK REF="STD-Ducloy_x002d_Bouthors-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ducloy-Bouthors 2006</LINK> compared epidural spread. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Weiniger-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Weiniger 2009</LINK>) compared walking to the toilet to void with using a bedpan in bed. In another (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 1982</LINK>) the primary outcome was electronic fetal monitoring, with all women having bed care receiving an epidural, which was not the case for the ambulating women.

<P>In the type of interventions we were considering (maternal positions and mobility), blinding women and their clinical carers to group allocation was not feasible. It was possible that partial blinding of outcome assessors could have been performed for some types of outcomes, but it was not clear that this was achieved in any of the included studies.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-08-15 10:37:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Annemarie Lawrence">
<P>The objectives of this review were to assess the effects of positions and mobility during first stage of labour on duration of labour, type of birth and other important outcomes for mothers and babies.</P>
<P>The decision to treat trials comparing upright with recumbent positions (Comparison 1) differently from trials comparing upright with recumbent positions whereby all women have epidural at time of study entry (Comparison 2), was based on the opinion that epidurals are associated with prolonged labour, an increased requirement for augmentation and an increased incidence of operative vaginal birth (<LINK REF="REF-Anim_x002d_Somuah-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anim-Somuah 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kemp-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemp 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 2012</LINK>). When mode of birth outcomes for both comparisons were pooled (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>), we did find that women in the Comparison 1 group were more likely to have vaginal birth (83% compared to 59%), and women in Comparison 2 group were more likely to have operative vaginal birth (26% compared to 10%), and caesarean birth (16% compared to 7%). This demonstrated a difference in comparison characteristics and affirms our decision to treat the studies differently.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-15 10:37:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed 80 meta-analyses in order to evaluate how a variety of maternal positions used during first stage labour affect the birth process and outcomes for mothers and babies.</P>
<P>For Comparison 1, women who were upright or mobile compared to those who were recumbent had a shorter first stage of labour (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>); were less likely to have a caesarean birth (<LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>); had less pain (<LINK REF="CMP-001.34" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.34</LINK>); were less likely to have an epidural (<LINK REF="CMP-001.29" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.29</LINK>); and their babies were less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (<LINK REF="CMP-001.46" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.46</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis demonstrated that nulliparous women and those who had spontaneous labour at trial entry were more likely to have a shorter duration of labour when upright or mobile (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Women who laboured with sitting, standing, squatting, kneeling or walking positions, compared with supine, dorsal or lateral recumbent positions, had shorter durations of labour (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>); more spontaneous vaginal births (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>); less operative births (<LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>); and less caesarean births (<LINK REF="CMP-001.25" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.25</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis was performed to exclude those trials of lower quality. Comparison was made between women who used sitting, standing, squatting, kneeling or walking positions, and those who used supine, dorsal or lateral recumbent positions. This analysis confirmed that being upright or mobile during first stage labour was more likely to result in a shorter duration of first stage labour (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>), more likely to result in spontaneous vaginal birth (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>) and less likely to result in caesarean birth (<LINK REF="CMP-001.28" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.28</LINK>).</P>
<P>For Comparison 2, where all women had epidural at trial entry, subgroup analysis demonstrated that nulliparous women who were upright were more likely to have operative vaginal births, compared with multiparous women who were supine (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>).</P>
<P>The outcomes of this review demonstrate benefit to the well being of mothers and babies. There is evidence that adopting an upright or mobile position during first stage labour reduces the duration of first stage, with no additional risk to mother or baby. Therefore, women in low-risk labour should be informed of the benefits of upright positions, and encouraged and assisted to assume whatever position they choose. Moving around in labour often requires continuous one-to-one support from a midwife/nurse, this reduces the need for pain medication and increases the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-08-11 10:16:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When considering the results of this review, it is important to consider the new evidence that women encouraged to maintain upright positions had lower rates of caesarean birth. This is an important finding as rates of caesarean birth continue to rise worldwide and most women and healthcare clinicians would like to see a reduction in caesarean birth as the procedure is not without risk for both mother and baby. Another new finding was that babies of mothers who were upright were less likely to be admitted to the neonatal unit. However, it would be prudent to treat this finding with caution as it is based on the results of one study only.</P>
<P>Most of the included studies collected information on mode of birth, but few had the statistical power to detect differences between groups. Few included studies collected outcome data on review outcomes such as pain, maternal satisfaction, and neonatal outcomes. Disappointingly, the many studies reporting Apgar scores, did so by different methods and at differing end points. Most reported the numbers of babies with Apgar scores less that seven at one and or five minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Calvert-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Calvert 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haukkama-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Haukkama 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacLennan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">MacLennan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McManus-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McManus 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miquelutti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Miquelutti 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1980</LINK>), but <LINK REF="STD-Bloom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 1998</LINK> reported scores less than three at five minutes, <LINK REF="STD-Gau-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gau 2011</LINK> reported scores less than eight at five minutes, and others only reported scores as means (<LINK REF="STD-Ben-Regaya-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ben Regaya 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitre-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Mitre 1974</LINK>), meaning that outcome data could not be pooled uniformly in these instances.</P>
<P>Studies were carried out over a long period: from the early 1960s (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 1963</LINK>) through to 2012 (<LINK REF="STD-Mathew-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mathew 2012</LINK>); and in a number of different healthcare settings <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. The cultural and healthcare context is likely to have been different at different times and in different settings, and there have also been changes in healthcare technologies. Within these changing contexts, the attitudes and expectations of healthcare staff, women and their partners towards pain, pain relief and appropriate behaviour during labour and childbirth have shifted. All of these factors are important in the interpretation of results.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-08-11 10:16:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As labour is a dynamic and complex process with many physical and emotional variables, designing trials that examine interventions related to women in labour is challenging and it is difficult to avoid bias (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollins-Martin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollins Martin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNabb-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNabb 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1989</LINK>). It is not possible to blind women or their caregivers to group allocation. In addition, it is difficult to standardise interventions. Due to the heterogeneity of trial interventions and participants, the inconsistencies within trials, and the variable trial quality, study findings are difficult to interpret, and the results of this review should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>For the main outcome, duration of first stage labour, there was considerable variation within and between studies in terms of average duration of first stage labour (hours). For nulliparous women means varied from 1.67 hours to 18.22 hours and for multiparous women means varied from 1.2 hours to 7.8 hours. Studies defined and measured the duration of the first stage of labour in different ways. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1987</LINK> recorded the duration as 5 to 10 cm, <LINK REF="STD-Taavoni-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taavoni 2011</LINK> as 4 to 8 cm, and <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1990</LINK> as 4 to 9 cm.</P>
<P>The review included women from many countries around the world, all with differing ages, obstetric and medical histories, ethnicity, customs, beliefs and supports. There was considerable variation in the position interventions women received and how these positions were described. In the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Nageotte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nageotte 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vallejo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vallejo 2001</LINK>, ambulation was defined as a minimum of five minutes of walking per hour, in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Frenea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Frenea 2004</LINK> women were asked to walk 15 minutes each hour, and in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 1990</LINK> the position intervention was assumed when the woman was anywhere between 4 to 9 cm.</P>
<P>There was also variability in the amount of time women adhered to the protocol in terms of ambulation or staying in bed. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bloom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 1998</LINK>, of the 536 women assigned to the walking group only 380 women actually walked. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Calvert-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Calvert 1982</LINK>, of the 100 women assigned to telemetry, only 45 women actually got out of bed. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-MacLennan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">MacLennan 1994</LINK>, of the 96 women randomised to ambulate, only 37 women actually chose to ambulate for half an hour or more. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Miquelutti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Miquelutti 2007</LINK>, women assigned to be upright only managed to achieve this for 57% of the time. It is clear that many of the women in these studies had difficulty maintaining the intervention position though out the whole duration of their first stage and preferred and often used alternative positions.</P>
<P>Further, there was also variation in the models of birth care, institutional procedures, and caregiver behaviour in relation to study protocols. In some studies, women were strongly encouraged by staff to mobilise (e.g. in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Miquelutti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Miquelutti 2007</LINK> any woman in the intervention group that remained in bed for more than 30 minutes was asked to get out again) and in other studies, women had more choice and only gentle encouragement (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2002</LINK>). In one study the intervention was only encouraged during the day as it was not felt that women would like to walk around at night (<LINK REF="STD-Karraz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karraz 2003</LINK>), additionally women in the comparison group were not allowed out of bed even to walk to the toilet.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-08-11 10:16:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Upright positions and walking are associated with a reduction in the duration of the first stage of labour, use of epidural as a method of pain relief and caesarean birth. There is also evidence that there is less chance of babies being admitted to the neonatal unit. Despite many of the trials included in this review being of lesser quality, sensitivity analysis of the higher quality trials indicated that the main findings of this review were robust. It is likely that women's preferences for positioning change as the first stage of labour progresses (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2000</LINK>) and, if given the opportunity, many women may choose an upright or ambulant position in early first stage labour and then choose to lie down as their labour progresses. Studies examining the physiology of maintaining a supine position in labour suggest adverse physiological effects on the labouring woman and her baby (<LINK REF="REF-Abitbol-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abitbol 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huovinen-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huovinen 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marx-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marx 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rooks-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooks 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stacey-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stacey 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2000</LINK>). Therefore, we believe wherever possible, women should be informed of the benefits of upright positions, encouraged and supported to take up whatever positions they choose, they should not have their freedom of movement options restricted unless clinically indicated, and they should avoid spending long periods supine.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-11 10:16:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the quality of the studies included in the review was mixed and most studies provided little information on methods. Minimising risk of bias in trials on this topic is challenging, as blinding is not feasible and it is difficult to standardise interventions. At the same time, some aspects of study design can be controlled.</P>
<P>Some considerations for future research are as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>There is a need for larger high-quality multicentre trials, with particular attention given to allocation concealment (selection bias) and reporting of all pre-specified outcome criteria (reporting bias).</LI>
<LI>Researchers should clearly explain how they have defined the duration of first stage of labour and include full statistical details (e.g. P values and standard deviations (SDs)).</LI>
<LI>Mode of birth outcomes should include full intention-to-treat data.</LI>
<LI>More studies are needed that compare different upright positions (e.g. sitting upright versus walking) and different lying positions (e.g. lying on side versus back).</LI>
<LI>More studies are needed that include women who are not low risk (e.g. all women undergoing induction of labour; all women with gestational diabetes or obesity; all women planning to have epidural pain relief prior to labour).</LI>
<LI>There is a need to collect more detailed information on outcomes for mothers, such as the effect of position on complications (e.g. hypotension, precipitous birth, prolonged birth, post-partum haemorrhage).</LI>
<LI>There is a need to improve and standardise measurements of all outcome data, including maternal pain, control and satisfaction.</LI>
<LI>Few trials assessed comparable outcomes for babies and future studies need to focus on this.</LI>

<P>1. The length of maximum slope in labour was recorded. This is a subdivision of the first stage of labour, during which rapid cervical dilatation takes place (from 4 to 9 cm). The duration of the first stage was determined by the first recorded time that cervical dilatation was assessed to be 4 cm and on the first recorded time that dilatation was assessed to be 9 cm.</P>
<P>2. The Maternal Comfort Assessment Tool was used. The tool estimates the level of maternal comfort by measuring focus of attention; eye contact during contractions; breathing pattern and vocal behaviour during contractions; muscle tension and activity during contractions; and verbalisations regarding ability to continue with labour. In addition, vital signs; degree of cervical dilatation; duration, frequency, and intensity of contractions; medications; and use of monitoring apparatus were recorded. When the scores for each category of observable behaviour in the tool are added, the highest possible comfort score for each contraction was 14 and the lowest was 0. Comfort scores for a series of 3 contractions were recorded on an hourly basis during the phase of maximum slope, and averaged for mean hourly comfort scores. Hourly comfort scores where then average to obtain an overall mean comfort score for each woman.</P>
<P>3. The amount of narcotic and other analgesia.</P>
<P>The randomisation method is unclear.</P>
<P>Women in the recumbent position were monitored externally more often (n = 13) than women in the upright position (n = 1), which may have been an additional source of discomfort for women in the recumbent group.</P>
<P>Apgar scores were not included as outcome measures because only a mean Apgar at 1 minute for each group was provided.</P>

<P>In this study the comparison was between two management policies rather than two different treatments. One group was nursed in bed and one group was encouraged to mobilise but there were also other differences in the treatment the two groups received which may have had an effect on outcomes. Women nursed in bed had routine amniotomy, women in the ambulant group did not; monitoring was also different in the two groups. These differences in management mean that it is not possible to assess the effect of position on outcomes. </P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-15 10:40:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We designed a form to extract data. At least two review authors extracted the data using the agreed form. We resolved discrepancies through discussion, or if required we consulted a third author. We entered data into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>), and checked for accuracy.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies  </HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We resolved any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor. Please see the 'Risk of bias' tables following the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables for the assessment of bias for each study.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used to generate the allocation sequence to assess whether methods were truly random.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determined whether group allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment, or changed afterwards.</P>
<P>We have assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study the methods used to blind study personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We have described where there was any attempt at partial blinding (e.g. of outcome assessors). It is important to note that with the types of interventions described in this review, blinding participants to group assignment is generally not feasible. Similarly, blinding staff providing care is very difficult, and this may have the effect of increasing co-interventions, which in turn may affect outcomes. The lack of blinding in these studies may be a source of bias, and this should be kept in mind in the interpretation of results.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4"> (4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study the completeness of outcome data, including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We state whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition/exclusion where reported, and any re-inclusions in analyses which we have undertaken.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. where there was no missing data or low levels (less than 10%) and where reasons for missing data were balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (e.g. where there were high levels of missing data (more than 10%);</LI>
<LI>unclear (e.g. where there was insufficient reporting of attrition or exclusions to permit a judgement to be made).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Other sources of bias and overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.</P>
<P>We have made explicit judgements about risk of bias for important outcomes both within and across studies. With reference to 1-4 above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings.  We have explored the impact of risk of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses; see sensitivity analysis below.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect  </HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data in the absence of significant heterogeneity if trials were sufficiently similar. When significant heterogeneity was present, we used a random-effects meta-analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we have presented results as summary risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data (e.g. maternal pain and satisfaction when measured as scores or on visual analogue scales) we used the mean difference (MD) if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials. We planned to use the standardised mean difference (SMD) to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used different methods.  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues  </HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We intended to include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually -randomised trials, and to adjust sample sizes using the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Gates-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>.</P>
<P>We identified no cluster-randomised trials in this version of the review, but if we identify such trials in future searches we will include them in updates.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data  </HEADING>
<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. Where data were not reported for some outcomes or groups, we attempted to contact the study authors for further information.<B> </B>
</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intention-to-treat analysis (ITT)</HEADING>
<P>We had intended to analyse data on all participants with available data in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If in the original reports participants were not analysed in the group to which they were randomised, and there was sufficient information in the trial report, we attempted to restore them to the correct group (e.g. we did this for the data from the <LINK REF="STD-Calvert-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Calvert 1982</LINK> study).<B> </B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>We examined heterogeneity using the I² statistic. Where we identified high levels of heterogeneity among the trials (greater than 30%), we explored it by pre-specified subgroup analysis and by performing sensitivity analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis was used as an overall summary for these comparisons.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>Where data were available, we had planned subgroup analyses by:</P>
<UL>
<LI>nulliparous versus multiparous women;</LI>
<LI>spontaneous labour versus induction of labour;</LI>
<LI>sitting, walking or sitting, standing, squatting, kneeling or walking versus recumbent/supine/lateral or bedcare.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We had also planned subgroup analysis by:</P>
<UL>
<LI>women with a low-risk pregnancy (no complications, greater than or equal to 37 weeks' gestation, singleton with a cephalic presentation) versus high-risk pregnancy.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Data were not available to carry out this analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis  </HEADING>
<P>We carried out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of trial quality for important outcomes in the review. Where there was risk of bias associated with a particular aspect of study quality (e.g. inadequate allocation concealment or high levels of attrition), we explored this by sensitivity analysis.</P>
