Babies rely on external help to maintain temperature, particularly in the first 12 hours of life. For vulnerable babies born preterm or at low birth weight, abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia) is a worldwide issue across all climates and has been linked to a variety of complications including death. Preventive action is taken by reducing heat loss and/or providing warmth through external heat sources. Precautionary steps routinely include ensuring a warm delivery room; drying immediately after birth, especially the head; wrapping in prewarmed dry blankets (including the head); prewarming surfaces; and eliminating draughts.</P><P><B>Search date: </B>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search CENTRAL (2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1966 to 30 June 2016), Embase (1980 to 30 June 2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 30 June 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.</P><P><B>Key results:</B> This review identified 25 studies involving 2433 babies; researchers used additional preventive actions in the first 10 minutes of life to prevent problems with hypothermia. Use of plastic coverings, heated mattresses, and skin-to-skin contact kept infants warmer (and within normal body temperature ranges) than routine preventive action. However, care must be taken, particularly when these methods are combined, to avoid the unintended effect of making babies too warm, which may be harmful. Limitations consist of small numbers of babies and studies included in some comparison groups; variations in methods and definitions used for normal body temperature and routine care; and differences in materials used.</P><P>Although this review confirmed that some of these measures are effective in preventing hypothermia, results across all studies show no reduction in deaths and only limited improvement in short-term complications or illnesses normally associated with being too cold. Findings suggest that perhaps hypothermia is a marker for poorer outcomes, particularly in the most immature and smallest babies, rather than a direct cause. Review authors recommend that future studies should be large enough to detect changes for rarer illnesses, should define these illnesses in the same way so they can be combined across studies, and should focus on longer-term consequences.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence: </B>Overall for the main comparison group (plastic wraps or bags vs routine care), we are moderately confident that trial results and our conclusions are reliable. Across the remaining comparison groups, evidence is insufficient to allow firm judgements mainly because numbers of studies and sample sizes are small.</P><P>In comparisons of plastic wraps or bags versus routine care to keep preterm or low birth weight babies warm, we rated the quality of evidence as moderate for key outcomes. Across outcomes reporting on babies' regulation of their body temperature, we suspect that some small trials showing that the intervention did not keep these babies warmer may not have been published, findings of studies were not in agreement, or evidence was based on small numbers of studies or events. For major complications of brain injury and bleeding into the lung (pulmonary haemorrhage), the number of events was too small or findings were based on only one study. We suspect that some small trials reporting deaths may not have been published; however this was unlikely to have affected review findings.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-02-05 12:24:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-12 17:08:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Newborn admission temperature is a strong predictor of outcomes across all gestations.

Thermal mattresses and SSC also reduced hypothermia risk when compared with routine care, but findings are based on two or fewer small studies. Caution must be taken to avoid iatrogenic hyperthermia, particularly when multiple interventions are used simultaneously. Limited evidence suggests benefit and no evidence of harm for most short-term morbidity outcomes known to be associated with hypothermia, including major brain injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis, and nosocomial infection. Many observational studies have shown increased mortality among preterm hypothermic infants compared with those who maintain normothermia, yet evidence is insufficient to suggest that these interventions reduce risk of in-hospital mortality across all comparison groups. Hypothermia may be a marker for illness and poorer outcomes by association rather than by causality. Limitations of this review include small numbers of identified studies; small sample sizes; and variations in methods and definitions used for hypothermia, hyperthermia, normothermia, routine care, and morbidity, along with lack of power to detect effects on morbidity and mortality across most comparison groups. Future studies should: be adequately powered to detect rarer outcomes; apply standardised morbidity definitions; focus on longer-term outcomes, particularly neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-01-26 19:03:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M McCall"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-26 19:03:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M McCall"><P>Keeping preterm infants sufficiently warm immediately after birth, especially during resuscitation, is difficult even when routine thermal care guidelines are followed. Hypothermia is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a core body temperature &lt; 36.5°C, or a skin temperature &lt; 36°C (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). However, temperature ranges for preterm infants vary, depending on the site of measurement and the device used (<LINK REF="REF-Knobel_x002d_Dail-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knobel-Dail 2015</LINK>). Globally, newborn hypothermia remains a challenge in both resource-poor and resource-rich settings and across all climates. <LINK REF="REF-Lunze-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunze 2013</LINK> reported hypothermia prevalence rates in a systematic review of literature pertaining to low- and middle-income countries. Hospital rates varied widely from 8% (&lt; 34.5°C) within 12 hours of birth (Guinea-Bissau, Africa) to 85% (&lt; 36°C) on admission (Harare, Zimbabwe, Africa), and community rates ranged from 11% (&lt; 35.6°C) on the first day of life (Haryana, India) to 92% (&lt; 36.5°C) during the first month (Sarlahi, Nepal) (<LINK REF="REF-Lunze-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunze 2013</LINK>). The Vermont Oxford Network (VON) 2016 database summary, including infants of birth weight from 501 to 1500 grams, shows an unadjusted network rate of 14.6% (8067 of 55,246 infants) for core body temperature &lt; 36&#8451; within the first hour after admission to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) (<LINK REF="REF-VON-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">VON 2017</LINK>). The highest rates occurred amongst the smallest (22.1% of 501 to 750 grams) and most immature infants (26.2% at &lt; 24 weeks' gestation) (<LINK REF="REF-VON-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">VON 2017</LINK>). These data were collated from 988 participating centres across 28 countries of high- or upper-middle-income status (<LINK REF="REF-The-World-Bank-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">The World Bank 2016</LINK>). The VON also analysed admission temperature data for 454,617 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants surviving for 12 hours or longer in 1112 NICUs during the period from 2009 to 2016 (<LINK REF="REF-VON-2017a" TYPE="REFERENCE">VON 2017a</LINK>). Although these data show improvement in admission hypothermia rates (temperatures &lt; 36.5°C) ranging from 52.6% (2009) to 38.2% (2016), nearly 4 in 10 infants (excluding early deaths) were cold on admission to the NICU. Similarly, in the UK, for infants born in 2015 and 2016, the National Neonatal Audit Programme (NNAP) highlighted hypothermia as an ongoing area of concern, with 28% (2054 of 7351; 2015) and 25% (1930 of 7758; 2016) of infants at &lt; 32 weeks' gestation having a recorded temperature below the recommended temperature range (36.5°C to 37.5°C) within one hour of birth (<LINK REF="REF-NNAP-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNAP 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NNAP-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNAP 2017</LINK>). Consequently, implementation, or sustained use, of evidence-based thermal care strategies is needed to address this issue.</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-01-26 19:03:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M McCall"><P>The newborn cannot shiver (<LINK REF="REF-Scopes-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scopes 1963</LINK>) and relies on interventions for protection against exposure to cold. The ability to maintain an equilibrium between heat loss and heat gain despite variation in environmental temperatures is restricted during the first 12 hours of life (<LINK REF="REF-Buczkowski_x002d_Bickmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buczkowski-Bickmann 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smales-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smales 1978</LINK>). After birth, deep body and skin temperature of the term newborn can drop at a rate of approximately 0.1°C and 0.3°C per minute, respectively, unless immediate action is taken (<LINK REF="REF-Adamson-1965a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamson 1965a</LINK>). Although cold stress may be important for initiating breathing, and induced cooling may help protect the brain of asphyxiated term or near term newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Harned-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harned 1970</LINK>), prolonged exposure to cold should be avoided, especially in the preterm infant.

The 2015 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation critically appraised 36 observational studies (published between 1964 and 2014) demonstrating increased risk of mortality associated with hypothermia at admission in non-asphyxiated infants at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Perlman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyllie-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyllie 2015</LINK>). Review authors initially judged this evidence to be of low quality but subsequently upgraded the quality to moderate on the basis of effect size, dose effect, and single direction of evidence. Across all gestations, admission temperature was shown to be a strong predictor of mortality and morbidity. <LINK REF="REF-Laptook-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laptook 2007</LINK> indicated that for every 1°C decrease in admission temperature, the odds of in-hospital mortality increased by 28% and the odds of late-onset sepsis increased by 11% in a cohort of 5277 low birth weight infants. This study also highlighted a birth weight/intubation interaction, with admission temperature showing an average difference of 1.4°C between an infant of 401 and 1400 grams compared with 0.4°C for birth weight alone. More recently, <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2016</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Lyu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyu 2015</LINK> assessed the association between admission temperature and neonatal mortality and morbidity in population cohort studies of 5697 very preterm infants from 19 regions in 11 European countries (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2016</LINK>), as well as 9833 infants at &lt; 33 weeks' gestation in Canadian NICUs (<LINK REF="REF-Lyu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyu 2015</LINK>). Use of mixed-effects generalised adjusted linear models revealed that an admission temperature &lt; 35°C was associated with increased early (one to six days) neonatal death (risk ratio (RR) 2.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45 to 4.00) and late (7 to 28 days) neonatal death (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.78) but showed no association after 28 days of life (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2016</LINK>). Overall, for every 1°C rise in admission temperature, mortality fell by 15% (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2016</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Lyu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyu 2015</LINK> identified an admission temperature range (axillary or rectal) of 36.5°C to 37.2°C associated with the lowest rates of a composite mortality/morbidity outcome and with individual major morbidities (major brain injury, severe retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, nosocomial infection/sepsis, and duration of ventilation). However, <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2016</LINK> found no association between admission temperature and neonatal morbidity when adjusting analyses for obstetrical characteristics. These retrospective observational studies had several limiting factors, including lack of standardised practice for temperature measurement (site, timing, and instrument) and lack of data for potential confounding factors such as maternal temperature or use of humidified gases. Further investigation is needed to explore the pathways from admission hypothermia to mortality, and to ascertain whether hypothermia is a step in the causal pathway possibly via late sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Laptook-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laptook 2007</LINK>), or, alternatively, whether hypothermia is a marker for illness and poorer outcomes by association rather than by causality.</P><P>Rapid postnatal fall in body temperature is attributable to a combination of physical characteristics (e.g. large surface area in relation to body weight and a thin layer of insulating fat) and environmental factors in the delivery room. Extent of total heat loss and the four modes of heat exchange (conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation) are influenced by ambient air temperature, pressure and relative humidity, and temperature of surrounding surfaces (<LINK REF="REF-Capobianco-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capobianco 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1994</LINK>). Increased rate of heat loss is mainly caused by evaporation of amniotic fluid from the skin surface when the wet newborn moves from the warm environment of the uterus into a cool, dry delivery room (<LINK REF="REF-Adamson-1965a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamson 1965a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hammarlund-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammarlund 1980</LINK>). To maintain core body temperature within the normal range of 36.5°C to 37.5°C (skin temperature of 0.5°C to 1.0°C lower) (<LINK REF="REF-Hey-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hey 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oliver-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 1965</LINK>), the term infant produces heat from breakdown of brown fat (non-shivering thermogenesis) and peripheral vasoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stern-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 1970</LINK>). When skin temperature falls to 35°C to 36°C, non-shivering thermogenesis is initiated (<LINK REF="REF-Bruck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruck 1961</LINK>). The WHO classifies a core body temperature for newborns from 36°C to 36.4°C as mild hypothermia, from 32°C to 35.9°C as moderate hypothermia, and &lt; 32°C as severe (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). Preterm infants have the combined disadvantages of a large surface area in relation to body weight, decreased fat for heat production and insulation, decreased glycogen stores, immature skin, which increases water loss, and poor vascular control. They experience even higher evaporative heat losses than term infants on the first day, especially at low ambient relative humidity (<LINK REF="REF-Hammarlund-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammarlund 1979</LINK>). For each millilitre of water that evaporates from the skin, 560 calories of heat is lost (<LINK REF="REF-Rutter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 2000</LINK>). Currently, no formal definition of 'normal' temperatures for preterm infants is accepted, and methods and accuracy of temperature measurement continue to be debated (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2013a</LINK>).</P><P>The external (skin environment) temperature gradient is pivotal in influencing the infant's response to cold (<LINK REF="REF-Adamson-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamson 1965</LINK>); here the healthcare professional can intervene in the delivery room to minimise the risk of hypothermia. Standard care includes ensuring a warm delivery room at a minimum of 25°C (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>), drying the infant thoroughly immediately after birth (especially the head) (<LINK REF="REF-Bloom-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloom 1994</LINK>), removing any wet blankets, wrapping in a prewarmed blanket, prewarming any contact surfaces, eliminating draughts, and maintaining close proximity to outside walls (<LINK REF="REF-Capobianco-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capobianco 1980</LINK>). If available, radiant warmers for resuscitation and stabilisation allow easy access and are effective in preventing heat loss, provided the infant is immediately dried and placed under the prewarmed heater (<LINK REF="STD-Dahm-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Dahm 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Du-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du 1969</LINK>). Although the infant gains heat via radiation, potential losses through convection and evaporation are increased, and these losses are exacerbated if drying is inadequate. Servo-control is advantageous for avoidance of overheating or underheating if absorption of heat is obstructed by coverings. Since this review was first published (<LINK REF="REF-McCall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCall 2005</LINK>), standard thermal care has evolved, and emerging research evidence encompasses several other preventive measures that were originally considered to exceed routine management.</P><P>In practice, achieving optimal ambient delivery room temperatures for preterm infants may prove difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Chitty-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chitty 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knobel-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knobel 2005a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Reilly-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 2015</LINK> reported that 86% of infants enrolled in the multi-centre Heat Loss Prvention (HeLP) trial were initially resuscitated in delivery room ambient temperatures &#8804; 25°C. In a small randomised controlled trial (RCT) (N = 91) conducted in Eastern China (<LINK REF="STD-Jia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jia 2012</LINK>), researchers found that mean core body temperature was significantly higher in infants at &#8804; 32 weeks' gestation who were born in a warm room (ambient temperature range 24°C to 26°C; mean (standard deviation - SD) 25.1 (0.6)) compared with those born in regular rooms (ambient temperature set at 20°C to 23°C; mean (SD) 22.5 (0.6)). This increase in ambient temperature was associated with a 0.5°C higher mean NICU admission temperature and a 31.9% reduction in the rate of hypothermia. However, this study excluded use of additional thermal care interventions, resulting in a high rate of hypothermia even in warm rooms. Another larger RCT (N = 825 infants) determined that an increase in ambient operating room temperature to 23°C (in addition to gestation-specific thermal care practices) at the time of caesarean delivery reduces the rate of neonatal hypothermia (core body temperature &lt; 36.5°C) on arrival to the admitting nursery compared with the standard temperature of 20°C (35% vs 50%; P &lt; 0.001) (<LINK REF="STD-Duryea-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Duryea 2016</LINK>). Data also show a trend towards increased hyperthermia (core body temperature &#8805; 38.0°C) in the intervention group. Hypothermia was less frequent at lower gestations because these infants received additional preventive measures such as plastic poncho and cap (&lt; 32 weeks' gestation) and warmed gel mattresses (&lt; 28 weeks' gestation). For preterm infants (n = 147), data show no differences in rates of hypothermia and hyperthermia between groups. Ninety-three per cent of 62 surgeons stated that ambient temperatures of 23°C would be considered acceptable if improvement in neonatal outcomes could be demonstrated. <LINK REF="REF-Bhatt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatt 2007</LINK> recommended that all delivery rooms should be fitted with individual thermostat and humidity controls to allow adjustment for preterm delivery by gestational age and birth weight. This supports recent American Heart Association (AHA), European Resuscitation Council (ERC), and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) guidance on temperature maintenance in the delivery room (<LINK REF="REF-Perlman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 2015</LINK>). For preterm infants at &lt; 32 weeks' gestation under radiant warmers, a combination of interventions is recommended, which may include ambient temperature of 23°C to 25°C as recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Perlman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 2015</LINK> and delivery room temperature above 25°C for preterm infants at &lt; 28 weeks' gestation as recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Wyllie-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyllie 2015</LINK>.

More recently, exothermic chemical gel (sodium acetate) mattresses have been utilised during newborn resuscitation and stabilisation of preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Almeida-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almeida 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ibrahim-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ibrahim 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pinheiro-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinheiro 2011</LINK>). These mattresses emit latent heat of crystallisation when activated (<LINK REF="REF-Carmichael-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carmichael 2007</LINK>). The Transwarmer mattress was tested in vitro, and investigators stressed the importance of activation before use to avoid unnecessary heat losses that may occur as a consequence of placing an infant on a non-activated mattress (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2012</LINK>). During 'immediate birth or very early skin-to-skin' contact, the infant is placed on the mother's chest or abdomen during the first minute after birth and suctioned, and, if well enough, the infant is thoroughly dried and placed in a light blanket. A hat may be placed on the infant's head to minimise heat loss (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2016</LINK>). The benefits of uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth are well documented and include improvements in thermal control and physiological stability; however, SSC has been focussed primarily on healthy term infants or poststabilisation preterm and/or low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Boundy-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boundy 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Britton-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Christensson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2013</LINK>). Of 86 studies included in a recent systematic review (RCTs and observational studies) that documented initiation time of SSC, only seven (8%) reported initiation immediately after birth, and 41 (48%) presented stability criteria for initiation (<LINK REF="REF-Boundy-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boundy 2016</LINK>). Fourteen studies that initiated SSC only after stabilisation, or when other criteria were met, reported temperature as a continuous outcome; two studies did not provide information on timing of initiation. Mean body temperature was significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the control group (14 studies; mean difference (MD) 0.24°C; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.33), although heterogeneity was high. This effect was similar for preterm (&lt; 37 weeks' gestation) and low birth weight (&lt; 2500 grams) infant subgroups. KMC significantly reduced the risk of hypothermia compared with conventional care (typical RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.41; nine studies). In a small study comprising 26 infants at &#8804; 26 weeks' gestation (postnatal age two to nine days), <LINK REF="REF-Karlsson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlsson 2012</LINK> demonstrated that SSC can be safely initiated and facilitates temperature control during the first week of life, even among those receiving intensive care. A recent cohort of 90 moderately preterm infants at 32 to 34 weeks' gestation in Norway prospectively assessed the feasibility and safety of early SSC in the delivery room after vaginal birth compared with immediate transfer to the NICU in a conventional incubator (<LINK REF="REF-Kristoffersen-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kristoffersen 2016</LINK>). Data show no statistically significant temperature differences between the two groups at 30 minutes after birth. However, this study was at risk of bias owing to differences in measurement sites for temperature (SSC (rectal) and incubator (axillary)) and underpowering of the study. Nevertheless, investigators implemented SSC immediately after birth with no additional resources and found SSC to be both feasible and safe for this group of infants.</P><P>In recent years, several studies have focussed on new strategies devised to maintain preterm infants' warmth at birth, such as use of humidified air during respiratory support to improve admission temperatures. In 2010, te Pas and colleagues, in a small, prospective observational cohort study, demonstrated a reduction in moderate hypothermia (core body temperature &lt; 36°C) in the heated group (53% vs 19%; P &lt; 0.001) among infants at &#8804; 32 weeks' gestation. Trial authors recommended further research to assess short- and long-term outcomes and cost versus benefit (<LINK REF="REF-te-Pas-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">te Pas 2010</LINK>). The bench test study <LINK REF="REF-Shearman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shearman 2012</LINK>, which also emphasised the need for more research into safety issues pertaining to heating and humidifying gas at resuscitation, supported this decision before any other clinical trials were initiated. Subsequently, a more recent RCT (N = 203) assessed the effect on admission temperature of adding heated humidified gases (HHGs) during respiratory support at birth and during transport of infants at &lt; 32 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2015</LINK>). Standard thermal care employed at the time of the study included warm delivery rooms (25°C to 26°C), preheated radiant warmer surfaces, occlusive body wrap (without drying), and placement of hats. This study showed that use of HHG appeared to be safe and possibly beneficial for infants at &lt; 28 weeks' gestation. Fewer infants (31%) in the HHG group had temperatures outside the normothermic range (36.5°C to 37.5°C) compared with infants in the cold, dry gas group (58%) (P = 0.03). Similarly, <LINK REF="REF-McGrory-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrory 2017</LINK> conducted an RCT (N = 273) at two Australian centres to assess whether use of HHG during stabilisation of infants at &lt; 30 weeks' gestation decreases hypothermia rates at NICU admission (core body temperature &lt; 36.5°C). A significant reduction in admission hypothermia (27% in the HHG group vs 43% in the control group) was reported without an overall increased risk of hyperthermia (core body temperature &gt; 37.5°C), although the trend towards an increased incidence of hyperthermia for lower gestations in the HHG group suggests the need for caution and careful temperature monitoring. <LINK REF="REF-McGrory-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrory 2017</LINK> also noted the need to balance benefits, costs, and risks of introducing an additional piece of delivery room equipment and indicated that consideration should be given to other low-cost interventions such as increasing ambient temperature or using exothermic mattresses.</P><P>All these interventions have potential disadvantages, for example, <LINK REF="REF-Newton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton 2003</LINK> reported that significantly more infants (at &lt; 30 weeks' gestation) wrapped in polyethylene bags were hyperthermic ( &gt; 37°C) when compared with unwrapped historical control infants. <LINK REF="REF-Brun-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brun 1997</LINK> noted that use of a chemical hot pack during resuscitation of a newborn infant resulted in third-degree burns, and recommended that these should not be used unless the peak temperature of the pack is &lt; 44°C. <LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McCarthy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCarthy 2013</LINK> reported that in infants at &lt; 31 weeks' gestation, using an exothermic mattress as well as a polyethylene bag caused increased hyperthermia on admission to the NICU when compared with only placing infants in polyethylene bags. <LINK REF="REF-Ibrahim-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ibrahim 2010</LINK> reported a higher incidence of admission hyperthermia (usually transient) associated with use of acetate gel mattresses in combination with polyethylene bags at resuscitation in preterm infants at &lt; 28 weeks' gestation. However, <LINK REF="REF-Pinheiro-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinheiro 2011</LINK> concluded that chemical warming packs added to plastic wrapping are useful for reducing hypothermia during stabilisation of very low birth weight infants without producing significant hyperthermia, and that their usefulness outweighs any potential rare adverse effects such as focal skin injury.

Current concerted and collaborative efforts to reduce the incidence of hypothermia on admission to neonatal units have included rapid cycle quality improvement initiatives and implementation of 'intervention bundles', such as staff education, checklists, consistent room air temperature, use of polyethylene bags or caps and thermal mattresses, and transfer in a warmed incubator (<LINK REF="REF-Arrindell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrindell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Caldas-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caldas 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeMauro-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMauro 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harer-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harer 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ho-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silvestri-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silvestri 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yip-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yip 2017</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Manai-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manai 2013</LINK> reported that the rate of admission hypothermia in preterm low birth weight infants was reduced from 44% to 0% within a two-year period at a regional NICU in San Jose. This study applied a multi-disciplinary, standardised, evidence-based thermal management approach before delivery and through NICU admission, implemented via the rapid cycle Plan-Do-Study-Act quality improvement method. Additional studies in high-income settings adopting this approach have reported comparable successes in prevention of hypothermia without incurring hyperthermia or other adverse complications (<LINK REF="REF-Pearlman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearlman 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pinheiro-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinheiro 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pinheiro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinheiro 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russo 2014</LINK>). The primary objective of adopting evidence-based thermal care practices during stabilisation and transfer to the NICU is to achieve and maintain normothermia while avoiding both iatrogenic hypothermia and hyperthermia (<LINK REF="REF-McCall-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCall 2014</LINK>). Therefore, this review provides healthcare professionals with a critical appraisal of available evidence, with focus on individual or combinations of interventions applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room, and is limited to preterm and/or low birth weight infants because these infants are most susceptible to adverse effects of hypothermia. Longer-term thermal management and spatial or environmental strategies for increasing warming are beyond the scope of this review, which provides an update of a Cochrane Review first published as <LINK REF="REF-McCall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCall 2005</LINK>, and later updated in <LINK REF="REF-McCall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCall 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-McCall-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCall 2010</LINK>.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-01-12 17:35:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Primary </HEADING><P>To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions designed for prevention of hypothermia in preterm and/or low birth weight infants applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room, compared with routine thermal care or any other single/combination of intervention(s) also designed for prevention of hypothermia in preterm and/or low birth weight infants applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Secondary </HEADING><P>To assess effects of these interventions on complications associated with preterm birth, hypothermia, and adverse outcomes.</P></SUBSECTION></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-01-25 14:19:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-01-19 02:47:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2017-03-03 09:39:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>All trials using randomised or quasi-randomised allocation to test a specific intervention(s) designed to prevent hypothermia immediately after birth.</P></CRIT_STUDIES><CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2018-01-13 05:02:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Preterm infants at &lt; 37 weeks' gestation (according to best obstetrical estimate at time of delivery) or low birth weight infants weighing &#8804; 2500 grams, for whom intervention(s) to prevent hypothermia is/are applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room.

We categorised one study as having unclear risk of other sources of potential bias owing to the significantly longer time from birth to admission for infants in the plastic bag + thermal mattress group when compared with the plastic bag group (24 vs 19 minutes; P = 0.008) (<LINK REF="STD-McCarthy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCarthy 2013</LINK>). Trial authors presented findings derived from a regression analysis that explored the relationship between time to admission and admission temperature, showing some evidence of a positive correlation between time to admission and rectal temperature in both groups, although the association was weak. Further multiple regression analyses suggest that maternal temperature and transport incubator temperature had an effect on infant temperature and the presence of hyperthermia, although these associations were not significant enough to explain differences between the two groups. Trial authors suggested that increased time from birth to admission in the plastic bag and thermal mattress group may have been a consequence of non-masking of treatment allocation. This may have resulted in greater vigilance among carers regarding infants who were not in the plastic bag and mattress group; we therefore moved these infants to the NICU faster group (shorter time from birth to admission) to avoid hypothermia.</P><P>We categorised 10 studies as having high risk of other sources of potential bias based on the following details.</P><UL><LI><LINK REF="STD-Bergman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 2004</LINK> showed potential for selection bias in that the assigned research nurse was unavailable for 99 potentially eligible mother-infant dyads.

For infants at &lt; 28 weeks' gestation, mean birth weight was 914 grams (SD 163) for the plastic wrap group and 742 grams (SD 206) for the non-wrap group; therefore, results could be potentially biased towards the wrap group because the non-wrap group was lighter and more vulnerable to heat loss.</LI></UL><P>In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Reilly-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 2015</LINK> reported several protocol violations among treatment groups, including delayed application of the wrap, wrap opening during the study period, and early removal of the wrap.

"A naked newborn exposed to an environmental temperature of 23°C suffers the same heat loss as a naked adult at 0°C" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>), and this is negatively correlated with gestation and birth weight. Therefore, early intervention in the delivery room is crucial for minimisation of heat loss during resuscitation, stabilisation, and transport to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), particularly for the least mature, smallest, and sickest infants. National and international agencies responsible for development of neonatal resuscitation guidelines face a challenging role while research evidence is emerging/not yet conclusive, but long-term safety data are not yet available. In 2006, the <LINK REF="REF-ILCOR-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILCOR 2006</LINK> consensus statement first recommended that plastic bags or plastic wrapping under radiant heat should be considered as a standard technique to maintain temperature. Since that time, recommendations have continued to evolve as research evidence has become available, and these thermal care practices have been adopted to varying degrees (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Naggar-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Naggar 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Godhamgaonkar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Godhamgaonkar 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2016</LINK>). Consequently, for this review update, we have expanded our inclusion criteria to reflect these changes in clinical practice. We remain focussed on interventions to prevent hypothermia applied immediately at birth apart from 'routine' care (as defined in our original protocol) but have also included randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing any other single/combination of intervention(s) designed for prevention of hypothermia in preterm and/or low birth weight infants and applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room that otherwise would have been excluded.</P><SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-01-26 18:31:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M McCall"><P>Twenty-five studies across 15 comparison groups met the inclusion criteria (2481 randomly assigned participants; 2433 participants completing the studies). Interventions were categorised into three main groups: barriers to heat loss (18 studies - 11 comparison groups), external heat sources (three studies - two comparison groups), and combinations of interventions (four studies - two comparison groups). We judged the quality of evidence for the main comparison group (plastic wraps or bags vs routine care) to be moderate across key clinical outcomes. For the remaining comparison groups, we derived evidence from one or two studies with small sample sizes, thereby limiting our ability to draw firm conclusions.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Barriers to heat loss category</HEADING><P><B>Core body temperature (°C) on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth (plastic wraps or bags vs routine care): </B>Thirteen studies comprising 1633 infants reported core body temperature in °C (rectal or axillary) on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth (<LINK REF="STD-Cardona-Torres-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cardona Torres 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chantaroj-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chantaroj 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farhadi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Farhadi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gathwala-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gathwala 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knobel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leadford-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Leadford 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reilly-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rohana-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rohana 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talakoub-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Talakoub 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trevisanuto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Trevisanuto 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vohra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vohra 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vohra-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vohra 2004</LINK>). Overall, plastic wraps or bags were effective in reducing heat loss for infants at &lt; 37 weeks' gestation when compared with infants who received routine care immediately after birth in the delivery room. Each individual study showed a significant effect in favour of the intervention for core body temperature on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth across gestations, with the exception of a small study that showed no significant effect for the subgroup of infants at &#8805; 28 and &#8804; 31 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="STD-Vohra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vohra 1999</LINK>). Findings indicate that the effect is greater among the most immature infants. Data show a substantial level of heterogeneity within each subgroup of infants. Possible causes may lie within variations in methods used across studies, particularly with respect to "routine care", or in baseline hypothermia rates, as previously discussed. Heat loss prevention observed, despite these variations in how the standard of care was implemented between sites, demonstrates that findings are robust and generalisable across centres. A funnel plot analysis for core body temperature on admission to the NICU suggests possible publication bias with respect to smaller non-effect studies that have not been published. Plastic wraps or bags seem to prevent rather than delay the postnatal fall in temperature with significant effects in favour of plastic wraps and bags at 1 hour, 90 minutes, and 2 hours after birth; at post stabilisation; and at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 90 minutes, and 2 hours after the initial NICU admission temperature was taken.</P><P><B>Hypothermia on admission to NICU or up to two hours after birth (plastic wraps or bags vs routine care): </B>Ten studies comprising 1417 infants reported the incidence of hypothermia in intervention and control groups (plastic wrap or bag and routine care) (<LINK REF="STD-Cardona-Torres-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cardona Torres 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chantaroj-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chantaroj 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farhadi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Farhadi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knobel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leadford-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Leadford 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reilly-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rohana-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rohana 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trevisanuto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Trevisanuto 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vohra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vohra 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vohra-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vohra 2004</LINK>).

Thermal (transwarmer) mattress significantly kept infants &#8804; 1500 grams warmer and reduced the incidence of hypothermia on admission to the NICU with no significant difference in risk of hyperthermia. Three infants would have to receive a thermal mattress to prevent one infant from being hypothermic (core body temperature &lt; 36°C) on admission to the NICU. Thermal (transwarmer) mattress also significantly reduced risk of a core body temperature outside the normothermic range (36.5°C to 37.5°C) on admission to the NICU. Two infants would have to receive a thermal mattress to prevent one infant from having a temperature outside the normothermic range. Data show a high level of heterogeneity between studies in this comparison group; the most likely reason for this is that the two studies used different methods. <LINK REF="STD-Chawla-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chawla 2011</LINK> used additional thermal care measures (plastic bag without drying below the neck) for infants at &lt; 28 weeks' gestation; this was considered to be part of routine thermal care practices. However, <LINK REF="STD-Brennan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brennan 1996</LINK> - the earlier study - did not employ such additional thermal care measures.

The most plausible reason for the observed moderate heterogeneity lies with <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2011</LINK>, in which variability of use between practitioners when the intervention was polyethylene wrap and, in some cases, displacement of the wrap could have resulted in heat loss.

However, overall, data show no significant difference in risk of hypothermia (core body temperature &lt; 36.5°C) but an overall significant increased risk of hyperthermia associated with the simultaneous combination of plastic bag and thermal mattress. For every six infants receiving plastic bag + thermal mattress, one infant would be hyperthermic on admission to the NICU for infants at &lt; 31 weeks' gestation. Researchers found no significant difference in risk of having a core body temperature outside the normothermic range on admission to the NICU nor for reported secondary outcomes: major brain injury, mortality, chronic lung disease, coagulation support, inotrope use, intubation during admission, and one or more doses of surfactant during admission.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Overall for all included interventions designed to prevent heat loss at birth</HEADING><P>Despite variation in interventions applied; definitions of 'routine care' and definitions of hypothermia, hyperthermia, and normothermia; and groups of infants included, a similar pattern emerged across all studies, with infants in the intervention group significantly warmer (or showing a non-significant trend in that direction) than infants receiving 'routine care'. Evidence of moderate quality shows that plastic wraps or bags keep preterm infants warmer and lead to higher temperatures on admission to neonatal units with less hypothermia and temperatures outside the range of normothermia. Extremely preterm infants (&lt; 28 weeks' gestation) appeared to benefit the most. Other interventions such as thermal mattresses, skin-to-skin care, and plastic caps also reduce hypothermia risk when compared with routine care, but these findings are based on two or fewer studies with small sample sizes. One small study found that stockinette caps were not more effective when compared with routine care in infants at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation.</P><P>Hyperthermia in the newborn may be caused by intrapartum maternal fever or, as our evidence suggests, by use of interventions to reduce hypothermia in the delivery room. Animal and human studies suggest that hyperthermia is harmful to the newborn brain. In infants at &#8804; 6 hours' postnatal age and at &#8805; 36 weeks&#8217; gestation with moderate or severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, elevated temperatures were associated with increased odds of death or moderate/severe disability at 18 to 22 months on secondary data analysis of the NICHD whole body cooling trial (<LINK REF="REF-Laptook-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laptook 2008a</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Lyu-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyu 2015</LINK>, in a retrospective observational study of 9833 preterm infants at &lt; 33 weeks&#8217; gestation in the Canadian Neonatal Network, demonstrated a U-shaped relationship between admission temperature and poor clinical outcome. The lowest rates of adverse outcomes were associated with temperatures between 36.5°C and 37.2°C. Hyperthermia has also been shown to worsen ventilator-induced lung injury and inflammation in preterm lambs (<LINK REF="REF-Ball-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ball 2010</LINK>). Therefore, iatrogenic hyperthermia should be avoided, particularly in infants at risk of neurological injury. Caution must be taken to avert iatrogenic hyperthermia, particularly when multiple interventions are used simultaneously immediately after birth in the delivery room (e.g. plastic bags + thermal mattresses).</P><P>Many observational studies (as discussed in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> section) have demonstrated increased mortality among preterm hypothermic infants compared with those who maintain normothermia, yet evidence is insufficient to suggest that interventions to prevent hypothermia reduce risk of in-hospital mortality across all comparison groups included in this review. In addition, researchers have provided limited evidence of benefit and no evidence of harm for most short-term morbidity outcomes known to be associated with being hypothermic, including major brain injury, BPD, ROP, NEC, and nosocomial infection. Limitations include lack of power to detect effects of these interventions on morbidity and mortality across most comparison groups. Data show significant differences for only two morbidity outcomes. For infants at &#8805; 24 and &lt; 28 weeks' gestation, plastic wraps or bags significantly reduced risk of pulmonary haemorrhage during hospital stay when compared with routine care (moderate-quality evidence). Plastic wraps were also more effective in reducing risk of hypoglycaemia within two hours of birth when compared with routine care for infants at &lt; 37 weeks' gestation with birth weight &#8804; 2500 grams undergoing interhospital transport in one small study. Further investigation is needed to explore the pathways from admission hypothermia to mortality, and to ascertain whether hypothermia is a step in the causal pathway (<LINK REF="REF-Laptook-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laptook 2008</LINK>), possibly via late sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Laptook-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laptook 2007</LINK>); alternatively, hypothermia may be a marker for illness and poorer outcome by association rather than for causality.</P><P>No reported adverse events across all studies, such as skin maceration or infection, were attributable to the intervention, nor did plastic bags, plastic caps, skin-to-skin care, or thermal mattresses interfere with resuscitation practices. However, mixed reports have discussed plastic wraps with regard to interference with resuscitation and placing of umbilical lines and probes. Problems appear to be related to displacement of plastic wraps.</P><P>Although the interventions studied in this review offer some short-term benefit regarding heat loss prevention in vulnerable preterm and/or low birth weight infants, their effect on morbidity and their long-term safety remain largely unknown; however, the harmful effects of hypothermia are well documented, and the findings of this review demonstrate that hypothermia can be prevented. Further information on effects of plastic wraps on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes will become available upon full publication of follow-up data from the Heat Loss Prevention (HeLP) study (<LINK REF="STD-Reilly-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 2015</LINK>). Therefore, monitoring (for both benefits and risks of potential adverse events) should continue in neonatal units where such interventions are adopted as routine practice, because wide variation in clinical practice has been reported. In addition, clarification of 'normal' temperatures for these populations of infants is essential, as are better data correlating axillary versus rectal versus other temperature-taking sites. The multi-centre HeLP study will yield important prospective data on 'normal' temperatures in this population, including correlation of axillary and rectal temperatures.</P><P>The 2015 neonatal resuscitation guidance provided by the American Heart Association (AHA), the European Resuscitation Council (ERC), and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) states that for all gestational ages, admission temperature of newly born, non-asphyxiated infants is a strong predictor of mortality and morbidity and should be recorded as an outcome predictor and as a key quality indicator (<LINK REF="REF-Perlman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 2015</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Fastman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fastman 2014</LINK> conducted a small qualitative study in the USA to explore clinicians' perspectives on barriers to management of hypothermia among low birth weight infants in the delivery room, during transport, and upon arrival to the NICU. A multi-disciplinary team approach to neonatal resuscitation, thermal care, and overall delivery room management, coupled with integration of temperature monitoring into quality and safety programmes, was considered an important step in addressing this long-standing problem. Paradoxically, hypothermia is a greater problem in lower-income countries, where climates are generally warmer. Four studies were conducted in lower-middle-income countries: India (<LINK REF="STD-Bhavsar-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bhavsar 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gathwala-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gathwala 2010</LINK>), Zambia (<LINK REF="STD-Leadford-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Leadford 2013</LINK>), and the Phillippines (<LINK REF="STD-Tescon_x002d_delos-Santos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tescon-delos Santos 2012</LINK>); and seven in upper-middle-income countries: South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 2004</LINK>), Mexico (<LINK REF="STD-Cardona-Torres-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cardona Torres 2012</LINK>), Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Chantaroj-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chantaroj 2011</LINK>), Turkey (<LINK REF="STD-Caglar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Caglar 2014</LINK>), Iran (<LINK REF="STD-Farhadi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Farhadi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talakoub-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Talakoub 2015</LINK>), and Malaysia (<LINK REF="STD-Rohana-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rohana 2011</LINK>). Plastic wraps (food grade polyethylene, clean but not sterile) used in the HeLP study cost approximately CAD 157 for 5000 wraps, which, when calculated per infant, equates to approximately (USD) 3 cents each (<LINK REF="STD-Reilly-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 2015</LINK>). Therefore, these may be an affordable option for preterm infants in low-resource settings. Another low-cost option would be skin-to-skin care; however, only one study fulfilled our inclusion criteria, because in most studies, participants were term infants, or skin-to-skin care was not initiated immediately at birth (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 2004</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-01-18 06:09:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>All included studies fulfilled our strict PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcomes) criteria. The primary outcome in one included trial was all-cause mortality; all other studies were powered for our primary outcome of temperature on admission to the NICU or for hypothermia. Investigators applied all interventions immediately after birth in the delivery room. Participants were categorised by gestation (all preterm) in 17 studies, by birth weight (all low birth weight) in two studies, and by both gestation and birth weight inclusion criteria in six studies. Four studies were conducted in lower-middle-income countries and seven in upper-middle-income countries; all other studies took place in high-income countries. Available information showed that all studies used a combination of external heat sources (radiant warmer/drop light, warmer table, transport incubator) and caps as part of routine thermal care (control group and/or intervention group). In two studies, researchers attempted to keep ambient delivery room temperature at 26°C for preterm births. Ranges of routine delivery room ambient temperatures included a cool 20°C to 21°C to a warm 26°C to 28°C. Four studies reported the main outcome measure (temperature on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth) as a continuous variable, one study as a dichotomous variable (derived from skin temperature °C), and the remaining studies as both a continuous and a dichotomous variable. Overall, 18 studies reported core body temperature as axillary °C, four studies as rectal °C, and two studies as both axillary and rectal °C; one study reported skin temperature. Definitions of hypothermia were not consistent across studies. Researchers provided limited reporting of prespecified secondary outcomes in earlier studies, but more recent studies reported important secondary outcomes such as mortality, major brain injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), sepsis, and adverse events, particularly hyperthermia on admission to the NICU. Definitions of morbidity outcomes were also variable across studies. Future studies would benefit from using standardised definitions. This would reduce heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias, thereby facilitating meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Webbe-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webbe 2017</LINK>). Core outcomes in Neonatology (COIN) are currently under development as part of the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials initiative (COMET) (<LINK REF="REF-Webbe-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webbe 2017</LINK>).</P><P>In summary, the literature included in our review was clearly applicable to our primary review objective - "To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions, designed for prevention of hypothermia in preterm and/or low birth weight infants, and applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room, compared with routine thermal care or any other single/combination of intervention(s) also designed for prevention of hypothermia in preterm and/or low birth weight infants, and applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room". However, reporting of secondary outcomes was limited across studies, with many outcomes reported for just one study within comparison groups; therefore imprecision is a major concern. In addition, these studies were not powered for all secondary outcomes. We addressed publication bias for each outcome when we were able to include more than 10 studies in the meta-analysis.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-01-19 02:48:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Overall, for all included studies, across both domains for selection bias, we considered 12 studies (48%) to be at low risk (i.e. adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment). For 92% of included studies, we noted no attempt to blind participants and healthcare personnel to the intervention (unclear but unlikely in two studies). Outcomes were objective and so were less likely to be biased than subjective outcome measures. In addition, secondary outcome data for key morbidities were assessed throughout the neonatal stay, when personnel were less likely to be aware of the original allocation group. Only three studies reported any attempt to blind outcome assessors or the data analysis team to the intervention; therefore, potential detection biases cannot be ruled out. However, for our primary outcome measure - core body or skin temperature - we conducted a simple linear regression analysis using the temperature time series (birth to 120 minutes) for one intervention and control group reported in <LINK REF="STD-Cardona-Torres-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cardona Torres 2012</LINK>. We found a significant linear trend (P &lt; 0.029) and widening of the mean temperature difference between control and intervention groups (polyethylene bag without previous drying). This pattern of results suggests that detection bias was unlikely. No studies reported incomplete outcome data &#8805; 20%. Therefore risk of attrition bias was low. All infants randomised in most (64%) studies completed the trial. We did not have access to study protocols for 16 of our included studies; therefore our assessment of the potential risk of reporting bias was limited. In all, 14 studies (56%) appeared to be free from any additional sources of bias, and one had unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-McCarthy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCarthy 2013</LINK>).</P><P>Two studies reported issues with displacement of plastic wrap, which may have resulted in heat loss (<LINK REF="STD-Simon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2013</LINK>). This may have influenced the findings for comparison group 14 (plastic wrap or bag vs thermal mattress), which showed no significant differences in effect between the two interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Simon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2011</LINK>). This bias is unlikely to change the conclusions for comparison group 1 (plastic wrap or bag vs routine care), which already demonstrated a highly significant difference in effect favouring plastic bag or wrap (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2013</LINK>).

One study reported a higher incidence of swaddling in the control group but showed a statistically significant difference in effect for the comparison group plastic wrap and plastic cap versus routine care in favour of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Tescon_x002d_delos-Santos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tescon-delos Santos 2012</LINK>). For skin-to-skin versus routine care (comparison group 12), <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 2004</LINK> found a risk of selection bias in that many preterm infants were born without the nurse researcher present. Further issues included higher delivery room temperatures in the intervention group for stockinette cap versus routine care (comparison group 11); despite this, data show no evidence of effect. <LINK REF="STD-Knobel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 2005</LINK> attempted to maintain delivery room temperature at 26°C but reported a wide range of temperatures. Post hoc analyses controlling for delivery room temperature showed that mean admission temperatures in the intervention group (plastic wrap or bag) were 0.6°C higher than in the routine care group. <LINK REF="STD-Leslie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Leslie 2007</LINK> compared plastic bag + thermal mattress versus plastic bag only (comparison 15) and found no differences between the two interventions; however, this study was underpowered and risk of bias cannot be ruled out, leading to unreliable findings. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Reilly-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 2015</LINK> reported several protocol violations among treatment groups, including delayed application of the wrap, wrap opening during the study period, and early removal of the wrap. Despite these violations, investigators reported significantly higher mean baseline and poststabilisation temperatures for the wrap group. Further violations included use of adjunct heat sources in small numbers of infants in both wrap and non-wrap groups, which was unlikely to affect findings.</P><P>We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, as outlined in the <I>GRADE Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>), to assess the quality of evidence for the following (clinically relevant) outcomes for our main comparison group: core body temperature on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth; hypothermia on admission to the NICU - core body temperature &lt; 36.5°C or skin temperature &lt; 36°C; core body temperature (°C) one hour after the initial NICU admission temperature was taken; hyperthermia on admission to the NICU - core body temperature &gt; 37.5°C; major brain injury during hospital stay; pulmonary haemorrhage during hospital stay; and mortality (death within hospital stay or at six months' corrected gestation). For all outcomes presented, we assessed the quality of the evidence as moderate: "We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different." We chose to not downgrade any of our outcome measures for performance or detection bias, as discussed above.

Both reviews are in agreement with our findings and provide similar evidence in support of the effectiveness of plastic coverings in reducing heat losses and preventing hypothermia compared with routine thermal care across a range of gestational ages. Reductions in risk of hypothermia of 21% to 46% provided in <LINK REF="REF-Oatley-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oatley 2016</LINK> and of 21% to 71% as reported in <LINK REF="REF-Li-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2016</LINK> are slightly below the range of our pooled data of 33% overall (&lt; 37 weeks' gestation), 30% for infants at &lt; 28 weeks' gestation, and 83% for infants at &#8805; 28 weeks' gestation (upper-middle-income settings). Data show no significant reductions in neonatal mortality or morbidity. <LINK REF="REF-Li-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2016</LINK> reported a significantly higher incidence of hyperthermia in the plastic wrap group compared with the control group (typical RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.56 to 4.15; eight studies; N = 1438), which was readily resolved within one to two hours after unwrapping. However, based on the results of eight RCTs, <LINK REF="REF-Oatley-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oatley 2016</LINK> suggested that risk of hyperthermia is low (&lt; 5%), that no evidence suggested increased risk with concurrent use of an incubator, and that in all reported cases neonates returned to normothermia when wrapping was removed.

Implications for research included the need for further study to assess the role of plastic coverings outside the hospital setting and inclusion of longer follow-up periods to assess the impact of this intervention on mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Further studies to assess effectiveness of plastic wrap compared with skin-to-skin care (SSC) immediately after birth would inform practice in low-resource settings. No studies for this comparison group fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The World Health Organization addressed the question "Should these plastic wraps/caps be used instead of kangaroo mother care immediately after birth in a subgroup of preterm infants?" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>). Evidence presented in <LINK REF="REF-Oatley-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oatley 2016</LINK> (no study compared plastic wraps vs kangaroo mother care (KMC)) led WHO to conclude that evidence on the effectiveness of plastic bags/wraps in providing thermal care for preterm newborns immediately at birth was insufficient. However, during stabilisation and transfer of these infants to specialised neonatal wards, wrapping in plastic bags/wraps may be considered an alternative method of preventing hypothermia.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">External heat sources</HEADING><P>Only one small RCT comparing SSC versus routine care fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review and showed that SSC was effective in reducing the risk of hypothermia when compared with conventional incubator care for infants with birth weight between 1200 and 2199 grams (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2016</LINK>, recently conducted a Cochrane Review (literature search end date June 2016) to determine whether evidence is available to support use of KMC in low birth weight infants as an alternative to conventional neonatal care before or after the initial period of stabilisation; similarly only one study evaluated KMC before stabilisation (<LINK REF="STD-Worku-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Worku 2005</LINK>). We excluded this study from our review because the intervention was not applied immediately at birth, within 10 minutes, in the delivery room, and the mean age of participants at enrolment was approximately 10 hours. The review authors were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of KMC in non-stabilised low birth weight infants and highlighted the need for rigorous trials to assess the effectiveness of early-onset continuous KMC for non-stabilised or relatively stabilised low birth weight infants in low-income countries. Clearly, studies to date have primarily focussed on healthy term infants or poststabilisation preterm and/or low birth weight infants. Of 86 studies included in a recent systematic review (RCTs and observational studies) documenting initiation time of SSC, only seven (8%) were initiated immediately after birth, and 41 (48%) had stability criteria for initiation (<LINK REF="REF-Boundy-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boundy 2016</LINK>). A recent prospective cohort of 90 moderately preterm infants of 32 to 34 weeks' gestation in Norway assessed the feasibility and safety of early SSC in the delivery room after vaginal birth compared with immediate transfer to the NICU in a conventional incubator (<LINK REF="REF-Kristoffersen-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kristoffersen 2016</LINK>). Data show no statistically significant temperature differences between the two groups at 30 minutes after birth. However, this study was at risk of bias owing to differences in measurement sites for temperature (SSC (rectal) and incubator (axillary)), and the study was underpowered. Nevertheless, investigators implemented SSC immediately after birth with no additional resources, and this approach appeared to be both feasible and safe for this group of infants.</P></SUBSECTION></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-18 07:35:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-01-18 07:35:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Hypothermia remains a worldwide problem, especially for small infants and those born preterm. Across all gestations, admission temperature is a strong predictor of mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Perlman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 2015</LINK>). Any additional intervention designed to prevent hypothermia in very preterm and/or low birth weight infants, and applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room, compared with routine thermal care is beneficial in practice. Moderate-quality evidence shows that low-cost plastic wraps or bags keep preterm infants warmer and lead to higher temperatures on admission to neonatal units with less hypothermia and fewer temperatures outside the range of normothermia. Extremely preterm infants appear to benefit the most. Further emerging evidence suggests that plastic caps, thermal mattresses, and skin-to-skin care also reduce risk of hypothermia across a range of gestations and birth weights when compared with routine care. Caution must be taken to avoid iatrogenic hyperthermia, particularly when multiple interventions are used simultaneously (e.g. plastic bags + thermal mattresses). Many observational studies demonstrate increased mortality in preterm hypothermic infants compared with those who maintain normothermia, yet evidence is insufficient to suggest that these interventions reduce risk of in-hospital (or at six months' corrected gestation) mortality across all comparison groups.</P><P>Limited evidence suggests benefit and no evidence suggests harm for most short-term morbidity outcomes known to be associated with being hypothermic, including major brain injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis, and nosocomial infection. Therefore, hypothermia may be a marker for illness and poorer outcomes by association rather than for causality. Limitations include small numbers of studies; small sample sizes; and variations in methods and definitions used for hypothermia, hyperthermia, normothermia, routine care, and morbidity; coupled with lack of power to detect effects of these interventions on morbidity and mortality across most comparison groups.</P><P>Overall, for the main comparison (plastic wraps or bags vs routine care), we are moderately confident that results and our conclusions are reliable. Across the remaining comparison groups, evidence is insufficient to allow firm judgements.</P><P>Preterm thermal care strategies should be tailored to the individual setting with consideration of the environment, available resources (both structural and financial), and baseline hypothermia rates. These strategies should be collaborative, multi-disciplinary, standardised, evidence-based thermal management approaches provided before delivery and throughout neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. Adherence to thermal care guidelines should be audited by integrating performance monitoring into practice, and by continuing to record core body temperature on admission to the NICU as a measure of quality of care and as a predictor of outcomes.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-01-18 07:35:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Future studies assessing the efficacy of interventions designed to maintain normothermia at birth should be adequately powered to detect rarer short-term morbidity outcomes and all-cause mortality, and should focus on longer-term outcomes, particularly neurodevelopmental outcomes. These large-scale studies should use standardised morbidity definitions.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-01-18 07:36:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Diarmuid Kennedy, Angela Thompson, Alex McIlroy, and Patricia Watt, Faculty Librarians Medicine and Health Sciences, Queen's University Belfast; Mike Stevenson, Consultant in Medical Statistics; Nuala Livingston, Cochrane Editorial Unit (London); Roger Soll, Colleen Ovelman, and Yolanda Brosseau, Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG); Suzanne Sweeney, Texas Woman's University Library, Texas Woman's University.</P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2018-01-18 07:39:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>SV is principal investigator on three studies that met the review eligibility criteria and was excluded from the study appraisal process for these studies.</P></CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST><CONTRIBUTIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-18 07:39:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review was conceived by the Northern Ireland Neonatal Intensive Care Outcomes Research and Evaluation Group (NICORE).</P><P>The contact review author (EC) co-ordinated the review and prepared the manuscript in RevMan 5.3.

However, this trial is the largest RCT evaluating short-term effects of wrapping infants immediately after birth (24 to 27 weeks' gestation). This large pragmatic trial with 39 participating centres was subject to several protocol violations in the treatment group (i.e. delayed application of wrap, opening of the wrap during the study period, and early removal of the wrap). Despite these violations, significantly greater baseline and poststabilisation temperatures in the wrap group suggested that they may not have greatly affected heat losses. In addition, use of adjunct heat source when temperature was not known to be &lt; 35.5°C. Only 12 infants in the wrap group and 17 in the no wrap group experienced this violation; therefore this was unlikely to have impacted the significance of primary and secondary outcomes.
