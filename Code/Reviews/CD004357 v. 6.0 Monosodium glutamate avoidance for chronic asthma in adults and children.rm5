Can we change this and send for peer review?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;===============================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Statistical editing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for asking me to look at this review. I would strongly advise that no meta-analysis of these two trials is attempted. The participants are different (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Schwartzstein 1987&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Schwartzstein 1987&lt;/a&gt; chronic asthma and &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Woods 1998&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Woods 1998&lt;/a&gt; people who perceived themselves MSG intolerant) and I would not expect the same treatment effect in these two trials (unless the treatment is ineffective).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are both cross-overs, and dichotomous data from cross-over studies depends on knowing the number of participants who are discordant pairs, which means those who have a significant drop in FEV1 and not on placebo, and vice versa. These data are presented in &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Woods 1998&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Woods 1998&lt;/a&gt; but is not shown in &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Schwartzstein 1987&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Schwartzstein 1987&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a helpful review, but needs to have the meta-analysis removed and the results described from each trial in narrative form. We can then move it on towards peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma notes. 31 October 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for submitting your review, which is good, but needs some attention before it is ready for peer review. I ran the text through CrossCheck software as part of our normal editorial process which compares text with already published text. The software detected a few instances where text has been copied and pasted from others' work and these sections need rephrasing before we can progress with the editorial process. I have highlighted the areas that need attention in &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;span&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a few additional comments that I would like you to address (see below). Please could you respond to the comments below to let me know what you decided to do - either use capitals or bold so I can see your remarks. I have made some changes using tracked changes. please review them and once you are happy with them accept them all by clicking on Edit &amp;gt; Global replace &amp;gt; and checking globally accept changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;references&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three references (Dean, Bateman and hall) that do not have any source. please provide full details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As you said, there is no need to include so many excluded studies with reasons, we'll get ride of those excluded after the first screen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risk of bias. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suggest deleting risk of bias figure 2. I don't think it adds anything here as there are so few studies. Richard added this figure, so I didn't move it &lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;OK!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the risk of bias discussion you state that the quality of both studies is high. I am not sure you can be sure of this given that the first two domains were unclear. Could you expand on this section to explain the methodological quality a bit clearer please? you could try looking at this example of a review to see how you might be able to do this&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The risk of bias table should contain direct quotes from the publication plus comments if required. Could you add quotes where possible please.&lt;span&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Woods thanks the pharmacist who arranged the interventions so perhaps this suggests that the randomisation/allocation concealment was OK? What do you think?&amp;#65288;done&amp;#65289;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;data and analysis. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; have rearranged the forest plots because comparisons are supposed to be different (e.g. comparison 1 MSG versus placebo; comparison 2 MSG versus inhaled steroids).&lt;span&gt;1g with 25mg/kg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;what is the count data in analysis 2.1 showing??we caculate &lt;span&gt;OR for GIV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What time were the FEV1 readings taken? Were any of them taken at home while others were taken at the clinic? &lt;span&gt;The time of the readings taking was described in the text, Schwartzstein didn't mention the place of the readings taking but Rosalie did it at the clinic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not sure what this means &amp;quot;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Schwartzstein 1987&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Schwartzstein 1987&lt;/a&gt; reported the number of participants who had unusual sensations (2 in MSG group and 2 in placebo), but did not scale the symptoms.&amp;quot; do you mean that the trialist did not use a symptom scale? &lt;span&gt;yes, we've rewritten it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Woods 1998&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Woods 1998&lt;/a&gt; found that there was no evidence of MSG affecting nonspecific BHR, but one subject did show a significant worsening in nonspecific BHR after the MSG challenge sequence, beyond the 95% confidence limits calculated by the method of Bland and Altman from the two preliminary PD20 values&amp;quot; I struggled a little to understand what this meant, so I looked at the original paper. Did you mean to say that the participant experienced symptoms after the 1 g challenge, but not after the 5 g challenge?&lt;span&gt; It is described as this in the fulltext, and we discussed and delete it for not confusing readers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In woods, the participants had a diet that was low in other chemicals perceived to cause asthma symptoms. Do you have any comments on this?&lt;span&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dicussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;what studies are you referring to here? &amp;#160;The doses in studies were 0.3 to 7.5 g (0.3, 1, 2.5, 5, 6, 7.5) ( &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Raiten 1995&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Raiten 1995&lt;/a&gt;). I thought one study had 5 and 1 g and the other 25 mg/kg which would be 1.5 g for a 60 kg person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it correct to say that the studies need to be conducted over a long time period? I thought that Chinese restaurant syndrome would be more of an instantaneous thing i.e. eat high-MSG food, feel bad. Schwartstein suggests that onset of asthma symptoms occurred 11-12 hours after eating MSG according to Allen.&lt;span&gt;yes it enough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There may be more than four reasons why the evidence may be unreliable so I have changed it to several. I am not sure that having the numbers 1 to 4 is helpful. Could you consider changing it back to regular paragraphs, or bullet points?&lt;span&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Characteristics of included studies &lt;/b&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;what is the (5) after ATS referring to or is it a typo?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure what this means: &amp;quot;the authors reported the &amp;quot;worst change&amp;quot; in a figure, but we can find only 11 points after each challenge&amp;quot;. Please clarify.&lt;span&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the table for Woods there is a lot of d1, d2 etc - does this refer to the number of days after challenge? please clarify &lt;span&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;please write something in all boxes in risk of bias table &lt;span&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no need to include so many excluded studies with reasons. You need only include references that you retrieved the full text articles for - can you delete some of them?&lt;span&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-06-04 17:20:50 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="MSG-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.7 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="6.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-02 13:32:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is used as a flavour enhancer and has been implicated in "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome", causing tightness, burning or numbness in the face, neck and upper chest (although there is no evidence to prove this syndrome). It has also been proposed that asthmatics may react badly to MSG. In two randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving 24 adult asthmatics, there was no evidence that MSG worsened asthma when compared to control ingestion. Further RCTs are needed.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-05-02 13:31:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is the sodium salt of the non-essential amino acid, glutamic acid, and is used as a flavour enhancer. It has been implicated in causing adverse reactions, which have been referred to as "Chinese restaurant syndrome". Over the last two decades there have been a number of studies investigating whether MSG ingestion induces an asthmatic response, and several reviews have been published (<A HREF="ilsi 1991">ILSI 1991</A>; <A HREF="stevenson 2000">Stevenson 2000</A>; <A HREF="woods 2001">Woods 2001</A>), but no meta-analysis or Cochrane systematic review has been performed.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-04-30 11:20:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>The objectives of this review are to: 1) identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of MSG ingestion and asthma response in adults and children older than two years of age with asthma; 2) assess the methodological quality of these trials; and 3) determine the effect of MSG ingestion on asthma outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-05-02 14:42:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and bibliographies of existing trials. Searches were current up to May 2012.<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-04-30 11:21:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>We included RCTs that investigated the effect of MSG on chronic asthma in adults and children.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-10 12:08:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently extracted, entered and analysed data from included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information.<BR/>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-05-02 13:31:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only two cross-over studies involving 24 adults met the eligibility criteria; the challenge dosages of MSG were 1 g, 5 g and 25 mg/kg. They reported the number of subjects who had a maximum fall in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) greater than 15% or 200 mL after MSG or the control challenge. The pooled data found no statistically significant difference between MSG and placebo. One trial reported the mean change at four hours and maximum fall in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> over four hours after MSG or the placebo challenge, but found no statistically significant difference between interventions. There were no differences in symptom scores, non-specific bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) or tryptase levels in peripheral blood between MSG and control, although we were unable to perform meta-analyses.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-05-02 13:31:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>The limited evidence available (n = 24) found no significant difference between MSG or the control challenge for the number of subjects who had a maximum fall in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> greater than 15% or 200 mL. There is no evidence to support the avoidance of MSG in adults with chronic asthma, but as data were limited, this review cannot provide a reliable evidence base for determining whether MSG avoidance is a worthwhile strategy. We could not find any studies conducted on the effect of MSG in children with chronic asthma. There is therefore, a need for further RCTs to investigate any relationship between MSG and asthma, especially in children.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-05-09 09:23:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Monosodium glutamate (MSG), a flavour enhancer, is the sodium salt of the non-essential amino acid, glutamic acid. Glutamate is present in almost all proteins, and it plays an essential role in human metabolism as a key component of metabolic cycles<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Filer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filer 1994</LINK>). Because there is no chemical difference between the MSG we find in foods and the MSG manufactured through fermentation by micro-organisms, the effects of MSG on the body are the same.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Kwok-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwok 1968</LINK> originally noted that MSG may cause adverse reactions; he wrote a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine to explain how he felt after eating MSG in a Chinese restaurant. The symptoms were tightness, burning or numbness in the face, neck and upper chest. This syndrome was named "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome". Kwok hypothesised that this syndrome could be due to MSG, sodium or some other unidentified substance. In 1981, Allen and Baker reported two cases of asthma and proposed an association between asthma and MSG (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1981</LINK>). Over the last two decades there have been a number of studies investigating whether MSG ingestion can induce an asthmatic response, but results are conflicting.</P>
<P>Although there are hypotheses about the mechanisms of MSG-induced asthma, for example, mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE; a class of antibody found in mammals) or acetylcholine, findings are inconclusive. <LINK REF="REF-Yoneda-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoneda 2011</LINK> investigated the effects of MSG on bronchial inflammation; they measured cytological, histological and functional changes in an ovalbumin-induced asthma mouse model, but found no acute effects on lung inflammation or airway hyper-responsiveness.</P>
<P>Although there are several narrative reviews on this topic (<LINK REF="REF-ILSI-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILSI 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevenson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stevenson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woods-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2001</LINK>), no meta-analyses have been performed.</P>

<P>We included adults and children older than two years with a diagnosis of asthma. We accepted trialist-defined asthma and recorded both the definition of asthma and the entry criteria used for each trial. We excluded studies on patients with acute asthma or exercise-induced bronchospasm because it is difficult to identify whether the attack of asthma is caused by MSG.

<P>Both studies that met the inclusion criteria were double-blind, randomised, cross-over trials that recruited adult participants (<LINK REF="STD-Schwartzstein-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartzstein 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woods-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 1998</LINK>). Full details of these included studies can be found in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> section.</P>
<P>The purpose of the <LINK REF="STD-Schwartzstein-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartzstein 1987</LINK> trial was to study the effect of oral MSG on airway function in 12 subjects with a history of chronic asthma (diagnosed using criteria from the American Thoracic Society). Participants had a history of food sensitivity, or not, and they were clinically stable. Clincal stability was defined as: 1) no increase in symptoms requiring medical attention within the past month; 2) no participants receiving corticosteroid therapy for at least one month; and 3) being able to discontinue medications for at least 12 hours without adverse effects. The article did not report how the participants were recruited. The participants (eight men and four women) were 22 to 44 years old (mean 28 years), and the mean duration of asthma was 16 years (3 to 30 years). None of the participants used bronchodilators within 12 hours of the challenges. Two participants had a history of milk sensitivity, and only one subject believed that she was MSG-sensitive. Six subjects were receiving bronchodilator therapy on a daily basis. The interventions were MSG (25 mg/kg) versus sodium chloride (equimolar to MSG), given in identical capsules. Subjects fasted for at least six hours prior to study visits. The forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV<SUB>1)</SUB> and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured before and after the challenge for two hours, with a 15-minute interval, and then<B> </B>they were measured every 30 minutes for a further two hours. If at the end of four hours observation, the FEV<SUB>1</SUB> had declined by 10% or more from baseline, measurement of pulmonary function continued at 30-minute intervals for an additional two hours. At the end, subjects were asked whether they had experienced any side effects, 24 to 48 hours after each study day.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The main purpose of the <LINK REF="STD-Woods-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 1998</LINK> trial was to determine if MSG would induce bronchoconstriction in adults with asthma who perceived they were MSG-sensitive. Twelve participants were recruited through The Alfred Hospital Asthma and Allergy Clinic, from patients registered on a computer database, between March 1995 and September 1996. The participants were aged between 19 and 57 years (mean 35.3 years), and seven (58%) of them were female. All of the participants had a history of reversible airway obstruction, however, they had been<B> </B>clinically stable without any change in their regular asthma medications in the past four weeks before the study. The study exclusion criteria were: 1) a previous life-threatening attack of asthma; 2) life-threatening anaphylaxis; 3) females who were pregnant or lactating or 4) a baseline FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>greater than 60% predicted or less than 1.5 L. An elimination diet was commenced after the baseline visit. Subjects continued with their regular inhaled bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory asthma medications<B> </B>during the study period, but they were instructed to withhold their short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>- agonist bronchodilator medication for at least four hours before attending the laboratory on each of the control days<B>. </B>The amount of relief medication and the time it was taken, if required on the control day, was duplicated on the subsequent control and challenge days.<B> </B>The participants received MSG (1 g), MSG (5 g), and placebo (5 g lactose) challenges as single doses on an empty stomach. Subjects received the lower dose (1 g) of MSG before the higher dose (5 g), with the placebo randomly interspersed on separate study days. Spirometry was conducted every 15 minutes, commencing 45 minutes before the challenge. The participants continued to monitor their peak expiratory flow (PEF) and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> at 15, 30, and 45 minutes and regular intervals after each challenge until 12 hours.<B> </B>Symptoms, symptom scores, non-specific bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) and soluble inflammatory marker activity (tryptase and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP)) were also measured.</P>

Two participants experienced a fall in lung function measurement after placebo only, three after both active and placebo treatment, and two to the 1 g MSG challenge only, but not the 5 g MSG challenge. One subject had a greater than 15% fall in spirometry to both high and low doses of MSG, but the change was not statistically significant and the trialists interpreted this as a negative effect. All participants except one experienced a drop of 20% or more of their pre-challenge spirometry measurement, so the authors stated that they "did not find any conclusive evidence of true MSG-induced asthma by using this rigorous method of analysis" (<LINK REF="STD-Woods-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 1998</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-05-02 13:31:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>This review summarises evidence from two small clinical trials assessing the effects of the MSG challenge on short-term physiological, symptomatic and biomarker outcomes. Long-term dietary avoidance has not been addressed in any clinical trials involving asthma patients to date. The evidence from this review, which found no difference in outcomes following MSG or control exposure, does not provide a reliable basis for recommendations on avoidance of MSG.</P>
<P>There are two reasons for this. First of all, only two small trials met the eligibility criteria of the review. The sample sizes of both studies were small and identical in number (n = 12), and the quality of one study was poor. As data from the included studies were limited, no firm conclusions can be drawn from this review regarding the effects of MSG in asthma. Secondly, the participants recruited had been clinically stable; those with a baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of less than 60% predicted were excluded. Therefore, these results cannot be applied to people with severe or unstable asthma, nor children, since both trials recruited only adult patients.</P>
<P>The dose of MSG in studies is reasonable. The average daily MSG intake in Western countries is 0.3 g to 1 g, but it may be as high as 4 g to 6 g in a highly seasoned restaurant meal (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1987</LINK>). The doses in the studies were 0.3 g to 7.5 g (0.3, 1, 2.5, 5, 6, 7.5) (<LINK REF="STD-Raiten-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Raiten 1995</LINK>), and the dosage used most frequently was 2.5 g. The doses used in challenges in the included studies are similar to quantities in meals, which means that it is unlikely that the absence of effect is due to under dosing.</P>
<P>Another limitation of this review is the lack of numerical outcome data on clinical scores such as symptoms, for which we were unable to extract raw data from trials assessing these outcomes.</P>
<P>We did not find any RCTs assessing the effects of MSG in children, so were unable to explore the relationship between childhood asthma and MSG.</P>
<P>Our result is consistent with most clinical (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevenson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stevenson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2009</LINK>) and mechanical (<LINK REF="REF-Yoneda-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoneda 2011</LINK>) studies, and it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-04-30 13:47:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Limited evidence from people with stable chronic asthma did not provide any evidence that MSG could pose a risk. However, this review has not been able to establish the effect of MSG exposure on people with stable chronic asthma, as data were limited by small sample sizes. Because of the lack of data, these results cannot be applied to people with severe or unstable asthma, nor children since both trials recruited only adult patients.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-04-12 19:42:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for large, placebo-controlled randomised trials that would address as many MSG-related symptoms as possible, and researchers should pay attention to other aspects such as psychological factors. There is a need for further studies in children.</P>
