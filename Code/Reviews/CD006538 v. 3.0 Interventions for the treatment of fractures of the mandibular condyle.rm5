<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-15 14:16:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fractures of the condylar process of the mandible (lower jaw) are common. Two treatment options are available: either closed treatment (without surgery) or open reduction (involving surgery). Complications are associated with both treatment modalities. With a closed approach the complications include disturbances in the way the teeth meet, facial asymmetry, chronic pain and reduced mobility of the lower jaw. With an open approach the complications include a scar on the overlying skin and also the possibility of temporary paralysis of the nerve supplying some of the facial muscles involved in smiling and eye opening/closing. Currently there is much controversy regarding the most appropriate method for the management of fractured mandibular condyles. This review revealed that there is a lack of high quality evidence for the effectiveness of either approach, and that there is a need for further research to help clinicians and patients to make informed choices of treatment options.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-19 11:31:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fractures of the condylar process account for between 25% and 35% of all mandibular fractures. Treatment options for fractures of the condyles consist of either the closed method or by open reduction with fixation. Complications may be associated with either treatment option; for the closed approach these can include malocclusion, particularly open bites, reduced posterior facial height and facial asymmetry in addition to chronic pain and reduced mobility. A cutaneous scar and temporary paralysis of the facial nerve are not infrequent complications associated with the open approach. There is a lack of consensus currently surrounding the indications for either surgical or non-surgical treatment of fractures of the mandibular condyle.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-03-15 14:17:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aetiology and incidence</HEADING>
<P>Fractures of the facial bones are very common. The mandible (lower jaw) and zygoma (cheek bone), by nature of their location and anatomy are the two bones most commonly fractured. In the developed world, interpersonal violence is the most common cause of facial fractures; this is often exacerbated by the use of alcohol or illicit drugs.<BR/>The mandible is a unique horse-shoe shaped bone with an identical joint at both ends with the condyle articulating in the glenoid fossa of the middle cranial fossa of the skull. Inherently weak areas of the bone are commonly fractured namely the articular condyle, the angle and the parasymphysis.<BR/>Fractures of the condylar process of the mandible are common, accounting for between 25% and 35% of all mandibular fractures in one reported series (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Classification</HEADING>
<P>There are numerous classifications of fractures of the condylar process of the mandible. They can be classified with respect to fracture level, dislocation at the fracture level, and condylar head relationship to the articular fossa (<LINK REF="REF-Lindahl-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindahl 1977</LINK>). In everyday clinical practice it is the level and degree of displacement of the fracture that is the most relevant.<BR/>Fractures tend to occur at one of three positions: the condylar head (and therefore usually within the joint capsule), high subcondylar (below the condyle and joint capsule but above the sigmoid notch) or low subcondylar where the fracture runs from the sigmoid notch to the posterior aspect of the mandibular ramus.<BR/>A number of factors may influence the degree and the direction of bone displacement in condylar fractures such as the direction of the traumatic force, the position of the mandible during impact, the influence of the lateral pterygoid muscle, and the presence of other fractures in the mandible or in the articular fossa. In some studies it was observed that bone displacements were more frequent in the medial and anterior directions, but other directions were also possible (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-e-Silva-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa e Silva 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The diagnosis of a fracture of the mandibular condyle can be made by clinical and radiographic examinations. Clinical signs, such as bone deflection, difficulty in opening the mouth, malocclusion (particularly open bite of the contralateral side), and oedema in the peripheral region of the auricle, may be indicative of traumatic uni- or bilateral fractures of the mandibular condyle (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-e-Silva-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa e Silva 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>Several factors may determine the treatment decision for these types of fractures, notably the level of the fracture and the degree of displacement. The level of the fracture influences the degree of pre-operative coronal and sagittal displacement (neck fractures have greater medial and anterior displacement than head and subcondylar fractures) and the treatment applied. In some studies the functional improvement, particularly the occlusion, obtained by open methods was greater than that obtained by closed treatment (<LINK REF="REF-De-Riu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Riu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Controversy exists regarding the management of mandibular condyle fractures. At the simplest level there are two treatment options, namely conservative treatment or open reduction with fixation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Conservative management (closed reduction)</HEADING>
<P>There are problems with the definition of conservative management as it can range from absolutely no active intervention to the use of some form of intermaxillary (maxillary-mandibular) fixation or traction. Complications of this method of treatment include malocclusion, particularly open bites, reduced posterior facial height and facial asymmetry, chronic pain and reduced mobility (<LINK REF="REF-Brandt-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandt 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Open reduction and fixation</HEADING>
<P>Most fractures occurring elsewhere in the mandible are openly reduced and fixed usually through intraoral incisions. Although the mandibular condyles can be reached through intraoral incisions, visualisation can only be via endoscopic means. Most open reductions are undertaken via an extraoral incision; either pre-auricular, retromandibular or submandibular. Fixation is achieved by the use of osteosynthesis miniplates, lag screws or pin fixation. Complications of this treatment may include a cutaneous scar and temporary paralysis of the facial nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Brandt-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandt 2003</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>The search retrieved 102 references to studies. After examination of the titles and abstracts of these references, all but 14 were eliminated and excluded from further evaluation.

All of the potentially eligible studies were then subjected to further evaluation which included examination of their bibliographical references but no additional citations to potentially eligible studies were identified.<BR/>Our search also retrieved a relevant meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Nussbaum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nussbaum 2008</LINK>) which had included a study (<LINK REF="STD-Worsaae-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Worsaae 1994</LINK>) that had been previously assessed as ineligible for our review and is listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> section.<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eckelt-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eckelt 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK>) did appear initially to meet our inclusion criteria but after further examination and subsequent confirmation with the investigators it was clear that the study participants and interventions in both studies were identical. However, these studies were eventually excluded because of substantial losses (25%) to follow-up. The investigators provided very few details about these participants, did not report which interventions they were allocated to or the reason for the losses to follow-up or the time during follow-up and data were not analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. We contacted one of the study authors by email but were unsuccessful in obtaining any further information or explanation about the losses to follow-up, further attempts to contact an additional investigator also proved unsuccessful.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-03-15 14:25:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified no high quality trials comparing open with closed reduction of fractures of mandibular condyles. One multicentre randomised controlled trial which was published as <LINK REF="STD-Eckelt-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eckelt 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK> was conducted in Europe and data collected. However, a large number of methodological shortcomings mean the published results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-15 14:24:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One trial published as <LINK REF="STD-Eckelt-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eckelt 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK> met our inclusion criteria, but was subsequently excluded as a result of missing data which we were unable to obtain even after contact with the authors. Therefore no conclusions can be reached about the effectiveness or otherwise of open versus closed treatment of fractures of the mandibular condyle.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-03-15 14:25:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With regards to the <LINK REF="STD-Eckelt-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eckelt 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK> articles the review authors were concerned about the 25% of randomised patients who were lost to follow-up and the analysed data in the study were of the remaining 66 patients. There was no intention-to-treat analysis. Given the high risk of bias and the overall quality of the evidence, no clear decisions can be made about the applicability of the evidence to support the use of one technique over another.</P>
<P>Even if the outcomes assessed in the study had favoured open or closed reduction, there were few patient centred outcomes which will be more important to patients than objective measurements made by a clinician.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-03-15 14:25:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The possibility of bias in the review process cannot be excluded because the one trial which was potentially eligible (<LINK REF="STD-Eckelt-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eckelt 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK>) was, in general methodologically sound, however it was incompletely reported and we were unable to obtain the missing data. If the data had been accessible to us it is likely the trial would have been included and could have potentially added to the evidence base for these interventions.</P>

<P>There is a lack of high quality evidence relevant to interventions considered in this review topic and so the effectiveness of the two interventions considered in this review cannot be ascertained. Therefore, clinical decisions should be based on clinical experience, individual circumstances and in conjunction with patient preferences and choices where appropriate.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-03-15 14:29:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for well conducted randomised controlled clinical trials, these should be designed and reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>). Important consideration should be given to the method of randomisation, justifying sample size, allocation concealment, blinding of the outcome assessor and reasons for patients lost to follow-up should be considered during the planning, conducting and reporting phase of the study. Factors such as quality of life, patient satisfaction levels and costs should also be investigated and reported.</P>
