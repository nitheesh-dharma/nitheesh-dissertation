<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-19 17:30:14 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Very low birth weight preterm infants are often fed through a tube into a vein (parenterally) as adequate growth and nutrition is important for lung and brain development. Early feeding via the gut (enterally) stimulates motility and digestive activity and is associated with improved growth, but this is not always possible. Lactase is an intestinal enzyme that helps digest milk and is slow to develop in preterm infants after birth. Breast milk contains components that help with lactose digestion. Lactose intolerance is often managed in infants born at term with low-lactose or lactose-free formulas, but these do not fulfil the nutrition requirements for preterm infants. Feeding intolerance leaves residual feeds in the stomach prior to the next scheduled feeding and causes abdominal distension, bile stained fluid in the lungs (aspirates), and vomiting. Preparations of lactase could potentially be added to formula or breast milk for preterm infants. There was not a significant effect on weight gain in the one randomized controlled trial identified that investigated addition of lactase. The review authors searched the medical literature thoroughly but found only this one high quality trial enrolling 130 preterm infants. No adverse effects were noted and lactase treated feeds appeared to be well tolerated.</P>

<P>Successful transition from parenteral nutrition to full enteral feedings during the immediate neonatal period is associated with improved growth in preterm infants. Lactase is the last of the major intestinal disaccharidases to develop in preterm infants. Because of inadequate lactase activity, preterm infants are unable to digest lactose. Lactase preparations could potentially be used to hydrolyse lactose in formulas and breast milk to minimize lactose malabsorption in preterm infants.</P>

<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were followed independently by the review authors to assess study quality and report outcomes. Treatment effects, calculated using Review Manager 5, included risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and mean difference (MD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A fixed-effect model was used for meta-analyses. We did not perform heterogeneity tests as only one study was identified.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-19 17:02:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The repeat searches conducted in May 2012 did not identify any additional studies for inclusion. One study enrolling 130 infants of 26 to 34 weeks PMA (mean postnatal age at entry 11 days) was identified and no identified study was excluded. The study was a double blind randomized controlled trial of high quality. Lactase treated feeds were initiated when enteral feedings provided &gt; 75% of daily intake. None of the primary outcomes outlined in the protocol for this review and only one of the secondary outcomes, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) were reported on. The RR for NEC was 0.32 (95% CI 0.01 to 7.79); the RD was -0.02 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.03) (a reduction which was not statistically significant). There was a statistically significant increase in weight gain at study day 10 in the lactase treated feeds group but not at any other time points. Overall, there was not a statistically significant effect on weight gain. No adverse effects were noted.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-19 17:30:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The only randomized trial to date provides no evidence of significant benefit to preterm infants from adding lactase to their feeds. Further research regarding effectiveness and safety are required before practice recommendations can be made. Randomized controlled trials comparing lactase versus placebo treated feeds and enrolling infants when enteral feeds are introduced are required. The primary and secondary outcomes for effectiveness and safety should include those identified in this review.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-02-18 15:28:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Successful transition from parenteral nutrition to full enteral feedings during the immediate neonatal period is associated with improved growth outcomes in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ehrenkranz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrenkranz 1999</LINK>). Adequate growth and nutrition in this population has been shown to be closely linked to outcomes such as chronic lung disease and neurodevelopment, and has implications for future adult health (<LINK REF="REF-Hack-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 2003</LINK>). Early postnatal nutrition in the very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infant is primarily supported parenterally, but this does little to support the function of the gastrointestinal tract. Early enteral feedings are beneficial to the gastrointestinal tract because of their trophic effects, positive effect on motility, and stimulation of gastrointestinal hormone secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Berseth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berseth 1995</LINK>). However, studies have shown that full enteral feeds are not established in critically ill VLBW preterm infants until an average of 30 days of age (<LINK REF="REF-Shulman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ehrenkranz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrenkranz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steward-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steward 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the primary setbacks to establishing full enteral feeds in preterm infants is feeding intolerance. This presents clinically as residual feeds in the stomach prior to the next scheduled feeding, sometimes associated with abdominal distension, bile stained aspirates, or emesis. Consequences of feeding difficulties include withholding of feedings, reductions in the amount of feeding, and the need for repeated abdominal radiographs to rule out the possibility that the feeding intolerance is related to necrotizing enterocolitis. In addition, the slow advancement of enteral feeding often leads to prolonged use of parenteral nutrition which predisposes these infants to nosocomial infections, hepatic dysfunction, and prolonged hospitalizations (<LINK REF="REF-Schanler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schanler 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-02-19 17:31:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lactose intolerance is often managed with low-lactose or lactose-free formulas (<LINK REF="REF-Sinden-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinden 1991</LINK>). However, these formulas - developed for term infants - do not meet the requirements for growth and development of the preterm infant (<LINK REF="REF-NCCPS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCPS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>). In the adult and paediatric population, lactose malabsorption is often treated with commercial lactase preparations. The recommended technique of lactase supplementation suggested by the manufacturer of commercially available lactase is to store milk with added enzyme (crushed tablet or drops of liquid) for 24 hours in the refrigerator before its use (<LINK REF="REF-PDR-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">PDR 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Commercial lactase preparations can be used to hydrolyse lactose in formulas and breast milk to minimize lactose malabsorption in preterm infants. The concern, however, is that the addition of lactase enzyme following the manufacturer-recommended 24-hour incubation period can increase osmolality to levels that exceed current guidelines for preterm infant feedings. There is evidence that hyperosmolar solutions may place the preterm population at higher risk for development of necrotizing enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Book-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Book 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willis-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willis 1977</LINK>). The 24-hour incubation period has also raised concerns regarding bacterial contamination of milk (<LINK REF="REF-Malone-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malone 1999</LINK>) which has been shown to occur within eight hours in an unsterile environment (<LINK REF="REF-White-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1979</LINK>). This lengthy incubation, which results in near elimination of lactose, may not be necessary for the purpose of improving feeding tolerance in the preterm infant. Studies have demonstrated that incubating milk with lactase for 15 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius was sufficient to accomplish over half of the 24-hour digestion (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2002</LINK>) and minimize the rise in osmolality to levels that are still within current guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Carlson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlson 1991</LINK>).<BR/>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-06-19 15:20:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Enhanced endogenous lactase activity is associated with improved feeding tolerance in preterm infants, with a decrease in the time to transition to full enteral feeds (<LINK REF="REF-Shulman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulman 1998</LINK>). Breast milk, shown to be better tolerated by preterm infants, induces higher lactase activity than formula (<LINK REF="REF-Shulman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulman 1998</LINK>). Direct and indirect trophic effects of minimal enteral nutrition in the early postnatal period demonstrated by human and animal studies can be related to its effects of increasing intestinal lactase activity (<LINK REF="REF-Shulman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McClure-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClure 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Detection bias</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention.) Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods used with regards to detection bias as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk - adequate; follow-up was performed with assessors blinded to group;</LI>
<LI>high risk - inadequate; assessors at follow-up were aware of group assignment;assignment;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Attrition bias</HEADING>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods with respect to the risk attrition bias as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk - adequate (&lt; 10% missing data);</LI>
<LI>high risk - inadequate (&gt; 10% missing data);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk - adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk - inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no or unclear information provided (the study protocol was not available).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other bias</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk - no concerns of other bias raised;</LI>
<LI>high risk - concerns raised about multiple looks at the data with the results made known to the investigators, difference in number of patients enrolled in abstract and final publications of the paper;</LI>
<LI>unclear - concerns raised about potential sources of bias that could not be verified by contacting the authors.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.<BR/>

<P>The statistical analyses followed the recommendations of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. A mean treatment effect was calculated using RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). The statistical methods included risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes. All estimates of treatment effects are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analyses. We did not plan additional sensitivity analyses a priori but exploratory (post-hoc) analyses were to be performed depending on the results of the review. We did not plan any subgroup analyses. We included outcomes reported by the authors but these outcomes had not been included in our protocol.</P>

<P>The repeat search of the literature in May 2012 did not identify any additional trials for inclusion. The literature search did not identify any study that was later excluded. One study enrolling 130 preterm infants in a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in one neonatal intensive care unit in Canada between April 1997 and July 2000 was identified. For further details see the table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'. The inclusion criteria were 26 weeks to 34 weeks PMA at birth, &#8805; 75% estimated energy requirement from enteral feeds, absence of major congenital malformations or gastrointestinal diseases, including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and no postnatal steroids or diuretics. Small, appropriate and large for PMA infants were eligible for the study. The study intervention started when enteral feedings provided &gt; 75% of the daily intake and was terminated when the infant reached 36 weeks or was discharged from the unit, whichever came first. Infants randomly assigned to the 'lactase treated feeds group' received feeds treated with Lactacid drops (McNeil Consumer Products Company). According to a previous study by Carlson et al (<LINK REF="REF-Carlson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlson 1991</LINK>) this would result in a 70% decrease in lactose concentration (from 35.3 to 10.3 grams/kg) after a two-hour incubation period. A study placebo solution composed of the identical carrier agent as in Lactacid was used in the control group. The enzyme and matched placebo solutions were packaged in identical bottles labelled "lactase study drops" and were identifiable only by the research nurse according to assigned code numbers. Researchers and care givers remained blinded for the duration of the study. The primary outcome measure was weight gain (grams/day) measured at study day seven, 10, 14 and at study exit. Additional outcomes included gains in length and head circumference; serum concentrations of protein, albumin, sodium and potassium; and measurements of feeding tolerance. In addition withdrawal from the study because of feeding intolerance or NEC was recorded.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2013-02-19 17:10:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Arne  Ohlsson">
<P>Although not clearly stated by the authors, we assumed that there was concealed allocation of the infants to one of the two groups. The authors write "...only the research nurse and central food production staff had access to randomization information and did not participate in patient care". Of the 66 infants randomly assigned to the lactase group 52 reached study day 14. Of the 64 infants randomly assigned to the control group 50 reached study day 14. The average (mean ± standard error of the mean) length of the study in the lactase group was 24.1 ± 1.7 days and in the placebo group 25.7 ± 1.9 days. None of the important primary outcomes that we had identified in the protocol and only one secondary outcome (the incidence of NEC) were reported on. The protocol for the study was not available to us. A sample size calculation was performed to allow for a 33% increase in mean weight gain per day in the treatment group, with a power of 0.80. However, it is unclear if the authors had decided a priori at what points in time after study entry to measure growth.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-02-19 17:20:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Arne  Ohlsson">
<P>The repeat search of the literature in May 2012 did not identify any additional trials for inclusion. To date, only one study has been included in this review and no identified studies have been excluded. The included study enrolled 130 infants of approximately 31 weeks PMA at around 11 days of age, when they were tolerating &#8805; 75% of enteral feeds. The study was of high quality but none of the predetermined primary outcomes in our protocol for this review were reported on. Only one of the secondary outcomes (NEC) was reported on. The authors reported on growth at seven, 10 and 14 days after study entry and at exit from the study. It is uncertain whether the time points for measuring growth were predetermined. None of these individual analyses can be interpreted as showing a significant effect on weight gain. There was a statistically significant increase in serum albumin on study day 14 or at study exit if this occurred earlier. There were no serious side effects reported. Lactase treated feeds appear to be well tolerated by preterm infants of approximately 31 weeks PMA at initiation of treatment. Further studies should include the most immature preterm infants (24 to 25 weeks PMA) as the lactase levels in the intestinal tract are even lower in that group of infants. Likewise in future studies lactase should be introduced at the initiation of enteral feeds to confer a potentially greater benefit. The studies need to be of adequate sample size to confirm the potential effectiveness of lactase treated feeds.</P>
