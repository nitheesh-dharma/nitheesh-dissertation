<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Alarm interventions for nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) in children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Night-time bedwetting is common in childhood, and can cause stigma, stress and inconvenience. The review of trials found 56 studies involving 3257 children. Alarm interventions reduce night-time bed wetting in about two thirds of children during treatment, and about half the children remained dry after stopping using the alarm. Alarms take longer to reduce bedwetting than desmopressin, but their effects continue after treatment in half the children who use alarms. So alarms are better in the long term than treatment with desmopressin or tricyclic drugs. Overlearning (giving children extra fluids at bedtime after successfully becoming dry using an alarm) and dry bed training (getting children to go to the toilet repeatedly and changing their own sheets when they wet) may reduce the relapse rate. There are no serious side-effects, which can occur with drug treatment. However, children need more supervision and time from other family members at first. There was not enough evidence with which to compare alarms with other non-drug treatments. Because some of the studies were of poor quality, better research comparing alarms with other treatments is needed, including follow-up to measure relapse rates. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially disruptive and stressful condition which affects around 15 to 20% of five year olds, and up to 2% of young adults. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of alarm interventions on nocturnal enuresis in children, and to compare alarms with other interventions.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 28 February 2007) and the reference lists of relevant articles. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of alarm interventions for nocturnal enuresis in children were included, except those focused solely on daytime wetting. Comparison interventions included no treatment, simple and complex behavioural methods, desmopressin, tricyclics, and miscellaneous other methods.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fifty six trials met the inclusion criteria, involving 3257 children of whom 2412 used an alarm. The quality of many trials was poor, and evidence for many comparisons was inadequate. Most alarms used audio methods.</P>
<P>Compared to no treatment, about two thirds of children became dry during alarm use (RR for failure 0.38, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.45). Nearly half who persisted with alarm use remained dry after treatment finished, compared to almost none after no treatment (RR of failure or relapse 45 of 81 (55%) versus 80 of 81 (99%), RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.68). There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about different types of alarm, or about how alarms compare to other behavioural interventions. Relapse rates were lower when overlearning was added to alarm treatment (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.92) or if dry bed training was used as well (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.20). Penalties for wet beds appeared to be counter-productive. Alarms using electric shocks were unacceptable to children or their parents.</P>
<P>Although desmopressin may have a more immediate effect, alarms appeared to be as effective by the end of a course of treatment (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.37) but their relative effectiveness after stopping treatment was unclear from two small trials which compared them directly. Evidence about the benefit of supplementing alarm treatment with desmopressin was conflicting. Alarms were not significantly better than tricyclics during treatment (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.09) but the relapse rate was less afterwards (7 of 12 (58%) versus 12 of 12 (100%), RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.94). However, other Cochrane reviews of desmopressin and tricyclics suggest that drug treatment alone, while effective for some children during treatment, is unlikely to be followed by sustained cure as almost all the children relapse. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Alarm interventions are an effective treatment for nocturnal bedwetting in children. Alarms appear more effective than desmopressin or tricyclics because around half the children remain dry after alarm treatment stops. Overlearning (giving extra fluids at bedtime after successfully becoming dry using an alarm), dry bed training and avoiding penalties may further reduce the relapse rate. Better quality research comparing alarms with other treatments is needed, including follow-up to determine relapse rates. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-10 12:28:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is one of seven reviews of interventions for bedwetting, or non-organic nocturnal enuresis. The others focus on: desmopressin (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2002</LINK>), tricyclics and related drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2003a</LINK>), other drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2003b</LINK>), simple behavioural training (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004b</LINK>), complex behavioural training (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004b</LINK>) and complementary and miscellaneous other interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2005b</LINK>). All seven are based on the work of Lister-Sharp and her colleagues at the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York, UK (<LINK REF="REF-Lister_x002d_Sharp-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lister-Sharp 1997</LINK>). The current review is a further update of previously published Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2003c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2005a</LINK>). It concerns the use of alarms triggered by wetting (e.g. pad-and-bell alarms) to waken the child. It is restricted to children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis who are treated with an alarm triggered by wetting, and includes other interventions if they are compared with such alarms or used in combination with them.</P>
<P>Nocturnal enuresis is the involuntary loss of urine at night, in the absence of organic (physical) disease such as urinary tract infection or detrusor overactivity, at an age when a child could reasonably be expected to be dry (by consensus, at a developmental age of five years) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Although bedwetting in itself is pathologically benign and has a high rate of spontaneous remission, it may bring social and emotional stigma, stress and inconvenience to both the person with enuresis and their families (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzwater-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzwater 1992</LINK>). Children who wet the bed may experience parental disapproval, sibling teasing and repeated treatment failure which may lower self esteem (<LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1992</LINK>). The children may also be at increased risk of emotional and physical abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1992</LINK>). Consequently, it is important that enuresis is properly managed (<LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although daytime wetting is a significant problem and is often associated with bedwetting, it is usually considered separately. It has been suggested that there are different aetiologies underlying monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and daytime wetting (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvelin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvelin 1989</LINK>). If daytime symptoms are present, investigations to identify physical causes such as urinary tract dysfunction, congenital malformation and neurogenic disorders are usually necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Djurhuus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djurhuus 1992</LINK>). An organic cause is more often found in children with daytime wetting; for example more structural abnormalities and functional disorders of the urinary tract are found in daytime wetters than controls (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvelin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvelin 1990</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevalences and causes</HEADING>
<P>Nocturnal enuresis is a complaint that affects many families. Estimating the prevalence of monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis is difficult, however, because there is variation in methods of diagnosis and definitions (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jonge-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jonge 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krantz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krantz 1994</LINK>). About 13 to 19% of boys and 9 to 16% of girls at age five wet the bed at least once per month (<LINK REF="REF-Devlin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devlin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feehan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feehan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhulst-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhulst 1985</LINK>). Although enuresis shows a steady decline with age, 2 to 3% still wet regularly during the late teens and early adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Forsythe-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsythe 1974</LINK>). The incidence of nocturnal enuresis is particularly high amongst children in residential care (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1970</LINK>). Without treatment, about 15% of bedwetting children become dry each year (<LINK REF="REF-Forsythe-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsythe 1974</LINK>). However, it is not possible to predict which children will become dry spontaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Doleys-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doleys 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>The causes of monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis are unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Lister_x002d_Sharp-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lister-Sharp 1997</LINK>). Genetic (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bakwin-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakwin 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bakwin-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakwin 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eiberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eiberg 1995</LINK>), physiological (<LINK REF="REF-Djurhuus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djurhuus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norgaard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norgaard 1993</LINK>) and psychological (<LINK REF="REF-Devlin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devlin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaffer-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffer 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 1989</LINK>) factors, as well as delay in maturation of the mechanism for bladder control (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvelin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvelin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koff-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koff 1995</LINK>), have been suggested. Other factors which may contribute to bedwetting include: constipation, sleep apnoea and upper airway obstructive symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Maizels-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maizels 1993</LINK>); and diet and mild caffeine drinks with diuretic effects (e.g. cola) (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwell 1989</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Pharmacological, psychological/behavioural and a variety of 'unconventional' interventions are commonly used for people who wet the bed.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Pharmacological interventions include desmopressin (Glazener 2002), tricyclic drugs (amitriptyline, dothiepin, doxepin, trimipramine, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, lofepramine, nortriptyline and protriptyline, <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2003a</LINK>), drugs related to the tricyclics (viloxazine, desipramine, mianserin and maprotiline, <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2003a</LINK>), and a variety of other drugs (e.g. amphetamine, diazepam and oxybutynin, <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2003b</LINK>). These are discussed in separate reviews as indicated.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>Behavioural interventions include simple methods (e.g. star charts, reward systems, overlearning, retention control training, urine stream interruption exercises, lifting and scheduled wakening, <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004b</LINK>), and complex (multidimensional) behavioural methods (e.g. dry bed training, full spectrum home training, <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004a</LINK>).</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Enuresis alarms</HEADING>
<P>Enuresis alarms consist of some kind of alarm which is activated by micturition. The first enuresis alarms were bed-based, the child sleeping on a pad or mat containing an electrical circuit (<LINK REF="REF-Mowrer-1938" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowrer 1938</LINK>). Urine, coming into contact with this would complete the circuit causing a bell to ring. Historically, some alarms worked by giving an electric stimulus or shock to the children's skin. The alarm is intended to change the meaning of the sensation of having a full bladder from a signal to urinate to a signal to inhibit urination and waken (<LINK REF="REF-Forsythe-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsythe 1989</LINK>). There are now many variations: the alarm may be a bell, buzzer, a visual signal such as a light or it may vibrate. There are also many different tones and intensities, and the alarm may be set to operate only intermittently or after an interval. In 'mini-alarm' systems, the sensor is placed in pants, producing a discrete, portable system ('body-worn' alarm).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overlearning</HEADING>
<P>An over-learning procedure may be initiated after successful alarm treatment (e.g. achievement of 14 consecutive dry nights). Extra drinks are given at bed-time to cause additional stress to the detrusor muscles in the bladder. Alarm treatment is then continued until 14 consecutive dry nights are once again achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwell 1989</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other behavioural interventions</HEADING>
<P>These include:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Lifting</HEADING>
<P>Lifting involves taking the child to the toilet during the night to empty their bladder, usually before the time that bedwetting is expected, without necessarily waking the child.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Waking</HEADING>
<P>This intervention involves waking the child to allow them to get up and urinate (<LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1994</LINK>). A scheduled waking programme may be used with the child being woken progressively earlier after dry nights until the interval between going to bed and scheduled waking is one hour. Older individuals may use an alarm clock to wake themselves (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwell 1989</LINK>). However, the use of an alarm clock in this circumstance is not included as an alarm triggered by bedwetting as defined in this review.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Reward systems (e.g. star chart)</HEADING>
<P>Systems to reward the child for dry nights are often used as first line treatment. For example, the child might receive a star for every dry night, and a reward after a preset number of stars have been earned.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Retention control training</HEADING>
<P>This is an attempt to increase the functional bladder capacity using exercises such as delaying urination for extended periods of time or drinking increased fluids (<LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1994</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stop-start training</HEADING>
<P>Stream interruption exercises (pelvic floor muscle training) have also been used (<LINK REF="REF-Novello-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novello 1987</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dry bed training</HEADING>
<P>Dry bed training was initially developed in the early 1970s for use with people with learning disabilities (<LINK REF="STD-Azrin-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Azrin 1973</LINK>). The original schedule involved an intensive training night, during which the patient was woken every hour and taken to the toilet. If an accident occurred, 45 minutes of 'cleanliness training' (changing the bed) and 'positive practice' (child practices getting up and going to the toilet about nine times) was implemented. On subsequent nights, the individual was woken once and taken to the toilet, this nightly wakening occurring progressively earlier. The wakening might or might not be triggered by an alarm.</P>
<P>Other (miscellaneous) interventions in the current review include: cognitive therapy, psychotherapy, counselling, education/information systems, restricted diet and shaming. These are described in the Table of Included Studies.</P>
<P>The wide variety of treatments for nocturnal enuresis indicates the lack of consensus as to which is the best. Provided that a sufficient number of adequate quality have been conducted, the most reliable evidence is likely to come from consideration of all well-designed randomised controlled trials. Hence, there is a need for an easily accessible, periodically updated, comprehensive systematic review of such studies which will not only help to identify optimal practice, but also highlight gaps in the evidence base.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of alarms for the treatment of children with nocturnal enuresis. </P>
<P>The following hypotheses were tested:<BR/>1. alarms are better than no active treatment/non-functioning alarms;<BR/>2. one type of alarm is better than another one;<BR/>3. alarm treatment alone is better than a behavioural intervention alone;<BR/>4. alarm treatment alone is better than alarm treatment supplemented by a behavioural method;<BR/>5. alarm treatment alone is better than a drug treatment alone or better than alarm treatment supplemented by a drug; <BR/>6. alarm treatment alone is better than treatments other than behavioural or drugs.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Identification of primary studies</HEADING>
<P>The titles and where possible abstracts of all studies located by the searches were checked to identify those likely to be evaluations of the effects of interventions for nocturnal enuresis. Full papers were then obtained and assessed to identify those which met the inclusion criteria.</P>

<LI>the level of concealment of random allocation in the trials (A=adequate method of concealment of allocation to groups, B=unclear, C=quasi-randomised, <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2006</LINK>);</LI>

<P>
<BR/>However, none of these criteria were used to include or exclude trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>The data were extracted using a standard form, independently by two review authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Where appropriate, the results were converted to the mean and standard deviation of the number of WET nights per WEEK, or the number of children failing to achieve cure during treatment, defined as 14 consecutive dry nights, or the number who were not cured during treatment plus those who relapsed after stopping active treatment (to allow for possible differences in initial 'success' rates). Where a mean value was reported with no standard deviation, we entered the data into 'Other Data Tables'.</P>
<P>We intended, where possible, to calculate standardised effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CI): weighted mean differences (WMD) where outcomes were continuous variables and relative risks (RR) where they were binary. A fixed effect model was used to calculate the pooled estimates and the 95% CIs (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1989</LINK>). The weighted mean differences were weighted by the inverse of the variance, and given as differences in number of wet nights per week. Negative values indicate fewer wet nights in the group on the left of the MetaView.</P>
<P>Differences between trials were further investigated when statistically significant heterogeneity was apparent either at the 10% probability level, using the chi squared test or assessment of the I-squared statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), or from visual inspection of the results. If there was no obvious reason for the heterogeneity, or it persisted despite the removal of outlying trials, a random effects model was used.</P>
<P>Crossover trials were marked with the suffix '#'. Data from the one trial identified were entered into 'Other Data Tables'.</P>
<P>In general, dropouts were not taken into account and data were presented as given in the trial reports. However, if there were evidence of differential dropouts from the groups which may have been caused by adverse effects of the interventions, the data were recalculated as if the dropouts were failures.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-08-20 11:00:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eighty four studies were identified as including an alarm intervention. Thirty were excluded, the majority because they were not randomised controlled trials. Three of these 30 were RCTs which included an adult population (<LINK REF="STD-Azrin-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Azrin 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crisp-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Crisp 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hanson 1988</LINK>) and one other was excluded because children were switched between groups (<LINK REF="STD-McConaghy-1969" TYPE="STUDY">McConaghy 1969</LINK>). One of these trials was an 'included study' in a previous version of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Hanson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hanson 1988</LINK>). Details are given in the Table of Excluded Studies.</P>
<P>Fifty six randomised controlled trials were included in the review (see Table of Included Studies). They were described in 52 reports (three reports each described two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bollard-1981a" TYPE="STUDY">Bollard 1981a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bollard-1981b" TYPE="STUDY">Bollard 1981b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butler-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butler-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geffken-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Geffken 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geffken-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Geffken 1986b</LINK>), and one described three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lovibond-1964a" TYPE="STUDY">Lovibond 1964a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lovibond-1964b" TYPE="STUDY">Lovibond 1964b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lovibond-1964c" TYPE="STUDY">Lovibond 1964c</LINK>)). One study (reported here as two separate trials) divided children into two groups according to their baseline maximal functional bladder capacity, large or small (<LINK REF="STD-Geffken-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Geffken 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geffken-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Geffken 1986b</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trials with methodological flaws</HEADING>
<P>Two included trials failed to provide reliable data, one because groups were combined and results reported only as medians for the combined groups (<LINK REF="STD-Azrin-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Azrin 1974</LINK>) and the other because children who dropped out from the alarm groups (due to inability to use the alarm or family disruption) were replaced by other children resulting in non-randomised groups and unreliable data (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1970</LINK>). No data from these trials have been used in the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>The trials all included an alarm which activated a bell or buzzer when triggered by wetting. In the majority, this was the standard bed-pad-and-bell but variations included body-worn alarms (<LINK REF="STD-Butler-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1990a</LINK>) and electric shock alarms (<LINK REF="STD-Elinder-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Elinder 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hojsgaard-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hojsgaard 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lovibond-1964a" TYPE="STUDY">Lovibond 1964a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKendry-1975" TYPE="STUDY">McKendry 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Netley-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Netley 1984</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Numbers of children </HEADING>
<P>In total, 3257 children were studied, of whom 2412 received an alarm intervention either alone or in combination with another treatment. In general, sample sizes were small, ranging from 14 to 222 with an average of about 57 participants per trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Duration of treatment</HEADING>
<P>Duration of treatment varied amongst the trials: alarms were used for between two and eight weeks in 16 trials, eight to 12 weeks in 18 trials, and for more than 12 weeks in 22 trials. However, children usually stopped earlier than the maximum allowed duration of treatment if they became dry.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Baseline wetting, organic causes and daytime wetting</HEADING>
<P>In 14 trials, there was no period of baseline recording of wetting before beginning the trial. In seven trials, authors failed to report that children with a possible organic cause for their bedwetting were excluded. In one of these seven, neither of these measures of quality (baseline wetting or exclusion of organic causes) were recorded (<LINK REF="STD-Forrester-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Forrester 1964</LINK>). Of the seven trials where organic causes were not specifically excluded, two included some children with daytime wetting (<LINK REF="STD-Caceres-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Caceres 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 1987</LINK>), three failed to record information about daytime wetting (<LINK REF="STD-Forrester-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Forrester 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Houts-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Houts 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Londen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">van Londen 1993</LINK>) and only two explicitly excluded children whose primary problem was daytime wetting (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lynch-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 1984</LINK>). However, no trials included children with known organic causes.</P>
<P>In 19 trials, children with diurnal (daytime as well as nighttime) wetting were specifically excluded. Six trials included at least some children with daytime wetting (<LINK REF="STD-Bradbury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bradbury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caceres-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Caceres 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibb-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gibb 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKendry-1975" TYPE="STUDY">McKendry 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1975</LINK>) although in three, organic causes were specifically excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Bradbury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bradbury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKendry-1975" TYPE="STUDY">McKendry 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1975</LINK>). Another included diurnal wetting 'only if negligible' (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1985</LINK>). One trial included some children who also had encopresis (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1975</LINK>). The remaining trials did not mention daytime wetting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Follow up</HEADING>
<P>Of the 56 included studies, only 29 trials provided follow-up data about wet nights or relapse rates after the end of trial treatment. In some trials follow up was not possible because children were given alternative (non-randomised) treatments.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Settings</HEADING>
<P>The children were recruited in different settings. In six trials, they were identified from the community by advertising in the media; in 18 they were recruited in hospital or community outpatient clinics; in four both methods were used; three trials were in residential institutions (<LINK REF="STD-Jehu-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Jehu 1977</LINK>) or amongst children with special needs (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sloop-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Sloop 1973</LINK>); and in 22 the setting was not specified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ages of children</HEADING>
<P>Most trials required children to be at least five years old at entry, but in six trials a few younger children were included (<LINK REF="STD-Azrin-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Azrin 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Azrin-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Azrin 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jehu-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Jehu 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1972</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Previous treatment</HEADING>
<P>In four trials, children were only included if they had not previously had treatment for their enuresis (<LINK REF="STD-Butler-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faraj-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Faraj 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sloop-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Sloop 1973</LINK>); in another four, all the children had failed with previous treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Butler-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caceres-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Caceres 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibb-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gibb 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scholander-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Scholander 1968</LINK>); in a further 16 trials some children had received previous treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Bollard-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Bollard 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bradbury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bradbury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butler-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elinder-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Elinder 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fielding-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Fielding 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jehu-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Jehu 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leebeek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leebeek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longstaffe-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Longstaffe 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motavalli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Motavalli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nawaz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nawaz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sukhai-1989-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Sukhai 1989 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tobias-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tobias 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wille-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wille 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1972</LINK>); the remainder did not provide this information.</P>

<P>Of the 56 included trials, nine reported concealment of allocation to groups which was probably adequate (e.g. by use of sealed opaque envelopes or remote computer allocation, rated as A: <LINK REF="STD-Azrin-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Azrin 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bradbury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bradbury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leebeek-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leebeek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Longstaffe-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Longstaffe 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Motavalli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Motavalli 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scholander-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Scholander 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sukhai-1989-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Sukhai 1989 #</LINK>); 39 trials did not provide adequate detail for this to be assessed (rated as B); and seven used methods where allocation definitely was not adequately concealed (i.e. quasi-randomised such as alternate numbers, rated as C: <LINK REF="STD-Butler-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butler-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werry-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Werry 1965</LINK>). In one further trial, although the initial randomisation was classed as A and stratified by age and sex, there were differential dropouts from the groups and they were non-systematically replaced resulting in unreliable groups (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1970</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Crossover trials</HEADING>
<P>There was one double-blind cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sukhai-1989-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Sukhai 1989 #</LINK>). An alarm in both arms of the trial was supplemented by desmopressin or placebo for two weeks, crossing over to the alternative arm after a two-week washout period. Follow-up information could therefore not be given separately for each regimen.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dropouts</HEADING>
<P>Only three trials reported that there were no dropouts (<LINK REF="STD-Scholander-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Scholander 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sukhai-1989-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Sukhai 1989 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 1985</LINK>). Where the drop-out rates in treatment and comparison groups were similar and no reasons were given, or where children randomised were found ineligible or did not attend for initial monitoring, analyses were conducted according to actual results reported, excluding drop-outs. There were 28 such trials, in which dropouts did not seem to be affected by group of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bollard-1981a" TYPE="STUDY">Bollard 1981a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butler-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butler-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butler-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elinder-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Elinder 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faraj-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Faraj 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fielding-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Fielding 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forrester-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Forrester 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fournier-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fournier 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geffken-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Geffken 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geffken-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Geffken 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Houts-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Houts 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jehu-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Jehu 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolvin-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Kolvin 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lovibond-1964a" TYPE="STUDY">Lovibond 1964a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lynch-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Netley-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Netley 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werry-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Werry 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 1974</LINK>). In one other trial, the number of dropouts was unclear because each was replaced with a subsequent child seen in the clinic (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1975</LINK>) but as this did not seem to be affected by the intervention allocated, the data have been used as reported.</P>
<P>However, where reasons for drop-out were reported as clearly related to the treatment group (e.g. unacceptability of the particular treatment, adverse effects) they were included as failures. There were three trials which reported such differential dropouts from the groups, probably caused by adverse effects of the interventions. In the first two, data were reported as if the dropouts were failures (<LINK REF="STD-Bollard-1981b" TYPE="STUDY">Bollard 1981b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKendry-1975" TYPE="STUDY">McKendry 1975</LINK>). In the other, children were differentially withdrawn from treatment, making the groups unreliable: data were not used from this study (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1970</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dropouts were usually due to: children not being sufficiently enuretic at baseline assessment or found not to be eligible in other ways for the trial; failure to attend for monitoring or follow up; receiving the wrong intervention; non-compliance or difficulty with using the equipment; family disruption; failure of the treatment; and in the case of the alarms which delivered electric shocks, the parents or the child being unwilling to experience the shocks (<LINK REF="STD-Elinder-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Elinder 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lovibond-1964a" TYPE="STUDY">Lovibond 1964a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKendry-1975" TYPE="STUDY">McKendry 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Netley-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Netley 1984</LINK>).</P>

After exclusion of two trials which involved children in residential homes (<LINK REF="STD-Jehu-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Jehu 1977</LINK>) or with learning disabilities (<LINK REF="STD-Sloop-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Sloop 1973</LINK>) and a further three trials which used quasi-randomised methods of allocation to groups (<LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werry-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Werry 1965</LINK>) the heterogeneity was reduced but still significant (P equals 0.013) while the RR for failure remained similar in favour of alarm treatment (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.44). The remaining heterogeneity may have been due to differences in types or effectiveness of the alarms used (as the children in all the control groups had a similar failure rate of over 90%) or differences between types of children for example in baseline severity of wetting. It is more likely, however, that the heterogeneity is a statistical artefact caused by the high proportion of children who failed, because the heterogeneity disappears if the data are entered as cure rates instead of failure rates.</P>
<P>Only three trials involved delayed or unsupervised alarms, but the net effect was still generally in favour of the alarm group during treatment (Comparisons 01.03.02, 01.03.03, Other Data Tables 01.02.02, 01.02.03) (<LINK REF="STD-Bollard-1981a" TYPE="STUDY">Bollard 1981a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lynch-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 1985</LINK>).</P>

There was statistically significant heterogeneity (P equals 0.0007).

Excluding this trial removed the statistical heterogeneity but also the significant difference in the chance of failure (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30): however, both remaining trials used quasi-randomised methods of allocation to groups (<LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werry-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Werry 1965</LINK>).</P>

The adverse events or side effects included: alarm failure; false alarms; fright; failing to wake the child; and waking others causing family disruption. A vibrating alarm was reported to be uncomfortable (<LINK REF="STD-Tobias-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tobias 2001</LINK>), and in a drug trial one headache and one nosebleed were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Gibb-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gibb 2004</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-10 12:26:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review updates two previous versions (<LINK REF="REF-Lister_x002d_Sharp-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lister-Sharp 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2001</LINK>). In the previous update, 20 new trials were added, as were 12 trials which were previously included only in sensitivity analyses. The 12 previously excluded trials had failed to report on either baseline wetting or exclusion of organic causes, but it was decided to include them in this update as they were otherwise properly randomised controlled trials. In the current update, three new trials were added.</P>
<P>Data for several important outcomes were only reported in single small trials (such as failure and relapse rates following alarm treatment compared to desmopressin treatment, <LINK REF="STD-Wille-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Wille 1986</LINK>). The sample sizes were generally small. The lack of a sufficiently large sample can result in failure to detect a real treatment difference (because the confidence intervals are wide), or conversely, finding an exaggerated difference to be statistically significant by chance.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of randomisation and follow-up data</HEADING>
<P>Amongst the 53 included trials, the method of concealment of allocation to groups was only of good methodological quality in eight trials. Seven others used a suboptimal (quasi-randomised) method of randomisation. Only 26 of the 53 included trials provided longer term results after treatment was finished. This is a serious shortcoming of the research, as continued effectiveness is the main aim of treatment. However, in some cases, it reflected the clinical situation in which families whose children continue to wet the bed ask for alternative treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Differential dropout</HEADING>
<P>In three trials, dropout rates were different from different trial arms. In two trials, drop-out was related to unacceptability of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Bollard-1981b" TYPE="STUDY">Bollard 1981b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKendry-1975" TYPE="STUDY">McKendry 1975</LINK>). In these trials, dropouts have been counted as failures. In a third trial, trial data were not used in analyses because children were switched between groups, making the data unreliable (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1970</LINK>). In the remaining trials, dropout rates were evenly distributed amongst the trial arms and results excluded dropouts. The meta-analyses also excluded dropouts in these cases.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Organic causes and daytime wetting</HEADING>
<P>It is likely that the underlying pathologies of night-only (monosymptomatic) bedwetting and mixed night and day (diurnal) wetting differ. Those with diurnal wetting are more likely to have an organic cause for their problem, and may be less likely to respond to treatment unless the underlying disease is treated (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvelin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvelin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jarvelin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvelin 1990</LINK>). Although the focus of the review was on monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, only 16 trials specifically excluded children with daytime wetting and six included at least some such children (the remainder provided no information about this issue). However, of the six, four specifically excluded children with organic causes. In total, 48 trials specifically excluded children with known organic causes for their enuresis. Of the seven trials which did not specify whether they excluded children with organic causes or not, only two trials included some children with daytime wetting. Therefore the majority of included trials (51) were likely to be amongst children without a recognised physical cause for their problem. To have included only the 16 trials which explicitly excluded all children with daytime wetting would have limited the review. The results should be interpreted with this in mind.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Settings for treatment</HEADING>
<P>Most of the included trials have recruited children from enuresis clinics or are hospital based. Participating families may be especially motivated to tackle the bed wetting. In addition, strict inclusion / exclusion criteria have been imposed in many of the trials. Consequently, the children involved are not necessarily representative of the wider population of those who wet the bed. Only three small trials included children who were learning disabled or from residential homes. The two larger of these trials favoured alarm treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Jehu-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Jehu 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sloop-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Sloop 1973</LINK>) but the data were too few to be generalisable.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effectiveness of alarms</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Alarms versus no treatment </HEADING>
<P>Alarm treatment was clearly better than no treatment or waiting list control interventions, both during treatment and in terms of continuing success rates after treatment was finished. About half the children fail or relapse after alarms compared with almost all who have a control treatment. Blinding of alarm treatment is difficult even if non-functioning equipment is used (as the patient will be aware that the alarm does not go off), and trials of conventional pad-and-buzzer alarms compared with sham alarms were not found. One trial of an electric shock device did use a sham alarm but the active treatment was not acceptable.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Different types of alarms</HEADING>
<P>There was some evidence that an immediate alarm (compared to a delayed alarm or one which woke the parents rather than the child) was better. In another trial, children preferred a body-worn alarm to a bed pad, and an audio body-worn alarm to a vibrating body-worn alarm, but in general there was insufficient evidence to suggest that one type of alarm was better than another.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Alarms versus behavioural interventions</HEADING>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a difference between alarms and simple behavioural interventions such as lifting, wakening or reward systems, because each intervention was addressed only by single small trials. Alarms resulted in fewer wet nights than stop-start training (teaching children to contract their pelvic floor muscles) but the single trial was too small to show reliably whether there was a difference in cure rates. Children were less likely to fail or relapse after alarm treatment alone than dry bed training alone in another small trial. There was some evidence that rewards increased the effectiveness of alarms whereas penalties after bed wetting appeared to reduce the likelihood of success.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Supplementing alarms with behavioural interventions</HEADING>
<P>Although 16 trials addressed the issue of supplementing alarm treatment by reinforcing it with behavioural interventions, there was not much evidence to say whether or not this improved performance of the alarm: the trials were all small, many did not report SDs, and the confidence intervals, where available, were wide. However, two small trials suggested that overlearning after successful alarm treatment halved the relapse rate from 49% to 25% (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1965</LINK>). Similarly, in two other trials, supplementing alarms with dry bed training reduced the relapse rate from 63% to 27% (<LINK REF="STD-Bollard-1981b" TYPE="STUDY">Bollard 1981b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nawaz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nawaz 2002</LINK>). Finally, one small trial suggested that giving children penalties for wet beds was unhelpful (<LINK REF="STD-van-Londen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">van Londen 1993</LINK>). These findings need to be confirmed in further research as the trials were small and some had methodological flaws. Retention control training (gradually trying to increase bladder capacity by teaching children to 'hold on') in addition to an alarm was detrimental during treatment, although it was not associated with significant differences in relapse rates after treatment stopped.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Alarms versus drugs</HEADING>
<P>Limited evidence suggested that alarms were better than placebo drug treatment, but direct comparisons with desmopressin or tricyclics alone were conflicting, in contrast with the findings of an earlier version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2005a</LINK>). These findings were based on single or small trials, and need to be confirmed in future research. However, two larger reviews (of desmopressin Glazener 2002) and tricyclics (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2003a</LINK>) suggest that drug treatment alone, while effective for some children during treatment, is unlikely to be followed by sustained cure as almost all the children relapsed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Supplementing alarms with drugs</HEADING>
<P>There is a move towards combining alarms with drug interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Howe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howe 1992</LINK>). The rationale is that the rapid onset of action of drugs is then combined with the more gradual treatment effect of alarms (<LINK REF="STD-Sukhai-1989-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Sukhai 1989 #</LINK>). Low doses of desmopressin as an adjunct to alarm treatment may also be used to ensure that the child only wets the bed once each night to minimise changes of bedding (<LINK REF="REF-Djurhuus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djurhuus 1992</LINK>). There was insufficient evidence to support this: while supplementing alarms with desmopressin did decrease the initial number of wet nights in four trials, success rates while on treatment or afterwards were not significantly different compared to an alarm alone. There was insufficient information about supplementing alarms with tricyclics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Alarms versus other treatments</HEADING>
<P>Limited evidence suggested that alarms were generally better than any of a variety of other classes of interventions while on treatment, but follow up data were only available from two small trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Acceptability of alarms</HEADING>
<P>High dropout rates in some of the trials suggest that there were problems with compliance, often reflecting the unacceptability of the treatment. Potential difficulties, such as the time needed to attain success and the initial disruption to the family, need to be discussed with families before embarking on alarm treatment. Some child or family variables have been shown to predict dropout, such as parental intolerance, behavioural problems or the child's negative self image (<LINK REF="STD-Wagner-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butler-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Butler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1994</LINK>). These may be useful for identifying which treatment is most likely to succeed, or where the chances of success may be increased by giving the family extra attention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events with standard pad-and-bell alarms which woke the children on wetting were limited to minor inconvenience due to alarm malfunction or disturbance to the family. In contrast, side effects with drugs may have more serious implications (Glazener 2002; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2003a</LINK>). For example, tricyclics may have serious side-effects such as arrhythmias and heart block, convulsions, and hepatic and haematological reactions. These may present a particular risk of overdose to the children treated or other family members (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzwater-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzwater 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parkin-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rushton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rushton 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, the alarms which delivered electric shocks to the children's skin on wetting were clearly unacceptable, in terms of frightening the children and causing burns and ulceration.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Costs</HEADING>
<P>In the UK, 16 weeks of drug treatment (the usual time allowed for fourteen consecutive dry nights to be attained using an alarm, <LINK REF="REF-Butler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1991</LINK>) would cost (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2002</LINK>):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>78 for desmopressin nasal spray (20 g per night) or 116 for desmopressin tablets (200 g);</LI>
<LI>4 for imipramine hydrochloride (25 mg tablet per night) or 14 for imipramine syrup (25 mg); and</LI>
<LI>enuresis alarms (including batteries &amp; sensor) typically cost 33.60, although alarms but not sensors (12) may be re-used several times.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>This information relates only to some of the direct costs to the health service. Although treatment with tricyclic or related drugs is considerably less expensive than alarms or desmopressin, this does not take into account the administrative or the human costs involved in using alarms. Alarm systems may not be returned to clinics and have to be followed up. Alarm treatment is accompanied by broken nights for various family members until success is attained. Staff must be trained to teach the children and their parents how to use the alarms (particularly that the child must be fully wakened) and ensure that the equipment is working. Staff also need time to teach the parents and provide support during treatment.</P>
<P>The Guidelines on Minimum Standards of Practice (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1993</LINK>) suggest that follow-up supervisory contacts should occur at least every three weeks, with management reviewed at least monthly. Against this must be set the possible reduced risk of relapse after stopping alarms compared with after stopping treatment with desmopressin, tricyclics or related drugs, and the potential for adverse events with tricyclics.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-10 12:29:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Using an audio alarm system on its own to condition children to wake before they wet the bed appears effective after treatment stops for about half of children with nocturnal enuresis. Supplementing alarm treatment with overlearning (giving children extra fluids at bedtime after successfully becoming dry using an alarm), dry bed training and avoiding penalties may reduce the relapse rate. Although the evidence suggests that desmopressin has a more immediate effect than alarms, alarms seem better than desmopressin or tricyclics in reducing the number of wet nights by the end of a course of treatment. There is no reliable evidence that the drugs are effective after treatment has stopped (Glazener 2002; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2003a</LINK>) whereas half the children remain dry after alarm treatments. </P>
<P>Although the cost of alarm treatment is intermediate between desmopressin and tricyclics, greater motivation and time are needed by families until alarm treatment is successful. However, the finding that effects are better sustained after alarm treatment, and the risks of side effects associated with drugs, suggest that alarms may be preferable to the pharmacological options.</P>
<P>The limited evidence suggested that alarms on their own were as good as or better than most other behavioural or other classes of interventions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-10 12:29:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although treatment with alarms, desmopressin and tricyclics have each been shown to be effective in a number of trials, there are few direct comparisons between them, or between different types of alarms (e.g. loudness, type of stimulus). These need further investigation. Current evidence on which to judge behavioural or other interventions is limited, and further trials of these compared with alarms, desmopressin or tricyclics are needed. Such trials should allow comparison in different populations and for different purposes (such as in primary care, or as a short-term measure to cover nights away from home), in order to inform choice of treatment. They should include formal testing to identify pre-treatment factors which might modify or determine treatment effects. Important factors include age, presence of organic causes or daytime wetting and family circumstances.</P>
<P>Future trials should focus on children without organic causes of bedwetting, and should include adequate assessment of baseline levels of wetting. The difficulty in comparing interventions is exacerbated by the lack of uniformity in outcome measures, which should include: the number of wet nights during treatment and after the end of treatment; the number of children failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights; adverse events; acceptability of treatment; compliance; and especially relapse rates after treatment has stopped (expressed as a composite outcome of failure to achieve 14 dry nights and subsequent relapse). It is crucial to be able to assess the success rates of different treatments at least three months after they have finished.</P>
<P>Children with daytime enuresis are more likely to have specific pathology such as bladder dysfunction or urinary tract infections. Alternative managements for this condition need to be assessed in a separate Cochrane Review.</P>
