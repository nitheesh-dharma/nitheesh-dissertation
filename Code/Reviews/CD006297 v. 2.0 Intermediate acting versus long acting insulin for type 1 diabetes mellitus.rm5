<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-08 19:02:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Diabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic disease with short and long term complications. The treatment for this disease is insulin administration, with basal and bolus insulin preparations being its main stay. Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin had previously been considered the standard of care for basal insulin replacement in blood glucose lowering for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Over the years, newer and longer acting insulins with a more physiological action profile became available: insulin ultralente, and later insulin glargine and insulin detemir. Their theoretical advantages lead to the thought of a beneficial effect on glucose level and rate of complications, such as very low levels of glucose or long term complications. The aim of this review was to assess whether this theoretical advantage is translated into real-life benefits, by comparing the effect of long acting insulins to intermediate acting insulins on diabetes control.<BR/>Twenty-three studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria with a total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively. The methodological quality of all the studies was rated intermediate to low. Trials duration was no longer than one year. The level of glycosylated haemoglobin, a marker of diabetes control, was lower in the long acting insulin group, but the observed difference was of doubtful clinical significance. Longer acting insulins were superior mostly in their nocturnal effect, which resulted in a lower level of fasting glucose levels and fewer episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. No data on long term complications were available.<BR/>The currently available data can not substantiate conclusions on the benefits and risks of long acting insulins, and long-term data are of need.</P>

<P>Twenty-three randomised controlled trials were identified. A total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively, were analysed. The weighted mean difference (WMD) for the level of glycosylated haemoglobin was -0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to -0.04) in favour of the long acting insulin arm. The WMD between the groups in fasting plasma and blood glucose levels was -0.63 (95% CI -0.86 to -0.40) and -0.86 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.72) in favour of the long acting insulins. The odds ratio for a patient on long acting insulin to develop any type of hypoglycaemia was 0.93 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.08) compared to that of a patient on intermediate acting insulins. The OR for severe hypoglycaemic episodes was 0.73 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.87), and 0.70 (95% CI of 0.63 to 0.79) for nocturnal episodes. The WMD between the long and intermediate insulin groups for hypoglycaemic events per 100 patient follow up days was -0.77 (95% CI -0.89 to -0.65), -0.0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02) and -0.40 (95% CI -0.45 to -0.34) for overall, severe, and nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes. Weight gain was more prominent in the control group. No difference was noted in the quantity or quality of severe adverse events or deaths.<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-05-08 19:02:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (i.e. elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative review groups-CRGs'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterised by a progressive destruction of pancreatic beta cells, which leads to insulin deficiency and overt diabetes. The goals of therapy for type 1 diabetic patients are to eliminate the symptoms of hyperglycaemia, reduce the long term microvascular and macrovascular complications and allow the patients to achieve a normal life-style. The care of a type 1 diabetic patient requires, among other things, ongoing insulin replacement therapy. Variable insulin regimens are available to match glucose intake and insulin requirements, and the right regimen for an individual patient should be tailored according to patient's glycaemic status and co-operation. In most regimens, basal insulin replacement is achieved via intermediate or long acting insulin, with supplemental prandial and correction-dose of short acting insulin bolus injections.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-08 19:02:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Basal insulin replacement for insulin dependent patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus has been achieved since the 1950s with either neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) or insulin zinc (Lente). Currently, they are provided as a suspension of human or purified porcine insulin with protamine and zinc (NPH) or zinc alone (Lente), which provide a slower onset of action and a longer duration of activity than that of regular insulin.<BR/>Insulin ultralente is a longer-acting insulin with zinc. It has a slower onset and a prolonged duration of activity when compared to intermediate insulins. It has been used as basal insulin replacement. While the beef-pork preparation of ultralente has no peak and lasts at least 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Rizza-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizza 1986</LINK>), currently available human ultralente peaks at 8 to 16 hours, and its duration of action ranges between 20 and 36 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 1998</LINK>). It has a wide intra and inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosskamp-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosskamp 1999</LINK>). In 2000, the first long acting insulin analogue (insulin glargine) was introduced, with a more physiological pharmacokinetic profile. The amino-acid changes have shifted its isoelectric point toward a neutral pH. As a result, insulin glargine has a delayed and prolonged absorption after subcutaneous administration (<LINK REF="REF-Bolli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolli 1999</LINK>), with a prolonged metabolic activity of 22 to 30 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Heinemann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinemann 2000</LINK>; Lepore 2000). Insulin detemir is another new long acting insulin analogue currently available for use in which the amino acid threonine at position 30 of the B-region has been omitted and a fatty acid acylated to lysin at position B 29 was added. It has been shown to have a slow absorption from the subcutaneous tissue and a protracted action (<LINK REF="REF-Havelund-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Havelund 2004</LINK>), and lower degree of intra patient variability of action compared with NPH insulin and insulin glargine (<LINK REF="REF-Heise-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heise 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-05-14 10:47:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Both insulin detemir and insulin glargine were shown in vitro properties that differed significantly from human insulin. Insulin glargine showed elevated insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor affinity, while insulin detemir was less potent than human insulin in binding to the IGF-I receptor and stimulating mitogenesis as well as in binding to the insulin receptor and stimulating lipogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtzhals-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzhals 2000</LINK>). Although long term insulins are considered to be of low potential for such effect, the clinical implications of this observation has not yet been fully explored.</P>
<P>Many studies comparing the various types of long and intermediate insulin analogues for basal insulin replacement in type 1 diabetic patients have been published, mostly involving insulin analogues compared to NPH. Their theoretical superiority has not been obvious in the clinical setting. A recently published meta-analysis showed that insulin glargine given once daily reduces the risk of hypoglycaemia compared with NPH insulin, with similar glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenstock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstock 2005</LINK>). A review on Insulin glargine versus NPH insulin concluded that insulin glargine may also improve glycaemic control and satisfaction in type 1 diabetic patients (<LINK REF="STD-Ratner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ratner 2003</LINK>).<BR/>Clinically, it is yet to be determined whether long acting insulin as a group (glargine, detemir and ultralente) can and should substitute intermediate acting insulin (NPH, Lente) for basal insulin replacement in type 1 diabetic patients, with special focus on insulin analogues in view of their action profile. This should be assessed in terms of better glycaemic control, elimination of the symptoms of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, reduction in side-effect rate, thus enabling more aggressive insulin treatment, as well as a reduction of the long term microvascular and macrovascular complications, as well as attention to mitogenic potential.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Trial design</HEADING>
<P>Attempts were made to identify all truly controlled randomised trials, in which treatment with long acting insulin preparations (glargine, detemir and ultralente) was compared to an intermediate-acting insulin preparation (NPH, Lente), in type 1 diabetic patients. Trials with more than two treatment groups were included and analysed accordingly. We also considered cross-over trial design (ideally, with a wash-out period of at least one week for measurements of blood or plasma fasting glucose levels, and three months for measurements of glycosylated haemoglobin levels).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Trial duration</HEADING>
<P>Trials with interventions and follow-up periods of at least four weeks were included, to allow stabilization of glycaemic control. For glycosylated haemoglobin levels, we focused on data from trials with at least three months duration of intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Exclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>Controlled randomised trials in which allocation to treatment or control group was not truly random or in which treatment allocation was not concealed, were excluded. After allocation, further concealment of treatment was impossible due to the difference between insulin preparations (insulin analogues are clear whereas NPH is a cloudy suspension). Thus, despite recognising that this may lead to biased treatment or reporting, post-allocation blinding could not be a prerequisite.<BR/>It is acknowledged that useful information about this problem might be gained from non-randomised studies or other randomisation methods (e.g. cluster randomisation). However, for the scope of this review, such studies were not considered.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-05-08 19:02:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>The quality of reporting each trial was assessed based largely on the quality criteria specified by Schulz and by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). In particular, the following factors were studied:<BR/>(1) Minimisation of selection bias - was the randomisation procedure adequate? was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>(2) Minimisation of performance bias - were the patients and people administering the treatment blind to the intervention? Performance bias is anticipated due to the different nature of insulin preparations (for example, clear versus cloudy).<BR/>(3) Minimisation of attrition bias - were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? was analysis by intention-to-treat?<BR/>(4) Minimisation of detection bias - were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the following three categories:<BR/>(A) all quality criteria met: low risk of bias;<BR/>(B) one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias; and<BR/>(C) one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>
<P>This classification was used as the basis of a sensitivity analysis. Additionally, we explored the influence of individual quality criteria in a sensitivity analysis.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>Effect measures for count and rates data were assessed according to their prevalence. Rare events such as death or long term complications were measured with the rate-ratio statistic. The rate-ratio compares the rate of events in the two groups by dividing one by the other. More common events such as the number of hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 days were measured as continuous data, with weighted mean difference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>Effect measures for continuous data were assessed through measurements of the mean difference (weighted mean difference), as results were expected to be on a unified scale (e.g. glycosylated haemoglobin level). The weighted mean difference was used for each of the parameters assessed, after assuring parameters reported by the different trials point towards a single direction. Dichotomizing results was not possible.</P>
<P>Short-, intermediate- and long-term (three months, three to six months, and over six months, respectively) assessments of effect in the case of repeated observations were performed.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis aims to include all participants randomised into a trial irrespective of what happened subsequently. This means that ideally, trial participants should be analysed in the group to which they were randomised regardless of which treatment they actually received or other protocol irregularities and all participants should be included regardless of whether their outcomes were actually collected. In this review we adopted an available-case-analysis, in which only the former criterion is met, and analysis is performed for every participant for whom data are available, thus filling-in for missing data was not conducted. Special attention was given for three types of exclusions:<BR/>(a) participants excluded for predefined exclusion criteria using information collected before randomisation- were considered as legitimate;<BR/>(b) participants excluded immediately after randomisation- illegitimate;<BR/>(c) very high dropout rates or inconsistency across study groups, which may indicate low quality of trial conduction.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2008-05-08 19:02:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Relevant missing data were sought from authors. Evaluation of important numerical data such as screened, eligible and randomised patients as well as intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) population was carefully performed. Drop-outs, misses to follow-up and withdrawn study participants were investigated. Issues of missing data, ITT and PP were critically appraised and compared to specification of primary outcome parameters and power calculation.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-05-08 19:02:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Heterogeneity is a term used to describe variability among trials encountered in a meta-analysis. In our review, we anticipated some clinical diversity, e.g. baseline diabetes status and treatment, as well as methodological diversity, both giving rise to statistical heterogeneity. On the one hand, the scope of our review is relatively confined; therefore heterogeneity is not inherently large. On the other hand, disease status may be variable among participants and bolus insulin injections in the study groups may differ by type and intensity. Methodologically there was no promise for comparable quality.<BR/>Heterogeneity was identified using the formal chi-square test, which is intended to assess whether observed differences in results are compatible with chance alone. Chi-squared test has low power when trials have small sample size or are few in number. Therefore a P value of 0.10 was considered statistically significant. We will also tried to quantify the amount of heterogeneity and its impact on the meta-analysis by describing the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). I<SUP>2</SUP>-values of 50% and more indicate a substantial level of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). When heterogeneity was found, we attempted to determine potential reasons for it by examining individual study characteristics and those of subgroups of the main body of evidence. A negative chi-square did not necessarily mean that no heterogeneity existed or should not be further explored. In this regard, a subgroup analysis was performed as discussed below.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-05-08 19:02:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Data were summarised statistically when available, sufficiently similar and of sufficient quality. Statistical analysis was performed according to the statistical guidelines referenced in the newest version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).<BR/>In the case of significant heterogeneity, a random-effects model was to be used. Otherwise, a fixed-effect meta-analytic model was planned.<BR/>When addressing continuous data, inverse variance method was utilized for conducting a fixed-effect analysis, whereas DerSimonian and Laird method was utilized for a random-effects meta-analysis.<BR/>For counts and rates data with rare prevalence of events, the generic inverse variance method was used to combine the log transformation of the rate-ratio across trials. For more common events for which the summery statistic is the weighted mean difference, analysis was performed as in the case of continuous data.<BR/>In the case of dichotomous data types, we expressed the effect of treatment with relative effect measures, i.e. risk-ratio and odds-ratio, which are more consistent than absolute measures. These were calculated for an event (rather then for a non-event) and re-expressed as absolute measures which are more interpretable by clinicians.</P>

<P>The initial search identified 1187 records, from these, 41 full papers were identified for further examination. The other studies were excluded on the basis of their abstracts because they were not relevant to the question under investigation (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> for details). After screening the full text of the selected papers, 24 publications finally met the inclusion criteria. Two of these publications address different aspects of the same trial population and were therefore considered as one study (<LINK REF="STD-Home-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Home 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Witthaus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witthaus 2001</LINK>). One study was declared as an extension phase of another study (<LINK REF="STD-De-Leeuw-2005" TYPE="STUDY">De Leeuw 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell_x002d_Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Russell-Jones 2004</LINK>). However, their description of patients and methods differed considerably and they were considered as two separate trials. Contact authors of these trials were not available for clarifications. A search through databases for ongoing clinical trials yielded two additional records (<LINK REF="STD-Alcolado-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Alcolado 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Page-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Page 2001</LINK>). The contact authors did not reply to our inquiry and a specific search through MEDLINE did not yield any further information. We therefore consider this analysis to include 23 RCTs.</P>

<P>Glycaemic control was assessed through measurements of glycosylated haemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, fasting blood glucose, and the mean daily self measured blood glucose (SMBG) averaging seven to eight points. Other efficacy parameters were not available or insufficiently described to be addressed within the scope of this review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Glycosylated haemoglobin</HEADING>
<P>
<I>G</I>lycosylated haemoglobin was addressed in all 22 of the 23 included studies in a total of 6666 patients. Overall, the use of long acting insulins resulted in a significant weighted mean difference of -0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to -0.04) when compared to intermediate acting insulins. This difference was prominent in studies with an intermediate follow-up period (three to six months, -0.17, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.10). Interestingly, in the longer follow-up periods (over six months), a non-significant trend towards NPH superiority was noted (WMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.08). Studies assessing shorter follow-up periods did not reach a statistical significance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Fasting plasma glucose</HEADING>
<P>Fasting plasma glucose was assessed in 11 studies, in a total of 4868 patients. The WMD between the groups resulted in a significant -0.63 (95% CI -0.86 to -0.40) in favour of the long acting insulins. This significance was noted in short, intermediate and long follow-up periods.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Fasting blood glucose</HEADING>
<P>Fasting self measured blood glucose was assessed in 17 studies in 5409 patients. The WMD between the groups was -0.86 with a significant 95% CI of -1.00 to -0.72 in favour of the long acting insulins, with statistically significant results in all periods of follow-up.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mean SMBG</HEADING>
<P>The mean SMBG was assessed by five studies in a total of 739 patients. The weighted mean difference between the groups favoured the long acting insulins but without statistical significance (-0.25, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.05).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hypoglycaemia</HEADING>
<P>3010 of 3537 patients and 2171 of 2594 patients in the long and intermediate acting insulin groups, respectively, developed at least one event of hypoglycaemia during the overall follow-up periods of the trials included. The odds ratio for a patient on long acting insulins to develop any type of hypoglycaemia was 0.93 without statistical significance (95% CI 0.8 to 1.08) compared to that of a patient on intermediate acting insulins. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were noted in 283 of 3356 and 271 of 2471 patients in these groups, respectively. The OR was 0.73 with 95% CI of 0.61 to 0.87. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes were noted in 1784 of 3135 and 1405 of 2271, with a significant OR of 0.70 with 95% CI of 0.63 to 0.79.<BR/>We also looked at hypoglycaemic events per 100 patient follow-up days. The WMD between the long and intermediate insulin groups was -0.77 (95% CI -0.89 to -0.65), -0.0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02) and -0.40 (95% CI -0.45 to -0.34) for overall hypoglycaemic episodes, severe episodes and nocturnal episodes, respectively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events classified by authors as serious were described in 14 trials. These events occurred in 97 of 2840 patients in the long acting insulin groups compared to 87 of 2038 patients in the control group, yielding a non-significant OR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.21). The types of serious adverse events are given in <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>. Most authors described serious adverse events whether or not they were treatment related, including severe hypoglycaemic episodes considered serious. However, in some reports, serious hypoglycaemic episodes or events considered not to be treatment related were omitted (<LINK REF="STD-Fulcher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fulcher 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ratner 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Russell_x002d_Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Russell-Jones 2004</LINK>).<BR/>Weight gain (kilograms) was described in eight studies and was more prominent in the control group with a significant WMD between the interventional and control groups of -0.67 (95% CI of -0.87 to -0.45). One study assessing insulin detemir versus NPH in children described a gain in body mass index in the NPH group which was statistically larger than in the detemir group (difference 0.18, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.26) (<LINK REF="STD-Robertson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 2007</LINK>). Other adverse events were considered mild to moderate.<BR/>Death occurred in two patients in the control group and none in the interventional arm. The reasons for death were lung tumour and myocardial infarction and were not considered treatment related.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Only one study addressed long term microvascular complications (i.e. retinopathy) in a follow-up period of 28 weeks without observed differences (<LINK REF="STD-Home-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Home 2005</LINK>). This reflects the relatively short period of follow-up in the identified trials with a maximum of one year. One patient in the intermediate acting insulin group died of myocardial infarction but this event was recorded by the authors as not related to treatment.<BR/>Health-related quality of life was assessed in two trials: <LINK REF="STD-Chatterjee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chatterjee 2007</LINK> et al. utilised the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) and Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life questionnaire (ADDQoL) while comparing insulin glargine with NPH in a crossover designed trial. A statistically significant difference between treatments ( P = 0.001) was only observed in analysis of DTSQ for the second period of the trial. Overall, satisfaction was greater with glargine by a mean of 4 points on the change scale compared with NPH. There was no difference in overall quality of life and overall impact of diabetes on quality of life using ADDQoL. <LINK REF="REF-Witthaus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witthaus 2001</LINK> et al. report better outcomes with insulin glargine for the DTSQ items, perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, compared to NPH. No difference in psychological well being between the treatment groups was observed, with mean scores increasing in both.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>The chi-squared test was performed with a P value of less than 0.10. All the efficacy parameters assessed in this meta-analysis yielded a significant inherent statistical heterogeneity. When addressing glycosylated haemoglobin, the chi-squared test yielded a P value of 0.002 with I<SUP>2</SUP>=53.8%. Fasting blood glucose estimation also yielded heterogeneity with a P value of &lt;0.00001 and I<SUP>2</SUP>=74.1%. for these parameters, long term studies were the main contributors to heterogeneity. Fasting plasma glucose estimation yielded heterogeneity with a P value of &lt;0.00001 and I<SUP>2</SUP>=86.2%. This heterogeneity was observed in intermediate and long term studies. Mean self measured blood glucose heterogeneity analysis yielded a P value of 0.006 with I<SUP>2</SUP>=72.2%.</P>
<P>Hypoglycaemic events per 100 patient days yielded a significant heterogeneity for all episodes, severe episodes, and nocturnal episodes. The percentage of people experiencing at least one nocturnal hypoglycaemic episode also showed an inherent heterogeneity. The only parameters with no heterogeneity were the percentage of people experiencing at least one hypoglycaemic episode, the percentage of people experiencing at least one severe hypoglycaemic episode, and weight gain analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Data extraction was reassessed to explore heterogeneity. A search for standard errors that have been mistakenly entered as standard deviation was performed.<BR/>We also employed a random effect meta analysis model in an attempt to address the question 'what is the average treatment effect?' rather then 'what is the best estimate of the effect?' as posed by the fixed effect model. Utilisation of the random effect meta analysis model did not reduce the heterogeneity in any of the assessed parameters.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>In an attempt to further explore heterogeneity subgroup analyses were carried out. Since some of the studies presented efficacy parameters in terms of final values and some as change from baseline, we performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis exploring this issue. Heterogeneity disappeared for fasting blood glucose evaluation when values of change from baseline were omitted without compromise of the statistical significance of the measured effects.<BR/>A subgroup analysis for clinical variables was also carried out. Variables regarding participants were pre-defined as gender and baseline diabetes mellitus status. Subgroup analysis according to gender was impossible to implement as studies did not present data on the patient's gender.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Diabetes status</HEADING>
<P>Studies were categorized according to their reported mean baseline glycosylated haemoglobin levels (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hermansen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hermansen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Home-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Home 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolendorf-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kolendorf 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porcellati-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Porcellati 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raskin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ratner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ratner 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rossetti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rossetti 2003</LINK> report fare diabetes control at baseline (&lt;8%). <LINK REF="STD-De-Leeuw-2005" TYPE="STUDY">De Leeuw 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Francis-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Francis 1986</LINK> report poor diabetes control (&gt;12%). Others reported intermediate control (10% to 12%). Glycosylated haemoglobin showed statistically significant decline with long acting insulins in the intermediate and poorly controlled subgroups but not in the trials with fairly controlled diabetes, in which heterogeneity was present. Fasting blood and plasma glucose were lower with long acting insulins in all diabetic subgroups. Mean daily measured blood glucose was not different in the long acting insulins when compared to the intermediate acting insulins and stratified according to diabetes control. The percentage of participants experiencing at least one severe or nocturnal hypoglycaemic episode was significantly lower in the intermediately controlled group, without heterogeneity. The number of total and nocturnal episodes per 100 patient's days was also higher in the long acting insulin groups in all diabetes control groups. Heterogeneity was not influenced significantly by these analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Insulin type</HEADING>
<P>Pre-defined parameters reflecting intervention were type of insulins (long, intermediate and short acting), and number of basal insulin doses per day. Only one of the studies presented data for pre-mixed insulin preparations (<LINK REF="STD-Porcellati-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Porcellati 2004</LINK>).<BR/>Glycosylated haemoglobin level was significantly lower with both insulin detemir and glargine, but not with ultralente. Heterogeneity was evident in the glargine and ultralente groups. Fasting blood and plasma glucose levels were lower with all types of long acting insulins. Significant heterogeneity disappeared when analysing fasting blood glucose in the detemir recipients. Mean self measured glucose level was lower with glargine but not with the other insulins. The number of patients experiencing at least one severe or nocturnal episode of hypoglycaemia was lower in both detemir and glargine groups, but the number of total episodes did not differ. Insulin detemir had a greater influence on this parameter, with lower heterogeneity. The number of episodes per 100 days was lower with both detemir and glargine for the total and nocturnal episodes but not for the severe episodes.<BR/>The effect of the type of intermediate insulin preparation was not assessed in view of the limited amount of studies assessing types other than NPH.<BR/>When analysing the effect of the short acting insulin given as bolus injections, glycosylated haemoglobin was lower with insulin analogues but not with human or porcine insulins, without significant heterogeneity. There were less patients experiencing nocturnal and severe episodes with short acting insulin analogues, and less patients experiencing severe episodes with human insulin. The number of hypoglycaemic events per 100 days analysis showed wide inherent heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Number of bolus injections</HEADING>
<P>Glycosylated haemoglobin was statistically lower in the once daily and in the more than once daily (range two to four) long acting insulin injection groups. In the latter group heterogeneity was absent. Fasting plasma and blood glucose levels were lower in the long acting insulin group regardless of the number of daily injections, with high heterogeneity. There were less nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes but a tendency towards more severe hypoglycaemic episodes in the twice of more daily basal injections group, with high heterogeneity.</P>
<P>It seems from our analysis that combining two type of data presentation, i.e. final values and change from baseline, was a major determinant of heterogeneity found in this meta-analysis. Analysis of parallel and crossover studies together may have also contributed<I>. </I>Subgroup analysis did not point to any major clinical and interventional factor as a major source of this heterogeneity. For this reason, the overall effect of treatment for these variables must be interpreted cautiously, as observed differences in results are probably not compatible with chance alone, and statistical heterogeneity exists.</P>

<P>Studies were separated into three groups according to the length of follow up (less than three months, three to six month or more than six months). Results according to this categorization are given above. The numbers of participants ranged from six to 747. The weight given to the smallest trial was insignificant. Exclusion of trials with over 600 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Raskin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Raskin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell_x002d_Jones-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Russell-Jones 2004</LINK>) did not influence the results.</P>
<P>None of the trials reported the diabetes mellitus diagnostic criteria used. Language of publication was English in all of the included trials. Source of funding was not an influencing factor - only three of the studies were not sponsored by the industry, one with limited number of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Francis-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Francis 1986</LINK>), and two with positive results regarding the effects of long acting insulins (<LINK REF="STD-Porcellati-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Porcellati 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossetti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rossetti 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The robustness of the results was tested by repeating the analysis using different measures of effects size for dichotomous data (continuous data could not be assessed with standardised mean difference in view of the combination of final and change from baseline values), and different statistical models.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 10:57:02 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a prevalent disease with short and long term complications. Diabetes control is essential to decrease the rate of these complications, but over-vigorous glucose lowering treatment can result in severe and sometimes life threatening adverse effects. The introduction of the new long acting insulins, and specifically, the long acting insulin analogues, aims to better mimic the physiological basal insulin release, and when complemented by bolus insulin injections, promises a theoretical advantage over older insulin administration strategies. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we aimed to assess this presumed benefit. Our review summarises the effect of all randomised controlled trials comparing long term insulin preparations with intermediate term insulin preparations for basal insulin administration.<BR/>The effect of these agents over their comparatives was significant for both efficacy and safety parameters. The glycosylated haemoglobin, being the most important marker for long term diabetes control, was found to be lower with statistical significance by a weighted mean difference of 0.08. This observation was mostly evident in trials of three to six months duration but not in shorter or longer trials. It was also more prominent with more than once daily basal insulin administration, in patients using newer insulin analogues (glargine and detemir), in patients using short acting insulin analogues for bolus injections rather then humanised or porcine insulins, and in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. Undoubtedly, this effect is far from being clinically satisfactory in terms of complication reduction. </P>
<P>Parameters assessing short term control such as fasting (morning) blood or plasma glucose, values were better controlled with long acting insulins. Indeed, the percentage of people experiencing nocturnal hypoglycaemia was significantly lower in this group, with a clinically significant lower OR of 0.70. The number of nocturnal hypoglycaemic events per 100 patient's days was also lower in this group. This finding implies a more physiological blood insulin level, which is important for nocturnal complications. Nevertheless, the percent of patients experiencing an hypoglycaemic episode not restricted to certain hours was not lower with long acting insulins, which implies that short acting bolus insulins are the main determinants of day-time complications. Adverse effects profile was similar in both groups.<BR/>When interpreting our results one must account for several confounding factors. The quality of the included studies was at most intermediate due to the lack of blinding and inappropriate description of quality markers. Inherent heterogeneity was also discovered in our analysis. This heterogeneity was studied extensively. Our view is that it is mostly due to the combination of final and change from baseline values. The significance of the different results was not significantly jeopardised by the separation of these data sets, while heterogeneity decreased in some but not all of the analyses. Another confounding factor lies in the source of funding, which came mostly from the makers of the long acting insulins, and gives rise to possible bias driven by market forces. Due to the limited number of non-industry sponsored trials this problem could not be addressed statistically.<BR/>In terms of applicability, the presented results do not fully reflect real life scenarios. In this regard, studies aimed at diabetes control may mask the hypoglycaemia avoidance strategies which are common in reality. They also present rigorous follow-up and adherence to treatment which may not reflect daily routines. Long acting insulins, despite their potential once daily use (which is less efficacious), require three separate bolus injections, while NPH can be injected with short acting insulin as a premixed preparation. In this view, one should not consider them superior in terms of adherence, and their superiority may be primarily related to achieving the same efficacy with less risk of hypoglycaemia.<BR/>It seems from our report that long acting insulin preparations in the right dose and schedule, given to the right patients, with the right additive bolus insulin injections, are efficacious and safe. Their presumed mitogenic effect could not be addressed, nor could their long term reduction of diabetic complications. When compared to intermediate acting insulins, their effect on glucose control seems to be subtle, if at all, but important for the control of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. These results are in concordance with a recent review on the effect of long acting insulin analogues in diabetes mellitus type 2 (<LINK REF="REF-Horvath-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horvath 2007</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Our analysis suggests only a modest clinical benefit of treatment with long-acting insulin preparations rather then intermediate acting insulin preparations for patients with diabetes mellitus type 1. Their effect is more prominent for the control of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. We suggest a cautious approach to their use in view of their potential mitogenic effect.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-08 19:02:35 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>More research is needed to assess the cost effectiveness of long term insulin preparations for type 1 diabetic patients. Long term follow-up is also necessary for the investigation of end-organ involvement and mitogenic effects, with a more rigorous approach on study quality and reporting.</P>

<P>STATED AIM OF STUDY:<BR/>First, to compare the long-term glycaemic control in T1 DM with two regimens of optimized replacement of basal insulin, i.e. NPH combined with lispro insulin at each meal (and a fourth NPH injection at bedtime), and insulin glargine once daily. Second, to test the hypothesis that the less frequent hypoglycaemia expected to occur with insulin glargine as compared with NPH, resulted in better responses of counter-regulatory hormones, symptoms and onset of cognitive dysfunction to hypoglycaemia.</P>
