<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>What are the effects of thyroid hormone treatment (levothyroxine) and minimally invasive procedures on benign thyroid nodules?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Nodules (lumps) within the thyroid gland are common and usually benign. They are more frequent in women, the elderly and in iodine-deficient areas. Thyroid nodules are often observed as an incidental finding in the course of ultrasonography of the thyroid, nodules of more than 1 cm in size are usually detected by palpation of the thyroid gland during a physical examination. Thyroid nodules may occur as a single nodule or as multiple nodules and may contain fluid (cyst). About 5 in 100 palpable thyroid nodules have a risk of becoming malignant (thyroid cancer). Thyroid nodules are often treated with thyroid hormones in order to reduce the size of the nodule. If thyroid nodules cause problems such as pressure symptoms or cosmetic complaints, surgery may be performed. Other therapies try to destroy the thyroid nodule by means of minimally invasive procedures (techniques which are less invasive than open surgery) and are usually performed on an outpatient basis.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 31 randomised controlled trials for this systematic review. Altogether 2952 participants were allocated to the various intervention and comparator groups. In total, 16 studies lasting six months to five years investigated the effects of levothyroxine therapy. Eight studies lasting 1 to 12 months investigated the efficacy of injections, mostly of ethanol, into thyroid nodules from which fluid had been slowly removed. Laser therapy (one or up to three sessions) was applied to nodules in five studies lasting 6 to 12 months. Two studies investigated the application of one or two radiofrequency (high-frequency radiowaves) sessions over 6 to 12 months.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>None of the interventions investigated death from any cause, the development of thyroid cancer or health-related quality of life. Nodule volume reductions were achieved by all therapies; however, the clinical relevance of this outcome is doubtful. Minimally invasive treatments resulted in improvements in pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints. Some side effects such as light-to-moderate pain were observed after minimally invasive procedures.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Most study results were of overall low quality, mainly because only a few people were investigated, findings were imprecise or measurements were prone to bias. Future studies should investigate more patient-important outcomes, such as health-related quality of life, and should compare minimally invasive therapies with surgery. Studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to provide evidence on the development of thyroid cancer, death from any cause and long-term side effects of treatments.</P>
<P>
<B>Currentness of data</B>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-06-13 12:24:02 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Thyroid nodules (TN) are common in the adult population. Some physicians use suppressive levothyroxine (LT4) therapy to achieve a reduction in the number and volume of TN. In addition, minimally invasive treatments, such as percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) sclerotherapy, laser photocoagulation (LP), and microwave (MW), radiofrequency (RF) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation, have been proposed, especially for pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints, as an alternative to surgery. However, the risk to benefit ratio of all treatments for benign TN is currently unknown.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-06-13 12:24:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>To assess the effects of LT4 or minimally invasive therapies (PEI, LP, and RF/HIFU/MW ablation) on benign TN.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-06-13 12:05:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>We identified studies from computerised searches of <I>The Cochrane Library, </I>MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS (all performed<I> </I>up to April 2014).<I> </I>We also searched trial registers<I>, </I>examined reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, and contacted study authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-06-13 12:24:24 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>We included studies if they were RCTs of LT4, PEI, LP, RF, HIFU or MW therapy in participants with an established diagnosis of benign TN. We excluded trials investigating the prevention of recurrence of thyroid disease after surgery, irradiation or treatment with radioiodine.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-06-13 12:06:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of included studies by visually inspecting forest plots and quantifying the diversity using the I²<SUP> </SUP>statistic. We synthesised data using random-effects model meta-analysis or descriptive analysis, as appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-16 14:38:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-one studies randomised 2952 outpatients to investigate the effects of different therapies on benign TN. Studies on LT4, PEI, LP and RF ablation therapy randomised 2083, 607, 192 and 70 participants, respectively. We found no RCTs of HIFU or MW ablation therapy in benign TN. The duration of treatment varied according to the applied therapies: up to five years for LT4 and one to three PEI ablations, one to three LP sessions and one or two RF sessions. Median follow-up was 12 months for LT4 and six months for minimally invasive therapies. Evidence was of low-to-moderate quality, and risk of performance and detection bias for subjective outcomes was high in most trials.</P>
<P>No study evaluated all-cause mortality or health-related quality of life. Only one LT4 study provided some data on the development of thyroid cancer, reporting no abnormal cytological findings. One LP study provided limited information on costs of treatment.</P>
<P>LT4 compared with no treatment or placebo was associated with a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in 16% compared with 10% of participants after 6 to 24 months of follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 2.38); P = 0.03; 958 participants; 10 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Pressure symptoms or cosmetic complaints were not investigated in LT4 studies. LT4 therapy was generally well tolerated: three studies provided quantitative data on signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which were observed in 25% of LT4-treated versus 7% of placebo-treated participants at 12 to 18 months of follow-up (269 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>PEI compared with cyst aspiration only was associated with a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in 83% compared with 44% of participants after 1 to 24 months of follow-up (RR 1.83 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.54); P = 0.0003; 105 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence). Improvements in neck compression symptoms after 6 to 12 months of follow-up were seen in 78% of participants receiving PEI versus 38% of those in comparator groups. No reliable summary effect estimate could be established, RR ranged from 1.0 to 3.06 in favour of PEI (370 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). In all trials, participants experienced periprocedural cervical tenderness and light-to-moderate pain usually lasting from minutes to several hours. As a result of the PEI procedure, 26% of participants reported slight-to-moderate pain compared with 12% of those receiving cyst aspiration only (RR 1.78 (95% CI 0.62 to 5.12); P = 0.28; 104 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>One study comparing LP with LT4 showed a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in favour of LP after 12 months of follow-up in 33% of LP participants versus 0% of LT4 participants, respectively (62 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence). A total of 82% of LP-treated versus 0% of untreated participants showed improvements in pressure symptoms after 6 to 12 months of follow-up (RR 26.65 (95% CI 5.47 to 129.72); P &lt; 0.0001; 92 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). Around 20% of LP-treated participants reported light-to-moderate cervical pain lasting 48 hours or more (97 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>One trial with 40 participants, comparing RF with no treatment, resulted in a mean nodule volume reduction of 76% in the RF group compared with 0% of those in the no-treatment group at six months of follow-up (low-quality evidence). These RF-treated participants had fewer pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints after 12 months of follow-up compared with untreated participants (a 2.8 decrease versus a 1.1 increase on a six-point scale, respectively, with higher values indicating more severe symptoms; low-quality evidence). All participants complained of pain and discomfort during RF, which disappeared when the energy was reduced or turned off (low-quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-13 12:20:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>No study evaluated all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life or provided systematic data on the development of thyroid cancer. Longest follow-up was five years and median follow-up was 12 months. Nodule volume reductions were achieved by PEI, LP and RF, and to a lesser extent, by LT4. However, the clinical relevance of this outcome measure is doubtful. PEI, LP and RF led to improvements in pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints. Adverse events such as light-to-moderate periprocedural pain were seen after PEI, LP and RF. Future studies should focus on patient-important outcome measures, especially health-related quality of life, and compare minimally invasive procedures with surgery. RCTs with follow-up periods of several years and good-quality observational studies are needed to provide evidence on the development of thyroid cancer, all-cause mortality and long-term adverse events.</P>

<P>Nodular thyroid disease is common. Thyroid nodules are more frequent in women, the elderly and in iodine-deficient areas, becoming malignant possibly more often in men and especially in individuals aged over 70 years (<LINK REF="REF-Belfiore-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belfiore 1992</LINK>). Palpable thyroid nodules were detected in 4% to 7% of individuals in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Mazzaferri-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazzaferri 1993</LINK>) and in 0.8% of adult men and 5.3% of adult women in Northeast England (<LINK REF="REF-Tunbridge-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunbridge 1977</LINK>). Thyroid nodules are even more common when detected using ultrasonography of the thyroid (<LINK REF="REF-Brander-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brander 1991</LINK>), with prevalence rates varying from 20% to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Galofr_x00e9_-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galofré 2008</LINK>). Many nodules are thyroid incidentalomas, which are discovered when neck structures are imaged for other reasons (<LINK REF="REF-Daniels-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 1996</LINK>). In the Framingham study population, new nodules appeared in 0.1% of participants per year during a 15-year follow-up period (<LINK REF="REF-Vander-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vander 1968</LINK>).</P>
<P>A clinically solitary thyroid nodule is a discrete swelling within an otherwise palpable normal thyroid gland. The overwhelming majority of these nodules are composed of irregularly enlarged follicles containing abundant colloid (benign adenomatous nodules). About half of individuals with clinically apparent solitary nodules are found to have multinodular goitres (MNGs) at surgery. The risk of cancer in people with true solitary nodules confirmed at surgery has been reported to be about the same as that in those with MNGs (<LINK REF="REF-McCall-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCall 1986</LINK>). In contrast, however, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis found MNGs to be associated with a lower risk of thyroid cancer than solitary nodules (odds ratio (OR) 0.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.96); 44,288 participants; 14 longitudinal and cross-sectional observational studies) (<LINK REF="REF-Brito-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brito 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thyroid nodules are often hypofunctioning, as determined by radionuclide scanning (termed 'cold' nodules), are incompletely encapsulated and sometimes poorly demarcated. Some authors consider a 'warm' TN as a distinct entity, although most distinguish nodules that are autonomously functioning as 'hot' from those that are 'cold'. Using this definition, virtually all thyroid cancers are cold. However, approximately 95% to 97% of cold nodules are benign (<LINK REF="REF-Daniels-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 1996</LINK>). Benign thyroid nodules are commonly caused by thyroid adenomas, cysts and thyroiditis.</P>
<P>The discovery of a thyroid nodule leads to concerns that the nodule may develop into thyroid cancer. Factors that favour the development of thyroid cancer include a history of neck irradiation, rapid tumour growth, male sex, age younger than 20 years or older than 70 years, a family history of thyroid cancer or features suggestive of neoplasia. The incidence of cancer in individuals with clinical features suggestive of malignancy (e.g. firm, fixed nodule, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy in the absence of previous surgery) is high, but most do not have these features (<LINK REF="REF-Hamming-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamming 1990</LINK>). From a clinical viewpoint, fewer than 5% of palpable thyroid nodules are malignant. Nodule growth alone, however, does not predict malignancy. <LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2003</LINK> found that cystic nodules grew less than those with more solid components, and that malignity was proved after repeated fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in 1 of 74 nodules.</P>
<P>Well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (papillary and follicular) comprise 80% of all thyroid cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1990</LINK>). The annual incidence is approximately 4 in 100,000 persons (0.004%), with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 1000 persons (0.1%) (<LINK REF="REF-Daniels-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 1996</LINK>). Many more people have clinically silent thyroid cancers: up to 35% of thyroid glands removed at autopsy (<LINK REF="REF-Mazzaferri-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazzaferri 1988</LINK>) or surgically (<LINK REF="REF-Pelizzo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelizzo 1990</LINK>) contain small (less than 1.0 cm), thought to be clinically insignificant, papillary carcinomas. Despite an increasing incidence in the detection of papillary carcinomas, mortality from thyroid cancer between 1973 and 2002 remained stable (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2006</LINK>). In the USA, approximately 37,200 cases of new thyroid cancers were estimated to be diagnosed in 2009, with about 1630 deaths resulting from the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent developments, such as the use of FNA biopsy (FNAB), the application of high-resolution ultrasonography and sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assays, have resulted in important advances in the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules. Many publications have defined and classified nodules according to cytological features, described techniques for monitoring thyroid functional status in the course of TSH suppression and raised concerns about the potential complications of suppressive therapy.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-06-16 14:18:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is unclear whether asymptomatic thyroid nodules should be treated because in most cases they are benign, small and can be managed by active surveillance (<LINK REF="REF-Gharib-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gharib 2007</LINK>). However, some thyroid nodules grow and can cause pressure and other symptoms as well as cosmetic complaints, and hence require treatment. Until recently, surgical approaches have been used for the management of nodules causing severe symptoms; however, the risk of complications persists and there may be a problem with the availability of experienced thyroid surgeons. Thyroid hormone suppression therapy with levothyroxine (LT4) is an alternative option for the treatment of thyroid nodules. In addition, a number of minimally invasive therapies, all guided by ultrasound imaging, are increasingly employed in the treatment of symptomatic thyroid nodules.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">LT4 therapy</HEADING>
<P>The use of thyroid hormone suppressive therapy in individuals with thyroid nodules and nodular goitre is based on the presumption that TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone also known as thyrotropin) is a growth factor for thyroid tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Burch-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morita-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morita 1989</LINK>). The rationale for TSH suppression (i.e. that thyroid nodules and nodular goitre are caused by TSH stimulation as the main stimulator of thyroid function or growth) has never been clearly proven (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1995</LINK>). Despite considerable controversy among experts about its efficacy, suppressive therapy of the thyroid nodule with thyroxine, with the goal of suppressing TSH production and reducing the size of the nodule, has gained wide acceptance. The efficacy of thyroid hormone suppressive therapy for nodules and goitre is supported by extensive anecdotal clinical experience as well as numerous uncontrolled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Daniels-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 1996</LINK>). Thyroid hormone suppression therapy for thyroid nodules resurfaced as a legitimate therapy with the publication of uncontrolled experiences in 1960 (<LINK REF="REF-Astwood-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astwood 1960</LINK>). Over the next decades, discordant reports about the efficacy of this therapy were published, possibly being associated with the aetiological heterogeneity of thyroid nodules and their unpredictable patterns of growth. With time, solitary nodules may enlarge, shrink or even disappear spontaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Kuma-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuma 1992</LINK>), but most do not change appreciably (<LINK REF="REF-Vander-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vander 1968</LINK>). Similarly, the possible presence of cystic nodules, which can either resolve or grow spontaneously, was not taken into consideration in some studies. Moreover, confounding variables, such as the lack of a comparator population, a short period of follow-up, an inaccurate quantification of nodule size and the lack of proof of effective TSH suppression, did not allow conclusive results. By definition, LT4 suppressive therapy is a dose of levothyroxine sufficient to suppress pituitary TSH secretion to concentrations that are below the lower limits of normal (<LINK REF="REF-Gharib-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gharib 1998</LINK>). Although the optimal level of TSH suppression has not been clearly defined, complete suppression of serum TSH concentrations to less than 0.1 mIU/L is thought to be unnecessary in individuals with benign thyroid disease (<LINK REF="REF-Burch-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burch 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Percutaneous injection sclerotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) is an ultrasound-guided minimally invasive therapeutic procedure suggested for the non-surgical management of benign thyroid nodules in individuals with pressure symptoms or cosmetic complaints. PEI was first proposed in 1990 as a possible alternative to surgery and radioiodine therapy for the treatment of autonomously functioning thyroid nodules in outpatients (<LINK REF="REF-Bennedbaek-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennedbaek 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Livraghi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livraghi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papini-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papini 1995</LINK>). The procedure is currently described as effective in the treatment of benign thyroid cysts and complex nodules with a dominant fluid component. The method should not be performed in solitary solid nodules, whether hyperfunctioning or not, or in MNGs (<LINK REF="REF-AACE_x002f_AME_x002f_ETA-Guidelines-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACE/AME/ETA Guidelines 2010</LINK>). The Latin American Thyroid Society (LATS) also does not recommend PEI for the routine treatment of thyroid nodules other than cysts in their recent guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-LATS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">LATS 2009</LINK>). However, some authors have described satisfactory results with PEI for the treatment of thyroid solid nodules in individuals with pressure symptoms or cosmetic complaints who refuse surgery or are at surgical risk, reporting an overall nodule volume reduction of 43% (<LINK REF="REF-Bennedbaek-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennedbaek 1995</LINK>). Mainly ethanol is injected into the thyroid cysts, some investigators however use other substances such as the antibiotic tetracycline. </P>
<P>
<B>Technique:</B> The individual lies on his/her back with the neck hyperextended. The nodule is identified by ultrasound. After applying local anaesthesia (optional), the operator inserts a needle that is connected to a syringe into the cyst. The cyst fluid is smoothly and slowly aspirated and the contents are extracted totally. Sterile ethanol 95% is then injected carefully into the cyst to refills the cavity. The quantity of ethanol injected is usually equivalent to 50% to 70% of the cystic fluid extracted. The alcohol (deposited within the cyst) is gradually reabsorbed during the next 24 to 48 hours without major discomfort. Alcohol causes permanent tissue ablation by local necrosis and thrombosis of small intranodular vessels. Experience is imperative for the performance of neck ultrasound and ultrasound-guided PEI because the manoeuvre is safe only in expert hands (<LINK REF="STD-PEI-Valcavi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">PEI Valcavi 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another variation of the PEI technique was proposed by Bennedbaek et al, which involves subtotal cyst aspiration, washing with ethanol and subsequent complete fluid aspiration after two minutes (without removing the needle) under ultrasound control (<LINK REF="STD-PEI-Bennedbaek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">PEI Bennedbaek 2003 </LINK>). The authors report treatment failure in 18% of participants. Such individuals subsequently underwent hemithyroidectomy; in one of them the surgeon mentioned that periglandular fibrosis resulting from the ethanol injection made the surgical procedure more difficult.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ultrasound-guided interstitial laser photocoagulation </HEADING>
<P>Interstitial laser photocoagulation (LP), also called percutaneous laser ablation, is described as a rapid, minimally invasive technique, and proposed as an alternative to thyroidectomy for benign thyroid lesions causing compressive symptoms or cosmetic complaints. The procedure is highly effective for achieving volume reductions in thyroid lesions, and is usually performed in selected cases (individuals at high-surgical risk) and in specialised centres (<LINK REF="REF-Filetti-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filetti 2006</LINK>). In most individuals with thyroid nodules, one to three sessions of LP induce a significant decrease in nodule volume and the amelioration of local symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-AACE_x002f_AME_x002f_ETA-Guidelines-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACE/AME/ETA Guidelines 2010</LINK>). Two new studies with three and five years of follow-up observed comparable nodule volume reductions of about 50% and 75%, with an improvement in pressure symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Dossing-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dossing 2011</LINK>). Because of potential complications, thermal ablation procedures should be performed only by experienced operators (<LINK REF="REF-AACE_x002f_AME_x002f_ETA-Guidelines-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACE/AME/ETA Guidelines 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Technique:</B> Under sterile conditions the individual undergoes local anaesthesia and light sedation to avoid abrupt movements. Ultrasound-guided, the laser fibre is positioned in the thyroid nodule through the lumen of one small or multiple (up to four) needles. The needle is then withdrawn 20 mm leaving the end of the fibre in direct contact with the tissue. After the penetration of the laser light, absorbed energy produces heat (temperatures of up to 180°C to 200°C), inducing tissue charring and necrosis with subsequent volume decrease. To avoid injuries from the thermal effects of LP, a safety distance of at least 15 mm from the neurovascular bundle is required (<LINK REF="REF-Pacella-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pacella 2000</LINK>). Before the procedure is terminated, three or four areas are treated.</P>
<P>A variation of this procedure has also been described as effective (<LINK REF="STD-LP-Gambelunghe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">LP Gambelunghe 2006</LINK>): during the manoeuvre a small needle is moved from the initial position in steps of 2 to 5 mm, to a distance of 10 mm from the cranial portion of the capsule. The energy applied varies from 100 J to 400 J per step, based on the extent of the hyperechoic area produced by photocoagulation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation therapy</HEADING>
<P>Ultrasound-guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation therapy has been investigated in elderly individuals with benign, compressive and large thyroid nodules (<LINK REF="REF-Spiezia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiezia 2009</LINK>). RF ablation therapy, using small needles and internally cooled electrodes, enables the therapist to prevent scar formation without skin incision (<LINK REF="STD-Baek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Baek 2010</LINK>). This procedure has previously been used for treating primary and secondary malignant neoplasms and liver tumours. RF energy is applied in 3.8 to 4 MHz quantities, and tissues are heated at temperatures between 60°C and 100°C resulting in subsequent cell death. The needles utilised are generally larger than those used for LP (<LINK REF="REF-Spiezia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiezia 2009</LINK>) and this method is ordinarily performed under conscious sedation. Some authors have used single-hook needles (<LINK REF="STD-Baek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Baek 2010</LINK>) and others prefer multiple expandable hook needles (<LINK REF="STD-RF-Faggiano-2012" TYPE="STUDY">RF Faggiano 2012</LINK>). Safety and efficacy in prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have yet to be adequately investigated, so RF ablation is currently not recommended in the routine management of benign thyroid nodules (<LINK REF="REF-AACE_x002f_AME_x002f_ETA-Guidelines-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACE/AME/ETA Guidelines 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation therapy</HEADING>
<P>This procedure is employed in the ambulatory setting and has been used to treat localised prostate cancer. The technique has been shown to lower costs and shorten hospitalisation, and represents an interesting alternative for individuals in whom surgery is contraindicated (<LINK REF="REF-Esnault-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esnault 2008</LINK>). High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation is a process of delivering a large amount of heat energy to a restricted space, where ultrasound produces necrosis with a minimum effect on surrounding structures. The first human feasibility study was an open-label, non-randomised and uncontrolled trial performed in 25 participants who were scheduled for thyroid surgery two weeks later. No serious adverse events were observed, especially those affecting the recurrent nerves or the trachea (<LINK REF="REF-Esnault-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esnault 2011</LINK>). Histological analysis provided some preliminary results about the efficacy of this method and studies are ongoing to asses the changes in nodules at longer follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Esnault-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esnault 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ultrasound-guided microwave ablation therapy</HEADING>
<P>This procedure has been used to treat benign and malignant tumours of the liver, kidneys, adrenal glands, spleen and lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Feng-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feng 2012</LINK>). The technique has been performed on an inpatient basis under continuous control of blood pressure, partial oxygen pressure and electrocardiography. Under local anaesthesia, a small incision (&lt; 2 mm in length) was made to introduce the internally cooled needle antenna into the thyroid nodule. After placement of the antenna, the ultrasound-guided microwave (MW) procedure was then performed under intravenous anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Feng-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feng 2012</LINK>). A power output of 20 W to 30 W was used during MW ablation. The penetration of the microwaves into the tissue is the consequence of a fast rotation of the molecules, growth of local energy and a rapid increase in temperature in the focused area (<LINK REF="REF-Gharib-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gharib 2013</LINK>). One small feasibility, non-randomised trial, performed in 11 participants with compressive neck symptoms, 9 with pain due to nodular goitre and 2 with Hashimoto&#8217;s thyroiditis demonstrated a nodule volume decrease of more than 50% and an improvement in cosmetic complaints (<LINK REF="REF-Feng-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feng 2012</LINK>). Currently, MW is currently considered an experimental procedure for the treatment of thyroid nodules (<LINK REF="REF-Gharib-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gharib 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>The majority of thyroid hormone studies were of short duration and severe adverse effects were not observed despite adequate TSH inhibition under LT4 suppressive therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Mainini-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mainini 1995</LINK>). Studies investigating cardiovascular and osteoporosis risks sparked several controversies about the possibilities of fractures with long-term LT4 therapy, especially in postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Bauer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leese-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leese 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stall-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stall 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uzzan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uzzan 1996</LINK>).

<P>Adverse effects were mostly few and transient, and generally related to the percutaneous injection of ethanol into solid nodules rather than cysts (<LINK REF="REF-Bennedbaek-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennedbaek 1997</LINK>). Perinodular fibrosis due to ethanol injection into solid nodules may seriously hamper subsequent surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Bennedbaek-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennedbaek 1997</LINK>).

<P>Thyroid nodules are a frequent problem seen in a medical practice, and the primary objective of their management - if not causing pressure symptoms or cosmetic complaints - is to exclude malignancy.

<P>One study investigated the effects of a combination of LT4 and iodine versus placebo, LT4 only or iodine supplementation only (<LINK REF="STD-LT4-Grussendorf-2011" TYPE="STUDY">LT4 Grussendorf 2011</LINK>). Participants had mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency (<LINK REF="APP-12" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 12</LINK>). In this review we report the findings of the comparisons of all LT4-containing regimens versus placebo. For the outcome nodule volume reduction of 50% or more, the results for placebo, iodine, LT4 and LT4 plus iodine were 6.5%, 7.1%, 9.7% and 16.2%, respectively (<LINK REF="STD-LT4-Grussendorf-2011" TYPE="STUDY">LT4 Grussendorf 2011</LINK>).</P>

Considering the 10 of 16 studies investigating this outcome independent of study duration and follow-up, and excluding the cross-over study by <LINK REF="STD-LT4-Koc-2002" TYPE="STUDY">LT4 Koc 2002</LINK>, this endpoint was achieved by 80/489 (16%) participants in the LT4 treatment groups and by 46/469 (10%) participants in the comparator groups after 6 to 24 months of follow-up (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-16 13:50:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 31 studies randomised 2952 participants to various treatments for benign thyroid nodules; LT4 trials represented the majority of studies (71%). We identified no RCTs of HIFU or MW ablation therapy for benign thyroid nodules. The duration of treatment varied according to the applied therapies: up to five years for LT4, one to three PEI ablations, one to three LP sessions and one or two RF sessions. Median follow-up was 12 months for LT4 and six months for minimally invasive therapies. Evidence was of low-to-moderate quality, and risk of performance and detection bias for subjective outcomes was high in most trials. For an overview of the main findings see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>.</P>
<P>No study evaluated all-cause mortality or health-related quality of life. Only one LT4 study provided some data on the development of thyroid cancer, and reported no abnormal cytological findings. One LP study provided limited information on costs of treatment.</P>
<P>All treatments produced a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in favour of the active intervention; however, the clinical relevance of this finding is doubtful, mainly because of the unclear relationship between nodule growth alone and malignant transformation of the nodule. Pressure symptoms or cosmetic complaints were not investigated in LT4 studies, but showed improvement following PEI, LP or RF treatments. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism in LT4-treated compared with placebo-treated participants at 12 to 18 months of follow-up were 25% versus 7%, respectively. All minimally invasive procedures induced some light-to-moderate pain and discomfort; serious adverse events were rarely reported.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-06-16 13:54:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall evidence base for the treatment of benign thyroid nodules is rather incomplete, with the majority of trials evaluating the effects of LT4 suppression therapy. Though LT4 often results in a reduction of the volume of thyroid nodules, the effects on pressure symptoms were not investigated in these included studies. Current clinical practice guidelines do not recommend the use of LT4 for benign thyroid nodules (<LINK REF="REF-ATA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATA 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gharib-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gharib 2010</LINK>); however, clinical guidelines providing guidance for the management of thyroid nodules and cancer differ in methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2013</LINK>). </P>
<P>In the included studies of this systematic review, minimally invasive therapies reduced pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints, though risk of bias for these findings was high. With regard to ultrasound-guided PEI, approximately 15% to 30% of thyroid nodules are reported to be cystic or predominantly cystic. Cyst aspiration often results in an improvement of pressure symptoms but the recurrence rate may be high. Ethanol seepage outside the treatment area may result in serious adverse events and hinder later surgery due to local fibrosis. However, depending on the availability of treatment alternatives in a given setting, ultrasound-guided PEI is currently seen as the treatment of choice for recurrent, benign cystic thyroid nodules (<LINK REF="REF-Gharib-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gharib 2013</LINK>). With regard to LP, experienced operators are needed. The precision of this procedure, especially for small thyroid nodules, is high and tissue ablation is well controlled with minimal or no extranodular tissue damage. Currently, only five trials with 192 participants could be included in this systematic review, so the evidence base is rather low. With regard to RF, experienced operators are needed. The evidence base for this procedure is also very low, currently consisting of two included trials with 70 participants. We found no RCTs on HIFU or MW therapy for benign thyroid nodules. Unfortunately, many of our predefined patient-important outcomes, such as health-related quality of life, adverse events and the development of thyroid cancer, were not (adequately) investigated. Therefore, apart from therapies for thyroid nodules causing symptoms, the question of how to best approach asymptomatic thyroid nodules remains unsolved.</P>

<P>Although we undertook a comprehensive literature search, there may be relevant unpublished studies or grey literature that we did not find. Outcome reporting bias could be addressed only partly because we had limited access to study protocols. The strength of our 'Risk of bias' evaluation is the separation between subjective and objective outcome measures, which revealed a high risk of performance and detection bias for subjective outcomes. In future updates of this review we plan to search for observational studies because it is likely that the occurrence of thyroid cancer will not be adequately addressed in RCTs. In addition, we will focus on patient-important outcome measures in future updates of this review.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Zelmanovitz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zelmanovitz 1998</LINK> reported, by means of a cumulative meta-analysis, a nodule volume decrease of 50% or more following LT4 therapy (risk difference 16.7% (95% CI 5.8 to 27.6%) but did not recommend offering this therapy to all individuals with thyroid nodules. The authors hypothesised that in participants experiencing a reduction in thyroid nodule volume, treatment could be prolonged with lower LT4 doses and TSH levels around the lower reference limit.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Castro-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castro 2002</LINK> analysed six RCTs investigating the effects of LT4 therapy given for six months or more.

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Richter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richter 2002</LINK> reported that TSH suppression therapy inhibits solitary thyroid nodule growth and reduces nodule size. However, the authors noted that "uncertainly about predictors of response or impact on outcomes that are important to participants leaves considerable doubt about the wisdom of applying suppressive therapy."</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Sdano-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sdano 2005</LINK> confirmed that LT4 therapy may lead to thyroid nodule volume reduction but did not recommend the routine use of this therapy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Yousef-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yousef 2010</LINK> noted that significant volume reductions in benign solitary thyroid nodules can be achieved and postulated that, especially in younger participants, LT4 suppression could decrease the chance of malignancy through a reduction in nodule volume size.</P>
<P>Finally, <LINK REF="REF-Fuller-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuller 2014</LINK>, in a recently published systematic review, analysed the effects of RF for the treatment of benign thyroid nodules. They included three RCTs and six observational trials. The authors noted a reduction in thyroid nodule size and improvements in symptoms and cosmetic scores. Authors were concerned about a lack of RCTs comparing RF with surgical and non-surgical treatment modalities.</P>
<P>In summary, all systematic reviews showed general agreements with our findings. However, none of these other reviews tried to evaluate all the available RCT evidence for all currently existing interventions for benign thyroid nodules.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-06-16 14:02:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is unclear whether asymptomatic thyroid nodules should be treated because in most cases they are benign, small and can be managed by active surveillance (<LINK REF="REF-Gharib-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gharib 2007</LINK>). Thyroid nodules are common in the adult population and from a clinical viewpoint, fewer than 5% of palpable thyroid nodules are malignant. Several therapeutic approaches are available, such as suppressive LT4 therapy and minimally invasive treatments (currently PEI sclerotherapy, LP, and MW, RF and HIFU ablation treatment). Although nodule volume reduction is achievable by all these treatments, the clinical relevance of this outcome measure is doubtful and the evidence base is of moderate-to-low quality. Improvements in pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints are possible using minimally invasive techniques such as PEI, LP and RF; however, the evidence base for these outcomes is of low quality. These techniques are associated with mild-to-moderate periprocedural pain. RCT evidence is currently not available for HIFU and MW. Included studies provided no information on all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life and the development of thyroid cancer. No firm evidence therefore exists to establish the optimal treatment strategy for thyroid nodules, with the possible exception of minimally invasive techniques utilised for thyroid nodules causing pressure symptoms, cosmetic complaints, or both, especially as an alternative to surgery and depending on the availability of experienced operators.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-06-16 14:08:10 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RCTs with several years of follow-up and good-quality observational studies are needed to provide evidence on all-cause mortality, the development of thyroid cancer and long-term adverse events profiles. One ongoing trial might provide additional insights into the long-term benefits and harms of LP compared with no treatment on benign thyroid nodules (<LINK REF="STD-LP-Pacella-2008" TYPE="STUDY">LP Pacella 2008</LINK>). Patient-important outcome measures, such as health-related quality of life, adverse effects, compliance and tolerance, and socioeconomic effects should be primary endpoints in future trials of thyroid nodule management.</P>

<P>Due to a significant time lag between publication of the protocol and first review draft almost all aspects of the review underwent significant changes due to improvements in methodology, reporting and standardisation. In particular, the contact person and team of authors changed. The scope of the review was enlarged from the evaluation of LT4 therapy only to encompass LT4 and all minimally invasive therapies. Consequently, the title was changed from 'Pharmacotherapy for thyroid nodules' to 'Levothyroxine or minimally invasive therapies for benign thyroid nodules'.</P>
