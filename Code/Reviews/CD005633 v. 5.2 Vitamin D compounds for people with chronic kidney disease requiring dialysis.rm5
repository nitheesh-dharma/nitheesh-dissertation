<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-11 12:16:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with reduced kidney function (chronic kidney disease; CKD) develop changes in circulating blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. The kidney gradually loses the ability to remove phosphorus from the blood and cannot activate adequate amounts of vitamin D, to maintain normal levels of calcium. The parathyroid gland senses these changes and compensates to increase calcium by elevating production and release of parathyroid hormone. These metabolic changes alter bone metabolism to release calcium and accordingly lead to bone abnormalities including altered bone production. Consequently bone deformation, bone pain, and altered risks of fracture may occur.</P>
<P>Treatment for these mineral changes in CKD include replacing activated vitamin D to suppress parathyroid hormone release. Earlier activated vitamin D preparations (calcitriol and alfacalcidol) were associated with increased circulating calcium and phosphorus levels through their direct action on the vitamin D receptor. Newer agents have since been developed that similarly suppress parathyroid hormone but may limit increases in calcium and phosphorus. Avoidance of increased calcium and phosphorus is considered important as these minerals may activate calcification in arteries and tissues, potentially leading to heart disease and tissue damage.</P>
<P>We identified 60 studies of vitamin D preparations in people with CKD and requiring dialysis involving 2773 people. No studies were designed to understand the effect of vitamin D therapy on risks of death. Vitamin D agents suppress PTH significantly compared with no treatment, however also increase both circulating calcium and phosphorus levels. Intravenous vitamin D may lower PTH more than oral vitamin D. Few studies directly compare newer vitamin D therapies with earlier (and presently more common treatment options; calcitriol and alfacalcidol); newer treatment options therefore cannot be recommended as superior to established treatments.</P>
<P>In the future, new studies will required to know if vitamin D effects on parathyroid function improve survival, bone pain, and need for parathyroid removal by surgery. It is possible that vitamin D compounds are beneficial to patients regardless of their effects on parathyroid hormone. This can only be adequately evaluated by conducting specific studies that are large enough to be sure of any treatment differences.</P>

<P>Clinical guidelines recommend vitamin D compounds to suppress serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) in chronic kidney disease (CKD), however treatment may be associated with increased serum phosphorus and calcium, which are associated with increased mortality in observational studies. Observational data also indicate vitamin D therapy may be independently associated with reduced mortality in CKD.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-13 13:51:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Sixty studies (2773 patients) were included. No formulation, route, or schedule of administration was associated with altered risks of death, bone pain, or parathyroidectomy. Marked heterogeneity in reporting of outcomes resulted in few data available for formal meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, vitamin D compounds lowered serum PTH at the expense of increasing serum phosphorus. Trends toward increased hypercalcaemia and serum calcium did not reach statistical significance but may be clinically relevant. Newer vitamin D compounds (paricalcitol, maxacalcitol, doxercalciferol) lowered PTH compared with placebo, with increased risks of hypercalcaemia, although inadequate data were available for serum phosphorus. Intravenous vitamin D may lower PTH compared with oral treatment, and be associated with lower serum phosphorus and calcium levels, although limitations in the available studies precludes a conclusive statement of treatment efficacy. Few studies were available for intermittent versus daily and intraperitoneal versus oral administration or directly comparative studies of newer versus established vitamin D compounds.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 14:33:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We confirm that vitamin D compounds suppress PTH in people with CKD and requiring dialysis although treatment is associated with clinical elevations in serum phosphorus and calcium. All studies were inadequately powered to assess the effect of vitamin D on clinical outcomes and until such studies are conducted the relative importance of changes in serum PTH, phosphorus and calcium resulting from vitamin D therapy remain unknown. Observational data showing vitamin D compounds may be associated with improved survival in CKD need to be confirmed or refuted in specifically designed RCTs.</P>

<P>All stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>- <I>Stages of chronic kidney disease (KDOQI))</I> are associated with significantly reduced survival <LINK REF="REF-Weiner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 2004</LINK>. Large scale observational data now show the altered metabolism of calcium and phosphorus in people with CKD contributes to adverse cardiovascular and mortality outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ganesh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganesh 2001</LINK>). The most frequent pattern of biochemical changes which occur early in CKD include increased serum phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, while levels of serum calcium may be low, normal or elevated (<LINK REF="REF-Coen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coen 2002</LINK>). These abnormalities are associated with abnormal bone mineralization, increased bone fragility (<LINK REF="REF-Alem-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alem 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piraino-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piraino 1988</LINK>), muscle weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Lazaro-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazaro 1980</LINK>), and vascular and soft tissue calcification (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Leo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Leo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldsmith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldsmith 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:41:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bone and soft tissue changes in CKD result from the interaction between abnormalities of vitamin D metabolism and parathyroid gland activity (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>&#8722; <I>Mechanisms for abnormal mineral metabolism in chronic kidney disease</I>). The term vitamin D refers to the secosterols vitamin D<SUB>2 </SUB>(ergocalciferol), vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB> (cholecalciferol), and the metabolites and derivatives of these molecules. Vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB> is produced primarily following conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin with ultraviolet irradiation. Vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB> is not active and must be hydroxylated in the liver to produce the intermediate molecule, 25 hydroxyvitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>. This is converted to active vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB> (called calcitriol <I>or</I> 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>) in the normal kidney. Vitamin D<SUB>2</SUB> is derived from plant and fungal sources and must be activated in a similar way to vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB> to produce the active form, 1,25 dihydroxyergocalciferol. The crucial role of calcitriol deficiency in the genesis of abnormal bone, vascular, and tissue mineralization provides the rationale for its use for treating bone disease in CKD. Vitamin D maintains normal calcium homeostasis via the vitamin D receptor to increase intestinal calcium absorption and to modulate mineral mobilisation from bone.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:36:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interventions which are widely used to reduce complications of mineral metabolism in people with CKD include vitamin D compounds, calcium and non-calcium containing phosphate binders, and calcimimetic agents. Although vitamin D compounds reduce PTH levels, they may also increase calcium and phosphorus levels, which are associated with poorer cardiovascular and mortality outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Block-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Block-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ganesh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganesh 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Newer vitamin D compounds (maxacalcitol (22-oxacalcitriol), doxercalciferol, paricalcitol, and falecalcitriol) have been developed to provide similar or superior dose-equivalent suppression of PTH in experimental or small clinical studies, without increasing calcium and phosphorus levels to the same extent. This allows a potential for improved survival when compared with established vitamin D compounds (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) (<LINK REF="REF-Hirata-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirata 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slatopolsky-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slatopolsky 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teng 2003</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-08-10 15:36:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the potential opposing effects of vitamin D (improving serum PTH but increasing serum calcium and phosphorus), we evaluated available randomised controlled studies (RCTs) to assess the safety and efficacy of vitamin D compounds on biochemical, bone, and cardiovascular outcomes in people with CKD requiring dialysis together with a summary of optimal schedules and routes of administration.</P>

<P>From 1455 citations, 149 underwent full text review<I>. </I>Full text review excluded a further 48 citations as they were not randomised, were review articles, defined outcomes unrelated to bone disease, were case reports/letters, or were pharmacokinetic studies. Sixteen studies reported RCTs of vitamin D compounds in people with other stages of CKD, which are reported in a separate systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2009</LINK>). Seventy eight publications reporting 60 studies (2773 patients) were included in this review. Most studies were small, with nine studies enrolling more than 75 patients and only 27 studies including more than 30 patients. Two ongoing studies of vitamin D compounds for people requiring dialysis were identified from studies registries (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00257920" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00257920</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00397475" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00397475</LINK>) and will be assessed upon publication.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-11 14:59:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review confirms the efficacy of vitamin D compounds to reduce serum PTH in people with CKD and requiring dialysis. Vitamin D compounds while lowering serum PTH when compared with placebo were associated with increased risks of hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia. Although these outcomes were reported in few studies in extractable format and the findings did not reach statistical significance, they may be clinically relevant. Established vitamin D compounds (calcitriol, alfacalcidol, or 24,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol) suppressed PTH compared with placebo although few data were available for treatment effects on serum calcium or phosphorus. Subjects receiving established vitamin D compounds were not more likely to experience hypercalcaemia and more likely to be withdrawn from therapy due to this outcome. Newer vitamin D compounds (designed to suppress PTH with lower calcaemic and phosphataemic action that earlier vitamin D compounds) also suppressed serum PTH but were associated with more hypercalcaemia than placebo. No data were available for hyperphosphataemia and a single study had data extractable for end of treatment calcium and phosphorus.</P>
<P>No efficacy data were extractable from two studies comparing an active vitamin D compound with vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>. Single studies reported the effect of calcitriol versus another established vitamin D compound or established versus newer vitamin D compounds on serum PTH; meta-analysis was not possible.</P>
<P>IV vitamin D administration resulted in lower PTH concentrations and was associated with lower serum phosphorus, and a trend toward lower serum calcium levels, although exclusion of a study that administered higher vitamin D doses to the IV group resulted in no difference between oral and IV vitamin D compounds for suppressing PTH. High-level heterogeneity in the analysis for IV versus oral vitamin D compounds on both serum PTH and calcium suggest caution is needed in the interpretation of these results.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis was not possible to evaluate the effects of either intraperitoneal or subcutaneous versus<I> </I>oral vitamin D administration or for intermittent versus daily administration on serum PTH suppression.</P>
<P>Marked differences in methods of reporting bone histomorphometry combined with the number of differing treatment comparisons and the small proportion of patients consenting to undergo bone biopsy resulted in few data available for these outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-08-11 14:59:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This meta-analysis analyses the total available evidence for vitamin D compounds in CKD for people requiring dialysis. We have published a companion intervention review in this issue of the Cochrane Library of RCTs evaluating <I>Vitamin D compounds for people with chronic kidney disease and not requiring dialysis </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2009</LINK>)<I>.</I>The results in that review and the present analysis are striking for the paucity of data for both clinical and biochemical outcomes.</P>
<P>While 60 RCTs examined vitamin D compounds in people with CKD requiring dialysis, meta-analysis was severely limited by the number of differing comparisons and the heterogeneity in reporting of outcomes, particularly serum PTH and bone histomorphometry. Effects of vitamin D compounds on biochemical outcomes including PTH were available in few small studies, resulting in considerable imprecision for point estimates of treatment effects. Most importantly, all studies were not designed to examine the effect of vitamin D treatment on mortality and none were powered to understand the effect of treatment on other important clinical outcomes, including resolution of bone pain, change in stature, risk of fracture, or need for parathyroidectomy.</P>
<P>Many of the studies were designed and conducted before observational studies in the 1990's found consistent associations between abnormalities of bone and mineral metabolism (serum calcium, phosphorus, and PTH), with increased risks for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ganesh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganesh 2001</LINK>). Studies of vitamin D compounds in CKD since have also not kept apace with findings linking calcium and phosphorus with adverse mortality outcomes, and, to date, no study of vitamin D compounds has been powered to examine mortality and cardiovascular endpoints in CKD. This is especially important given that vitamin D treatment may be associated with increased serum calcium and phosphorus and it is necessary to understand the relative importance of treatment effects on serum PTH, phosphorus and calcium on outcomes during vitamin D therapy. Indeed, studies identified in major clinical studies registries that are currently being conducted are also not powered to examine treatment effects for clinical outcomes in CKD and requiring dialysis.</P>
<P>Only one study reported efficacy data directly comparing newer with established vitamin D compounds. The relative efficacies of newer and established vitamin D compounds for PTH suppression and risks of hypercalcaemia or hyperphosphataemia remain unknown. IV administration of vitamin D was superior to oral administration for PTH suppression but with the removal of <LINK REF="STD-Liou-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Liou 1994</LINK> from the analysis (which prescribed a higher dose of vitamin D to the IV group), the difference in PTH concentration was not different between IV and oral administration.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-08-11 11:54:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Included studies were commonly reported incompletely and of poor quality, although this may reflect pre-2001 CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) practices (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>). Allocation concealment was adequate in only 5/60 (8%) studies. Eighteen studies reported blinding of participants and investigators while 10 reported blinding of outcome assessors. Fourteen studies reported loss of follow-up or exclusion from data analysis exceeding 20% and in 11 studies completeness to follow-up was not clear. Absence of allocation concealment, blinding and ITT analysis tends to lead to an over-estimate of the observed treatment effects. Many studies were too small to detect any differences between treatments even if differences did exist, particularly for bone histology outcomes. Only nine studies enrolled more than 75 patients and 27 studies included more than 30 patients. Most studies provided outcome data qualitatively as normal or not statistically different without providing the numeric results with an estimate of variance.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-08-11 11:55:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review is greatly limited by insufficient extractable data for all outcomes (clinical, bone, and biochemical outcomes) increasing bias toward studies that reported these outcomes in an extractable format.</P>
<P>This was most apparent when considering the effect of vitamin D compounds to suppress parathyroid hormone. Fewer than one-third (19/60 studies) reported serum PTH at the end of treatment and due to the heterogeneity of treatment comparisons this resulted in eight or fewer studies in each meta-analysis for this outcome. Increasingly, the efficacy of newer vitamin D compounds (particularly paricalcitol) is measured as a percentage reduction in baseline PTH. This appears an initiative driven by study conduct or direct study funding by pharmaceutical companies. These PTH outcomes were consistently more extractable as they did not rely on an estimate of variance for inclusion. As these data were more available for meta-analysis than end of treatment PTH, they likely have biased the results of this review to favour the outcomes reported in these studies. This change in reporting of serum PTH also precludes the direct comparison of these newer studies (predominantly of paricalcitol) with older studies that examine calcitriol and alfacalcidol.</P>
<P>Further, when data were reported in descriptive format only (and therefore not extractable) the descriptive results frequently reported no difference between treatment comparisons. This would suggest that inclusion of extractable data only in the present meta-analyses might bias the analyses toward finding a difference between two treatment groups where no true difference exists (overestimating the treatment effect). Consistency in reporting of biochemical outcomes in all future would reduce this bias.</P>
<P>The principle adverse effects of clinical concern for vitamin D compounds are hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia. However, these were reported as either one or more episodes of hypercalcaemia/hyperphosphataemia or end of treatment serum values. Due to the number of differing treatment comparisons and this variability in reporting, meta-analyses for treatment effects on hypercalcaemia all contained six or fewer studies and hyperphosphataemia included five or fewer studies, reducing the strength of conclusions that can be drawn from the review.</P>
<P>In future research, consistency of outcome reporting would greatly enhance comparability between studies and treatment effects for clinicians and consumers. Dual reporting of serum PTH, phosphorus and calcium as dichotomous variables (suppression below baseline, hypercalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia) and end of treatment values would also assist comparability particularly between studies from differing eras.</P>

<P>Observational studies support an association between vitamin D therapy and improved clinical outcomes in adults with CKD (<LINK REF="REF-Dobrez-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dobrez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalantar_x002d_Zadeh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalantar-Zadeh 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shoji-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoji 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teng 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tentori-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tentori 2006</LINK>). In four retrospective studies, treatment with a vitamin D compound (alfacalcidol, doxercalciferol, paricalcitol, or calcitriol) was associated with a reduced unadjusted hazard for death compared with no treatment in 117,068 patients receiving dialysis (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shoji-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoji 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teng 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tentori-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tentori 2006</LINK>). Furthermore, the administration of doxercalciferol or paricalcitol was reported to reduce risk of death or hospitalisation in people receiving HD when compared with calcitriol (3 studies, 86,573 patients) (<LINK REF="REF-Dobrez-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dobrez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tentori-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tentori 2006</LINK>). While observational studies have inherent limitations through unmeasured confounders (e.g. baseline co morbid conditions, nutritional status, or concomitant therapy) and selection bias, these large scale studies suggest a clinical advantage for vitamin D therapy in CKD that demands exploration through adequately powered RCTs.</P>
<P>We found no evidence of superiority of newer vitamin D compounds over established vitamin D compounds for any outcome, when these agents were compared directly in RCTs. Our findings are consistent with the National Kidney Foundation KDOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines for bone metabolism and disease in CKD (<LINK REF="REF-NKF_x002d_Guidelines-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NKF-Guidelines 2003</LINK>), suggesting patients treated with HD or PD and elevated serum PTH should receive an active vitamin D sterol (such as calcitriol, alfacalcidol, paricalcitol, or doxercalciferol) however, we cannot conclude whether newer vitamin D analogs are superior in terms of clinical outcomes or with regard to serum phosphorus and calcium levels compared with calcitriol and alfacalcidol. Our findings also support current CARI guidelines for CKD stage 5, published in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Elder-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elder 2006</LINK>) and the Canadian Society of Nephrology guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.csnscn.ca/">http://www.csnscn.ca/</A>) which indicate that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of newer vitamin D analogs (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> &#8722; <I>Current guidelines for the use of vitamin D Compounds in chronic kidney disease </I>for a summary of the current guidelines<I>). </I>
</P>
<P>We were unable to find sufficient data for the optimal route or schedule of administration of vitamin D compounds. IV administration of vitamin D was superior to oral administration for PTH suppression and maintaining phosphorus levels but with the removal of <LINK REF="STD-Liou-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Liou 1994</LINK> from the analysis (which prescribed a higher dose of vitamin D to the IV group compared with the oral group), the difference in PTH concentration was not different between IV and oral administration. Due to the significant limitations of the presently available studies, our findings do not support the KDOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines for people receiving dialysis (<LINK REF="REF-NKF_x002d_Guidelines-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NKF-Guidelines 2003</LINK>) in recommending that IV administration of calcitriol is more effective than daily oral calcitriol in lowering serum PTH levels.</P>
<P>In conclusion, based upon contemporary epidemiological standards for assessing the validity of interventions, vitamin D compounds remain of unproven clinical efficacy in people with CKD requiring dialysis. While vitamin D treatment suppresses serum PTH, the clinical consequences of this intervention are unknown. This is despite 60 RCTs in CKD conducted over 30 years. Biochemical and experimental data suggest that effects of vitamin D compounds may have opposing influences on mortality in this high risk population, but have been assessed in fewer than 3,000 people requiring dialysis and within studies that were not designed to assess the effects of treatment on clinical outcomes.</P>

<LI>Understanding the effects of vitamin D compounds on clinical outcomes (hospital admissions, cardiovascular outcomes, fracture, bone pain, muscle weakness, and mortality) for people with CKD and receiving dialysis requires adequately powered RCTs.</LI>
<LI>Recognition in observational studies that vitamin D therapy may be associated with lower mortality in people with CKD and requiring dialysis suggests that a fixed dose RCT of vitamin D should be considered (higher dose versus lower dose or a placebo-controlled study) with mortality as the primary outcome.</LI>
<LI>Serum PTH must be validated as a surrogate marker for outcomes (bone and clinical) in CKD. RCTs should target differing levels of PTH and measure effects on clinical outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Consistent reporting of outcomes (both patient-centred and biochemical) is necessary to ensure comparability of studies for clinicians and consumers. For evaluating efficacy of serum PTH suppression, studies should report the end of treatment PTH and not solely report an arbitrary measure such as two or more periods of &gt; 30% reduction in serum PTH. If the more recent trend of reporting PTH suppression as either &gt; 30% or &gt; 50% below baseline continues, it must be validated as an outcome that is directly causal to improved clinical outcomes (including bone pain, need for parathyroidectomy, mortality, cardiovascular events).</LI>
<LI>Given the expense but theoretically attractive profile of the newer vitamin D analogs (paricalcitol, maxacalcitol, doxercalciferol) future RCTs should prioritise directly comparing the efficacy of these agents against established vitamin D sterols (calcitriol, alfacalcidol) on mortality and patient centred outcomes.</LI>

<P>Patients treated with HD or PD with serum levels of intact PTH levels &gt; 300 pg/mL) (33.0 pmol/L) should receive an active vitamin D sterol (such as calcitriol, alfacalcidol, paricalcitol, or doxercalciferol) to reduce the serum levels of PTH to a target range of 150-300 pg/mL (16.5-33.0 pmol/L).

<P>The intermittent, IV administration of calcitriol is more effective than daily oral calcitriol in lowering serum PTH levels. (EVIDENCE)</P>
<P>In patients with corrected serum calcium and/or phosphorus levels above the target range, a study of alternative vitamin D analogs, such as paricalcitol or doxercalciferol may be warranted. (OPINION)</P>

<P>Oral calcitriol (intermittent or pulsed) is effective at lowering parathyroid hormone levels in patients on PD (Level II evidence).</P>
<P>Vitamin D and its analogs, either given orally daily, orally intermittently, or intravenously are effective at lowering PTH levels in patients on HD (Level I/II evidence).</P>
<P>Oral calcitriol is effective for the prevention or treatment of hyperparathyroidism in most patients on HD or PD. IV calcitriol may be more effective at lowering PTH levels and be less likely to cause hypercalcaemia but the lack of well-designed studies of sufficient size prevents a more definitive statement.</P>
<P>Vitamin D analogs are effective at lowering PTH but clinical studies proving their effectiveness with fewer side-effects prevents are either lacking or not definitive. On the basis of current evidence there is little reason to recommend their use over oral or IV calcitriol.</P>

<P>The relative importance of hyperparathyroidism as a risk factor for premature vascular disease is difficult to determine from observational studies and no informative RCTs exist.</P>
<P>There is no doubt that a serum PTH concentration over 4 times the normal limit is associated with increased risk of significant bone disease and should therefore be avoided by medical (or if necessary surgical) management of hyperparathyroidism.</P>
<P>In the absence of firm evidence, individual clinicians should decide on the degree to which hyperparathyroidism should be corrects and how this should be achieved.</P>
