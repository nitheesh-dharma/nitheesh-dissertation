<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-13 15:22:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traumatic events can have a significant impact on individuals', families' and communities' abilities to cope. In the past, single session interventions such as psychological debriefing were widely used with the aim of preventing continuing psychological difficulties. However, previous reviews have found that single session individual interventions have not been effective at preventing post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A range of other forms of intervention have been developed to try to prevent individuals exposed to trauma developing PTSD. This review evaluated the results of 11 studies that tested a diverse range of psychological interventions aimed at preventing PTSD. The results did not find any evidence to support the use of an intervention offered to everyone. There was some evidence that multiple session interventions may result in worse outcome than no intervention for some individuals. Further research is required to evaluate the most effective ways of providing psychological help in the early stages after a traumatic event.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-04-22 19:47:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The prevention of long-term psychological distress following traumatic events is a major concern. Systematic reviews have suggested that individual Psychological Debriefing is not an effective intervention at preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recently other forms of intervention have been developed with the aim of preventing PTSD.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-04-04 17:15:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To examine the efficacy of multiple session early psychological interventions commenced within three months of a traumatic event aimed at preventing PTSD. Single session individual/group psychological interventions were excluded.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-05-13 16:54:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Computerised databases were searched systematically, the most recent search was conducted in August 2008. The Journal of Traumatic Stress and the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology were handsearched for the last two years.

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-05-13 15:21:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of any multiple session early psychological intervention or treatment (two or more sessions) designed to prevent symptoms of PTSD.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-04-22 19:57:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were entered using Review Manager software. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed individually by two review authors. Data were analysed for summary effects using Review Manager 4.2. Mean difference was used for meta-analysis of continuous outcomes and relative risk for dichotomous outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-13 17:36:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven studies with a total of 941 participants were found to have evaluated brief psychological interventions aimed at preventing PTSD in individuals exposed to a specific traumatic event, examining a heterogeneous range of interventions. Eight studies were entered into meta-analysis. There was no observable difference between treatment and control conditions on primary outcome measures for these interventions at initial outcome (k=5, n=479; RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17). There was a trend for increased self-report of PTSD symptoms at 3 to 6 month follow-up in those who received an intervention (k=4, n=292; SMD 0.23; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.46). Two studies compared a memory structuring intervention against supportive listening. There was no evidence supporting the efficacy of this intervention.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The results suggest that no psychological intervention can be recommended for routine use following traumatic events and that multiple session interventions, like single session interventions, may have an adverse effect on some individuals. The clear practice implication of this is that, at present, multiple session interventions aimed at all individuals exposed to traumatic events should not be used. Further, better designed studies that explore new approaches to early intervention are now required.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-05-13 15:23:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is now a large body of literature to show that traumatic experience can cause significant psychological difficulties for large numbers of people, through events such as natural disasters (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-McFarlane-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarlane 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goenjian-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goenjian 1993</LINK>), man made disasters (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Gleser-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleser 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baum-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1990</LINK>), military combat (<LINK REF="REF-Kulka-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kulka 1990</LINK>), rape (<LINK REF="REF-Kilpatrick-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilpatrick 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crummier-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crummier 1991</LINK>), violent crime (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Hough-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hough 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-North-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">North 1994</LINK>) and road traffic accidents (<LINK REF="REF-Ehlers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehlers 1998</LINK>). Many individuals show great resilience in the face of such experiences and will manifest short-lived or sub-clinical stress reactions that diminish over time (<LINK REF="REF-Bonanno-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonanno 2004</LINK>). Most people recover without medical or psychological assistance (<LINK REF="REF-McNally-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNally 2003</LINK>). Nevertheless, a range of psychological difficulties may develop following trauma in some of those who have been exposed. These include depressive reactions, phobic reactions and other anxiety disorders, alcohol and other substance misuse, and less frequently obsessive compulsive disorder, psychotic reactions and conversion symptoms. Some individuals display symptoms consistent with Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) in the early phase after a traumatic event. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common enduring mental health problems to occur and has probably received most attention in the research literature.</P>
<P>PTSD is defined by DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) as a syndrome which is comprised of three clusters of symptoms: repeated re-experiencing of the trauma; avoidance of reminders and symptoms of numbing; and symptoms of heightened arousal. For a diagnosis of acute PTSD to be made symptoms have to have been present for more than a month, with chronic PTSD being the presence of symptoms for three months or longer. Reported rates of acute PTSD have varied across different trauma populations from 23% in motor vehicle accident victims (<LINK REF="REF-Ehlers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehlers 1998</LINK>) to 47% in rape victims (<LINK REF="REF-Rothbaum-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothbaum 1992</LINK>). Epidemiological research suggests that a third of individuals who develop acute PTSD remain symptomatic for six years or longer (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1995</LINK>). The impact on social, interpersonal and occupational functioning for those who develop chronic PTSD can be very significant across the life span (<LINK REF="REF-Litz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Litz 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-04-30 14:26:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To date, Cochrane reviews have considered psychological intervention of PTSD (<LINK REF="REF-Bisson-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisson 2007a</LINK>) and pharmacological treatment of PTSD (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2006</LINK>). A large number of RCTs have demonstrated the effectiveness of some psychological interventions in treating chronic PTSD (<LINK REF="REF-Foa-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foa 2008</LINK>). Trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy (see <LINK REF="REF-Bisson-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisson 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2005</LINK>) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) (<LINK REF="REF-NCCMH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCMH 2005</LINK>) have the strongest evidence base. Evidence based interventions are not effective for all and many individuals remain symptomatic, even after treatment is completed (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Over the past 25 years or so, clinicians have been increasingly involved in attempts to develop interventions that might mitigate against the effects of trauma and prevent the onset of chronic PTSD. For a number of years single session interventions such as psychological debriefing were a widely used and popular form of intervention. Debriefing came under increasing scrutiny in the 1990's and has been the subject of a Cochrane review first published in 1998 and recently updated (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2002</LINK>). Similar findings have been reported in other reviews as well (<LINK REF="REF-van-Emmerik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Emmerik 2002</LINK>) The lack of evidence for the efficacy of single session individual debriefing has therefore led many experts in the field to caution against its use (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-NCCMH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCMH 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-02-24 15:02:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Increasingly the field has turned its attention to other models of intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Bisson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brewin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brewin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ehlers-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehlers 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Litz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Litz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Litz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Litz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gray-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2005</LINK>). These models have included multiple session interventions aimed at any individual exposed to a traumatic event with the aim of preventing the development of PTSD, interventions aimed at individuals with a known or suspected specific risk factor and interventions aimed at individuals who are clearly symptomatic. For example, psychological first aid (<LINK REF="REF-NCTSN_x002f_NCP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCTSN/NCP 2006</LINK>) has been increasingly prescribed as an initial form of intervention. Psychological first aid refers to the provision of basic comfort, information, support and attendance to immediate practical and emotional needs. Brief forms of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), offered from around two weeks post incident, have been proposed as interventions to prevent the onset of PTSD and to treat those who develop symptoms in the early stages after a trauma. Interventions aimed at enhancing social support have also been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Litz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Litz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ormerod-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ormerod 2002</LINK>). A number of recent studies have been conducted to evaluate some of these forms of intervention.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-02-01 18:49:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some experts in the field (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Bisson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brewin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewin 2008</LINK>) advocate interventions that are targeted at those who are most at risk of continuing psychological difficulty. However, in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event there is often a strong imperative from health care services, the public and politicians to provide psychological intervention to everyone who has been exposed regardless of symptomatology. The issues of who should be offered the intervention, timing of intervention and mode of intervention are at this time still contentious. This review aims to clarify the current evidence base by conducting a review of multiple session early interventions aimed at preventing PTSD in individuals who have been exposed to a traumatic event but have not been identified as suffering from any specific psychological difficulties.</P>

<P>Any individual exposed to a traumatic event. For the purposes of the review, an event was considered to be traumatic if it was likely to meet criterion A1 of DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) for PTSD. Therefore, the majority of participants in included studies were considered to have experienced, witnessed, or been confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.</P>
<P>Studies that enlisted participants who met a certain symptom profile (e.g. ASD, acute PTSD, depression) were excluded from the review.</P>

</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-18 06:47:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review considered any multiple session early psychological intervention designed to prevent symptoms of traumatic stress, and begun within three months of a traumatic incident. Single session interventions were excluded because they are the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2002</LINK>). Early psychological interventions aimed at treating individuals who were identified as symptomatic (e.g. with ASD or acute PTSD) is subject to a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2010</LINK>) conducted at the same time as this review.</P>
<P>For the purpose of the review a psychological intervention included any specified non-pharmaceutical intervention aimed at preventing the onset of PTSD offered by one or more health professional or lay person, with contact between therapist and participant on at least two occasions. We decided a priori that eligible intervention categories would include forms of psychological therapy based on a specified theoretical model. Potential intervention categories were identified from previous PTSD based reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bisson-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisson 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCCMH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCMH 2005</LINK>). These were:</P>
<P>1. Trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) - any psychological intervention that predominantly uses trauma focused cognitive, behavioural or cognitive-behavioural techniques. This category includes exposure therapy.<BR/>2. Stress management/relaxation - any psychological intervention that predominantly uses non-trauma focused cognitive, behavioural or cognitive-behavioural techniques.<BR/>3. TF-CBT Group Therapy - any approach delivered in a group setting that predominantly uses trauma focused cognitive, behavioural or cognitive-behavioural techniques.</P>
<P>4. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) - any psychological intervention that predominantly uses non-trauma focused cognitive, behavioural or cognitive-behavioural techniques. This category excludes the use of exposure therapy.<BR/>5. Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) - any psychological intervention that predominantly uses EMDR.<BR/>6. Non-trauma focused CBT group therapy - any approach delivered in a group that predominantly uses non-trauma focused cognitive, behavioural or cognitive-behavioural techniques.<BR/>7. Other psychological intervention - any psychological intervention that predominantly uses non-trauma focused techniques that would not be considered cognitive, behavioural or cognitive-behavioural techniques. This category includes non-directive counselling, psychodynamic therapy and hypnotherapy.</P>
<P>We also decided a priori that eligible interventions would include non-pharmaceutical interventions that were not based or only partially based on a specified theoretical model but that nevertheless aim to reduce symptoms of traumatic stress, to include the following categories:</P>
<P>8. Education or information giving intervention - Any intervention which predominantly provides only education or information about possible future difficulties and/ or offers advice about constructive means of coping.<BR/>9. Stepped care - Any a priori specified care plan which offers intervention in a stepped care manner based on the continuing needs of the included participants.<BR/>10. Interventions aimed at enhancing positive coping skills and improving overall well being - Any non-pharmaceutical intervention which aims to improve well being such as an occupational therapy intervention, an exercise based intervention or a guided self help intervention.</P>
<P>We decided a priori that the trials considered would include:<BR/>1. Psychological intervention vs waiting list or usual care control.<BR/>2. Psychological intervention vs other psychological intervention.</P>
<P>From prior knowledge of the literature, it was clear that a number of different forms of intervention had been evaluated on differing participant groups. Several studies were thought to have offered intervention to all individuals exposed. Others were known to have evaluated interventions for those who met inclusion based on predictors of future risk. We decided to undertake comparison of all interventions together initially and to undertake sub-analysis on specific interventions and interventions targeted at individuals meeting specific risk factors as appropriate. Given the pattern of naturalistic improvement for many following exposure to a traumatic event it also seemed appropriate to consider separate analysis between studies that began shortly after a traumatic event and those that began later.</P>

<BR/>The Cochrane Collaboration Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK. A references register and a studies based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 24,000 reports of trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 70% of these references have been coded and tagged to individual trials. These coded records are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register.</P>
<P>References to trials for inclusion in the CCDAN registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO; quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); annual searches of PSYNDEX, LILACS, AMED and CINAHL and review specific searches of additional databases. Details of trials are also sourced from international trials registers, drug companies, the hand-searching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A list of CCDAN&#8217;s generic search strategies can be found in the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section of the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/DEPRESSN/frame.html">Group&#8217;s module text.</A>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-04-30 14:15:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This was assessed in two ways. Firstly, two authors rated studies according to the standard approach described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>), which considers sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of assessors and reporting of loss to follow-up. Each study was then assessed on additional methodological and reporting items identified as especially relevant by the authors. Many recent Cochrane reviews had used a 23 item scale developed by <LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2001</LINK> to assess study quality. However, the <LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2001</LINK>scale includes a number of items (e.g., blinding of participants) that are of limited relevance to a psychological intervention. A checklist with an additional 19 criteria was therefore developed for this review to focus on key methodological issues pertinent to psychological interventions research in the traumatic stress field. In developing this checklist consideration was initially given to recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Foa-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foa 1997</LINK>) for seven "gold standards" required in RCTs investigating interventions for PTSD. These standards relate to clearly defined target symptoms, use of reliable and valid outcome measures, use of blind and independent assessors, assessor reliability, manualised specific and replicable treatment, concealment of allocation and treatment adherence. Further criteria related to non-confounded conditions, use of multi-modal outcome measures, reported level of therapist training and use of a control or comparison group were drawn from <LINK REF="REF-Hertlein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hertlein 2004</LINK>. One criterion based on a clear definition of the population to receive intervention was based on recommendations made by <LINK REF="REF-Kenardy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenardy 1996</LINK>, as used by <LINK REF="REF-Rose-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2002</LINK>. A further nine criteria addressing adequate follow-up, report of side effects, report of exclusions and refusals, comparability, intent to treat analysis, presentation of results, power calculation, appropriate statistical analysis and justified conclusions were drawn from the <LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2001</LINK> scale.</P>
<P>Cases of disagreement were initially discussed between the two rating authors. In cases where disagreement persisted advice was sought from a third author in order to make a final decision. In developing this scale it was not the study group's intention to report an overall quality assessment score, but rather to allow for reporting on and discussion of specific study quality and reporting issues.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-04-04 19:36:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Continuous outcomes were analysed using weighted mean difference (WMD) when all trials had measured outcome on the same scale. When some trials measured outcomes on different scales the standardised mean difference (SMD) was used. Relative risk (RR) was used as the main categorical outcome measure as this is more widely used than odds ratio (OR) in health related practice. All outcomes were presented using 95% confidence intervals.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2009-04-26 16:31:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For trials which had a crossover design only results from the first randomisation period were considered. If the trial was a three (or more) armed trial, consideration was given to undertaking pair-wise meta-analysis with each arm, depending upon the nature of the intervention in each arm and the relevance to the review objectives. Management of cluster randomised trials followed guidance provided in the Cochrane Handbook.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2009-04-23 11:51:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When intention to treat (ITT) data were available, these were reported in the results. Attempts were made to access ITT data wherever possible. In cases where partial ITT data and partial completer data were available, separate ITT and completer analysis was undertaken. Completer only analysis was performed when this was the only data source available. In cases where there was inadequate information within a particular paper to undertake analysis, attempts were made to compute missing data from other information available within the paper, using guidance provided in the Cochrane Handbook. For example, in a number of cases dichotomous ITT outcomes (PTSD diagnosis) were calculated by adding the number of treatment drop-outs to the number of completers continuing to have the diagnosis. For continuous data when only the SE or t-statistics or p values were reported, SDs were calculated using guidance provided in the Cochrane Handbook. When imputation was not possible or when further clarification was required, we attempted to contact the authors concerned with a request for additional information. In cases where no further useable data were available, the study was not included in further analysis.</P>

<P>A visual inspection of the forest plots was initially used to explore for possible heterogeneity. Heterogeneity between studies was also measured by observing the I-squared test and the chi-squared test (p &lt; 0 .10).

An I-squared of 30% to 50% was considered to indicate moderate heterogeneity. An I-squared of more than 50% was considered to indicate notable heterogeneity.

<P>Methodological quality of many of the studies included was poor. The process of recruitment used by <LINK REF="STD-Brom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Brom 1993</LINK> was judged to be of particular concern as recruitment took place prior to invitation to potential participants to join the study.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Additional methodological and reporting issues</HEADING>
<P>The overall quality of the studies in relation to other methodological and reporting issues was variable. All of the studies included in the review were considered to have defined clear targets for inclusion and to have used at least one reliable and valid outcome measure to assess key outcome variables. For a summary of the reviewers judgements on other criteria see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2 </LINK>. Of note, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2007</LINK>) gave information about whether or not participants experienced adverse effects which might have been attributable to their intervention. They reported the results of post-hoc analysis which suggested that individuals in the counselling intervention with a past psychiatric history tended to do worse at 6 month follow-up. Use of withdrawals in analysis is dealt with in "Loss to follow-up" above.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-04-26 15:15:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 11 RCTs of early multiple session psychological interventions starting within three months of a traumatic event that were designed to prevent traumatic stress symptoms. These studies included a total of 941 participants. Nine studies with 775 provided data available for analyses. There was no evidence that a multiple session intervention aimed at everyone following a traumatic event was effective. There was a trend that just failed to reach statistical significance for no intervention to result in less self-reported PTSD symptoms at 3-6 month follow-up than a multiple session intervention. The heterogeneous nature of the interventions included means that there remains uncertainty regarding the efficacy of specific interventions.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-04-30 14:26:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this review directly address the primary review question. It was possible to perform meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials of multiple session psychological interventions aimed at preventing PTSD in individuals who have been exposed to a traumatic event but have not been identified as suffering from any specific psychological difficulties. However, meta-analyses could not be performed for all outcomes and the limited number of studies, their small sample sizes and heterogeneity (see below) complicate interpretation. The question of how interventions fare against another psychological intervention could only be answered for memory structuring and not for other interventions.</P>
<P>Given the prominence of cognitive behavioural interventions in the evidence base for psychological therapies it is surprising that only one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Andre-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Andre 1997</LINK>) identified in this review evaluated a CBT intervention, although <LINK REF="STD-Kazak-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kazak 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marchand-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marchand 2006</LINK> included CBT components in their interventions. <LINK REF="STD-Andre-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Andre 1997</LINK> reported a significant decrease in intrusive symptoms and anxiety in their treatment group. Unfortunately, data provided in their paper did not permit inclusion in meta-analysis. Counselling was the intervention most frequently evaluated. The evidence reviewed did not provide any support for its effectiveness as a preventative intervention. </P>
<P>There is a need for some caution in the applicability of the trend for no intervention to result in less self-reported PTSD symptoms at 3-6 month follow-up than multiple session intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), as findings for PTSD diagnosis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) in the same periods were in the opposite direction. Four studies contributed to each analysis, with <LINK REF="STD-Marchand-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marchand 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zatzick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zatzick 2001</LINK> being common to both. The reason for this apparent contradictory finding is not clear. However, there was significant clinical heterogeneity in the studies involved in these comparisons. Intervention participants in <LINK REF="STD-Marchand-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marchand 2006</LINK> appeared to fare worst in self-reported PTSD symptoms, compared to those in the control condition. This study used an adapted debriefing intervention. Debriefing interventions have previously been associated with worse outcome at longer term follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2002</LINK>). Data from <LINK REF="STD-Brom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Brom 1993</LINK> contributed most in terms of weight to PTSD symptom analysis and it should be noted that there are particular methodological concerns with this study, in terms of recruitment and allocation. Contradictory findings from <LINK REF="STD-Zatzick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zatzick 2001</LINK> are difficult to explain.</P>
<P>Participants in the studies included in the review were exposed to single individual traumatic events and there were no studies of larger scale traumatic events such as disasters or wars which limits the external validity of the results across the full range of traumatic events.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, only one study reported adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2007</LINK>) and it is unclear whether or not any adverse effects occurred in the other studies. The absence of tolerability assessment is a key shortcoming in the RCTs identified and one that has previously been noted in psychological treatment studies of chronic PTSD (<LINK REF="REF-Bisson-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisson 2007b</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-05-13 17:01:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six RCTs with 479 participants were included in the primary meta-analysis of ITT rates of PTSD. Other analyses included fewer RCTs and participants and therefore the results are likely to be less robust, with an increased risk of chance findings. The inclusion of five studies (479 participants) for the primary outcome, together with the lack of difference between the ITT and completers' only findings suggests this result may be robust. However, this must be considered in the light of heterogeneity and methodological quality issues.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>There was evidence of both clinical and statistical heterogeneity in the included studies. Although all the trials attempted to prevent PTSD symptoms, the nature of the interventions included in the meta-analyses was quite diverse. The interventions included in the primary analysis were two sessions of counselling (one face to face and one by telephone (<LINK REF="STD-Gamble-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gamble 2005</LINK>), two sessions of adapted critical incident stress debriefing (<LINK REF="STD-Marchand-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marchand 2006</LINK>), four 45-60 minute counselling sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Ryding-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ryding 1998</LINK>), two group counselling and education sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Ryding-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ryding 2004</LINK>) and a collaborative care intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Zatzick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zatzick 2001</LINK>). It is very difficult to compare such trials and there did appear to be some differences in outcome, for example <LINK REF="STD-Ryding-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ryding 2004</LINK> appearing to be more effective than <LINK REF="STD-Marchand-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marchand 2006</LINK>. There were also differences in the clinical populations which included motor vehicle accident victims, women who had emergency Caesarean sections and caregivers and parents following the news that their child had cancer. Unfortunately the limited number of trials meant that sensitivity analyses could not be performed in a meaningful way to explore these issues further. Statistical heterogeneity was apparent in several analyses, the I² value demonstrating inconsistencies in the outcomes of some trials that were grouped together. When statistical heterogeneity was identified we used a random effects model as opposed to a fixed effect model to calculate more conservative confidence intervals. We concluded that all trials were essentially trying to measure the same thing and that it was worthwhile summarising their combined results, but the variation means that caution should be applied when interpreting the results (<LINK REF="REF-Fletcher-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fletcher 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological Quality</HEADING>
<P>The overall quality of the studies was varied and is described above. There were several issues that were problematic in several studies including the randomisation process, incomplete reporting of dropouts and absence of a manualised, replicable specific treatment in all but the <LINK REF="STD-Kazak-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kazak 2005</LINK> study. As with all psychological treatment trials there are issues with the control groups. This is particularly important in early intervention research where a reduction in symptoms over the duration of the trial would be expected, given the natural course of traumatic stress reactions. The development of a psychological treatment placebo is very difficult, if not impossible, as is blinding of participants and therapists. Some of the wait list/usual care groups may have received some form of intervention by virtue of contact through symptom monitoring, but this was not properly evaluated and it is not possible to determine what, if any, impact on outcomes this would have had. The two studies that did have an active control group (<LINK REF="STD-Gidron-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gidron 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gidron-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gidron 2007</LINK>) did not show a difference between that and two sessions of memory structuring.</P>
<P>The small sample sizes of most of the studies are also an important limitation. However, the intervention and control groups in most studies appeared well matched at baseline, reducing the risk of the reported unadjusted mean outcomes being influenced by baseline differences.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-04-07 23:04:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review adhered strictly to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. This will have reduced potential bias but there is likely to have been a bias towards published as opposed to unpublished studies and English language rather than other language manuscripts. Full data were not available for all studies although this potential bias was reduced by personal contact with authors of papers who supplied information that could not be extracted from the published manuscripts. The clear inclusion and exclusion criteria helped with correct identification as did the fact that study selection was performed independently by two of the reviewers, with a third becoming involved if there were any disagreements.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-04-30 14:15:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is the first specific systematic review of multiple session interventions to prevent PTSD. The results are consistent with the findings of systematic reviews that have included studies in this area (<LINK REF="REF-NCCMH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCMH 2005</LINK>) and also with prevailing guidance regarding how best to respond following a traumatic event (<LINK REF="REF-NCCMH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCMH 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-ACPMH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACPMH 2007</LINK>). It is noteworthy that there was a trend for increased self-report of PTSD symptoms at 3-6 month follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) and that another study (<LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2007</LINK>) reported that individuals in the counselling intervention with a past psychiatric history tended to do worse at 6 month follow-up. At first glance this appears to be consistent with the finding that single session interventions are associated with worse outcome at longer term follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2002</LINK>), not least given the apparent contribution of the adapted critical incident stress debriefing intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Marchand-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marchand 2006</LINK>) to the trend in this review. However, there is a need for some caution in interpreting this trend given the contradictory findings for PTSD diagnosis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-04-30 14:15:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These results coupled with those of the Cochrane review of single session interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2002</LINK>) suggest that at this time there is little evidence to support the use of psychological intervention for routine use following traumatic events and that some multiple session interventions, like single session interventions, may have an adverse effect on some individuals. The clear practice implication of this is that, at present, multiple session interventions aimed at all individuals exposed to traumatic events should not be used. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-04-26 16:33:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further well-designed randomised controlled trials of interventions that appeared to show more promise than others, e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Ryding-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ryding 2004</LINK>, could be subjected to further evaluation and it is noted that preventative cognitive behavioural interventions have not been adequately investigated. However, the absence of effect and trend towards a worse outcome with intervention than without suggests that great caution should be adopted in the planning of future research. The results suggest that alternative approaches are required; this could involve developing interventions that address our increasing knowledge regarding the aetiology and development of PTSD from social, psychological and neurobiological perspectives. Indeed, a Cochrane review of prevention of PTSD with pharmacological agents has now been registered (<LINK REF="REF-Ipser-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ipser 2006</LINK>). It would be of interest to examine interventions aimed at couples and families to improve familial response, not least given the better results of <LINK REF="STD-Ryding-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ryding 2004</LINK>. It would also be of interest to evaluate forms of community intervention and interventions aimed at improving coping skills and enhancing positive and helpful behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Ruzek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruzek 2007</LINK>). Future research should also explore the optimal time to intervene, consider adverse events and tolerability of treatment, and carefully control for additional intervention.</P>
