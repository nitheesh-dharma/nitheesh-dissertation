<P>Terbutaline pumps may not be able to prevent a woman who had preterm labor stopped with drugs going back into labor too soon.</P>
<P>Women who go into very early labor (before 34 weeks) and have their contractions stopped by intravenous drugs are at high risk of going back into preterm labor. Terbutaline is a drug that can relax the uterus and possibly stop contractions. Taken orally, though, it does not seem to prevent contractions returning. Another option is to use a small portable pump that feeds a continuous dose of terbutaline under the skin. The review found there are not enough large trials to show whether this is safe or effective. Some evidence suggests that terbutaline by pump does not prevent the return of preterm labor.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and then extracted data from eligible studies. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included two studies. Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy did not appear to offer any advantages over the saline placebo pump or oral terbutaline maintenance therapy in preventing preterm births by prolonging pregnancy or its complications among women with arrested preterm labor. The weighted mean difference (WMD) for gestational age at birth was -0.14 weeks (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.66 to 1.38) for terbutaline pump therapy compared with saline placebo pump for both trials combined and 1.40 weeks (95% CI -1.13 to 3.93) for terbutaline pump versus oral terbutaline therapy for the first trial. The second trial reported a relative risk (RR) of 1.17 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.73) of preterm birth (less than 37 completed weeks) and a RR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.84) of very preterm birth (less than 34 completed weeks) for terbutaline pump compared with saline placebo pump. Terbutaline pump therapy also did not result in a higher rate of therapy continuation or a lower rate of infant complications. No data were reported on long-term infant outcomes, costs, or maternal assessment of therapy.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-01 21:21:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy has not been shown to decrease the risk of preterm birth by prolonging pregnancy. Furthermore, the lack of information on the safety of the therapy, as well as its substantial expense, argues against its role in the management of arrested preterm labor. Future use should only be in the context of well-conducted, adequately powered randomized controlled trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-25 12:38:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>This review has been updated by a new review team. Readers are referred to the new review for updated results (<LINK REF="REF-Chawanpaiboon-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chawanpaiboon 2014</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Escobedo-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Escobedo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1994</LINK>). Additionally, women who give birth to preterm babies are at increased risk of psychological distress (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1995</LINK>). Consequently, women who experience threatened preterm labor at 34 weeks of gestation or earlier are often treated with tocolytic therapy to arrest uterine contractions and stop the progress of active labor. Tocolytics are often used in the short term to allow for administration of corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity. Because women whose labor is initially arrested with tocolytics are at high risk of recurrent preterm labor, many centers have advocated maintenance tocolytic therapy to reduce this risk. However, the effectiveness of these therapies in decreasing the risk of preterm birth or low birthweight or increasing the interval until birth is unproven (<LINK REF="REF-Sanchez_x002d_Ramos-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez-Ramos 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Agents of various classes have been investigated, and previous systematic reviews have shown that neither oral terbutaline nor oral magnesium sulfate is effective maintenance tocolytic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macones-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macones 1995</LINK>). Moreover, these therapies may have serious adverse effects such as sudden death, pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmias, and hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hudgens-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudgens 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perry-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quinn-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 1994</LINK>). Possible reasons cited for the lack of benefit from oral terbutaline maintenance therapy include desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors in the myometrium, inconsistent drug levels, and lack of compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Lam-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an attempt to overcome these problems, some health care providers have used a portable pump similar to an insulin pump to deliver a subcutaneous infusion of terbutaline at a low basal delivery rate with boluses as needed for increased uterine activity. Terbutaline was chosen for this purpose because it is more easily absorbed subcutaneously than other agents and is less costly. Pump therapy has several reported advantages over oral therapy: lower total daily medication dose, causing fewer side effects and less tachyphylaxis; faster onset of action, allowing control of contractions before cervical change; and improved patient compliance. The terbutaline pump also allows women to remain at home for therapy, as compared with prolonged intravenous tocolysis. This allows women to avoid sleep disruption, possibly reducing stress, and increasing her sense of control. Proponents of the therapy believe that these advantages will lead to greater prolongation of pregnancy compared with alternative or no therapy. However, reported adverse effects such as maternal death, chest pain, pulmonary edema, and tachycardia have prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to issue a warning letter to health providers regarding the use of terbutaline pump therapy for preterm labor.</P>

We calculated weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes such as gestational age at delivery and birthweight. We calculated relative risks with 95% CIs for the dichotomous outcomes of preterm birth, very preterm birth, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal intensive care unit stay, and early discontinuation from therapy. Data were entered into the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>).

<P>The published trial by Guinn and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Guinn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guinn 1998</LINK>) recruited 52 women with singleton gestations from 22 to less than 34 weeks of gestation with intact membranes who experienced suspected preterm labor that was arrested with intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy for at least 24 hours before study entry. The study was conducted at the University of Alabama, Alabama, USA. The authors calculated sample size a priori, and determined that a total sample size of 48 women was needed to have 80% power to detect a clinically significant difference of a 14-day delay in the interval from treatment to delivery between the two therapies. <LINK REF="STD-Guinn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guinn 1998</LINK> reported a strict case definition of preterm labor. Women had to experience more than four uterine contractions per hour and at least one of the following: 80% or greater effacement, one centimeter or greater dilation, or documented cervical change. Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy was compared with the placebo, saline placebo pump maintenance therapy. Both therapies used portable subcutaneous pumps (model 404-S; MiniMed Technologies, Sylmar, CA). Terbutaline therapy consisted of the continuous administration of 1 mg terbutaline/ml saline at the rate of 0.05 ml/hour with five daily bolus injections programmed at regular intervals. The women could also self-administer boluses of 0.25 ml twice daily for increased uterine activity. Saline placebo pump therapy was identical to terbutaline pump therapy except that saline replaced the terbutaline. Women were followed up on a weekly basis during maintenance therapy, and nursing support was constantly available. In the event of recurrent preterm labor before 34 weeks of gestation, pump therapy was discontinued, and another course of intravenous magnesium therapy was given unless there was advanced cervical dilation or ruptured membranes. Pump maintenance therapy resumed if labor was arrested. Both pump therapies continued until either delivery or 36 weeks of gestation was reached.</P>
<P>Wenstrom and colleagues' published trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wenstrom 1997</LINK>) recruited 42 women with singleton or multiple gestations from 20 to less than 35 weeks of gestation who had suspected preterm labor that was arrested with intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy for at least 48 hours before study entry. The authors do not mention sample size calculations. The study was conducted at the University of Iowa, Iowa, USA. Preterm labor was defined only as regular, persistent uterine contractions that produced observed cervical change. Three maintenance therapies were compared: terbutaline pump, saline placebo pump and oral terbutaline. Terbutaline pump and saline pump therapies used the same portable pump model as in the <LINK REF="STD-Guinn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guinn 1998</LINK> trial. The terbutaline pump group received 1 mg terbutaline/ml saline initially administered at rate of 0.05 ml/hour with 0.25 ml bolus injections every six hours. While the basal rate was kept constant, the bolus dose was adjusted to the women's unique contraction pattern. The saline placebo pump group received therapy identical to the terbutaline pump group except that saline replaced the terbutaline. The oral terbutaline group received five to 10 mg terbutaline orally every two to six hours, titrated to maintain maternal heart rate at 90 beats per minute or higher and to prevent uterine contractions from occurring at a rate of more than four per hour. If recurrent preterm labor occurred despite maximization of therapy, the treatment arm assignment was determined and therapy was changed. Women receiving oral terbutaline or saline placebo therapy were switched to terbutaline pump, and women receiving terbutaline pump were switched to oral terbutaline. Women who had recurrent preterm labor that was not resolved after switching therapies were treated with intravenous tocolysis and aggressive management. Women were followed up on a weekly or biweekly basis according to the department's standard protocol for outpatient management of preterm labor. No gestational age was specified for the discontinuation of therapy.<BR/>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Treatment allocation in the <LINK REF="STD-Guinn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guinn 1998</LINK> trial was based on computer-generated randomization with stratification by cervical dilation (&lt; 3 cm versus &gt;= 3 cm) and previous indomethacin use. Only the research pharmacist had knowledge of treatment assignment; the pharmacist prepared the pump solutions, which were clear, odorless, and indistinguishable. The authors reported only one case of loss to follow up (in the terbutaline arm). </P>
<P>The pharmacist in the <LINK REF="STD-Wenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wenstrom 1997</LINK> trial randomized participants using a random-number table and prepared all solutions. Again, the pump solutions were identical in appearance and only the pharmacist knew the pump assignments; however, the oral therapy was not blinded. Over 90% of eligible women in this trial declined participation. The study authors attributed the low participation rate to patient concerns about the pump and its needle or the use of placebo. Physician reluctance to the trial was not addressed. The treatment arm was broken for women with recurrent preterm labor that could not be resolved with the assigned therapy. The assignment code was broken for nine of the 15 women in the terbutaline pump arm; one was switched to oral terbutaline, five received intravenous tocolytic therapy, and three delivered. The code was broken for eight of the 12 women in the saline placebo pump arm; three were switched to terbutaline pump, three received intravenous tocolytics, and two delivered. Two of the 15 women in the oral terbutaline group received intravenous tocolytics. All cases were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The authors did not describe any cases of loss to follow up.</P>
<P>We wrote to the authors of both studies to query for additional unreported outcomes. We also queried whether the numbers following the estimates in the tables, which were unlabeled, represented standard deviations. Since we did not receive a response from the authors, we assumed that they represented standard deviations. </P>

<P>Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy was not associated with a reduction in preterm birth or its complications in either trial. For the first infant outcome of gestational age at delivery, no significant difference in the mean gestational age at delivery between terbutaline pump and the saline placebo pump was found; the weighted mean difference (WMD) for gestational age at birth was -0.14 weeks (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.66 to 1.38) for both trials combined. The gestational age at delivery also did not differ by treatment when measured by the dichotomous outcomes, preterm (less than 37 completed weeks) or very preterm (less than 34 completed weeks) birth. The <LINK REF="STD-Guinn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guinn 1998</LINK> trial found a relative risk (RR) of 1.17 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.73) of preterm birth and a RR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.84) of very preterm birth for terbutaline pump compared with saline placebo pump therapy. Preterm and very preterm birth were not reported outcomes in the <LINK REF="STD-Wenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wenstrom 1997</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>Birthweight was not significantly different between treatments. The WMD for birthweight was 107.90 g (95% CI -216.24 to 432.04) for terbutaline pump versus saline placebo pump therapy for both trials combined. No perinatal deaths occurred in either study, and the <LINK REF="STD-Guinn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guinn 1998</LINK> study reported that no cases of intraventricular hemorrhage occurred. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) did not appear to differ by treatment received. Both trials combined showed a summary RR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.23 to 2.93) of RDS for terbutaline pump versus saline placebo pump. The <LINK REF="STD-Guinn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guinn 1998</LINK> study found a RR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.73) for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay greater than 24 hours. In the <LINK REF="STD-Wenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wenstrom 1997</LINK> study no significant differences were reported in length of neonatal hospital stay between the terbutaline pump and saline placebo pump groups. <LINK REF="STD-Wenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wenstrom 1997</LINK> also found no differences between these groups for Apgar scores at one and five minutes. No data were available from either study on need for mechanical ventilation or long-term neurological sequelae.</P>
<P>Neither trial reported any serious complications of therapy. Terbutaline pump therapy did not result in a higher rate of therapy continuation. For both trials combined, the RR of early discontinuation from assigned therapy was 1.15 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.95) for terbutaline pump compared with the saline placebo pump. The only cases of early discontinuation reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Wenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wenstrom 1997</LINK> trial were those resulting from recurrent preterm labor that required the treatment assignment be broken and therapy switched. Thus, the discontinuation rate is based on our assumption that these constituted all cases of early discontinuation. In contrast, the <LINK REF="STD-Guinn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guinn 1998</LINK> trial described both discontinuations resulting from physician decisions (n = 9) as well as those resulting from patient choices (n = 11).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy does not appear to offer any advantages over the placebo, saline placebo pump, or oral terbutaline maintenance therapy in preventing preterm births by prolonging pregnancy among women with arrested preterm labor. Neither trial found terbutaline pump therapy to be efficacious in increasing gestational age at birth or in reducing preterm birth and its complications. </P>
<P>Both trials had small sample sizes. The <LINK REF="STD-Guinn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guinn 1998</LINK> trial only enrolled 52 women; however, the sample size was calculated to have sufficient power to detect a clinically significant difference (two weeks) between the two therapies in the interval from initiation of therapy to delivery. The <LINK REF="STD-Wenstrom-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wenstrom 1997</LINK> trial enrolled only 42 women despite an enrollment period of four years and four months. Over 90% of eligible women declined participation in the study. Although the authors state that no apparent differences existed between those who agreed to participate and those who declined, the possibility of differences cannot be eliminated. Both trials restricted enrollment to women with arrested preterm labor and, thus, at high risk for preterm delivery. The ability to detect an association between terbutaline pump therapy and preterm birth, most likely, was strengthened by the exclusion of women with lower risk of preterm birth. </P>
<P>Terbutaline pump therapy did not have a higher rate of continuation than the other therapies. Furthermore, the safety of terbutaline pump maintenance therapy was not assessed adequately. Neither trial was designed to have adequate statistical power to evaluate major adverse events that occur at an infrequent rate. With an average cost of $200/day compared with oral therapy or no therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Adkins-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adkins 1993</LINK>), terbutaline pump therapy imposes an additional expense without proven benefits. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy has not been shown to decrease the risk of preterm birth by prolonging pregnancy. Furthermore, the lack of information on the safety of the therapy, as well as its substantial expense, argues against its use in the management of arrested preterm labor. Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy should not be used outside well-designed randomized controlled trials.<BR/> </P>
