<I>What is the problem?</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>People with cancer who undergo anti-cancer treatment (chemotherapy) often have a tube inserted into a large vein (central venous catheter or CVC) through which their chemotherapy is given. As chemotherapy is usually administered at regular intervals over several months to years, long-term, semi-permanent, tunnelled CVCs (TCVCs) or totally implanted devices (TIDs) are frequently used. Despite sterile insertion and post-insertion care, these long-term CVCs may become infected. These infections are usually caused by Gram positive bacteria.</P>
<P>Flushing or locking means to instil a solution to dwell in the tube when it is not in use. Usually, after use, the tube is flushed or locked with a saline or heparin-saline solution to prevent clot formation within the tube.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>What was the aim of this review?</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to determine whether giving antibiotics before inserting the tube, or giving antibiotics with the solution used to flush and lock the tube, can prevent Gram positive bacterial infections.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>What are the findings?</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the literature from 1966 to 2013 for relevant studies (randomised controlled trials only).</P>
<P>We included five studies (involving 360 children and adults) that compared antibiotics given before the insertion of the CVC with no antibiotics before insertion. We found that giving an antibiotic before inserting a tunnelled CVC did not prevent Gram positive catheter-related infections.</P>
<P>We included six studies (involving 468 people, mainly children) that tested flushing or locking the newly inserted CVC with a combination of an antibiotic and heparin compared with heparin only. We found that flushing the catheter with a solution containing an antibiotic and heparin reduced the number of catheter-related infections. This practice is most likely to be of value where the risk of such infections is high. We considered this evidence to be of a moderate quality.</P>

<P>This is an updated version of the review which was first published in <I>the</I> <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> in 2006. Long-term central venous catheters (CVCs), including tunnelled CVCs (TCVCs) and totally implanted devices or ports (TIDs), are increasingly used when treating oncology patients. Despite international guidelines on sterile insertion and appropriate CVC maintenance and use, infection remains a common complication. These infections are mainly caused by Gram positive bacteria. Antimicrobial prevention strategies aimed at these micro-organisms could potentially decrease the majority of CVC infections. The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotics in the prevention of Gram positive infections in long-term CVCs.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-25 10:58:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 11 trials with a total of 828 oncology patients (adults and children). We assessed most included studies to be at a low or unclear risk of bias. Five trials compared the use of antibiotics (vancomycin, teicoplanin or ceftazidime) given before the insertion of the long-term CVC with no antibiotics, and six trials compared antibiotics (vancomycin, amikacin or taurolidine) and heparin with a heparin-only solution for flushing or locking the long-term CVC after use. Administering an antibiotic prior to insertion of the CVC did not significantly reduce Gram positive catheter-related sepsis (CRS) (five trials, 360 adults; risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 1.58; I = 5 2%; P = 0.41).</P>
<P>Flushing and locking long-term CVCs with a combined antibiotic and heparin solution significantly reduced the risk of Gram positive catheter-related sepsis compared with a heparin-only solution (468 participants, mostly children; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.80; I = 0%; P = 0.005). For a baseline infection rate of 15%, this reduction translated into a number needed to treat (NNT) of 12 (95% CI 9 to 33) to prevent one catheter-related infection. We considered this evidence to be of a moderate quality.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-25 10:58:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was no benefit to administering antibiotics before the insertion of long-term CVCs to prevent Gram positive catheter-related infections. Flushing or locking long-term CVCs with a combined antibiotic and heparin solution appeared to reduce Gram positive catheter-related sepsis experienced in people at risk of neutropenia through chemotherapy or disease. Due to insufficient data it was not clear whether this applied equally to TCVCs and totally implanted devices (TIDs), or equally to adults and children. The use of a combined antibiotic and heparin solution may increase microbial antibiotic resistance, therefore it should be reserved for high risk people or where baseline CVC infection rates are high (&gt; 15%). Further research is needed to identify high risk groups most likely to benefit.</P>

<P>This is an updated version of the review which was first published in <I>the</I> <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> in 2006.</P>
<P>People undergoing treatment for cancer need adequate venous access because of the frequent administration of chemotherapy and requirements for intravenous fluids, blood products and other medications. To limit the discomfort of short-term venous access, long-term central venous catheters (CVCs), including tunnelled central venous catheters (TCVCs) and totally implanted devices or ports (TIDs), are used in more than two thirds of children and adults undergoing chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Groeger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groeger 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ingram-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingram 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2006</LINK>). However, the use of long-term CVCs is limited by the risk of blood clot formation and infection. The risk of infection ranges from 1.4 (<LINK REF="REF-Bagnall_x002d_Reeb-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagnall-Reeb 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Press-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Press 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schinabeck-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schinabeck 2003</LINK>) to 2.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Groeger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groeger 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarper-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarper 2006</LINK>) infections per 1000 catheter days. The duration of antimicrobial therapy to treat these infections ranges from seven to 21 days. Success rates of 60% to 91% are reported, although often the device has to be removed (<LINK REF="REF-Bagnall_x002d_Reeb-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagnall-Reeb 2004</LINK>). Approximately one third of people experience an episode of infection while having a long-term CVC in place. Seventy per cent of the organisms that are cultured are Gram positive organisms, mainly coagulase negative staphylococci (<I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> and <I>enterococci</I>)<I>. </I>Other organisms include Gram negative organisms (15%) (mainly <I>E coli</I>), fungal organisms (8%) (mainly <I>Candida </I>species) and anaerobic organisms (7%) (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Grady-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Grady 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The adherence to and colonization of CVCs with micro-organisms is facilitated by the formation of a very thin biofilm inside the catheter lumen. This process is influenced by several factors such as the production of fibroglycocalyx (extracellular slime) by coagulase negative staphylococci. In addition, the host reaction to the CVC results in the formation of a thrombin sleeve rich in clotting factors such as fibronectin, fibrinogen and fibrin, which contributes to the formation of the biofilm (<LINK REF="REF-Bagnall_x002d_Reeb-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagnall-Reeb 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Darouiche-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darouiche 1999</LINK>). This means that adequate antibiotic treatment may lead to resolution of the CVC infection only in certain cases (that is when caused by coagulase negative staphylococci) whereas in other cases (that is when caused by <I>Pseudomonas</I>, <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> or fungi) this will be much more difficult to clear and therefore removal of the catheter is necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The organisms responsible for catheter colonization and infection come from four sources. These are the skin, the catheter hub (the part through which the catheter is tunnelled under the skin), haematogenous seeding (infections originating outside the catheter can reach the CVC via the bloodstream) and contamination of the intravenous fluids given to the patient (for example intravenous total parenteral nutrition) (<LINK REF="REF-Hachem-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hachem 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Early catheter-related infections (infections that develop within 45 days after placement of the catheter) are mostly due to organisms from the skin insertion site. This is the time period during which many manipulations of the CVC are necessary due to the intensity of the chemotherapy. After 45 days the catheter hub becomes a far more important source of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Abbas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbas 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaul-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaul 1998</LINK>). International guidelines have been developed to prevent catheter-related infections (<LINK REF="REF-CPAC-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPAC 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Grady-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Grady 2002</LINK>). These include guidelines for catheter insertion and care and handling, as well as restrictions on the number of catheter interruptions (the number of times per day one is allowed to open the catheter, to give medication or to draw blood). Most recently, a clinical care management bundle (including hand hygiene, barrier precautions for insertion, chlorhexidine skin antisepsis, optimal catheter site selection and assessment of CVC necessity) sets the standard for CVC care (<LINK REF="REF-Schiffer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffer 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-25 10:58:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Standard maintenance of long-term CVCs includes flushing the lumen with a saline solution following access or closing the CVC with a locking solution which is instilled into the lumen of the CVC after chemotherapy and left to dwell in the CVC until the next use. There are conflicting data about the relative value of adding prophylactic heparin to saline flushes (<LINK REF="REF-Schiffer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffer 2013</LINK>); however, heparinised saline is commonly used. Adding an antibiotic to the flush solution may prevent biofilm formation and eliminate bacteria introduced into the CVC via the skin or during CVC access, from any source. Antibiotics which have activity against Gram positive organisms and which have been evaluated for this purpose include vancomycin, taurolidine, teicoplanin and minocycline. Systemic antibiotics may be given intravenously before the insertion of the CVC in an attempt to reduce early infections; however, in the original version of this review we found no evidence to support the use of antibiotics in this way.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-11-25 10:58:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Theresa A Lawrie">
<P>Oncology patients are at increased risk of infection due to the immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy or their disease, for example with haematological malignancy. Administering antibiotics prophylactically may reduce the likelihood that Gram positive bacteria, introduced at the time of CVC insertion or following access, will thrive and lead to a catheter-related infection.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-11-25 10:58:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the original review in which we found weak evidence to support adding an antibiotic with activity against Gram positive organisms to the standard flush or lock solution, and no evidence to support the use of systemic antibiotics prior to long-term CVC insertion. There remains uncertainty as to whether antibiotic prophylaxis is of benefit to adults and children at high risk of catheter-related infections. By updating this review and incorporating new evidence we hoped to clarify the role of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent Gram positive infections in long-term CVCs.</P>

<P>We included five studies in this meta-analysis: two used vancomycin, two used teicoplanin, and one used ceftazadime prophylaxis versus control (placebo or no antibiotic). All five studies were conducted in adults.

<P>In this review, we included studies that enrolled adults, children, or both. However, as the first meta-analysis included studies comprising adults only (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) it is possible that the results of this meta-analysis are not generalisable to children. Similarly, the second meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) included studies that were mainly conducted in children. Therefore, it is possible that the associated evidence, which indicates a beneficial effect of adding antibiotics to the standard flush or lock solution, may not be generalisable to adults. We consider the prevention, detection and treatment of infections in CVCs to be comparable in adults and children and therefore consider this evidence to be applicable to both.</P>
<P>We included studies evaluating the risk of CRS in TIDs and TCVCs. We were unable to distinguish between infection rates for TCVCs and TIDs due to insufficient data. Ports may be associated with a lower risk of CRS, however we pooled the data on ports and TCVCs as both are tunnelled central venous catheters and both are used to administer chemotherapy. One included study evaluated participants with TCVCs or TIDs (<LINK REF="STD-Handrup-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Handrup 2013</LINK>) and one study evaluated participants with TIDs only (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Carlo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Di Carlo 2011</LINK>). In the latter study no early infections occurred in the 108 participants that were included. In <LINK REF="STD-Handrup-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Handrup 2013</LINK>, which comprised mainly TIDs, long-term infection rates in the control group were comparable to those reported in the TCVC studies.</P>
<P>Although the risk of infection is considered to be greatest during the first 45 to 100 days after placement (<LINK REF="REF-Abbas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbas 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salzman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzman 1995</LINK>), few of the included studies defined or evaluated early CRS.

<P>Overall, we consider the evidence synthesized in this review to be of a moderate quality. <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> suffered from substantial heterogeneity due to the small sample sizes and inconsistent findings of the included studies. We considered <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> to be high quality evidence with respect to children, however we downgraded the evidence to moderate quality due to the clinical heterogeneity of the studies (types of antibiotics, CVCs and participants).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-11-25 10:58:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We attempted to reduce bias in this review by excluding studies in which long-term CVCs were already in situ, that is were not newly inserted. Catheters that are in situ and in use prior to enrolment were likely to be pre-colonized with bacteria. Including such studies may have led to spurious findings or higher rates of infections observed and would have introduced another variable by which to adjust the results.</P>
<P>Some included studies reported Gram negative and Gram positive CRS (for example <LINK REF="STD-Barriga-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barriga 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Handrup-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Handrup 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henrickson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Henrickson 2000</LINK>). In these instances we only used the Gram positive data. However, the antibiotic group in <LINK REF="STD-Handrup-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Handrup 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Henrickson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Henrickson 2000</LINK> also experienced lower rates of Gram negative CRS. Had we included these data, the RR would have more strongly favoured the antibiotic group in <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Like <LINK REF="REF-Snaterse-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snaterse 2010</LINK>, we did not differentiate between flush and lock solutions in our meta-analyses as we considered them to have the same effect on the catheter lumen. Similarly, we combined the results of studies using various antibiotics with activity against Gram positive organisms into one meta-analysis.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-11-25 10:58:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original review found weak evidence in favour of antibiotic flush solutions and no evidence to support systemic antibiotics. There remains no demonstrable benefit from prophylactic intravenous antibiotics before long-term CVC insertion. However, evidence from our updated meta-analysis supports a beneficial effect of an antibiotic and heparin solution for flushing or locking long-term CVCs. In a 2010 review, <LINK REF="REF-Snaterse-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snaterse 2010</LINK> points out that the lack of specificity in the outcomes measured in many of the included studies may lead to overestimation of the effect. We agree that more evidence is needed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-11-25 10:58:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Flushing or locking long-term CVCs with an antibiotic and heparin solution appears to reduce Gram positive catheter-related sepsis experienced in people at risk of neutropenia through chemotherapy or disease. Due to insufficient data it is not clear whether this applies equally to TCVCs and TIDs, or equally to adults and children. The use of an antibiotic and heparin solution may be of value in high risk people and where baseline CVC infection rates are high (&gt; 15%). However, routine antibiotic administration, irrespective of risk, is likely to increase microbial resistance.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-11-25 10:58:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although some of the included studies stratified risk groups (for example neutropenic and non-neutropenic) none analysed these separately due to insufficient numbers. A large multicentre study to investigate the role of antibiotics for different risk groups is needed. Such a trial would also be valuable in identifying high risk groups that are most likely to benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis. It was not possible to draw any conclusions about the types of CVCs and antibiotics; further research would be valuable.</P>
<P>Antibiotic coatings for long-term tunnelled CVCs are currently under investigation and studies comparing these new types of catheters with antibiotic and heparin lock solutions are required. Due to the risk of developing microbial resistance, research into non-antibiotic solutions to reduce catheter-related infections is warranted. Ethanol (70%) lock solutions to prevent catheter-related infections are currently being investigated in both adults and children.</P>

The study group received prophylactic vancomycin 25 ug/ml. All participants received parenteral nutrition. Results CNS 21/61 in the control group and 19/85 in the vancomycin group (P &lt; 0.05). The patient group is not the group studied in this review. Methods of the study poor. Not specified how often the prophylactic vanco was given. Clinical criteria were used to determine if the neonate was infected, and then peripheral and central cultures were done. Not specified if quantitative or qualitative cultures were done. Trial not blinded, no tunnelled catheters used, inappropriate patient group</P>
