<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-08-17 20:55:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
</P>
<P>To find out what strategies can improve healthcare workers' compliance with recommendations for hand hygiene, either handwashing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR), or both. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
<P>
<B>Key messages</B>
</P>
<P>A variety of single intervention strategies and combinations of strategies, many based on current recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO), led to increased hand hygiene compliance in most studies, regardless of setting. However, the certainty of the evidence varied from very low to moderate, depending on the strategy. What remains unclear is which strategy or combination of strategies is most effective in a given context.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we study in the review?</B>
</P>
<P>Traditionally hand hygiene has been considered the single most important way of reducing health care-associated infections, many of which are spread by direct contact, especially by the hands of healthcare workers. Much time and effort is spent worldwide promoting hand hygiene. Many different strategies have been tried to improve hand hygiene compliance but the most effective methods remain unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review?</B>
</P>
<P>We included 26 studies in the review. Fourteen studies assessed the success of different combinations of strategies recommended by WHO to improve hand hygiene compliance. Strategies consisted of the following: increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand hygiene products, different types of education for staff, reminders (written and verbal), different types of performance feedback, administrative support and staff involvement. Six studies assessed different types of performance feedback, two studies evaluated education, three studies evaluated cues such as signs or scent, and one study assessed placement of ABHR.</P>
<P>Multimodal (combinations of) strategies that include some but not all strategies recommended by WHO may slightly improve hand hygiene compliance and slightly reduce infection rates (low certainty of evidence). Multimodal interventions that include all strategies recommended by WHO may lead to little or no difference in methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (MRSA) infection rates (low certainty of evidence), but it is uncertain whether such WHO-based approaches improve hand hygiene compliance or reduce colonisation rates because the certainty of this evidence is very low. Multimodal interventions that contain all recommended strategies plus additional strategies may slightly improve hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence). It is unclear whether such WHO-enhanced interventions reduce infection rates because the certainty of this evidence is very low.</P>
<P>Performance feedback may improve hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence) and probably slightly reduces infection and colonisation rates (moderate certainty of evidence). Education may improve hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence). Cues, such as signs or scent, may slightly improve hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence). Placement of ABHR close to the point of use probably slightly improves hand hygiene compliance (moderate certainty of evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is this review?</B>

<P>Health care-associated infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Hand hygiene is regarded as an effective preventive measure. This is an update of a previously published review. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-08-17 20:28:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the short- and long-term success of strategies to improve compliance to recommendations for hand hygiene, and to determine whether an increase in hand hygiene compliance can reduce rates of health care-associated infection.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-07-11 06:35:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. We conducted the searches from November 2009 to October 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-07-09 08:35:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We included randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series analyses (ITS) that evaluated any intervention to improve compliance with hand hygiene using soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR), or both.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-07-13 03:23:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Two review authors independently screened citations for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias for each included study.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-13 06:24:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>This review includes 26 studies: 14 randomised trials, two non-randomised trials and 10 ITS studies. Most studies were conducted in hospitals or long-term care facilities in different countries, and collected data from a variety of healthcare workers. Fourteen studies assessed the success of different combinations of strategies recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to improve hand hygiene compliance. Strategies consisted of the following: increasing the availability of ABHR, different types of education for staff, reminders (written and verbal), different types of performance feedback, administrative support, and staff involvement. Six studies assessed different types of performance feedback, two studies evaluated education, three studies evaluated cues such as signs or scent, and one study assessed placement of ABHR. Observed hand hygiene compliance was measured in all but three studies which reported product usage. Eight studies also reported either infection or colonisation rates. All studies had two or more sources of high or unclear risks of bias, most often associated with blinding or independence of the intervention.</P>
<P>Multimodal interventions that include some but not all strategies recommended in the WHO guidelines may slightly improve hand hygiene compliance (five studies; 56 centres) and may slightly reduce infection rates (three studies; 34 centres), low certainty of evidence for both outcomes.</P>
<P>Multimodal interventions that include all strategies recommended in the WHO guidelines may slightly reduce colonisation rates (one study; 167 centres; low certainty of evidence). It is unclear whether the intervention improves hand hygiene compliance (five studies; 184 centres) or reduces infection (two studies; 16 centres) because the certainty of this evidence is very low.</P>
<P>Multimodal interventions that contain all strategies recommended in the WHO guidelines plus additional strategies may slightly improve hand hygiene compliance (six studies; 15 centres; low certainty of evidence). It is unclear whether this intervention reduces infection rates (one study; one centre; very low certainty of evidence).</P>
<P>Performance feedback may improve hand hygiene compliance (six studies; 21 centres; low certainty of evidence). This intervention probably slightly reduces infection (one study; one centre) and colonisation rates (one study; one centre) based on moderate certainty of evidence.</P>
<P>Education may improve hand hygiene compliance (two studies; two centres), low certainty of evidence.</P>
<P>Cues such as signs or scent may slightly improve hand hygiene compliance (three studies; three centres), low certainty of evidence.</P>
<P>Placement of ABHR close to point of use probably slightly improves hand hygiene compliance (one study; one centre), moderate certainty of evidence.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-22 13:58:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With the identified variability in certainty of evidence, interventions, and methods, there remains an urgent need to undertake methodologically robust research to explore the effectiveness of multimodal versus simpler interventions to increase hand hygiene compliance, and to identify which components of multimodal interventions or combinations of strategies are most effective in a particular context.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-13 03:37:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The most recent prevalence study in England established that 6.4% of hospital inpatients develop health care-associated infections (HCAIs) (<LINK REF="REF-Health-Protection-Agency-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Protection Agency 2011</LINK>). In European acute care hospitals between 2011 and 2012, overall prevalence of HCAIs was 5.7% (<LINK REF="REF-ECDC-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECDC 2013a</LINK>). In a 2010 survey of 183 hospitals in the USA, prevalence of HCAIs was 4.0% (<LINK REF="REF-Magill-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magill 2014</LINK>), while the prevalence was 8.7% in 30 Canadian paediatric hospitals in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Rutledge_x002d_Taylor-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutledge-Taylor 2012</LINK>). HCAI rates vary considerably by type of infection (e.g. surgical site infection or pneumonia), by hospital or long-term care facility, and by causative micro-organism. In the European Union (EU) study 12.3% of the HCAIs were caused by methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (MRSA), while in the USA study 12.1% were caused by <I>Clostridium difficile,</I> 10.7% by <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (sensitive and resistant strains), and 9.9% by <I>Klebsiella </I>species. In general, rates of MRSA and <I>Clostridium difficile</I> infections have fallen but infections caused by Gram negative bacteria are increasing, especially those caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains (<LINK REF="REF-ESPAUR-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESPAUR 2015</LINK>). However, not all facilities have been able to reduce overall or micro-organism-specific HCAI rates (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2016</LINK>). In Canada, for example, rates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections rose from 0.31 per 10,000 patient days in 2009 to 0.45 in 2014 (<LINK REF="REF-CNISP-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNISP 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant micro-organisms place patients at risk of infection that cannot be treated easily and costs the EU 1.5 billion euros annually (<LINK REF="REF-UK--Five-Year-Antimicrobial-Resistance-Strategy" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy</LINK>). It has been estimated that in general hospital populations in the USA the cost per case of HCAI ranges from USD 2027 to USD 12,197 (<LINK REF="REF-Etchells-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etchells 2012</LINK>). In acute care hospitals in the USA it has been estimated that the overall burden of HCAIs, including lost income and other direct and indirect health costs, result in an overall financial burden of USD 96 to USD 147 billion annually (<LINK REF="REF-Marchetti-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchetti 2013</LINK> ). Collectively these figures demonstrate that strategies to prevent HCAIs have been more successful in some countries and healthcare facilities than others and for some pathogens more than others, and that HCAIs remain a major threat to patient safety globally and a drain on healthcare resources.</P>
<P>Most HCAIs are spread by direct contact, especially by the hands of healthcare workers. Hand hygiene has traditionally been considered the most important means of preventing HCAIs because it disrupts the chain of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Pittet-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittet 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teare-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teare 1999</LINK>). Transmission of micro-organisms from the hands of healthcare workers to a patient or to the environment can be prevented either by mechanical removal by washing with soap and water or an aqueous antiseptic (e.g. chlorhexidine gluconate) and drying, or by use of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs). ABHRs kill many of the organisms that cause HCAIs, and are less time-consuming and more convenient to use than traditional washing. However, they are effective only when used on physically clean hands. Furthermore, because they have low viscosity and evaporate rapidly, care must be taken to ensure that there is adequate contact with all hand surfaces. The availability of soap and water or of ABHR is insufficient, however, to ensure that healthcare workers perform hand hygiene when it is indicated.</P>
<P>In 2009 the World Health Organization (WHO) published guidelines for implementing and evaluating hand hygiene programmes in healthcare settings (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-Guidelines-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Guidelines 2009</LINK>). The guidelines incorporate &#8216;My Five Moments for Hand Hygiene&#8217;, which sets out a framework for understanding, training, monitoring and reporting hand hygiene compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Sax-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sax 2007</LINK>). The WHO guidelines also identify five components to be specifically implemented: ABHR at point of care or carried by the healthcare worker, training and education, observation and performance feedback, reminders (e.g. posters), and administrative support/institutional safety climate. The WHO guidelines have been widely disseminated internationally and are reported to be highly influential (<LINK REF="REF-Mathai-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathai 2011</LINK>). Healthcare workers in many countries now spend considerable time and effort promoting hand hygiene, auditing hand hygiene compliance, and assessing the effectiveness of hand hygiene and other measures to reduce HCAIs. Multiple interventions have been implemented to improve hand hygiene compliance but the most effective method remains unclear.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-17 20:54:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Pittet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittet 2000</LINK> published the results of a Swiss initiative that used an uncontrolled before-after design to demonstrate that a hospital-wide multimodal campaign led to a sustained improvement in hand hygiene compliance for nursing but not for medical staff, as well as a reduction in overall HCAIs and transmission of MRSA. The campaign consisted of visual cues (posters, signs), education to optimise use of ABHR, ABHR placed at every bedside, performance feedback and managerial support. Follow-up data published independently revealed continuing success (<LINK REF="REF-Hugonnet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hugonnet 2002</LINK>). These studies have been widely taken to indicate that multimodal campaigns are the most effective way of promoting hand hygiene compliance and reducing HCAIs. All of the interventions used in the Swiss initiative were incorporated into the recommendations for multimodal campaigns published in the <LINK REF="REF-WHO-Guidelines-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Guidelines 2009</LINK>, which have since been implemented in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-Mathai-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathai 2011</LINK>). Many different interventions have been tried over the years, both as individual interventions and as multimodal campaigns. The latter are usually based on the WHO recommendations, but multiple variations have been adopted. In the earliest studies, interventions were targeted mostly at nursing and sometimes at medical staff, but in recent years most have been targeted at inter-professional audiences.</P>
<P>Interventions to promote hand hygiene compliance fall mainly under the heading of Implementation Strategies in the Evaluation of Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Taxonomy of Topics (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2015a</LINK>). Such strategies are designed to bring about changes in healthcare workers&#8217; behaviour. Education is an important component of hand hygiene interventions. Information, usually based on the <LINK REF="REF-WHO-Guidelines-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Guidelines 2009</LINK>, is displayed on posters and flyers. E-learning materials and simulation have been used in wards in a few studies, while other studies have used lectures or workshops. Teaching is usually delivered by in-house infection prevention teams or external consultants by outreach to clinical areas. Some studies have included reminders about hand hygiene. A common strategy is to use audit with performance feedback delivered to wards, units, organisations and sometimes to individuals. In some studies individual verbal as well as written feedback is given and in most studies there is graphical display of hand hygiene audit findings in clinical areas which may include infection rates.</P>
<P>Changes to the healthcare environment have also been incorporated into hand hygiene campaigns. These involve the introduction of ABHR, a new formulation of an alcohol-based product (e.g. replacement of a liquid hand rub with gel), changes related to gloves, and in a few studies, rearranging the work environment to improve access to hand hygiene products in addition to increasing their availability. In a few studies consensus processes have been used to adapt guidelines for a local healthcare system, and a small number have employed administrators, opinion leaders or local champions to improve the practice culture.</P>
<P>Only a few studies have deployed incentives. These can take the form of individual rewards, financial incentives to healthcare workers in countries where money to pay for insurance claims arising from cases of HCAI is derived from hospital fines, or rewarding successful wards or healthcare workers by publicising their achievements throughout the organisation.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-07-10 07:27:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Education and training to use the different types of hand hygiene products are intended to increase compliance by increasing healthcare workers&#8217; knowledge of when hand hygiene should be performed, and in some cases encouraging optimal technique. Audit and performance feedback are intended to increase awareness of behaviours, and, like incentives, may serve as a motivator to continue to perform well or to improve performance, depending on the level of compliance. Reminders serve as cues to action. Changes in the availability of products or the environment or both can facilitate performance of the behaviour; it is difficult to perform hand hygiene, for example, if sinks or ABHR are not readily available. Involvement of staff and leadership support help to create unit-specific strategies to address local contributing factors to reduced compliance, and may reinforce behaviour through role-modelling or creating expectations about hand hygiene. Performance feedback, reminders, and leadership support may serve to reinforce the need for hand hygiene in a continual Hawthorne effect (<LINK REF="REF-Roethlisberger-1939" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roethlisberger 1939</LINK>).</P>
<P>Multimodal interventions incorporate different components, including some of those advocated by WHO and, in some cases, different ones. The ideal components of multimodal campaigns remain to be established, and it is still unclear whether multimodal interventions are superior to single interventions, although a number of the most recent randomised trials are now exploring the impact of single interventions. Because few studies to improve hand hygiene compliance have incorporated any theoretical underpinning, the best way of encouraging compliance is unknown. A recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Srigley-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srigley 2015</LINK>) has concluded that behavioural theories may help guide interventions.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-22 12:10:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An early systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Naikoba-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naikoba 2001</LINK> of 21 studies published before 2000 suggested that multimodal campaigns held more promise of effectiveness than single interventions, and that education with written information, reminders and continuous performance feedback were more useful than single interventions such as automated sinks or provision of moisturised soaps. However, it was difficult to draw firm conclusions in this review. <LINK REF="REF-Naikoba-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naikoba 2001</LINK> noted numerous limitations associated with the studies they reviewed, including small sample sizes, short duration of follow-up, lack of or inappropriate control groups, lack of generalisability from critical care units where most studies had been conducted to other clinical settings, and emphasis on frequency of hand hygiene as an outcome measure rather than microbiological data. One key limitation of the review was that it included studies that had weak designs for making causal inferences about the effects of interventions (mainly uncontrolled before-after studies). Another disadvantage is the failure of the authors to consider variables that might influence rates of HCAIs. Seasonal variations are particularly likely to influence outcome measures in studies that examine hand hygiene and rates of HCAI. For example, bacterial counts are affected by seasonal factors such as humidity, while hand hygiene compliance is likely to be influenced by factors such as staffing levels and replacement of usual staff by temporary staff during national holidays or in the event of staff sickness.</P>
<P>Work published after <LINK REF="REF-Naikoba-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naikoba 2001</LINK> indicated that multimodal interventions to improve different aspects of healthcare delivery are not likely to change practice more effectively than single interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2004</LINK>), and that audit with performance feedback has only a modest effect on improving practice (<LINK REF="REF-Ivers-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ivers 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 2007, we published a systematic review of interventions to improve hand hygiene compliance in patient care (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2007</LINK>), followed by an update in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2010</LINK>). Only four studies met the inclusion criteria. Two examined education as a single intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Gould-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gould 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK>) while two evaluated multimodal campaigns (<LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2008</LINK>). Sample sizes were small and most studies lacked either a suitable comparison group or any control group at all. Consequently, we were unable to draw a conclusicn about the effectiveness of interventions to promote hand hygiene compliance due to the lack of high certainty of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>HCAIs remain a major threat to patient safety globally and a drain on healthcare resources (<LINK REF="REF-Badia-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badia 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PHAC-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHAC 2016</LINK>). The hospital microbial flora are constantly changing to present new infection prevention challenges, illustrated by a recent decline in MRSA and an upsurge in Gram negative bacteraemia in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Health-Foundation-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Foundation 2015</LINK>). Some organisms are intrinsically resistant to antibiotics and for these, excellent non-antibiotic approaches to prevention will always be essential. Hand hygiene has continued to be promoted as the foremost intervention that can be undertaken to prevent HCAIs and a large number of new studies have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Luangasanatip-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luangasanatip 2015</LINK>). Since 2009 there has also been explicit guidance from WHO of what should be done to improve hand hygiene compliance, based on Pittet&#8217;s work in Geneva (<LINK REF="REF-Pittet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittet 2000</LINK>), but the components of multimodal campaigns vary considerably and do not always reflect the WHO recommendations.</P>
<P>Since evidence of the effectiveness of interventions to promote hand hygiene compliance and prevent HCAIs identified in <LINK REF="REF-Gould-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2010</LINK> was limited and based on methodologically weak studies, it is important to review the large number of new studies and reassess the body of evidence. We undertook this review update to demonstrate the effectiveness or otherwise of new strategies, different approaches to performance feedback, the new combinations of approaches that have been adopted, and the impact of improved hand hygiene compliance on patient outcomes and healthcare expenditure.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-13 03:49:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We considered any intervention intended to improve compliance with hand hygiene using soap and water or alcohol-based products, or both. For example, we considered education, audit with performance feedback, health promotion, and variations in availability and type of products used for hand hygiene. Studies of interventions to promote hand hygiene compliance were potentially eligible regardless of whether the intervention occurred in outbreak or non-outbreak situations. We considered studies to promote compliance with universal or infection prevention and control precautions for inclusion, provided that data relating specifically to hand hygiene compliance were presented separately. Similarly, studies to promote hand hygiene compliance as part of a care bundle approach were eligible, provided that data relating specifically to hand hygiene compliance were presented separately. We excluded studies if hand hygiene compliance was assessed in simulations or artificial settings outside the clinical environment.</P>

<P>We considered studies reporting proxy indicators of hand hygiene compliance, for example use of soap or ABHRs or compliance with hand hygiene measured by an automated monitoring device. Automated devices vary in their degree of sophistication. The simplest are straightforward devices that deliver a measured amount (e.g. 5 mls) of product to the hands and record the number of times that the device has been used. The most sophisticated are body-worn systems with sensors that indicate whether hands have been cleansed, linked to a computer that stores uptake. Healthcare workers&#8217; self-reports of their hand hygiene practices were not considered a valid measure of compliance because there is evidence that self-reports are not accurate (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>Given the substantial heterogeneity of interventions and methods across studies, it was not sensible to undertake meta-analysis to pool results; we therefore did not need to address clustering, matching, or inclusion of multi-armed studies in a quantitative synthesis. Instead, we presented the results of studies in tabular form and made a qualitative assessment of the effects of studies, based on certainty of evidence. We reported the following data (where available): pre-intervention and post-intervention data, including absolute and percentage improvement. Where researchers did not report differences, the review authors calculated them based on available data and reported in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Fourteen studies presented the results of multimodal campaigns featuring complex interventions that were similar to or based on the <LINK REF="REF-WHO-Guidelines-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Guidelines 2009</LINK> recommendations. Five studies reported multimodal campaigns that included some but not all of the elements recommended by WHO (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Madrazo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Madrazo 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeung-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 2011</LINK>). They differed in the elements not included. We categorise them as non-WHO multimodal interventions in this review. Three studies included all five types of strategies recommended by WHO; these campaigns are referred to as WHO-based multimodal interventions in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Derde-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Derde 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Perlin 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Derde-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Derde 2014</LINK> did not describe their campaign. Four studies reported campaigns that included the interventions recommended by WHO in addition to other measures, such as social marketing or staff involvement in the development of the campaign (<LINK REF="STD-Huis-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Huis 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Midturi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Midturi 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbluth-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbluth 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevenson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Stevenson 2014</LINK>). These are called WHO-enhanced multimodal interventions in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Midturi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Midturi 2015</LINK>, for example, evaluated the impact of rewards and alerts to the supervisor when hands were not cleansed, while <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbluth-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbluth 2015</LINK> additionally evaluated role-modelling, encouragement and incentives to cleanse hands.</P>
<P>Two studies reported on two separate multimodal interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2008</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2008</LINK>, one of the three interventions tested (<I>Geneva</I>) was categorised as WHO-based, while the second (<I>Washington</I>) was categorised as WHO-enhanced, as it included extensive staff involvement. <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2008</LINK> also reported a third intervention that consisted of the addition of ABHR alone. Similarly, one of the two interventions in <LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK> (<I>Clean Care is Safer Care</I>) was categorised as WHO-based, while the other (<I>VigiGerme</I>) was categorised as WHO-enhanced, as it included social marketing. <LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK> did not describe their campaigns in any detail. As the researchers did not compare results between arms, we considered each intervention separately in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> summarises the individual components of the multimodal campaigns and illustrates the variation that existed.</P>
<P>Of the remaining 12 studies, six reported a single intervention. Two of these studies focused on education; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK> evaluated education sessions while <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2013</LINK> assessed the effect of an e-learning hand hygiene game. Three studies evaluated the effectiveness of cues: signs with messages about personal consequences versus patient consequences of failing to cleanse hands (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2011</LINK>), lights above sinks switching on when staff entered the room (<LINK REF="STD-Diegel_x002d_Vacek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Diegel-Vacek 2016</LINK>), and signs portraying a stern pair of male eyes and clean scent to remind healthcare workers about hand hygiene (<LINK REF="STD-King-2016" TYPE="STUDY">King 2016</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Munoz_x002d_Price-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz-Price 2014</LINK> evaluated the different placement of ABHR dispensers in the anaesthesia room.</P>
<P>The six remaining studies focused on performance feedback with additional components. Two of these evaluated feedback as their main intervention incorporating technology into the process; <LINK REF="STD-Armellino-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Armellino 2012</LINK> videotaped hand hygiene episodes and gave feedback to the units, while <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2013a</LINK> used a wireless monitoring system that had an audible beep as a real-time reminder, and gave individual feedback. <LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2012</LINK> used two interventions, adding action planning to performance feedback; hand hygiene compliance results were reported to wards and staff were then supposed to develop action plans to address compliance issues. <LINK REF="STD-Stewardson-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Stewardson 2016</LINK> evaluated performance feedback, enhanced performance feedback and patient participation. <LINK REF="STD-Moghnieh-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Moghnieh 2016</LINK> evaluated incentive-based feedback and audit-based feedback. The multimodal campaign by <LINK REF="STD-Talbot-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Talbot 2013</LINK> differed considerably from the others, focusing on feedback to individuals as well as leadership, goal setting, financial incentives to the centre, and institution-wide marketing.</P>
<P>Three studies were complex and evaluated the effectiveness of interventions to address MRSA, such as screening, isolation precautions, and decolonisation, in addition to hand hygiene, but it was possible to extract hand hygiene data separately (<LINK REF="STD-Derde-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Derde 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Perlin 2013</LINK>). One study adopted a two-stage design in which the first stage refined the hand hygiene intervention which was then tested in the second stage (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six studies contained evidence of theoretical underpinning. In <LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK> the intervention was informed by Social Marketing Theory (<LINK REF="REF-Kotler-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotler 1971</LINK>). A framework to support staff accountability for hand hygiene developed by the authors was used in <LINK REF="STD-Talbot-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Talbot 2013</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Huis-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Huis 2013</LINK> was based on a leadership and teamwork model developed for the study based on earlier descriptions of barriers and facilitators to hand hygiene. <LINK REF="STD-Diegel_x002d_Vacek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Diegel-Vacek 2016</LINK> was based on an adaptation of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Azjen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azjen 1991</LINK>) which holds that behaviour is susceptible to change in environmental conditions and that such change can be manipulated to encourage the desired action (<LINK REF="REF-Shankar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shankar 2007</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Diegel_x002d_Vacek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Diegel-Vacek 2016</LINK> the environmental cue was a light above a sink switching on when the room was entered. In <LINK REF="STD-King-2016" TYPE="STUDY">King 2016</LINK>, the intervention was based on psychological priming. This is the process through which exposure to particular cues (auditory, olfactory or visual) have the capacity to alter behaviour without the individual becoming aware that their behaviour is being manipulated (<LINK REF="REF-Bargh-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bargh 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2012</LINK> employed an intervention based on behavioural theory that applies psychological techniques to improve compliance through performance feedback, but no specific behavioural theory was named.</P>

<P>Twenty-three of the 26 included studies were published after 2009 when WHO released its guidelines for promoting hand hygiene compliance. However, the research was initiated prior to the publication of those guidelines in all but four of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz_x002d_Price-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz-Price 2014</LINK>). Although refined for the <LINK REF="REF-WHO-Guidelines-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Guidelines 2009</LINK>, WHO had made earlier recommendations regarding hand hygiene promotion.

The guidelines also identify five components to be specifically implemented: ABHR at point of care or carried by the healthcare worker; training and education; performance observation and feedback; reminders (e.g. posters); and administrative support/institutional safety climate. Leadership and staff involvement contribute to the latter. Three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Derde-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Derde 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Perlin 2013</LINK>), and one campaign in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008 </LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2008</LINK>, implemented all five recommendations. <LINK REF="STD-Derde-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Derde 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK> may have adopted them but it is impossible to tell as details were not provided about their campaigns: they were simply described as based on the WHO guidelines, without further detail.

<P>The <LINK REF="REF-WHO-Guidelines-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Guidelines 2009</LINK> recommend that hand hygiene compliance should be assessed by direct observation because it is the only approach that can detect all hand hygiene opportunities, the number of times than an opportunity is acted on, and the appropriate timing of the hand hygiene episode in the sequence of care. In 20 studies data were collected solely by direct observation, with data collectors present on the units. In <LINK REF="STD-Armellino-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Armellino 2012</LINK>, observation was recorded by video camera. Three studies employed product usage as the sole method of data collection (<LINK REF="STD-Perlin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Perlin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2008</LINK>). Two studies documented direct observation and product usage (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2013</LINK> also assessed hand-washing technique using testing with adenosine triphosphase in addition to hand hygiene compliance. WHO acknowledges that the results of hand hygiene compliance derived through direct observation are open to bias. Thirteen studies using direct observation considered the possibility of bias in the discussion of their results (<LINK REF="STD-Derde-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Derde 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diegel_x002d_Vacek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Diegel-Vacek 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huis-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Huis 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Madrazo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Madrazo 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz_x002d_Price-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz-Price 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevenson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Stevenson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talbot-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Talbot 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeung-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-WHO-Guidelines-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Guidelines 2009</LINK> also recommend use of their tools, including the Five Moments framework and their data collection checklist. Three studies reported that their checklists were based on the WHO audit tool (<LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huis-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Huis 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mertz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz 2010</LINK> used a modified tool based on WHO tools that existed at the time, and <LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2012</LINK> used the Hand Hygiene Observation Tool which had been developed especially for their study. The other authors did not specify what observation tool was used, although five studies reported a link to the Five Moments indications for hand hygiene (<LINK REF="STD-Derde-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Derde 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Madrazo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Madrazo 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moghnieh-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Moghnieh 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbluth-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbluth 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewardson-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Stewardson 2016</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of participants and personnel</HEADING>
<P>Of the 16 studies reporting non-ITS study designs, only one was at low risk of bias for blinding of participants to group allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2011</LINK>). In this study staff were aware that signs to promote hand hygiene compliance had been positioned adjacent to sinks but were not aware that a research study was taking place. In the randomised trial with cross-over reported by <LINK REF="STD-Munoz_x002d_Price-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz-Price 2014</LINK>, ABHR dispensers placed on the work surface were visible but staff did not know what was being assessed, so we considered risk of bias to be unclear. In <LINK REF="STD-King-2016" TYPE="STUDY">King 2016</LINK>, the participants would have noticed the signs and scent but the authors did not report whether the participants knew the purpose of the study.</P>
<P>In the remaining non-ITS studies we rated risk of bias high through failure to blind staff and researchers to group allocation. In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2015</LINK>) posters and performance feedback were employed, so all staff knew about the intervention. In <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Madrazo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Madrazo 2012</LINK> posters were displayed throughout all participating centres regardless of group allocation. In <LINK REF="STD-Yeung-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 2011</LINK> reminders to cleanse hands were given throughout all participating centres, regardless of group allocation. In the remaining studies blinding was impossible because campaigns were customised to the clinical setting (<LINK REF="STD-Stevenson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Stevenson 2014</LINK>), the wireless technology used to promote hand hygiene was visible and audible (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2013a</LINK>), the lights were visible and the participants aware of the purpose of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Diegel_x002d_Vacek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Diegel-Vacek 2016</LINK>), the intervention involved performance feedback and individualised action planning to improve hand hygiene (<LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewardson-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Stewardson 2016</LINK>), the intervention was promoted by ward leaders (<LINK REF="STD-Huis-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Huis 2013</LINK>), the intervention involved an incentive or audit and feedback (<LINK REF="STD-Moghnieh-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Moghnieh 2016</LINK>), or the education was very specific so participants were aware of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the 10 ITS studies we judged one to be at unclear risk of bias because insufficient information was provided in the study to draw conclusions (<LINK REF="STD-Derde-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Derde 2014</LINK>). Risks were high in the remaining ITS studies because of the changes introduced to collect the data or because the nature of the intervention indicated that hand hygiene compliance was being studied. In <LINK REF="STD-Armellino-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Armellino 2012</LINK>, video cameras were installed to collect data. In the other ITS studies staff could have been alerted by extra AHBR stations being installed and the presence of the e-learning hand hygiene game station (<LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2013</LINK>), the appearance of posters and because it was apparent that managerial support was provided for the campaign (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Midturi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Midturi 2015</LINK>), use of incentives and feedback (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenbluth-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbluth 2015</LINK>), a care bundle to prevent MRSA was introduced and clinical leaders were involved in the delivery of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Perlin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Perlin 2013</LINK>), and pocket-sized ABHR dispensers were introduced (<LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK>). Leaders and staff were similarly involved in <LINK REF="STD-Talbot-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Talbot 2013</LINK> and by <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2008</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding of outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>Of the 16 studies reporting non-ITS study designs, four were at low risk of bias because data collectors and staff were unaware of the outcome being assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Madrazo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Madrazo 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moghnieh-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Moghnieh 2016</LINK>).

In one study with high risk of bias, researchers responsible for undertaking analysis were informed (<LINK REF="STD-Huis-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Huis 2013</LINK>), while in <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2013a</LINK> data collectors belonged to the research group and knew the outcome of interest. In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-King-2016" TYPE="STUDY">King 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewardson-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Stewardson 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diegel_x002d_Vacek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Diegel-Vacek 2016</LINK>) scents and signs, posters, and lights, respectively would have been visible to the observers. In the other three studies risk was unclear, either because the authors did not discuss blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz 2010</LINK>) or because observational data were collected by in-house infection prevention staff (<LINK REF="STD-Stevenson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Stevenson 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>For three of the 10 ITS studies risk of bias was low because outcomes were assessed by AHBR usage (<LINK REF="STD-Perlin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Perlin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK>) or by an automated monitoring device (<LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2008</LINK>). In the remaining ITS studies risks were high. In <LINK REF="STD-Armellino-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Armellino 2012</LINK> the video-camera recordings were analysed by third-party auditors who were not blind to the study outcomes, and in the ITS studies by <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Midturi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Midturi 2015</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbluth-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbluth 2015</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Talbot-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Talbot 2013</LINK>, observers were not blinded.

For four studies the risk was unclear because baseline outcome measures were not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Diegel_x002d_Vacek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Diegel-Vacek 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz_x002d_Price-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz-Price 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevenson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Stevenson 2014</LINK>). We considered risk of bias to be high in <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2015</LINK>, because there were differences between groups.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Similar baseline characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Of the 16 studies reporting non-ITS designs, we rated only three at low risk of bias because baseline characteristics were reported as similar (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz_x002d_Price-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz-Price 2014</LINK>) or used a single unit (<LINK REF="STD-King-2016" TYPE="STUDY">King 2016</LINK>). We classified <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2015</LINK> as having unclear risk of bias as there were minor differences in characteristics between groups, but the impact of such differences was unclear. <LINK REF="STD-Moghnieh-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Moghnieh 2016</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stewardson-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Stewardson 2016</LINK> reported baseline characteristics as similar but provided no supporting data. The remaining non-ITS studies were all at high risk of bias. In <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Madrazo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Madrazo 2012</LINK> types of healthcare workers were similar but the types of patients and baseline characteristics of the units in the healthcare centres participating in the different arms of the trial were not reported. In <LINK REF="STD-Mertz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz 2010</LINK>, numbers of sinks and ABHR availability were similar but there was no comparison of characteristics between patients or staff. In the cluster-randomised trial by <LINK REF="STD-Yeung-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 2011</LINK> there were more patients with severe disability in the test group and fewer sinks were available in the clinical areas where they received care. In six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Diegel_x002d_Vacek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Diegel-Vacek 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huis-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Huis 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevenson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Stevenson 2014</LINK>) no baseline characteristics were reported, so we judged the risk to be high in accordance with the EPOC criteria.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adequate protection against contamination</HEADING>
<P>Of the 16 studies reporting non-ITS study designs there was adequate protection against contamination and we rated risk of bias as low in five studies because allocation was either by organisation (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Madrazo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Madrazo 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevenson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Stevenson 2014</LINK>) or by units in different hospitals (<LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huis-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Huis 2013</LINK>). We also judged risk of bias to be low in <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2011</LINK> because, although physicians and staff could have seen the different signs to promote hand hygiene displayed in different units, they were unaware that the research study was being conducted. We rated risk of bias as high in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Diegel_x002d_Vacek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Diegel-Vacek 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mertz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz_x002d_Price-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz-Price 2014</LINK>). In the cross-over randomised trial reported by <LINK REF="STD-Munoz_x002d_Price-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz-Price 2014</LINK>, there could have been a wash-over effect among staff first allocated to the intervention group as they could have become primed to look for ABHR when it was no longer placed within reach. Similarly, staff may have become used to the light over the sink as a cue and changed behaviour when the light was not present (<LINK REF="STD-Diegel_x002d_Vacek-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Diegel-Vacek 2016</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mertz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz 2010</LINK> reported that contamination could have occurred in their study. In the remaining seven studies contamination was theoretically possible and we considered risks of bias to be unclear. In <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2013a</LINK> it was possible for information (audible bleep) to have been given to the test group, while in <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2002</LINK> nurses worked in the same hospital and could have communicated with one another. <LINK REF="STD-Yeung-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 2011</LINK> reported a high turnover of staff and as a result many in the intervention group did not in fact receive the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2015</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stewardson-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Stewardson 2016</LINK> reported that contamination could not be ruled out.

In <LINK REF="STD-Higgins-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 2013</LINK> extra ABHR stations were added while the study was in progress and two separate interventions were ongoing at the same time: the multimodal intervention and the use of the e-learning hand hygiene game station. <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK> reported that mandatory MRSA screening was introduced while their study was in progress and although the intervention took place in 10 hospitals over a period of 25 months there were no reports of other events that could have influenced outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Perlin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Perlin 2013</LINK> reported that ABHR uptake varied in the different centres pre-intervention and MRSA screening, isolation precautions and new policies for disinfection and cleaning were also introduced during that time.

In <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK> risk was unclear through possible selection bias: it was not clear which staff were invited to participate or refused. We rated risk of bias as unclear in <LINK REF="STD-King-2016" TYPE="STUDY">King 2016</LINK> because it did not distinguish between healthcare workers and visitors, and it is unclear if their behaviour in response to the scent or signs would be different. The remaining studies contained high risk risks of bias. In two of these studies the research was reported to coincide with an outbreak of the respiratory virus H1N1 and the authors stated that additional measures were introduced to control spread (<LINK REF="STD-Huis-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Huis 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Madrazo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Madrazo 2012</LINK>).

<P>As described in the following sections, overall, hand hygiene compliance increased in all studies, regardless of the intervention or the outcome measure employed. The level of increase varied, however, as did the level of hand hygiene compliance both at baseline and post-intervention. Some studies reported reduction in infections (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Perlin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewardson-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Stewardson 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeung-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 2011</LINK>) or mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Yeung-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 2011</LINK>) while other studies reported no changes (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>) or a variation depending on the micro-organism (<LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK>).

<P>Re-analysis of data from studies with inappropriate analysis was either not possible through lack of available data or not warranted, given the high risk of bias in the studies.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multimodal Campaigns</HEADING>
<P>Fourteen studies evaluated multimodal campaigns, with two evaluating two different types of multimodal campaigns (<LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2008</LINK>). Overall, multimodal interventions led to an increase in hand hygiene compliance, with very low to low certainty of evidence, depending on the components of the multimodal intervention, i.e. whether they were not WHO-based, WHO-based, or WHO-enhanced, as shown in <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> summarises the key results. Outcomes for different measures of hand hygiene compliance are detailed, with both observed hand hygiene compliance or proxy measures considered together in determining the GRADE rating.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Multimodal campaigns not based on WHO recommendations</HEADING>
<P>Five of the studies evaluated multimodal campaigns that did not contain all of the elements recommended by WHO (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Madrazo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Madrazo 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeung-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 2011</LINK>). All showed improvements in hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence) as shown in <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. All five measured observed hand hygiene compliance as the outcome; the four non-ITS studies compared results of the intervention group to results from controls who had either received no intervention or education on another topic. <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2015</LINK> reported on a stepped-wedge randomised trial and used appropriate statistical analysis. They found an increase in observed hand hygiene compliance (odds ratio (OR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 1.22), with absolute differences ranging from 1.9 to 26.7 percentage points. The other three studies were cluster-randomised trials with none adopting appropriate statistical analysis: two analysed at the level of the individual rather than the cluster (<LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Madrazo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Madrazo 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeung-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 2011</LINK>) and the other failed to compare changes between the arms of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>). However, all three studies showed increases in hand hygiene compliance in the intervention groups compared both to the control groups and to baseline levels. Baseline rates were low, ranging from 7.98% to 27%; post-intervention rates in the intervention groups ranged from 32.74% to 48.6%. The absolute differences in hand hygiene compliance compared to baseline ranged from 1.9 to 37.7 percentage points in the intervention groups and from 0.3 to 11.9 percentage points in the control groups. Results varied by study and by time period, as none had the same post-intervention assessment interval. The ITS study <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK> reported appropriate statistical analysis. This team demonstrated increases after the start of hand hygiene promotion (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.42) with monthly decreases after the campaign ended. The highest levels of hand hygiene compliance were observed during the intervention phase, with an average compliance of 63.8% in the intervention group compared to 49.3% at baseline.</P>
<P>Three of the studies also reported reduced infection (low certainty of evidence); none reported colonisation rates. <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK> reported reduced respiratory outbreaks (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.93) and reduced MRSA infections requiring hospitalisation (IRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.97) favouring the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Yeung-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 2011</LINK> reported reductions of 0.27 to 0.77 cases per 1000 resident-days in serious infections, pneumonia and death in the intervention group compared to no change or an increase of 0.57 cases per 1000 resident-days in the control group. In the ITS study <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK>, promotion of hand hygiene was incorporated into a bundle of strategies for the control of MRSA, so hand hygiene was a secondary outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2013</LINK> found that the bundle, rather than hand hygiene promotion alone or the other strategies without hand hygiene promotion, led to a decrease in MRSA isolated from clinical cultures.</P>

The other three studies used different outcome measures. <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2008</LINK> employed an electronic count of the number of times ABHR was dispensed, and reported an increase for the <I>Geneva</I> programme in hand hygiene compliance relative to baseline in immunisation and diagnosis units (IDUs) (risk ratio (RR) 1.56, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.89), but no increase on medical units. <LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK> measured ABHR in litres per 100 patient-days and reported increases in use for the <I>Clean Care is Safer Care</I> programme but did not report volume changes. <LINK REF="STD-Perlin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Perlin 2013</LINK> also measured volume of ABHR but used mean ounces of ABHR per adjusted patient-day, so the results are not readily comparable to those reported by <LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Perlin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Perlin 2013</LINK> reported an increase of 24.75 ounces of ABHR per adjusted bed-day but did not conduct statistical analysis appropriate to an ITS study.</P>
<P>Two of the studies also reported effects of the intervention on infection rates (very low certainty of evidence). Both reported hand hygiene interventions as part of a bundle for control of specific infections. <LINK REF="STD-Perlin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Perlin 2013</LINK> reported a decrease in central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) of 0.191 cases per 1000 line-days, and a decrease of 0.538 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) per 1000 ventilator-days with the bundle, but did not conduct an appropriate statistical analysis for an ITS study, so results must be interpreted with caution. <LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK> reported that the WHO-based campaign was associated with a decreased incidence of 0.03 clinical MRSA isolates for each litre of ABHR per 100 patient-days but there was no effect on <I>C. difficile</I> rates.</P>
<P>Two studies reported colonisation rates (low certainty of evidence). <LINK REF="STD-Derde-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Derde 2014</LINK> found that increasing hand hygiene compliance alone accounted for a trend towards reduction of MRSA acquisition (IRR 0.976, 95% CI 0.954 to 0.999) but neither hand hygiene alone nor the bundle of interventions had any effect on incidence of <I>C. difficile</I> or HRE. <LINK REF="STD-Mertz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mertz 2010</LINK> reported no difference in the incidence of MRSA colonisation, with 0.30 and 0.31 cases per 1000 patient days in the intervention and control groups respectively, but suggested that this might be because of the low hand hygiene compliance levels achieved post-intervention (42% to 48%).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> summarises key results from the 12 studies that evaluated interventions other than multimodal campaigns. Six studies evaluated interventions with a major emphasis on performance feedback. All reported increased hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence) as shown in <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>. Three of the studies were randomised trials. <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2013a</LINK> evaluated wireless monitoring with performance feedback of hand hygiene compliance and reported slight increases of 0 to 5 percentage points on both entry to and exit from patients&#8217; rooms, compared to slight decreases of 2 to 4 percentage points in the control group who received no intervention. There was variation according to type of ward, occupational group, and opportunity for hand hygiene but the regression results were not clearly reported. <LINK REF="STD-Fuller-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fuller 2012</LINK> focused on feedback and personalised action planning. This team reported increases in both the relative use of liquid soap and hand hygiene compliance documented by direct observation. They found an absolute increase in hand hygiene compliance from 10% to 18% (ORs 1.67 to 2.09) compared to baseline rates during the national <I>Clean Your Hands</I> campaign in England and Wales, with variation according to type of ward and baseline rates. <LINK REF="STD-Stewardson-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Stewardson 2016</LINK> reported that observed hand hygiene was only slightly higher in the groups with performance feedback (75%) and with feedback and patient participation (77%) during the intervention compared to the control group (73%), although all groups improved over baseline (66%). Absolute changes in the intervention period compared to baseline were similar: 10% in the performance feedback group (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.84) and 11% in the feedback and patient participation group (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.51 to 1.98). Both changes were slightly higher than the absolute change of 7 percentage points in the control group (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.63).</P>
<P>One study was a non-randomised trial. <LINK REF="STD-Moghnieh-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Moghnieh 2016</LINK> reported observed hand hygiene compliance rates of 43% at week eight and 51% at week 14 for the audit and feedback group compared to 16% to 20% at baseline; rates were unchanged for the control group but higher in the group receiving an incentive at both week eight (60%) and week 14 (77%). Differences between baseline and week eight ranged from 23% to 44% in the intervention groups and between 31% and 61% between baseline and week 14. Each of the other studies was an ITS. <LINK REF="STD-Armellino-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Armellino 2012</LINK> reported increases in hand hygiene compliance with video-recording and performance feedback to staff with an average increase of 4% weekly after an initial increase of 17%. Hand hygiene compliance ranged from 3.5% to 9.8% at baseline to an average of 81.6% (weekly range 30.8% to 91.2%) in the post-feedback period. <LINK REF="STD-Talbot-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Talbot 2013</LINK> reported an increase in hand hygiene compliance following a programme focused on performance feedback, leadership goal setting, financial incentives to the centre and marketing, but did not report estimates of effect.

Hand hygiene compliance was 89% in the "active accountability phase" and 75% during the intervention phase compared to 52% at baseline, with differences of 37 and 23 percentage points respectively.</P>
<P>Only one study reported on both infection rates and colonisation rates (moderate certainty of evidence). <LINK REF="STD-Stewardson-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Stewardson 2016</LINK> reported reduced primary bloodstream infection in the enhanced feedback group (IRR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.95) and control group (IRR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.80) with little change in the enhanced feedback + patient participation group (IRR 1.02, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.34). Period prevalence of HCAIs was also reduced in the enhanced feedback group (IRR 0.91, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.23), with little change in the enhanced feedback + patient participation group (IRR 1.05, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.40) and an increase in the control group (IRR 1.33, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.1.88).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-07 14:27:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-six studies met the criteria for inclusion and reported on eight different types of interventions. All reported on hand hygiene compliance, although measures differed; some also reported either infection or colonisation rates. The main results are displayed in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Multimodal interventions were evaluated by 14 studies. Multimodal interventions that include some but not all strategies recommended in the WHO guidelines, or that contain all recommended strategies plus additional strategies, may slightly improve hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence; 11 studies). In contrast, it is uncertain whether multimodal interventions that include all strategies recommended in the WHO guidelines improve hand hygiene compliance, because the certainty of this evidence is very low (five studies). Multimodal interventions that include some but not all strategies recommended in the WHO guidelines may also slightly reduce infection rates (low certainty of evidence; three studies). It is uncertain whether multimodal interventions that include all strategies recommended in the WHO guidelines, or that contain all recommended strategies plus additional strategies, reduce infection rates because the certainty of this evidence is very low (three studies). Lack of impact of interventions on <I>C. difficile </I>is unsurprising, as alcohol does not destroy the spores produced by this bacterium. Multimodal interventions that include all strategies recommended in the WHO guidelines may lead to little or no difference in MRSA colonisation rates (low certainty of evidence; two studies).</P>
<P>We found considerable variation in hand hygiene compliance, regardless of type of intervention, the outcome measure used, the study design, or the setting. Most increases in hand hygiene compliance in intervention groups were small (less than 20% in observed compliance), although larger than the increases seen in the control groups. One ITS study reported a RR of 1.56 favouring the WHO-based intervention, and one ITS and one randomised trial reported RRs of 1.48 to 1.64 favouring the WHO-enhanced intervention. Similarly, there was variation in the types of infections evaluated. MRSA was the micro-organism most commonly reported, with inconsistency in whether or not there were decreases, regardless of the type of intervention.</P>
<P>While the variation in results makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the different types of multimodal interventions, the variation in the interventions was appropriate, as the <LINK REF="REF-WHO-Guidelines-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Guidelines 2009</LINK> are intended to be adapted to the local context.</P>
<P>Performance feedback was evaluated by six studies, with considerable variation in the nature and delivery of performance feedback. Performance feedback may improve hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence; six studies). Some of the differences seen were as large as 37% to 61%, with ORs of 1.61 to 2.09 favouring the intervention. Performance feedback probably slightly reduces infection and colonisation rates (moderate certainty of evidence; one study).</P>
<P>Education may improve hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence; two studies). Differences ranged from 16.3 to 42 percentage points, although different outcome measures were used. Cues, such as signs or scent, may slightly improve hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence; three studies). There was considerable variation in results, with the scent cue resulting in greater increases in hand hygiene compliance than signs or light cues. Placement of ABHR close to the point of use probably slightly improves hand hygiene compliance (moderate certainty of evidence; one study).</P>
<P>In summary, because of the heterogeneity in the interventions, samples and outcome measures, inappropriate statistical analysis in a number of studies, and the limited number of studies evaluating a given intervention using similar measures, it is difficult to draw a clear conclusion about the effectiveness of different interventions, whether implemented as a single intervention or in combination. Given the variability of results between and within studies, we can draw no conclusion about which interventions or combination of interventions lead to clinically important improvements in hand hygiene compliance or reductions in infection or colonisation rates, and under what circumstances. In the studies that evaluated bundles for MRSA control, the role of hand hygiene could not be disentangled from the effects of other interventions. It does appear, however, that all interventions can potentially lead to some improvement in hand hygiene compliance. The main harm that may occur would be the use of resources that might have been directed elsewhere.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-20 16:26:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence is relevant to the primary and secondary review questions, namely to examine the effectiveness of different strategies to improve hand hygiene compliance in patient care and to reduce infection, respectively. Further research examining similar interventions in similar groups of participants, using robust methods and appropriate statistical analysis, will contribute to greater certainty of evidence (discussed in the next section). The results of this review, however, indicate that there is sufficient evidence to justify taking actions to improve hand hygiene, even though it is not yet clear which strategies would be the most useful for a specific context or whether a single intervention rather than a multimodal intervention would be sufficient for specific situations or clinical settings.</P>
<P>The review fits into the context of current practice because of the emphasis that hand hygiene continues to receive as an important component of infection prevention programmes in health care, international and national guidelines, and other regulations (e.g. accreditation standards in many countries). Considerable effort is put into promoting hand hygiene and monitoring hand hygiene performance and it is thus important to be able to identify effective practices. According to the <LINK REF="REF-WHO-Guidelines-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Guidelines 2009</LINK>, it is appropriate for clinical settings to individualise strategies to their context. Leadership is crucial for infection prevention and control, but is not enough on its own; implementation of hand hygiene campaigns should also consider the opinions of healthcare workers who are required to implement infection prevention interventions and involve them in local decisions about strategies to promote hand hygiene (<LINK REF="REF-Freeth-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeth 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Health-Foundation-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Foundation 2015</LINK>). Some studies considered in this review involved staff in the design of the intervention, and involved leaders, but the contribution of these strategies was not assessed. The challenge is to encourage healthcare workers to accept personal responsibility for hand hygiene rather than imposing interventions &#8216;top down&#8217; that are not tailored to the specific needs of each workplace. There is a risk that inflexible requirements for hand hygiene will be resented, as has been suggested for other aspects of infection prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Brewster-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewster 2016</LINK>). Available evidence does not yet provide answers as to how best to address this challenge.</P>
<P>There are a number of additional problems affecting completeness and applicability of the evidence. A major problem is that there is currently a lack of agreement on what optimal hand hygiene compliance should be for a specific clinical setting or situation (<LINK REF="REF-Mahida-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahida 2016</LINK>). It was not possible to draw conclusions about the ability of the interventions to achieve sustained high performance, because of the Hawthorne effect influencing performance and because of limited follow-up evaluations. The evidence did not address the effects of limited evaluation of some of the moments of hand hygiene (<LINK REF="REF-Sax-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sax 2007</LINK>); most studies documented the first and last moments only. Documentation of the Five Moments, and thus who performed hand hygiene and under what circumstance, is not possible in studies where hand hygiene compliance is assessed solely by product usage or electronic monitoring devices. The studies employing proxy measures of hand hygiene might not give valid or reliable indicators of compliance. Where product consumption is taken as the outcome measure apparent uptake could increase because more is being consumed each time the hands are cleansed or through wastage, spillage or improper use (e.g. cleaning equipment). Automated counters may break down or healthcare workers may &#8216;game&#8217;, resulting in under- or overestimation of hand hygiene compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2017</LINK>). None of the included studies examined hand hygiene technique and its impact on infection/colonisation rates.</P>
<P>There is also very limited cost-effectiveness data. This is a major omission, as healthcare workers require evidence not only of which hand hygiene interventions are effective, but also which are the most cost-effective. A number of bundles incorporate hand hygiene promotion but do not measure it separately from other outcome measures. The effect of bundling is not clear; it might increase healthcare worker awareness of the risk of specific infections or place emphasis on specific technical skills that incorporate hand hygiene that are more effective than the components of typical multimodal campaigns incorporating performance feedback, reminders and education. Factors other than hand hygiene, such as environmental cleaning, antibiotic use or colonisation pressure, can have an impact on colonisation and infection rates but were not explored in any of the studies that evaluated bundles. Finally, most studies lack a clearly articulated theoretical underpinning. Linking interventions clearly to individual and organisational behaviour change theories would benefit our understanding of how interventions to promote hand hygiene work and how best to promote hand hygiene (<LINK REF="REF-Srigley-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srigley 2015</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Certainty of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>Our judgements of the certainty of evidence for the impact of multimodal interventions on hand hygiene compliance ranged from very low to low, depending on the combination of strategies recommended by WHO. The description of interventions was limited in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Derde-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Derde 2014</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vernaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vernaz 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Whitby-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Whitby 2008</LINK>) so assumptions were made in categorizing the interventions as WHO-based or WHO-enhanced. The impact of incorrectly categorizing the studies on the GRADE rating would be minimal however as all three provided nonrandomized evidence and had at least two sources of high or unclear risk of bias. The overall conclusions about certainty of evidence for each of the three categories of multimodal interventions (not WHO, WHO based or WHO-enhanced) would be unchanged if errors were made in our categorization of these studies. Certainty of evidence about performance feedback, education strategies and cues was low, while certainty about evidence for the impact of placement of ABHR was moderate. The evidence provides a clear indication of the direction of effect of interventions but not of the magnitude or consistency of effect of specific interventions in different contexts. The certainty of evidence was more variable for the outcomes of infection and colonisation rates, ranging from very low to moderate, with some studies reporting no effect.</P>
<P>We were unable to draw robust conclusions about which interventions to promote hand hygiene compliance are most effective either singly or in combination, because of the heterogeneity of interventions, participants, settings, and outcome measures. The evidence indicates that interventions can be effective, but there was inconsistency in the degree of improvement within and between studies.</P>
<P>Key methodological limitations of the studies relate to risk of bias. Most studies contained at least two or more sources of high risk of bias and many contained sources of unclear risk. Some of the sources of bias would be difficult to eliminate. These include risk of bias arising because healthcare workers were aware they were being observed and inability to blind them to the intervention. These sources of bias might not make a marked difference if the resultant overestimation of effect is taken into consideration and allowance is made during the interpretation of results.</P>
<P>Some sources of bias could have been readily addressed at the design stage by, for example, blinding observers. Although we found many more studies of eligible design in the searches for this update compared to the first update, a number did not meet the eligibility criteria because of inadequacies at the design stage. These included lack of sufficient data collection points pre- and post-intervention and lack of documentation of a clear intervention period in the ITS studies. These omissions were particularly problematic when the studies introduced multiple different interventions at different stages in the study. Lack of an adequate control group was apparent in the randomised trials, non-randomised trials and controlled before-after studies. If more attention had been given at the design stage, more studies would have been eligible for inclusion. This in turn might have allowed the inclusion of a sufficient number of studies assessing specific interventions to enable us to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of those interventions. Furthermore, inappropriate statistical analysis was problematic in a number of studies and could also have been corrected at the design stage by identifying appropriate data to collect, and at the analysis phase.</P>
<P>Some biases could have been addressed at the reporting stage, for example, documenting baseline characteristics, blinding, and allocation methods. While it is difficult to control for other events such as outbreaks or changes in policy that could influence hand hygiene compliance, especially when studies continue over prolonged periods, reporting whether or not such changes occurred would allow for a more accurate assessment of risk of bias. Having fewer unclear risks of bias could lead to conclusions about interventions based on a stronger body of evidence.</P>

<LINK REF="REF-Kingston-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingston 2016</LINK> reviewed intervention studies published between December 2009 (after the WHO guidelines were issued) and February 2014, and searched two databases (PubMed and CINAHL). They include UCBA and ITS studies which do not meet EPOC inclusion criteria. The review authors stated that heterogeneity precluded undertaking a meta-analysis but nevertheless pooled the results and concluded that multimodal interventions are modestly effective, whether or not based on the WHO guidelines. While this review provides a useful descriptive account of the studies in terms of geographical locations and clinical settings where data were collected, it lacks critical appraisal and consideration of potential sources of bias is entirely absent.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Schweizer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweizer 2014</LINK> systematically reviewed all multimodal studies (referred to as bundles) to improve hand hygiene compliance. The searches were extensive; studies were published between 2000 and 2012. Many of 39 quasi-experimental studies in their review did not meet EPOC criteria and were not included in this second Cochrane update. The authors concluded that the quality of the studies was poor but nevertheless proceeded to meta-analysis of works that, in addition to a lack of rigour, demonstrated considerable heterogeneity. The authors concluded that multimodal interventions improve hand hygiene compliance and that the effectiveness of the different types of multimodal interventions should be evaluated employing better-quality study designs. They did not address the question of whether multimodal interventions are more effective than simpler ones.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Srigley-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srigley 2016</LINK> searched a number of databases and identified 10 studies but did not conduct a meta-analysis because of heterogeneity. Eight of the 10 studies were UCBAs; all were considered to be at moderate to high risk of bias. Interventions varied from provision of ABHR with or without education, to multimodal strategies. They concluded that interventions may improve hand hygiene and reduce HCAI rates but that future research should be undertaken employing stronger designs.</P>
<P>The only systematic review published since 2009 to rival this second Cochrane update in terms of scope and the number of papers considered is <LINK REF="REF-Luangasanatip-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luangasanatip 2015</LINK>. The aim of their review was to evaluate the effectiveness of WHO-based and other interventions to promote hand hygiene in hospital settings. They undertook comprehensive searches covering the period up to 2014. Although they said they employed EPOC criteria, they included some studies that we did not consider eligible for inclusion in our review. They proceeded to meta-analysis regardless of the marked heterogeneity between the included studies. Their conclusion differs from ours in that they considered that evidence of the effectiveness of multimodal interventions to promote hand hygiene, from a larger set of studies, is strong.</P>
<P>Our update is more rigorous than any of the four reviews discussed above and the conclusions drawn from it are correspondingly more cautious. However, our findings overall are broadly in line with those from the other reviews: there is evidence that interventions may be effective whether or not they are based on the WHO guidelines or are single strategies, and that more research studies are needed that employ stronger designs and address threats to internal validity.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-17 16:47:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-08-17 16:47:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since most HCAIs are likely spread by direct contact by the hands of staff, hand hygiene should logically provide an effective way of reducing risks of cross-infection as well as being aesthetically desirable. Many organisations have provided guidelines to promote hand hygiene in healthcare settings but those issued by WHO are the most comprehensive. The multimodal package of interventions recommended (ABHR, education, reminders, performance feedback, and managerial support) are applicable to all settings and implementation should therefore be encouraged. However, the WHO intervention will need to be adapted to meet local needs and available resources; different strategies or combinations of interventions may be more effective for some groups or healthcare settings than others. Multimodal interventions that include some but not all strategies recommended in the WHO guidelines, and those that include all the recommended strategies plus additional strategies, may slightly improve hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence), but it is uncertain whether multimodal interventions that contain all strategies recommended in the WHO guidelines improve hand hygiene compliance because the certainty of this evidence is very low.</P>
<P>There is sufficient evidence to justify taking actions to improve hand hygiene. However, it is unclear whether interventions need to be multimodal. When implemented as a single strategy, performance feedback and education may improve hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence) and cues such as signs or scent may slightly improve hand hygiene compliance (low certainty of evidence). Placement of ABHR close to the point of use as a single strategy probably slightly improves hand hygiene compliance (moderate certainty of evidence). It will therefore be important for organisations to evaluate their own results and revise their interventions accordingly.</P>
<P>Organisations also need to make decisions about which approach to use for hand hygiene audit, as each has limitations. The presence of observers is very likely to increase hand hygiene frequency and overestimate compliance, but relying solely on product uptake or electronic counting devices results in loss of information because they provide no information about the hand hygiene event in the context of care delivery. Studies have not compared individual feedback to group feedback to identify which is more effective. Oganisations will need to interpret the results of audits in terms of the methods used, e.g. accounting for overestimation of effect.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-13 06:13:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We have identified several implications for research. While study designs to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions intended to improve hand hygiene compliance and reduce HCAIs have improved since the last update of this review, there are still methodological inadequacies that should be addressed in future work. These include providing adequate controls, and blinding data collectors and those undertaking analysis to group allocation. There will always be some risk of bias in hand hygiene studies where data are collected by direct observation. Better reporting would allow risk of bias to be assessed more accurately and completely. ITS studies should include sufficient numbers of data collection points pre- and post-intervention and report the period of time over which each phase of the study was conducted.</P>
<P>A key requirement of future studies is to frame the research question in terms of the value of the different components of the intervention: at present it is not clear if multimodal campaigns offer any advantage over single interventions, or which components add the most value. Similarly studies that investigate hand hygiene as part of a bundle to reduce infection also need to address the contribution of various components to the outcome. More sophistical research designs and analyses may be necessary to be able to determine the value of individual components.</P>
<P>Multimodal interventions and bundles have the potential to be more expensive than single strategies and it is important to demonstrate which component(s) of programmes are effective so that costly but ineffective elements are not recommended for practice. Many studies now continue over several years but only a few include economic outcomes, and this should be addressed.</P>
<P>We recommend that interventions should be considered in terms of underpinning theoretical frameworks, for example drawing on knowledge from the social sciences. Most studies continue to lack convincing theoretical underpinning and in some cases no rationale is given for including some of the components of multimodal interventions.</P>
<P>More studies are needed to address the same intervention employing consistent measures, so that results are comparable. Studies could consider hand hygiene techniques which still attract little attention, and data collection. A more thorough assessment of all of the Five Moments is also warranted.</P>
<P>Some potentially valuable studies that we reviewed were flawed because the data were not analysed appropriately. Two cluster-randomised trials, for example, failed to analyse data at the level of the cluster, while multiple ITS studies did not use the correct statistical approach. Re-analysis was not possible because too little information was provided. Research teams need to access high-quality statistical support so that the appropriate analysis is conducted. Study results should also be reported as fully as possible, so that the effectiveness of the same approach can be evaluated in other hospitals and clinical settings.</P>

<P>We refined the search strategy for this review to increase precision of the search results.</P>
<P>We include one new author (MT).</P>
<P>We added 'Summary of findings' tables and GRADE ratings.</P>
<P>We updated the eligibility criteria of study designs in line with changes to EPOC criteria for study designs eligible for inclusion.</P>
<P>We updated the objective "To determine whether a sustained increase in hand hygiene compliance can reduce rates of health care-associated infection" and replaced it with "To determine whether an increase in hand hygiene compliance can reduce rates of health care-associated infection", since studies examined the effect of changes in hand hygiene compliance, not a sustained increase in hand hygiene compliance.</P>
<P>The primary objective is: "To assess the short- and long-term success of strategies to improve hand hygiene compliance in patient care". Because of inconsistency in duration of follow-up, and no clear definition of 'long-term success' in the literature or the studies, we focused only on short-term success, with "short-term" being the interval reported by the researchers.</P>
<P>In the original <LINK REF="REF-Gould-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2007</LINK> review and the <LINK REF="REF-Gould-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2010</LINK> update, the excluded studies lists summarised the reasons for lack of eligibility of the 129 excluded studies. The purpose was to highlight the types of studies being undertaken, most of which were uncontrolled before-after designs, and explain why so few studies were eligible despite the large volume of publications. Since the <LINK REF="REF-Gould-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2010</LINK> update, there has been a marked increase in the number of studies conducted using research designs that are potentially eligible for inclusion, so there is no longer a need to provide this level of detail. The excluded studies table now lists only randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and ITS studies failing to meet EPOC eligibility criteria. As previously discussed, one of the original studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gould-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gould 1997</LINK>) is no longer eligible for inclusion and has therefore been removed from the list of included studies and added to the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table. Overall, while the types of studies differed between the original review and the first updated review, the reasons for exclusion were similar, primarily relating to insufficiency of control groups or inadequate data points in ITS studies.</P>
