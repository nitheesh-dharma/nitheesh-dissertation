<P>
<B>Review question: </B>Does vitamin A supplementation among term neonates in low and middle income countries prevent mortality and morbidity?</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Vitamin A is an important micronutrient that is required for maintenance of normal functioning of the human body. In the developing world, many pregnant women are vitamin A deficient. During pregnancy, additional vitamin A is required to promote growth of the baby and to provide stores in the baby's liver. Deficiency of this micronutrient in the mother may lead to its deficiency in the baby and may result in adverse effects on the baby's health. The benefits of giving vitamin A to children older than six months of age for reducing death and adverse effects on health have been established, but no available evidence shows this beneficial effect among infants one to five months of age. Potential benefits of vitamin A supplementation during the newborn period (during the first month of life) are under investigation.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>The present review identified 12 studies including 168,460 newborns in which the intervention group was supplemented with vitamin A during the newborn period.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Key results:</B> Analysis of data for all infants shows no significant reduction in infant deaths at six months of age with the intervention and similar findings for infant deaths at 12 months of age.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence:</B> We judged the quality of evidence as high for the most important clinical outcomes, with the exception of two outcomes that we scored as having low and very low quality: &#8216;diarrhoeal events during the first 48-72 hours post supplementation&#8217; and &#8216;all-cause infant mortality at 6 months in term infants&#8217;, respectively.<BR/>

<P>Vitamin A deficiency is a major public health problem in low and middle income countries. Vitamin A supplementation in children six months of age and older has been found to be beneficial, but no effect of supplementation has been noted for children between one and five months of age.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-13 00:44:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 12 trials (168,460 neonates) in this review, with only a few trials reporting disaggregated data for term infants. Therefore, we analysed data and presented estimates for term infants (when specified) and for all infants.</P>
<P>Data for term neonates from three studies did not show a statistically significant effect on the risk of infant mortality at six months in the vitamin A group compared with the control group (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.18; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63%). Analysis of data for all infants from 11 studies revealed no evidence of a significant reduction in the risk of infant mortality at six months among neonates supplemented with vitamin A compared with control neonates (typical RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 47%). We observed similar results for infant mortality at 12 months of age with no significant effect of vitamin A compared with control (typical RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 47%). Limited data were available for the outcomes of cause-specific mortality and morbidity, vitamin A deficiency, anaemia and adverse events.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-12 23:22:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the high burden of death among children younger than five years of age in low and middle income countries, and the fact that mortality in infancy is a major contributory cause, it is critical to obtain sound scientific evidence of the effect of vitamin A supplementation during the neonatal period on infant mortality and morbidity. Evidence provided in this review does not indicate a potential beneficial effect of vitamin A supplementation among neonates at birth in reducing mortality during the first six months or 12 months of life. Given this finding and the absence of a clear indication of the biological mechanism through which vitamin A could affect mortality, along with substantial conflicting findings from individual studies conducted in settings with potentially varying levels of maternal vitamin A deficiency and infant mortality, absence of follow-up studies assessing any long-term impact of a bulging fontanelle after supplementation and the finding of a potentially harmful effect among female infants, additional research is warranted before a decision can be reached regarding policy recommendations for this intervention.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-13 00:44:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-02-12 23:24:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin A deficiency is considered a major public health problem in low and middle income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Globally, 9.8 million pregnant women are affected by night blindness, and more than 19 million have low serum retinol concentrations (&lt; 0.70 µmol/L). Night blindness affects 5.2 million preschool children, and an estimated 190 million have low serum retinol concentrations. The prevalence of low serum retinol concentrations among pregnant women is highest in South-East Asia (17.3%), followed by Africa (13.5%), whereas the prevalence of night blindness is approximately the same in the two regions (9.9% in South-East Asia vs 9.8% in Africa) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Deficiency of vitamin A may be secondary to decreased ingestion, defective absorption and altered metabolism or increased requirements. Factors such as low dietary fat intake or intestinal infection may also interfere with absorption of vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency is the most important cause of childhood blindness and contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality from common childhood infections (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2016</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-12 23:25:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient that is required for maintenance of normal functioning of the human body. It was the first fat-soluble vitamin to be discovered and for nearly a century has been known to be an important dietary constituent (<LINK REF="REF-Hopkins-1912" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopkins 1912</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCollum--1915" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCollum 1915</LINK>). Vitamin A is part of a family of compounds called retinoids; naturally occurring retinoids include retinol, retinal and retinoic acid. For human physiology, retinol is the predominant form and 11-cis-retinol is the active form. Inactive retinoids, also known as provitamin A, are produced as plant pigments and are called carotenoids. Although many carotenoids are found in foods, only about 50% can be metabolised into active retinoid forms. Beta-carotene, a retinol dimer, has the most significant provitamin A activity. Vitamin A is stored in the liver as retinyl esters and, when needed, is transported into blood, where it is carried by retinol binding protein (RBP) for delivery to other tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Bowman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowman 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vitamin A is important for normal functioning of the visual system, as well as for immune response, gene expression, reproduction, embryogenesis and hematopoiesis. It is essential for maintenance of normal epithelial tissues throughout the body (<LINK REF="REF-Bowman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowman 2001</LINK>). Preformed vitamin A is found only in animal foods such as liver, fish and dairy products (such as milk, cheese and butter); it constitutes 65% to 75% of dietary vitamin A intake. Remaining dietary vitamin A is obtained from carotenoids present in plant sources such as carrots, dark green leafy vegetables, red and orange fruits and red palm oil. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamin A vary with age. For healthy breast-fed infants up to six months of age, the average RDA is 400 µg/d, and for infants seven to 12 months of age, the RDA is 500 µg/d. For children one to three years and four to eight years old, the RDA is 300 µg/d and 400 µg/d, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-DRI-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRI 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Routine consumption of large amounts of vitamin A over time can result in toxic symptoms, which include liver damage, headaches, vomiting, skin desquamation, bone abnormalities, joint pain and alopecia (<LINK REF="REF-Bowman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowman 2001</LINK>). Hypervitaminosis A appears to be due to abnormal transport and distribution of vitamin A and retinoids that is caused by overloading of plasma transport mechanisms. A very high single dose can also cause transient acute toxic symptoms that may include a bulging fontanelle in infants; headaches in older children and adults; and vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and irritability in all age groups. Toxicity from ingestion of food sources of preformed vitamin A is rare (<LINK REF="REF-Hathcock-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hathcock 1997</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-02-13 00:44:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During pregnancy, women need additional vitamin A (an additional increment of 100 µg/d above basal requirements during the full gestation period) to sustain growth of the foetus and to provide a limited reserve in the foetal liver, as well as to maintain the woman's own tissue growth. Because therapeutic levels of vitamin A are generally higher than preventive levels, the safe intake level recommended during pregnancy is 800 µg retinol equivalents (RE)/d. Women who are or who might become pregnant should carefully limit their total daily vitamin A intake to a maximum of 3000 µg RE (10,000 IU) to minimise risk of foetal toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_NUT-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/NUT 1998</LINK>). Infants have very low levels of vitamin A stored in the liver at birth and are dependent on breast milk as a source of vitamin A during the first few months of life. Thus, maternal vitamin A deficiency during lactation, early weaning or artificial feeding may result in vitamin A deficiency among infants (<LINK REF="REF-Underwood-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Underwood 1994</LINK>). The physiological vitamin A needs of infants born to vitamin A-adequate mothers and fed breast milk with adequate vitamin A (in excess of 30 µg/dL, or 1.05 µmol/L) are met for at least the first six months of life (<LINK REF="REF-Underwood-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Underwood 1994</LINK>). Because of the need for vitamin A to promote growth in infancy, the rate of which can vary considerably, a requirement estimate of 180 µg RE/d seems appropriate. Average consumption of human milk by such infants is about 750 mL/d during the first six months (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_NUT_x002f_98.1-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/NUT/98.1 1998</LINK>). If an average concentration of vitamin A in human milk of about 1.75 mmol/L is assumed, mean daily intake would have to be about 375 µg RE, which is therefore the recommended safe level.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-02-12 23:29:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The role of vitamin A supplementation for children older than six months of age is well established (<LINK REF="REF-Beaton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaton 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Imdad-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imdad 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rice-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rice 2004</LINK>). Beaton and colleagues in their meta-analysis showed that vitamin A supplementation in children six months to five years of age significantly reduced mortality by 23% (<LINK REF="REF-Beaton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaton 1993</LINK>). A recent Cochrane review concluded that two oral doses of 200,000 IU of vitamin A given on consecutive days to children younger than two years of age with measles were associated with reduced risk of overall mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.61) and pneumonia-specific mortality (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.92) (<LINK REF="REF-Huiming-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huiming 2005</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends administration of vitamin A during vaccination contacts to prevent vitamin A deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). The policy of WHO has been to supplement vitamin A by providing 100,000 IU at the earliest possible opportunity after six months of age. However, it is now recommended that an additional 50,000 IU of vitamin A be administered with each of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and polio vaccinations, which usually are given at six, 10 and 14 weeks of age (<LINK REF="REF-Sommer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 2002</LINK>). National and regional programmes of vitamin A supplementation, which are in place in more than 60 countries worldwide, target children older than six months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Fawzi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawzi 2006</LINK>). Not only are these programmes highly effective in reducing mortality and morbidity, but in countries in which vitamin A deficiency constitutes a public health problem, they appear to be among the most cost-effective public health interventions available. Such programmes seek to maximise child survival among children older than six months - the group that accounts for a quarter of deaths in children younger than five years of age. To address the major proportion of deaths in children younger than five, programmes should target children younger than six months of age. Supplementation with vitamin A between one and five months of age has been found to have no beneficial effect (<LINK REF="REF-Daulaire-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daulaire 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rahman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_CHD-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/CHD 1998</LINK>). Supplementation of neonates has been suggested as a feasible approach to bolstering body stores of vitamin A during early infancy, thereby having an impact on mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1995</LINK>). Several randomised clinical trials and systematic reviews have evaluated this approach (<LINK REF="STD-Benn-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Benn 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Benn 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Benn 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhutta-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Bhutta 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edmond-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Edmond 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haider-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haider 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haider-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haider 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Humphrey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Humphrey 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klemm-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Klemm 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malaba-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malaba 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masanja-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Masanja 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rahmathullah-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rahmathullah 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK>).

<P>For the March 2016 update:</P>
<UL>
<LI>We conducted a comprehensive search including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 13 March 2016); Embase (1980 to 13 March 2016); and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 13 March 2016) using the following search terms: (vitamin A OR retinol OR retinoid OR retinoic OR vitamin A [MeSH]), plus database-specific limiters for RCTs and neonates (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for full search strategies for each database). We applied no language or date restrictions.</LI>
<LI>We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and recently completed trials (<A HREF="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">clinicaltrials.gov</A>; World Health Organization&#8217;s International Trials Registry and Platform - <A HREF="http://www.whoint/ictrp/search/en/">www.whoint/ictrp/search/en/</A> and <A HREF="http://www.isrctn.com/">the ISRCTN Registry</A>).</LI>

<P>For prior searches:</P>
<UL>
<LI>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 14 June 2010) in the Cochrane Library; and Embase and MEDLINE (1966 to May 2010) via PubMed using the following search terms: (Newborn OR infan* OR neonat*) AND (vitamin A OR retino*). We limited our search to the clinical trial publication type.</LI>
<LI>We limited searches to human studies and applied no language restrictions. We also searched related conference proceedings for relevant abstracts. We contacted organisations and researchers in the field for information on unpublished and ongoing trials and searched reference lists of all trials identified by the above methods.

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-02-12 23:31:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included in this review three cluster-randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bhutta-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Bhutta 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klemm-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Klemm 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK>). For <LINK REF="STD-Bhutta-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Bhutta 2016</LINK>, study investigators reported that the observed design effect and intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) for neonatal mortality were 1.29 and 0.01, respectively. For infant mortality at six months, the observed design effect and ICC were 1.27 and 0.01. <LINK REF="STD-Klemm-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Klemm 2008</LINK> reported that the observed design effect was 0.9%. For <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK>, 95% CIs of effect estimates were inflated by 10% to account for the impact of design on study findings. We estimated that the 10% increase in 95% CIs yielded an ICC of 0.04 for the cohort of infants administered vitamin A.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-02-21 11:31:08 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We analysed the data using a generic inverse variance approach to meta-analysis via Review Manager software (RevMan 2008) and generated risk ratio or rate ratio estimates with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes. For this approach, we entered data as natural logarithms (as log risk ratios and log rate ratios and standard error (SE) of log risk ratios and SE of log rate ratios) for each individual study, using data extracted from published papers or obtained from study authors if not presented in papers. We have presented data used for infant mortality analyses along with their sources in 'Additional tables'. We used the fixed-effect method for combining data when trials were examining the same intervention, and when we judged trial populations and methods as sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>The review objective was to evaluate the effect of vitamin A supplementation in term neonates. Studies included in this review had enrolled all births identified in their study settings without restriction for gestational age of &lt; 37 or &#8805; 37 weeks, which would have allowed us to use only term data. Three studies used birth weight as a criterion: <LINK REF="STD-Benn-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Benn 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Benn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Benn 2014</LINK> enrolled normal birth weight neonates (birth weight &#8805; 2500 grams), and <LINK REF="STD-Benn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Benn 2010</LINK> recruited only low birth weight neonates (birth weight &lt; 2500 grams). One study presented data for term neonates separately only in the published paper for the infant mortality outcome at six months (<LINK REF="STD-Klemm-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Klemm 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995</LINK> (Keith West; personal communication, 2008) did not provide information about gestational age. Given the small number of studies included in the review and limited available data for primary outcomes, we analysed data for term neonates, when available, then performed analyses of data for all infants. For all secondary outcomes, investigators presented data for all infants together in published papers, and we analysed these data as such. As the inclusion criterion for both <LINK REF="STD-Benn-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Benn 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Benn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Benn 2014</LINK> was birth weight of at least 2500 grams, we assumed that a greater proportion of neonates would be term babies and analysed their data as such in our term neonate analysis. We used the term 'all infants' to refer to aggregated term and preterm infant data throughout this review.</P>
<P>Two studies provided maternal supplementation with vitamin A in the postpartum period (<LINK REF="STD-Malaba-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malaba 2005</LINK>) or during pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Klemm-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Klemm 2008</LINK>). Malaba and colleagues randomised mother-infant pairs to four treatment arms (described in detail in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table), whereas Klemm and associates randomised neonates within each of three previously randomised treatment arms of a maternal supplementation trial of vitamin A. This resulted in two neonatal treatment arms in <LINK REF="STD-Klemm-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Klemm 2008</LINK>, which were balanced across maternal supplementation arms. Both studies reported no significant interaction between maternal and neonatal supplementation with vitamin A, and we included data for all neonates provided by these studies on the basis of their randomisation to the neonatal vitamin A intervention or control group.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, as outlined in the <I>GRADE Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>), to assess the quality of evidence for the following (clinically relevant) outcomes.</P>
<UL>
<LI>All-cause infant mortality at six months.</LI>
<LI>All-cause neonatal mortality (between supplementation and 28 days of age).</LI>
<LI>Blindness and signs of xerophthalmia (Bitot's spots and corneal lesions).</LI>
<LI>Adverse events reported in trials due to vitamin A toxicity: bulging fontanelles.</LI>
<LI>Adverse events reported in trials due to vitamin A toxicity: vomiting.</LI>
<LI>Adverse events reported in trials due to vitamin A toxicity: diarrhoea.</LI>
<LI>Biochemical indicator values of vitamin A deficiency (vitamin A deficiency measured as serum retinol &lt; 0.70 µmol/L).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the quality of evidence for each of the outcomes above. We considered evidence from RCTs as high quality but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations on the basis of the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates and presence of publication bias. We used the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT</LINK> Guideline Development Tool to create <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> to report the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence according to one of four grades.</P>
<UL>
<LI>High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect but may be substantially different.</LI>
<LI>Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>

<P>We measured heterogeneity among trials by calculating the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. We considered values of the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic greater than 50% to represent substantial heterogeneity, in which case we planned to explore heterogeneity by undertaking prespecified subgroup analysis. However, the small number of studies included in the review precluded evaluation of heterogeneity, when identified. We conducted subgroup analysis by geographic region and sex of the infant for mortality outcomes for all infants in response to the special interest of the scientific community in evaluating this differential effect.</P>
<P>We planned to investigate publication bias for outcomes if we identified more than 10 studies for inclusion. However, we did not investigate this bias as the number of studies included was small.</P>

For home births, they invited mothers to participate at the time of their visit to the local health centre for BCG vaccination. Study investigators randomised all infants with birth weight at least 2500 grams, with no serious medical condition or malformation and for whom parental consent was available, to oral drops of vitamin A (50,000 IU) or to placebo.

<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-2014" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 2014</LINK> is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted in a peri-urban area of The Gambia. Researchers recruited two hundred mother-infant pairs at the Sukuta Health Centre, a government health clinic in the Western coastal region of The Gambia. Inclusion criteria were singleton birth, birth weight &#8805; 1500 grams, mothers over 18 years of age, residency within the study area and administration of birth vaccinations and vitamin A supplementation within 48 hours of birth. Exclusion criteria were infants with a congenital disease, a serious infection at birth or inability to feed, and mothers who were seriously ill at the time of enrolment, were participating in other studies and/or were HIV positive. Within 48 hours of birth, investigators randomised neonates to receive an oral dose of 50,000 IU vitamin A or placebo. The primary outcome is frequency of circulating T regulatory (Treg) cells expressing gut homing receptors in infants at 17 weeks post supplementation. Secondary outcomes are differences in thymus size, B cell immune responses and improved mucosal barrier function in infant participants. Recruitment and follow-up for this study are complete and data analysis is in progress.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-20 17:16:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted this review to compare the effect of supplementing term neonates with vitamin A as compared with not providing vitamin A supplementation. As term neonatal outcome data were available for only a small number of studies, and then for infant mortality outcomes only, we analysed and presented estimates for both term neonates (when specified) and all infants for various prespecified outcomes. Our analysis of data provided for all infants provided evidence of a non-significant reduction in risk of death at six months of age in the vitamin A supplemented group as compared with the control group. Analysis of term neonatal outcomes included data from a subset of studies included in the all-infant analysis and revealed a non-significant reduction in risk of death in the first six months or 12 months of life. The reader should interpret these findings with caution because of the small number of studies contributing data to these analyses, statistical heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals that are close to the null effect. In addition to these results, our analysis of data from Asia on all infants based on geographical region showed a significant reduction in risk of death at six months as a result of vitamin A (reduction 11%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1% to 20%). On the contrary, studies from Africa showed an effect that ranged from no impact to a 21% increase in risk of mortality. Overall, our review findings do not suggest a potential effect of this intervention on infant mortality.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-02-21 12:24:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included a total of 12 trials conducted to evaluate the effect of vitamin A supplementation for neonates. These include all trials conducted to date to assess this intervention. Inclusion of these studies, which we identified through extensive searches of the literature and of additional data obtained by contacting study authors, represents the overall completeness of evidence.</P>
<P>Deficiency of vitamin A is a major nutritional concern in many countries of the world. All studies included in this review were conducted in low and middle income countries with varying levels of vitamin A deficiency and infant mortality. These studies have demonstrated a mix of effects on infant mortality resulting from supplementation with vitamin A, and studies conducted in areas with vitamin A deficiency indicate a potential beneficial effect of supplementation; however, studies conducted in regions with less deficiency suggest no benefit of supplementation and potential for harm.</P>
<P>Reasons for these conflicting findings are unclear, and data show no clear indication of the biological mechanisms through which vitamin A could lower risk of death when given during the neonatal period. Investigators have proposed various mechanisms. Newborns have marginal reserves of vitamin A in their liver, and they depend on breast milk as a source of this vitamin during the first few months of life. Hence, low maternal vitamin A levels translate into vitamin A deficiency among newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Underwood-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Underwood 1994</LINK>). Deficiency of vitamin A could begin very early in life if colostrum is discarded or breastfeeding is inadequate. Colostrum and early breast milk have been found to be very rich sources of vitamin A that can significantly augment vitamin A stores among neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Wallingford-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallingford 1986</LINK>). Along with inadequate breastfeeding, introduction of artificial feeds hinders establishment of good breastfeeding practices, thereby denying infants this critical source of vitamin A throughout the breastfeeding period (<LINK REF="REF-Haskell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haskell 1999</LINK>). Artificial feeds early in life also increase the risk of gastrointestinal infection among these infants. It has been proposed that vitamin A supplementation may have an impact on infant mortality through development and maintenance of the integrity of intestinal and respiratory epithelia, and by provision of enhanced local and systemic immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tielsch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tielsch 2008</LINK> - a report on <LINK REF="STD-Rahmathullah-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rahmathullah 2003</LINK>). These pathways may provide an explanation for the effect of supplementation in settings where the practice of discarding colostrum, the presence of inadequate breastfeeding or reports of artificial feeds and infections are common. Alternatively, early initiation of feeding of colostrum and exclusive breastfeeding could explain absence of a beneficial effect of vitamin A received as a supplement. However, in this review, we could not study these proposed mechanisms, as only a few included studies presented limited information on breastfeeding practices and the use of artificial feeds.</P>
<P>Limited data were available for the outcomes of cause-specific mortality and morbidity and vitamin A deficiency, measured as serum retinol values in infants. Data on adverse events, specifically bulging fontanelle, vomiting or diarrhoea, were also limited and showed no significant increase within the first 48 to 72 hours of supplementation.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-02-13 00:45:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We graded the evidence for most outcomes as high quality, with the exception of two outcomes that we scored as having low and very low quality: &#8216;diarrhoeal events during the first 48-72 hours post supplementation&#8217; and &#8216;all-cause infant mortality at six months in term infants&#8217;, respectively (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). We downgraded the former outcome for inconsistency and imprecision, a moderate level of statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 58%) and wide confidence intervals, with the lower confidence limit indicating a 19% reduction in diarrhoeal events and the upper limit indicating a 13% increase. We downgraded the latter outcome, 'all-cause infant mortality at six months in term infants', to very low quality, although the previous review judged this outcome as low quality. This change reflected adoption of a random-effects model; the estimate changed from a risk ratio (RR) of 0.82 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.99) to an RR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.18), with the wider confidence interval indicating less precision. It should be noted that we considered the evidence for all-cause infant mortality at six months in all infants as high quality, despite inclusion of three studies with the outcome for term infants. With the introduction of eight new studies into the analysis of data for all infants, the relative influence of the three previously included studies decreased. Unclear risk of bias from <LINK REF="STD-Klemm-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Klemm 2008</LINK> was no longer a reason to downgrade the quality of the entire analysis because it had little effect on the overall risk ratio. Likewise, heterogeneity was lower (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 47%), and imprecision was not indicated as serious.</P>

<P>This update of the review includes additional data published since the time of the last update. We conducted an extensive literature search to identify new studies or new publications of previously included studies available since the last search was conducted.

Given that we applied the Cochrane methods described above, the findings of this review are unlikely to be affected by biases in the review process.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-02-21 11:07:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Considerable debate has surrounded the issue of supplementing neonates with vitamin A owing to conflicting study findings and variability in the results of pooled analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gogia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gogia 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haider-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haider 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sachdev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachdev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tielsch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tielsch 2008</LINK>). The current review includes most of the up-to-date data available on neonatal vitamin A supplementation and additional data provided when we contacted study authors.</P>
<P>Two of the included trials, one conducted in India (<LINK REF="STD-Rahmathullah-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rahmathullah 2003</LINK>) and one in Bangladesh (<LINK REF="STD-Klemm-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Klemm 2008</LINK>), examined a population characterised by high infant mortality and vitamin A deficiency. The trial in India showed a reduction of 22% in risk of infant mortality at six months, whereas the trial in Bangladesh showed a 15% reduction in risk of infant mortality in the vitamin A group compared with the control group. In the Indian setting, 5% to 6% of included women reported a history of night blindness, which is a clinical manifestation of vitamin A deficiency, and this event was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.26). Study authors noted that the impact of vitamin A supplementation on mortality was evident from two weeks of age and continued until three months, after which no further effect was apparent. The Bangladesh trial reported similar observations, including a difference in mortality among infants as early as after the first week of life that persisted until four months of age. Approximately 9.5% of pregnant women in each group reported night blindness during their most recent pregnancy. Investigators measured a subsample of this study population for serum retinol in the first trimester and showed suboptimal vitamin A status (defined as serum retinol &lt; 1.05 µmol/L) in approximately 41% of women in the vitamin A group and 36% of those in the control group. These findings of an effect of vitamin A on risk of mortality between the early weeks of life until four months do indicate a common biological mechanism of vitamin A. Of the three large recent trials funded by the World Health Organization (WHO), the trial conducted in India by Mazumder et al examined a population with moderate vitamin A deficiency (about 40% of mothers in this setting had low vitamin A status). Researchers reported a significant reduction of 10% in risk of infant mortality at six months of age with vitamin A supplementation for neonates. This beneficial effect was evident in survival curves after a few weeks of supplementation and was sustained until 12 months of age. This study observed no significant interaction between the intervention effect and sex of the infant in terms of mortality at six months. <LINK REF="STD-Humphrey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Humphrey 1996</LINK>, an Indonesian trial, was the first trial of vitamin A supplementation in neonates that was conducted as a safety trial. Although this trial had reported significant benefit for survival that was notable after the first month and became consistent after four months of birth, trial authors had noted that the mother included in the study had little vitamin A deficiency (based on serum retinol levels for a subset of the study population). The infant mortality rate in the control group (7.2 per 1000 child-years) was well below that reported for families included in this study, which were relatively privileged (<LINK REF="STD-Humphrey-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Humphrey 1996</LINK>). Although serum retinol levels were adequate, these findings provide no information on hepatic reserves, which may have been low in this study group (<LINK REF="REF-Tielsch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tielsch 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies conducted in Nepal, Zimbabwe, Guinea Bissau, Ghana and Tanzania reported conflicting results. <LINK REF="STD-West-1995" TYPE="STUDY">West 1995,</LINK> the Nepal trial, was part of a larger vitamin A supplementation trial in preschool children. Infants supplemented during the neonatal period did not show a significant effect on infant mortality, which investigators evaluated at four months of age. Of note, this study setting was characterised by endemic vitamin A deficiency and high infant mortality. This finding contrasted with findings from other studies conducted in similar settings. Studies conducted in Zimbabwe (<LINK REF="STD-Malaba-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Malaba 2005</LINK>) and Guinea Bissau (<LINK REF="STD-Benn-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Benn 2008</LINK>) reported non-significant effects of vitamin A on both six-month and 12-month infant mortality outcomes. Benn and associates (<LINK REF="STD-Benn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Benn 2010</LINK>) measured infant mortality in a study conducted in Guinea Bissau at 12 months and reported no effect on this outcome. The vitamin A status of mothers provided evidence of minimal deficiency in these study settings, with mean (± standard deviation (SD)) serum retinol values in a subset of Zimbabwean women in the control group of 1.09 (± 0.29) and 1.19 (± 0.42) µmol/L at six weeks postpartum. In Guinea Bissau, less than 1% of women had low retinol binding proteins (retinol binding proteins &lt; 1.11 µmol/L). This study also measured serum retinol values among infants at six weeks and four months of age and found no evidence of an effect of vitamin A supplementation on vitamin A deficiency. An important feature of this trial is that all eligible children were provided free consultations and essential drugs for any illness during the first year of life. The mechanism through which vitamin A supplementation in children older than six months of age improves survival has been explained in part by a reduction in severity rather than the incidence of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1996</LINK>). We believe that provision of free consultations and essential drugs for illnesses in the Guinea Bissau trial masked any beneficial effect of vitamin A supplementation that might have occurred by reducing episodes of severe illness. Recent large trials in Ghana (<LINK REF="STD-Edmond-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Edmond 2015</LINK>) and Tanzania (<LINK REF="STD-Masanja-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Masanja 2015</LINK>) also reported no significant beneficial effect of vitamin A supplementation on infant mortality at six months. Results of these trials indicated potential for harm. Study sites for these recent studies included districts with long-running demographic surveillance programmes for supplementation of women to address the problem of micronutrient deficiencies. As a result, less than 3% of women in Ghana and 5% to 8% of those in Tanzania had biochemical vitamin A deficiency.</P>
<P>This update also found differences in the effect of vitamin A supplementation for neonates on infant mortality at six months by geographic region, with studies conducted in Asia showing a beneficial effect of supplementation and those in Africa indicating potential for harm. <LINK REF="REF-Haider-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haider 2015</LINK> noted this in another pooled analysis of data. The reasons for possible differences in results of trials conducted in different geographic regions are uncertain. However, these findings could represent genuine differences in population-attributable risks of micronutrient deficiencies. As noted above, studies included neonates of mothers with varying levels of baseline vitamin A deficiency, both low birth weight and normal birth weight neonates and varying rates of baseline infant mortality. These factors could affect the generalisability of study findings. It should be noted that in contrast to observed benefits of vitamin A supplementation among mothers in Nepal (<LINK REF="REF-West-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1999</LINK>), a large trial of maternal vitamin A supplementation in Ghana (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkwood-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkwood 2010</LINK>) reported no benefit.</P>
<P>Another concern raised by some trial authors is the presence of a differential effect of vitamin A supplementation for neonates on infant mortality by sex (<LINK REF="STD-Benn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Benn 2014</LINK>). In the current review, we conducted a subgroup analysis by sex of the infant, when data were available. Although results showed no significant difference in infant mortality at six months of age, findings were statistically significantly different for infant mortality at 12 months, with significantly higher risk noted in the subgroup of female infants (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.41). <LINK REF="STD-Benn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Benn 2014</LINK> reported similar findings in an assessment and pooled analysis of infant mortality among children six to 12 months of age; however, recent trials did not observe significant interaction of effects of interventions on infant mortality at six months by sex. Given these differences in study findings, additional research is warranted to further study this effect.</P>

<P>Evidence provided in this review does not indicate a potential beneficial effect of vitamin A supplementation for neonates at birth in reducing mortality during the first six months or 12 months of life. Analyses based on geographical region, however, demonstrated a beneficial effect of supplementation in studies from Asia and potential for harm in studies from Africa. Given this finding and the absence of a clear indication of the biological mechanism through which vitamin A could affect mortality during early infancy, along with substantial conflicting findings from individual studies conducted in settings with potentially varying levels of maternal vitamin A deficiency and infant mortality; the absence of follow-up studies assessing the long-term impact of a bulging fontanelle after supplementation; and the finding of a potentially harmful effect among female infants, additional research is warranted before a decision can be reached regarding any policy recommendations for this intervention.</P>

<P>Future research should seek to identify biological mechanisms and indicators for vitamin A in reducing risk of death, and to explain the differences observed in vitamin A supplementation trials conducted in different geographical settings with varying levels of baseline vitamin A deficiency.

Future investigators should make every effort to stratify effects by sex of the infant, age after birth of vitamin A administration, prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation.</P>

The 3 randomly assigned groups were similar in terms of their background characteristics (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). A total of 176 deaths occurred; 2 of these were due to accidents and were censored. Fourteen deaths occurred after the child had been eligible for a national vitamin A campaign.

<P>Quote: "We had based our sample size calculations on an infant mortality rate of 70, but in this trial it declined to 39. Although this clearly is a very positive development, it decreased our power to detect any differences between the randomly assigned groups. With the current MR, we only would have been able to show a difference of &gt; 40% between the 2 doses. Because there was minimal difference between the 2 doses, we used the data to test findings made in our previous NVAS trial. All of these analyses were not a priori analyses prespecified in the protocol but were formulated before we initiated the data analysis of the present trial. The trial was not sized to test these findings, and the results should be interpreted with appropriate caution"</P>

<P>The following issues were evaluated and entered into the risk of bias table:<BR/>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:<BR/>a. low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);<BR/>b. high risk (any non-random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:<BR/>a. low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);<BR/>b. high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>3. Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:<BR/>a. low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;<BR/>b. low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel;<BR/>c. low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors.<BR/>
<BR/>4. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion, when reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. When sufficient information was reported or supplied by trial authors, we re-included missing data in analyses. We categorised the methods as:<BR/>a. low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);<BR/>b. high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data);<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>5. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:<BR/>a. low risk (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);<BR/>b. high risk (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>6. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether a potential source of bias was related to the specific study design, whether the trial was stopped early owing to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:<BR/>a. low risk;<BR/>b. high risk;<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
</P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses.<BR/>
