<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Leukotriene receptor antagonists are a new class of drug which may have an anti-inflammatory action in some patients with asthma. In theory they may also be of benefit in bronchiectasis, but no randomised controlled trials have yet been reported so it is not possible to make a recommendation about their use in this condition.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-26 15:16:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LRAs) have recently been identified as a useful drug in bronchial asthma. In an acute asthma attack, numerous inflammatory mediators including leukotrienes are released by mast cells. Leukotrienes in particular are potent bronchoconstrictor agents and act as a chemo-attractant for eosinophils. They also have a role in neutrophil mediated inflammation, for example in cystic fibrosis. LRAs inhibit specific receptors for leukotrienes in the bronchiolar tissues so they may reduce bronchoconstriction, oedema, mucus secretion and eosinophil or neutrophil - mediated airway damage.</P>
<P>This review aimed to identify all clinical trials of LRAs in bronchiectasis and synthesize the findings into an overall conclusion regarding the effect of LRAs in bronchiectasis.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of the review was to determine whether LRAs have any additive benefit over and above conventional treatment for bronchiectasis (usually consisting of antibiotics and postural drainage).<BR/>The specific purpose of the review was to assess whether the use of LRAs has any benefit on symptoms, pulmonary function, exacerbation rate, quality of life and mortality.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-05-25 18:08:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>To be selected, studies will be randomised against either placebo or other active treatment ,and may be parallel group or cross-over design.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis based on clinical symptoms and imaging techniques (either high resolution CT scanning or bronchography). Patients with cystic fibrosis would be excluded.<BR/>Other therapy used for bronchiectasis during the study must be stable and well documented. Subgroup analysis by co-intervention would be carried out to investigate use in differing grades of severity of bronchiectasis.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Participants randomised to use LRAs such as Montelukast or zafirlukast or matching placebo.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-05-25 18:08:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>All outcome measures of bronchiectasis severity were to be considered, but specifically:</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2011-05-26 15:13:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts (please see the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/AIRWAYS/frame.html">Airways Group Module</A> for further details). All records in the Specialised Register coded as 'bronchiectasis' were searched using the following terms:<BR/>
<BR/>leukotriene* or leucotriene* or anti-leuk* or "anti leuk*" or anti-leuc* or "anti leuc*" or *lukast or lukast* or cysteinyl OR montelukast or zafirlukast or pranlukast</P>
<P>An additional search of CENTRAL was carried out using the same search terms. The most recent searches were run in May 2011.</P>
<P>Bibliographies from included studies, reviews and texts were checked for further references to trials.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-05-25 18:08:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>SELECTION OF TRIALS</P>
<P>Initially the titles, abstracts and citations were independently reviewed by the two reviewers (JC and CW) to assess potential relevance for full review. Subsequently from the full text, both reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion based on the criteria for population, intervention, study design and outcomes.</P>
<P>QUALITY ASSESSMENT<BR/>Studies to be included were subjected to quality assessment by both reviewers, using two the Cochrane approach and the method of Jadad.</P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>Data were to be extracted from published selected studies by both reviewers JAC and CJW and entered into the Cochrane Collaboration software programme.</P>
<P>STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS<BR/>Where possible, all included trials were to be combined using the Review Manager. For continuous variables the results of individual studies were to be calculated as fixed effects weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD), with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). For similar studies the pooled WMD or SMD and 95%CI were to be calculated. The SMD was to be used only used to pool the same type of variable (e.g. PEFR) when expressed in different units e.g. L/min and percent of predicted normal. It would not have been used to pool different variables such as clinic FEV1 and home PEFR measurements. For pooled effects a Breslow-Day test of heterogeneity was to have been carried out and a p value &lt;0.05 would have been considered significant.</P>
<P>Planned subgroup comparisons were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Concurrent use of corticosteroids (none, inhaled, oral)</LI>
<LI>Concurrent use of salmeterol (which may have effects on neutrophils)</LI>
</OL>
<P>Planned sensitivity analyses were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Methodological quality - Cochrane criteria A versus B &amp; C and Jadad score 3-5 versus &lt;3</LI>
<LI>Random effects versus fixed effects modelling.</LI>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-01 14:03:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Leukotriene antagonists have only recently been licensed for use in asthma, for which they were originally designed. The absence of reported trials in bronchiectasis is more likely due to prioritisation of trials than failure to publish negative studies. The number of patients with asthma (and therefore the market for this type of drug) is much larger than for bronchiectasis. There are theoretical grounds for studies using these drugs in bronchiectasis, however.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No relevant trials appear to have been published so this review concludes that there is no evidence of effect of leukotriene antagonists in bronchiectasis rather than evidence of no effect.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Clinical trials of the use of leukotriene antagonists in bronchiectasis are required.</P>
