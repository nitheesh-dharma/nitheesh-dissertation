<TITLE>Autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion (glue ear)</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-04-24 14:21:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Otitis media with effusion (OME) or 'glue ear' is very common in children and the hearing loss and discomfort, especially where the effusion is bilateral and long-lasting, may lead to problems with language, development and behaviour. There are a number of treatment options including steroids, antibiotics, decongestants, antihistamines and surgery (the insertion of grommets (ventilation tubes)). Grommet insertion is one of the commonest operations of childhood. The best treatment strategy remains controversial, however, as glue ear often resolves spontaneously within a few months.</P>
<P>Autoinflation is a technique whereby the Eustachian tube (the tube that connects the middle ear and the back of the nose) is reopened by raising pressure in the nose. This can be achieved by forced exhalation with closed mouth and nose, blowing up a balloon through each nostril or using an anaesthetic mask. The aim is to introduce air into the middle ear, via the Eustachian tube, equalising the pressures and allowing better drainage of the fluid.</P>
<P>This review included eight randomised controlled trials of autoinflation for glue ear. All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow-up.</P>
<P>The review authors used a combined outcome measure which included any outcome signifying improvement (as defined in the individual studies) and measured outcomes at the time points 'up to one month' and 'more than one month'. Improvement was demonstrated only in 'more than one month' analyses. Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device at both under one month and over one month. None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions.</P>
<P>The authors conclude that the evidence for the use of autoinflation in the short term appears favourable.<B> </B>Given the small number of studies and the lack of long-term follow-up, the long-term effects associated with the use of these devices cannot be determined.</P>

<P>Otitis media with effusion (OME) or 'glue ear' is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or infection. It is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and the usual reason for insertion of 'grommets'. Potential treatments include decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. Autoinflation devices have been proposed as a simple mechanical means of improving 'glue ear'.</P>

Similarly, there were no significant changes for discrete pure-tone audiometry and non-discrete audiometry. Pooled estimates favoured, but not significantly, the intervention for the composite measure of tympanogram or audiometry at less than one month; at more than one month the result became significant (RRI 1.74, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.50). Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device under one month (RRI 7.07, 95% CI 3.70 to 13.51) and over one month (RRI 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.04).</P>

<P>All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow-up. However, because of the low cost and absence of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. Primary care could prove a beneficial place to evaluate such interventions and there is ongoing research in this area. Further research should also consider the duration of treatment, the long-term impact on developmental outcomes in children and additional quality of life outcome measures for children and families.</P>

<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 4, 2006.</P>
<P>Otitis media with effusion (OME) or 'glue ear' is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or infection. It is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Rovers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rovers 1999</LINK>). It is common in children between the ages of one and three years and in seasons when there is a high incidence of the common cold, with a prevalence of OME between 10% and 30%. The cumulative incidence to the age of four years is 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Zielhuis-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zielhuis 1990</LINK>) and at age seven the prevalence is still 3% to 8% (<LINK REF="REF-Fiellau-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiellau 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fiellau-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiellau 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lous-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lous 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teele-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teele 1989</LINK>). The aetiology of 'glue ear' is uncertain, but low-grade infection, poor Eustachian tube function and adenoidal infection or hypertrophy have all been implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Bluestone-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bluestone 1988</LINK>). Otitis media with effusion often resolves spontaneously within a few months (<LINK REF="REF-Fiellau-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiellau 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>Otitis media with effusion (OME) may be associated with ear ache (otalgia), infection and/or hearing loss. Hearing loss may be significant (20 dB to 30 dB), particularly when the disorder is bilateral and has lasted for more than a month (<LINK REF="REF-Fiellau-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiellau 1983</LINK>). However, some children have nearly normal hearing despite the presence of fluid within the middle ear. The hearing loss and discomfort may have linguistic, developmental, behavioural and other social consequences, particularly if the effusion is bilateral and of long duration (<LINK REF="REF-Lous-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lous 1995</LINK>). Some studies have shown that children with unilateral or bilateral otitis media with effusion have balance problems (<LINK REF="REF-Golz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grace-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grace 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>For its diagnosis, tympanometry in combination with otomicroscopy or pneumatic otoscopy is the recommended technique (<LINK REF="REF-Bluestone-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bluestone 1988</LINK>). Tympanometry is performed with a handheld device inserted in the ear canal and measures the eardrum responses to the sound and different pressures. Diagnostic tympanometry results in a flat curve (relative gradient less than 0.1, type B) or in a curve with a middle ear pressure between -399 to -200 daPa (C2 curve) (<LINK REF="REF-Jerger-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jerger 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zielhuis-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zielhuis 1989</LINK>) or when mobility of the tympanic membrane is absent or reduced, or fluid and/or air bubbles are evident behind the eardrum (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 2010</LINK>). Type A and C1 tympanograms are considered not to represent otitis media with effusion. The presence of a significant (10 dB) air-bone gap on pure-tone audiometry correlates well with the presence of fluid in the middle ear.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Management options</HEADING>
<P>OME usually resolves spontaneously (20% will resolve in one month and 40% at three months (<LINK REF="REF-Fiellau-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiellau 1979</LINK>)) and many children will require no specific treatment. The most common medical treatment options include the use of decongestants (<LINK REF="REF-Griffin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 2011</LINK>), mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines (<LINK REF="REF-Griffin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 2011</LINK>) and antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-van-Zon-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Zon 2012</LINK>). Of these options, only steroids have been shown effective and only for short-term resolution (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2011</LINK>). Surgical treatment is more widely used and better researched, with options including grommet insertion (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 2010</LINK>), myringotomy tympanocentesis (surgical incision of the eardrum, with or without aspiration of fluid from the middle ear cavity) and adenoidectomy (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Aardweg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Aardweg 2010</LINK>). The optimal treatment strategy remains controversial, with wide international variability in clinical practice.</P>
<P>'Autoinflation' refers to the opening of, and forcing of air through, the Eustachian tube by the raising of intranasal pressure. This may be achieved by forced exhalation with closed mouth and nose, blowing up a balloon through each nostril, use of an anaesthetic mask or a Politzer device. The aim of these procedures is to introduce air into the middle ear, via the Eustachian tube, to equilibrate the pressures. This is most likely to help in 'Eustachian tube dysfunction' and has been proposed as a treatment for otitis media with effusion (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt_x002d_Williams-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt-Williams 1968</LINK>). This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of autoinflation devices in children and adults with otitis media with effusion.</P>

<P>We carried out analysis on the basis of intention-to-treat. Where possible we combined data to give a summary measure of effect.</P>
<P>When outcome data obtained were binary - recovered or improved glue ear or audiometry improvement - we used relative risks of improvement to compare interventions. The data reported in the trials mainly used 'ears' as their analysis unit despite using individuals as randomisation units. To correct for this and to give adequate weight to the studies we adjusted the outcomes using the 'design effect', which takes into consideration the association found in using both ears from the same individual (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We estimated the 'design effects' from the Blanshard data (full data set provided by author) at one month and three months for participants with either types B or C2 tympanograms or only type B tympanograms. Minor differences in correlation between intervention and control groups (smaller at three months) were found, but an average was used, as differences could be due to sampling variation. For participants with type B or C2 tympanograms the design effect at one month was 1.25, while at three months it was 1.51. For participants with only type B tympanograms the design effect was 1.3 for both one and three months follow-up.</P>
<P>We used the appropriate design effect (for less than one month or more than one month by tympanogram type at entry) to obtain adjusted risk ratios (RR) for all studies that provided data for the outcome. We calculated and then entered the log(RR) and the SE(log(RR)) into RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). As the focus of the review is on recovery/improvement we emphasise the use of a positive outcome and refer to the RR obtained as the 'relative risk of improvement' or RRI; instead of using the term risk ratio which is normally associated with a negative outcome (e.g. death).</P>
<P>When data were continuous, we used mean differences to compare interventions. We used the GIV (generic inverse variance) method with a random-effects model to pool studies together and examined heterogeneity using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic. Funnel plots were not used as the number of studies found was too small for these to provide relevant information. We carried out analyses using RevMan 5.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analyses had been planned on the basis of the diagnosis of otitis media with effusion and the extent of the hearing loss measured on audiometry. However, insufficient studies were identified to allow these analyses. We also planned subgroups according to age (under three years, three to 12 years and over 12 years). However, we could not identify any papers of sufficient quality including children aged under three years and only one paper included children over 12 years (<LINK REF="STD-Lesinskas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lesinskas 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>From the 2013 update searches, we retrieved a total of 401 references. Following first-level screening (i.e. removal of duplicates and clearly irrelevant references) by the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Search Co-ordinator we were left with 127 references for further consideration. Following sifting by the authors two more duplicates were removed and 105 discarded following screening of titles and abstracts, leaving 20 reports for consideration. Two were studies which we have included in the updated review (<LINK REF="STD-De-Nobili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Nobili 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ercan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ercan 2005</LINK>).

<P>From the original searches (2006 publication of this review), 418 abstracts were obtained from the search, with 62 selected as possibly relevant. These were screened for relevance and we obtained 24 full-text articles. Of these full-text articles two review authors (JH and RP) filtered out 16 as duplicates or rejected them for not fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Two further reports were awaiting assessment in the original review and remain so (<LINK REF="STD-Niebuhr_x002d_Jorgensen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Niebuhr-Jorgensen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scadding-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Scadding 2002</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>). Limited available information has meant that these studies cannot yet be excluded from meeting the review criteria. There have been no published data following on from either of the abstracts for these studies. Contact with one of the authors has indicated that one of the studies may be published in the future (<LINK REF="STD-Scadding-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Scadding 2002</LINK>), whilst the other author has not been contactable (<LINK REF="STD-Niebuhr_x002d_Jorgensen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Niebuhr-Jorgensen 1996</LINK>). Six studies were included in the original (2006) version of the review.</P>
<P>It is hoped that the two ongoing studies will be able to contribute their results to this review in the future. The <LINK REF="STD-Tel_x002d_Aviv-Med-Center-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tel-Aviv Med Center 2006</LINK> study commenced in October 2006. The authors confirmed in 2010 that their results would be released shortly; unfortunately this has been delayed and a new date has not been announced. The <LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2011</LINK> study started in September 2011 and it is hoped that results will be available during winter of 2013-14.

Diagnosis of OME was confirmed by tympanometry alone in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-De-Nobili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Nobili 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stangerup-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stangerup 1992</LINK>), tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lesinskas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lesinskas 2003</LINK>), tympanometry and otoscopy in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ercan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ercan 2005</LINK>), tympanometry, otoscopy and audiometry in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Brooker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 1992</LINK>) and audiometry and otoscopy in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Arick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arick 2005</LINK>). Stangerup and Blanshard only included participants with a diagnosis of bilateral OME of at least three months duration. The diagnosis of OME by tympanogram varied from study to study, with some defining types B and C2 as OME (<LINK REF="STD-Blanshard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanshard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stangerup-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stangerup 1992</LINK>) while others only included type B (<LINK REF="STD-Brooker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ercan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ercan 2005</LINK>).</P>

Seven out of the eight studies used observation without treatment as their control; the exception was Ercan who maintained nasal saline irrigation in the control. The duration of the intervention was variable, with a minimum of 10 days (<LINK REF="STD-Lesinskas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lesinskas 2003</LINK>) to a maximum of seven weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Arick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arick 2005</LINK>). The number of times per day the autoinflation procedure was designed to be carried out was relatively consistent: three times per day (<LINK REF="STD-Blanshard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanshard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brooker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ercan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ercan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stangerup-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stangerup 1992</LINK>) or two times per day (<LINK REF="STD-Arick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arick 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lesinskas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lesinskas 2003</LINK>).

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1977</LINK>) used a three-factorial design to compare autoinflation, ephedrine drops and Dimotapp<SUP>®</SUP> elixir to treat OME. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lesinskas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lesinskas 2003</LINK>) the intervention was carried out by a physician, not the patient or a carer.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes and follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Tympanometry was the most commonly used outcome and was reported in four trials, as a dichotomous variable (improvement yes/no) (<LINK REF="STD-Blanshard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanshard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Nobili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Nobili 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stangerup-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stangerup 1992</LINK>) and as a continuous variable (difference in mean middle ear compliance) (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1977</LINK>). Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brooker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ercan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ercan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lesinskas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lesinskas 2003</LINK>) reported dichotomous, composite measures obtained from tympanometry combined with other outcomes. Lesinskas reported a total score that combined pneumotoscopic appearance, tympanometry, patient complaint and audiometry. Brooker reported improvement in both tympanometry and audiometry as a single, combined outcome measure. Audiometry was reported as a separate outcome in three trials. One of these (<LINK REF="STD-Blanshard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanshard 1993</LINK>) reported a dichotomous change in pure-tone audiometry threshold at frequencies between 250 Hz and 4000 Hz, while the other two trials reported it as a continuous outcome (mean change in pure-tone audiometry thresholds at frequencies between 500 Hz to 4000 Hz (<LINK REF="STD-Arick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arick 2005</LINK>) or 500 Hz to 2000 Hz (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1977</LINK>)). Other outcomes reported were tympanic membrane mobility on otoscopy (<LINK REF="STD-Arick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arick 2005</LINK>) and clearance of fluid from the middle ear (<LINK REF="STD-Blanshard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanshard 1993</LINK>).

<P>We assessed studies for risk of bias in four areas: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. We also assessed the quality of the intervention in terms of equal provision of care for all groups and treatment adherence. We deemed none of the included studies to be of high quality (see individual entries in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table, <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Randomisation (sequence generation) was reported and deemed low risk in three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Arick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arick 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blanshard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanshard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lesinskas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lesinskas 2003</LINK>); the remaining trials were unclear risk.</P>
<P>Only one study fully commented on allocation concealment and we classed this as low risk (<LINK REF="STD-Lesinskas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lesinskas 2003</LINK>). The remaining studies made no comment and so we classified them as unclear risk.</P>
<P>Four studies presented data showing the different arms of the study to be comparable on prognostic characteristics (<LINK REF="STD-Arick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arick 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Nobili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Nobili 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stangerup-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stangerup 1992</LINK>). One study described distribution of age and sex as being similar between arms at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Ercan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ercan 2005</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Blanshard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanshard 1993</LINK>) commented that groups showed significance only in age distribution and exposure to smoking, while two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brooker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lesinskas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lesinskas 2003</LINK>) described as randomised controlled trials did not present data on the baseline characteristics. Confounding was not an issue in any trial.</P>
<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Arick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arick 2005</LINK>) reported that the participating doctors and the outcome assessors were blinded, although with patients not blinded it is likely the patient's status could have become known to the assessors.</P>
<P>Follow-up was predominantly low risk: four studies had no attrition (<LINK REF="STD-Arick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arick 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brooker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Nobili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Nobili 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lesinskas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lesinskas 2003</LINK>) and three further studies had less than 15% attrition (<LINK REF="STD-Blanshard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanshard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ercan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ercan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1977</LINK>). We assessed only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Stangerup-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stangerup 1992</LINK>) as high risk, with 42% attrition in the experimental arm and 67% attrition in the control arm.</P>
<P>No trials showed any evidence of selective reporting.</P>
<P>Reported adherence to the use of autoinflation was variable; one trial reported 98% compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Arick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arick 2005</LINK>) while another reported 45% of participants as having high compliance, 43% low compliance and 12% being unable to use the autoinflation device (<LINK REF="STD-Blanshard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanshard 1993</LINK>).</P>

<P>Eight studies met the inclusion criteria for this review and compared autoinflation with control.</P>
<P>Combining data proved difficult due to a lack of consistent reporting of a common single outcome measure.

Within these five studies, at less than one month, autoinflation showed a non-significant improvement in tympanometry as defined by type C2 and B tympanograms (relative risk of improvement (RRI) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 3.13), with substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 89%). See <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.1. Subgroup analyses suggested that autoinflation is beneficial in children with either initial type B tympanogram, relative to a type C1 or A tympanogram (RRI 2.15, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.28, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%), or type C2 tympanograms (RRI 3.84, 95% CI 1.94 to 7.59, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). This anomaly was due to the fact that the <LINK REF="STD-Brooker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 1992</LINK> trial did not report the baseline tympanometry level of the participants in the study, while <LINK REF="STD-De-Nobili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Nobili 2008</LINK> reported these as percentages at different stages (not tracked by ear) and therefore neither could be included in the subgroup analyses. As these are the two trials where the effect of the intervention is negative, their exclusion from the subgroup analyses changed the size of the estimated effect.</P>
<P>A sixth study (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1977</LINK>) used mean change in middle ear pressure as the tympanometry outcome and was not included in the pooled estimates. Fraser found no significant difference between control and intervention groups.</P>
<P>Four studies followed participants for longer than a month (<LINK REF="STD-Blanshard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanshard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Nobili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Nobili 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ercan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ercan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stangerup-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stangerup 1992</LINK>). In these studies autoinflation produced a non-significant change in tympanometry compared to control (RRI 1.22, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.49, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>

Two studies reported audiometry improvement as continuous (<LINK REF="STD-Arick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arick 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1977</LINK>), with the pooled estimate showing a non-significant improvement in the autoinflation group (mean difference (MD) 7.02 dB, 95% CI -6.92 to 20.96, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 95%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of autoinflation and compliance</HEADING>
<P>None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between the control or intervention groups. The side effects/complications studied included incidence of middle ear infection, eardrum perforation, attacks of otitis media, upper respiratory tract infections, tonsillitis, use of antibiotics, middle ear effusion, insertion of grommets and enlarged adenoids. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Lesinskas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lesinskas 2003</LINK>) reported that one patient stopped the treatment due to the pain caused by the procedure.</P>
<P>Six of the eight trials reported compliance. Four studies assessed the adherence to the intervention as 'high compliance' (as defined by the study authors) ranging from 45% to 100%. Two studies reported 'good' or 'satisfactory' compliance.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-04-25 09:30:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Overall autoinflation appears to have a beneficial effect on the resolution of glue ear, with a low incidence of adverse side effects (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Six of the eight studies showed beneficial effects at least in the short term (maximum duration of follow-up in the included studies was three months), while one of the two that reported a negative effect in the short term reported a positive effect in the long term (two months). This is in keeping with a previous systematic review on the use of autoinflation (<LINK REF="REF-Reidpath-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reidpath 1999</LINK>). This review concludes that the evidence for the use of autoinflation in the treatment of glue ear in children is conflicting but suggests that it may be of clinical benefit in the short term.</P>
<P>There are several limitations in the collection and interpretation of the findings. The type of device used may be critical in determining the benefits of autoinflation. Pooled effect estimates suggest Politzerisation to be more effective than the classic Otovent® device or carnival blower with a balloon attached. However, both papers that used Politzerisation as the method of autoinflation had slightly different entry criteria to the rest. They were deemed suitable for inclusion in this review as they both used multiple criteria to make the diagnosis of otitis media with effusion (OME) (hearing loss, tympanometry and, in one paper, otoscopy). Information in this area is sparse. A study (<LINK REF="STD-Hanner-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hanner 1997</LINK>, not part of this review) comparing two different methods of autoinflation (Valsalva versus Otovent®) did not identify a difference between them, however a reanalysis of their data showed a significant difference in favour of Otovent® (relative risk of improvement (RRI) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 2.69).</P>
<P>Duration of treatment and follow-up also appear to be factors in determining the effects of autoinflation. Autoinflation seems more beneficial in the short term (one month or less of treatment) than in the longer term. Paradoxically the meta-analysis of composite outcomes shows the relative risk of improvement at one month or less to be non-significant (RRI 1.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 4.31) whilst the relative risk of improvement at more than one month is significant (RRI 1.74, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.50). The results are affected by the two studies that found autoinflation to be markedly worse than control at least in the short term (<LINK REF="STD-Brooker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Nobili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Nobili 2008</LINK>), leading to significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 89%). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Brooker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 1992</LINK> did not continue follow-up for longer than one month, therefore it was not included in the composite outcomes at longer time frames. The study by <LINK REF="STD-De-Nobili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Nobili 2008</LINK> reported percentage of ears at different tympanogram levels (B, C2, C1 and A) at baseline, 12 days and two months. For our calculations we have assumed that all ears in the category B and C2 are included and ears in categories A and C1 will not revert to worse tympanograms. <LINK REF="STD-De-Nobili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Nobili 2008</LINK> reports a positive difference (in favour of autoinflation) for the two-month follow-up. A final important difference is that for this study most OMEs are resolved within the two months of follow-up; five out of 60 ears remain as C2 or B. Several differences were noted in the duration of the intervention (range 10 days to three months) and also in the duration of follow-up, ranging from cessation of the intervention to two months after the intervention. Only three studies continued to follow up participants after the intervention had ceased (<LINK REF="STD-Arick-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arick 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lesinskas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lesinskas 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stangerup-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stangerup 1992</LINK>). For these reasons it is difficult to determine whether the benefits of autoinflation are sustained after treatment.</P>
<P>The combined effects show a mixed pattern of autoinflation, with both statistical and clinical heterogeneity. Considerable heterogeneity may be due to the populations, the intervention or the outcome definitions. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Brooker-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 1992</LINK>) found autoinflation to be worse than control; another (<LINK REF="STD-De-Nobili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Nobili 2008</LINK>) showed it to be worse in the short term (12 days) but better in the long term (two months). The children in Brooker's study are comparable to those in other studies in terms of age, but there are few data with which to compare the prognostic characteristics of the control and intervention groups in this study with the other studies. For <LINK REF="STD-De-Nobili-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Nobili 2008</LINK> it is difficult to assess if the assumption made about the change in tympanogram for ears is potentially affecting the results (no data on improvement at ear or individual level are provided).</P>
<P>Brooker's populations may be different to those of other studies in that the proportion of controls recovering in this trial was much higher than in any other studies. A possible reason for this is the outcome reported, which is a composite of improvement in pure-tone audiogram and tympanogram. Another difference is that it is suggested in the paper that only children with type B tympanograms were included, but this was not clearly stated. Hence, heterogeneity could be explained if autoinflation is helpful to children with type C2 but not type B tympanograms. Subgroup analyses of the <LINK REF="STD-Blanshard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanshard 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stangerup-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stangerup 1992</LINK> papers suggest that this might be the case (although the effect size is not statistically significant in either subgroup). Finally, Brooker did not use a standardised Otovent® device, instead using a carnival blower and balloon. This may be a less effective or even harmful method of autoinflation, however the independent rater classified this intervention to be equivalent to Otovent®.</P>
<P>The studies mainly gave information on tympanometry and composite outcomes. Autoinflation does not appear to improve pure-tone audiometry thresholds. Only one study reported otoscopy findings so it is difficult to comment on this outcome. Reduction of hearing loss is an important outcome for children and parents, but there was little evidence within the included studies to address the impact of hearing loss. The development of a quality of life questionnaire specifically for children with hearing loss means that the impact of hearing loss could be assessed in future studies (<LINK REF="REF-Umansky-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Umansky 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, it appeared that autoinflation was beneficial at one and two months. A large primary care study is in progress (<LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2011</LINK>) which will report on one and three-month outcomes.</P>
<P>Adverse events do not appear to differ significantly between intervention and control groups. Data for compliance were variable. There is some anecdotal evidence that some children, possibly in selected groups, do get pain when undertaking autoinflation and that continued enthusiasm for the procedure over time can wane. <LINK REF="STD-Blanshard-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blanshard 1993</LINK> comments that "significant improvement was seen only in those who used the treatment with a high compliance for the duration of the study". More details on adverse events and compliance are needed from trials, along with evidence on how to achieve good compliance.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>The heterogeneity of trial designs, inclusion criteria, interventions, outcome reporting and time scales makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions. Another factor that affects validity is the variation in the level of data analysis. Most studies used ears as their data analysis unit, but some used patients. To overcome this problem we estimated the within-patient correlation. Furthermore, some studies reported their outcomes as continuous variables and some as dichotomous variables. Definitions of improvement varied in the studies that reported dichotomous outcomes. The quality of the trials was variable, in particular none of the studies used blinding of participants or assessors and some studies used inferior methods of randomisation.</P>
<P>One of the major concerns in children with glue ear is possible developmental sequelae; none of the included papers looked at this issue. Currently there are no proven treatments that affect speech and language development, including grommets (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 2010</LINK>). Therefore, it is not possible to say whether the statistically significant improvements in tympanometry translate into clinically significant benefits. This is an important consideration when reviewing treatments for a self limiting condition such as otitis media with effusion; there is a real possibility that watchful waiting without intervention may have similar long-term outcomes to other interventions.</P>

<P>Although this analysis does not enable us to make any firm conclusions, the evidence appears favourable at least in the short term. Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion (OME). One particular concern is the level of adherence: are the child and parent willing to tolerate the inconvenience of the procedure? A recent Cochrane review has concluded that the benefits of grommets for OME compared to watchful waiting are small and then diminish over time (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 2010</LINK>). Currently most autoinflation interventions are instigated in secondary care. With increased awareness and the ability to instruct and educate parents and children in their use, this intervention would be well suited to primary care and there is ongoing research in this area (<LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2011</LINK>). The use of a Politzer device appears promising, however due to the limited amount of information available it is difficult to make any definitive recommendation. None of these trials provided data on long-term sequelae such as language development. However, the trials of ventilation tubes suggest there is little long-term impact achieved through treatment of otitis media with effusion (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 2010</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-03-01 10:00:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All of the studies we included were small and of limited duration of treatment and follow-up. Further studies with larger numbers of participants and longer duration of intervention, completed in primary care, are much needed. Studies need to provided further evidence on adverse events and treatment compliance. Further studies should also consider the impact of autoinflation on both developmental and hearing loss outcomes in children with otitis media with effusion. The heterogeneity suggests that the method of autoinflation, including the device used, may be important and this merits further investigation. Studies looking at factors predicting which children may benefit from autoinflation would help in identifying subgroups of children for whom autoinflation could be recommended. Future work could also include the possibility of investigating whether autoinflation is effective in preventing disease relapses in children prone to OME.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-04-25 09:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Both interventions described here involve inflating the middle ear by blowing air up the nose during the act of swallowing. The main difference is that one intervention is active with the individual (child or adult) inflating a balloon (Otovent®) and then allowing it to deflate; while the other one is passive with air being delivered as a constant flow into the nose (Politzer device). The patient swallows while air is flowing in. During the swallow the air is diverted up the Eustachian tube ventilating the middle ear. There are (at least) two commercial products available, Otovent® (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) and a handheld, battery-operated device called the EarPopper&#8482; (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) that allows Politzerisation to be performed at home.</P>
