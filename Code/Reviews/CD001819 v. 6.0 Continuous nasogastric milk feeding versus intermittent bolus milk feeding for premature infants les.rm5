<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-02-19 19:45:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no difference in time to achieve full feedings in low birth weight premature infants fed milk through a tube into the stomach either on a continuous basis or over 10 to 20 minutes every two to three hours. Premature infants born weighing less than 1500 grams are not able to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing. Feeding into the gastrointestinal tract (enteral feeding) helps with gastrointestinal tract development and growth. Therefore, in addition to feeding through a tube into a vein (parenterally), premature infants may be fed milk through a tube placed either up their nose and into the stomach (nasogastric feeding) or through their mouth and into the stomach (orogastric feeding). Usually a set amount of milk is given over 10 to 20 minutes every two to three hours (intermittent bolus gavage feeding). Some clinicians prefer to feed premature infants continuously. Each feeding method has beneficial effects (e.g., achieve full feedings sooner) but can also have harmful effects (destructive inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract or necrotizing enterocolitis. There was no difference in time to achieve full feedings between feeding methods regardless of tube placement. Reports of the incidence of destructive inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (necrotizing enterocolitis) were similar. However, there is not enough evidence to determine the best feeding method for low birth weight premature infants. More research is required in this area.<I>

<P>Overall, the seven included trials, involving 511 infants, found no differences in time to achieve full enteral feeds between feeding methods (weighted mean difference (WMD) 2 days; 95% CI -0.3 to 3.9) . In the subgroup analysis of those studies comparing continuous nasogastric versus intermittent bolus nasogastric milk feedings the findings remained unchanged (WMD 2 days, 95% CI -0.4 to 4.1). There was no significant difference in somatic growth and incidence of NEC between feeding methods irrespective of tube placement. One study noted a trend toward more apneas during the study period in infants fed by the continuous tube feeding method compared to those fed by intermittent feedings delivered predominantly by orogastric tube placements [mean difference (MD) 14.0 apneas during study period; 95% CI -0.2 to 28.2]. In subgroup analysis based on weight groups, one study suggested that infants less than 1000 grams and 1000 to 1250 grams birth weight gained weight faster when fed by the continuous nasogastric tube feeding method compared to intermittent nasogastric tube feeding method (MD 2.0 g/day; 95% CI 0.5 to 3.5; MD 2.0 g/day; 95% CI 0.2 to 3.8, respectively). A trend toward earlier discharge for infants less than 1000 grams birth weight fed by the continuous tube feeding method compared to intermittent nasogastric tube feeding method (MD -11 days; 95% CI -21.8 to -0.2).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-09-06 15:18:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tube feeding is necessary for most premature infants less than 1500 grams because of their inability to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing (<LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>) and the danger of aspiration (<LINK REF="REF-Valman-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valman 1972</LINK>). <BR/>
</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-09-06 15:20:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conventional tube feeding method is intermittent bolus gavage feeding, where a prescribed volume of milk is given over a short period of time (<LINK REF="REF-Aynsley_x002d_Green-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aynsley-Green 1982</LINK>), usually over 10 to 20 minutes by gravity. The first reported use of the continuous nasogastric tube feeding method for preterm infants was in 1972 (<LINK REF="REF-Valman-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valman 1972</LINK>). Some clinicians prefer the continuous nasogastric feeding method for feeding premature infants less than 1300 grams birth weight, although intermittent bolus gavage feeding is the method more commonly used in practice (<LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-09-06 15:20:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Theoretical risks and benefits of both continuous nasogastric milk feeding and intermittent bolus milk feeding have been proposed. Continuous nasogastric feedings may improve energy efficiency (by increasing energy absorbed and decreasing energy expenditure) (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1991</LINK>), reduce feeding intolerance, improve nutrient absorption, and improve growth (<LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>). However, continuous infusion of milk into the gastrointestinal tract could alter the cyclical pattern of release of gastrointestinal tract hormones, which might affect metabolic homeostasis, and growth (<LINK REF="REF-Aynsley_x002d_Green-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aynsley-Green 1982</LINK>). Furthermore, a properly functioning lower oesophageal sphincter is an important barrier against the reflux of stomach contents into the oesophagus and aspiration. Reflux and aspiration may be compounded in the premature infant receiving continuous nasogastric feedings. Not only do these infants have reduced lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Newell-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 1988</LINK>), but the nasogastric tube remains in situ preventing complete closure of the sphincter.</P>
<P>Milk feedings given by the intermittent bolus gavage method are thought to be more physiologic because they promote the cyclical surges of gastrointestinal tract hormones normally seen in healthy term infants (<LINK REF="REF-Aynsley_x002d_Green-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aynsley-Green 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aynsley_x002d_Green-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aynsley-Green 1990</LINK>). Gastrointestinal hormones such as gastrin, gastric inhibitory peptide, and enteroglucagon are trophic and require the presence of intraluminal nutrients to stimulate secretion. Surges in plasma concentrations of gastrointestinal tract hormones postnatally may be important for gastrointestinal tract development (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aynsley_x002d_Green-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aynsley-Green 1989</LINK>). On the other hand, functional limitations of the premature infant's gastrointestinal system such as delayed gastric emptying or intestinal transit could hinder the premature infant's ability to handle bolus milk feeds, resulting in feeding intolerance. Additionally, this feeding regimen alternates between periods of feeding and fasting which may challenge the premature infant's ability to maintain metabolic homeostasis and, therefore, decrease growth (<LINK REF="REF-Aynsley_x002d_Green-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aynsley-Green 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effects of the feeding method on feeding tolerance, weight gain or days to regain birth weight were examined in two non-randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Krishnan-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnan 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Urrutia-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urrutia 1983</LINK>). In a retrospective study, <LINK REF="REF-Krishnan-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnan 1981</LINK> found that infants fed milk by continuous nasogastric tube feeding reached enteral intakes of 90 kcal/kg/day almost twice as quickly as those infants fed milk by intermittent bolus gavage feeding (16 +/- 6 versus 26 +/- 17 days, respectively). In addition, infants in the continuous group achieved steady weight gain sooner than infants in the intermittent group (24 +/- 10 versus 32 +/- 14 days). Unfortunately, these findings are difficult to interpret due to study design and methodologic limitations. First, the non-random assignment of patients allows for selection bias. Second, energy intake was not controlled and may have influenced feeding tolerance and weight gain. Third, a convenience sample rather than a predetermined sample size was used, making it difficult to achieve both clinical and statistical significance in a study. Hence, it is difficult to make generalizations regarding these findings to similar populations of infants (<LINK REF="REF-Raudonis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raudonis 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Urrutia-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urrutia 1983</LINK> conducted a non-randomised prospective study of continuous versus intermittent nasogastric tube milk feedings. They found no difference between groups in days to regain birth weight. These findings are also difficult to interpret because patients were allocated to the continuous or intermittent group based on neonatologists' preference rather than random assignment, and a convenience sample was used.</P>

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK>) compared continuous versus intermittent feeding methods; however, both nasogastric and orogastric tube feedings were used with the intermittent feeding method. In the <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> study, data from the intermittent nasogastric feeding group and the intermittent orogastric feeding group were taken together as these two groups did not differ in characteristics (e.g., demographic, birth related factors, and duration of feeding) and primary outcome of time to achieve full enteral feedings. In the <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK> study, infants in the intermittent feeding method group received primarily (approximately 90% of time) orogastric tube feedings (personal communication).

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-09-06 15:46:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methodologic quality was assessed using the following key criteria: blindness of randomisation, blindness of intervention, completeness of follow-up and blinding of outcome measurement. Additional criteria of study quality included evidence of confounders, objective criteria of measuring outcomes, and defined exclusion/inclusion criteria. The interventions being compared could not be blinded to those providing care, but should have been blinded to the assessors of the outcomes.</P>
<P>In addition, for the update in 2011, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias table (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>):</P>
<P>(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: <I>low risk </I>(any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); <I>high risk </I>(any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number) or <I>unclear risk</I>. </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: <I>low risk </I>(e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); <I>high risk</I> (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);or <I>unclear risk</I>. </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as: <I>low risk</I>, <I>high risk</I> or <I>unclear</I> for participants; adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel; <I>adequate</I>, inadequate or <I>unclear</I> <I>risk </I>for outcome assessors. </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as: <I>low risk</I> (&lt; 20% missing data); <I>high risk</I> (&#8805; 20% missing data) or <I>unclear risk</I>. </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: <I>low risk</I> (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); <I>high risk</I> (where not all the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or <I>unclear risk</I>. </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: <I>low risk</I>; <I>high risk</I>; or <I>unclear risk</I>.  </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>There were 12 reports that met the eligibility criteria. However, one study had three reports and another study had two reports but the outcomes showed in the second report were not clinically relevant to this review. Hence, there were nine studies that met the criteria for relevance. Two of the potentially eligible studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berseth-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Berseth 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1997</LINK>) were excluded because the outcomes reported were not clinically relevant to this review. As a result, seven studies (complete data from four and partial data from three) were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> (partial); <LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1992</LINK> (partial), <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK> (partial), and <LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>). The table 'Characteristics of Included Studies', outlines details of the seven studies described below.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK> included clinically stable infants 700 to 1250 grams who were able to start feeding before day 10 of life. Continuous feeds (N = 39) were delivered by an infusion pump while bolus feeds (N = 41) were given every three hours over 15 to 30 minutes by gravity via an indwelling nasogastric feeding tube. Feeding protocols were developed for each 50 to100 gram weight category and strategies were identified for managing feeding intolerance. Infants were followed until they were tolerating full feeds, defined as 100 kcal/kg/d of enteral feeds for at least 48 hours. In addition to the primary outcome of days to full feeds, the authors reported feeding intolerance (feeds withheld for &gt; 12 hours), days to regain birth weight, and days to discharge weight of 2040 grams.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK> included infants 500 to 1250 grams who were &lt; 48 hours postnatal age. Feeds were initiated between day two and five as per feeding protocol that specified increase in feed volume and included guidelines to manage feeding intolerance (gastric residual volume (GRV) &gt; 20% volume of feeds over previous four hours). Continuous feeds (N = 10) were delivered by infusion pump. Infants 501 to 750 grams received intermittent bolus feeding (nasogastric tube placement) every two hours while infants &gt; 750 grams received feedings every three hours by gravity (N = 13). The major outcome variable was "delay in reaching full feeds", defined as the difference between the expected time to reach full feeds as per feeding protocol and the actual time taken by infants to attain full feeds, defined as 160 cc/kg/d. Days to full feeds, and days to regain birth weight (mean <U>+</U> standard error) were also reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> (partial) included infants with gestational age 24 to 29 weeks and birth weight &lt; 1200 grams. Human milk feedings were initiated within 30 hours of birth as per pre-established guidelines. Infants were initially started on intravenous glucose infusion and then within 72 hours were supplemented with total parenteral nutrition. Fortification of human milk was initiated for all infants when total parenteral nutrition was discontinued. Continuous feeds (N = 22) were delivered by infusion pump. The control groups, intermittent orogastric (N = 24) and intermittent nasogastric feeding (N = 22), received feedings every three hours over a period of 15 to 40 minutes which was tailored based on the infant's feed volume and tolerance. The assigned feeding method was used until postmenstrual age of 32 weeks when intermittent orogastric feedings were changed to nasogastric feedings and infants in the continuous feeding group were weaned over a period of 10 to 14 days to intermittent feeding every three hours. Infants in the continuous feeding method group were compared with infants from the two control groups as a collective (i.e. the intermittent orogastric group and intermittent nasogastric group were combined). The primary outcome was time to achieve full enteral feedings defined as the number of days from birth to the time when infants tolerated the prescribed total fluid intake enterally. Secondary outcomes included time to regain birth weight, anthropometric measurements, enteral intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis, and septicaemia.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1992</LINK> (partial) included infants &lt; 1400 grams whose route of feed was determined on day two of life when milk feedings were started. Infants were fed by bolus nasogastric (N = 12), continuous nasogastric (N = 12), or transpyloric (N = 10) feeding method. Infants were supplemented with total parenteral nutrition. Although a feeding protocol was described, it appears to pertain to continuous feeding method as initial volume of feed and increments are described in mls/hour. The delivery equipment for continuous feeds, the bolus feeding method, transpyloric feeding method, and management of feeding intolerance was not described. The selected method of feeding was used until infants reached a weight of 1600 grams after which all infants were switched to bolus nasogastric feeding method. Energy supplements were not provided during the trial period. The primary outcome of this study was growth including length, weight, and occipitofrontal circumference. Standard deviations for days to full enteral feedings was not reported and we are awaiting response from the co-investigator of this study. Triceps and quadriceps skinfold thickness, and chosen biochemical indices (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, urea, albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin) were also measured but were not included in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK> included infants 26 to 30 weeks gestation who were &lt; 96 hours of age and whose fraction of inspired oxygen was &lt; 0.6 by 72 hours. Feeding protocols were developed for feeding schedules and management of feeding intolerance. The continuous feeding method (N = 83) was not described. Intermittent feedings (N = 88) were given every three hours over 20 minutes by orogastric/nasogastric tube feeding method (note: predominantly by orogastric tube feedings). The primary outcome was days to attain full oral feeds, defined as eight bottle or breast feeds per day. Other outcomes reported in this study included days to full feeding (150 cc/kg/d), weight gain, head circumference gain, length gain, skinfold thickness (five sites), feeding intolerance, nutritional balance studies, bone mineral content and serum indices of protein and mineral status.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK> (partial) included infants 750 to &lt; 1500 grams who were able to start nasogastric feeds on day two or three of life. Infants in the continuous feeding group (N = 42) received a feeding over a three hour period. Infants in the intermittent bolus feeding group (N = 40) were fed every three hours over 15 to 30 minutes up to a maximum of one hour if feeding difficulties were encountered. Feeding protocols were developed for advancement of feeds and for the management of feeding intolerance (GRV &gt;= 2 hours feed volume for continuous; &gt;= 2 mL feed for intermittent bolus). The primary outcome was rate of weight gain. Days to full feeds (75 kcal/kg/day) and days to discharge (criteria not defined) were also reported. Anthropometric measurements (change in head circumference, length, midtricipetal skin-fold thickness, skin-fold thickness, and subscapular skin-fold thickness) and retention rates of nitrogen, fat, total carbohydrate, and lactose were also compared between groups. There appears to be a significant difference between the continuous and intermittent feeding method groups in head circumference data; however, the difference is reported as being insignificant. Clarification has been requested.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK> included infants &lt; 1500 grams who were ready for enteral nutrition. The timing of feeds was not specified. Continuous feeds (N = 30) were delivered by an infusion pump. Intermittent nasogastric feeds (N = 23) were given every three hours by gravity. Feeding protocols and management of feeding intolerance were standardized. The following outcomes were reported: somatic growth including weight gain, change in length, occipitofrontal circumference, and skin fold thickness, total protein, bilirubin, feeding related complications such as NEC, suspected NEC, feeding intolerance, hours NPO per day, number of apnoea episodes per day, number of stools per day, and fraction heme-positive stools.</P>

<P>Of the seven studies included in the review, six were randomised. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>) used alternate assignment. Blinding of allocation was achieved for six of the seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Caregivers were not blinded to the intervention as this would not be feasible. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK>) outcome assessors were blinded and in one study they were not (<LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> study, only radiographic assessors for the outcome of necrotizing enterocolitis were blinded to patient group assignment. For the remaining four studies blinding of the outcome assessors could not be determined.</P>
<P>In each of the trials, several infants were removed from the assigned feeding protocols for clinical reasons including, but not limited to, feeding intolerance. An intention-to-treat analysis should include outcome results for such infants.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>) had complete follow-up. In this study, infants were removed from the treatment protocol if they were not able to adhere to the feeding protocol for more than one week. Ten infants in the continuous group and one in the intermittent group were removed from their assigned feeding protocols because of feeding intolerance. However, data from these infants were included in the analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK> reported complete follow-up only for stratified groups. In this study, 11 infants were removed from treatment protocols and excluded from overall analyses. Of three infants excluded from the continuous group, none were excluded for feeding intolerance, although one was excluded for protocol violation. Of eight infants excluded from the intermittent group, three were excluded for feeding intolerance and another two for protocol violation. Follow-up was incomplete in the remaining three studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK> excluded nine infants from analysis. Of four patients excluded from the continuous group, one had been switched to breastfeeding, but none were excluded for feeding intolerance. Of five infants excluded from the intermittent group, three infants were excluded for protocol violation (feeding intolerance not specified) and one had been switched to breastfeeding.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK> excluded five infants from analysis, one for protocol violation (the infant was switched to bolus feeding method because of failure to establish full feedings) and the other four because of death.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> excluded two infants post randomisation because of diagnosed malformations. One infant in the control group was switched to the continuous feeding method group because of severe apnoea and bradycardia secondary to gastroesophageal reflux. Data for this infant was included as randomised. In the early intervention phase, three infants died (one infant in each feeding group) due to respiratory and circulatory collapse. Two infants in the continuous feeding method group died at postmenstrual ages of 33 and 47 weeks secondary to septicaemia and severe respiratory and circulatory distress and chronic lung disease.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1992</LINK> enrolled 13 babies in the continuous feeding method group but only 12 completed the study as one infant was transferred to another hospital at age two weeks of life. Three of the 15 infants enrolled in the bolus feeding method group died within the first week of life, before milk feedings were established and were therefore excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK> study, 30 infants were excluded because they did not complete seven days in the study. In these studies, the post-randomisation exclusion of infants from the analysis has resulted in loss to follow-up.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-09-06 14:49:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current practice varies with regards to use of continuous versus intermittent bolus gavage feeding methods. There are theoretical advantages to each method, and practice appears to be based more on individual assessment rather than scientific evidence. There are seven clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of continuous versus intermittent milk feedings methods in premature infants less than 1500 grams. Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK>) compared continuous infusion with intermittent feeds given every two or three hours. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1992</LINK>) compared continuous infusion, intermittent feeds (frequency unknown), and transpyloric method of feeding. All but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1992</LINK>) stratified participants, either by birth weight or gestational age, in order to obtain more homogeneous samples for comparison.</P>
<P>Gavage feedings may be given via nasogastric or orogastric feeding tube placement. Some clinicians prefer the orogastric tube placement given the potential of apnoea secondary to airflow obstruction with nasogastric tubes. Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK>) focused strictly on the nasogastric tube feeding method. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>) compared continuous gavage feeding with intermittent feedings that were delivered predominantly (&gt; 90%) by the orogastric tube feeding placement (personal communication). Although <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> had two control groups, intermittent nasogastric tube feeding method and intermittent orogastric tube feeding method, data were combined when the analysis was undertaken for the comparison. All studies were included in this systematic review with a subgroup analysis presented for only those trials which compared continuous nasogastric feeding method with intermittent bolus nasogastric feeding method. Complete data from four (<LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK>) and partial data from three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1992</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK>) were included in the review.</P>
<P>Overall, the evidence suggests that there is no significant difference in the time taken to achieve full feeds between continuous versus intermittent gavage feeding methods irrespective of tube placement (i.e., nasogastric or orogastric). <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> reported findings in contrast to <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK> which suggested that infants fed by the continuous tube feeding method took longer to reach full feeds. <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> defined full feeds as enteral intake of the total prescribed volume based on postnatal age and weight (&lt; 140 to 160 cc/kg/day) for 48 hours. <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK> defined full feeds as reaching an enteral intake of 160 cc/kg/day within a specific time frame based on weight group (e.g., eight days in the largest weight group). In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>, an enteral intake of 150 cc/kg/day was considered full feeds. Differences in the way the primary outcome of full feeds was measured may account for the statistically heterogeneity noted in the overall meta-analysis (i.e., including nasogastric and orogastric tube placement and examining data for all infants). Other potential sources of heterogeneity might include differences in definition and management of feeding intolerance, participants, intervention, and study quality which are addressed later. Consequently, it is difficult to draw conclusions from these data.</P>
<P>Days on parenteral nutrition was examined only in studies which compared continuous nasogastric feeding method with intermittent bolus (nasogastric and orogastric tube) milk feeding. Although not significant difference in the number of days on parenteral nutrition was reported (WMD -5 days; 95% CI -9.5, -0.03) between feeding methods, the difference of five days is clinically significant as it has workload implications (e.g. nursing care and medical management), as well could potentially facilitate transfer of the infant to a center which does not manage total parenteral nutrition. Days on parenteral nutrition was not examined in studies comparing continuous nasogastric feeding method with intermittent nasogastric bolus milk feeding method.</P>
<P>There was no difference in growth (weight, length, head circumference) of infants fed by either method regardless of tube placement. Although infants with birth weight &lt; 1000 grams and 1000 to 1249 grams had better weight gain on continuous feeds, these results were only reported in one study with a small sample size. To assess this further, subgroup data has been requested from <LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> . The lack of an effect on growth may, in part, be attributed to the consistent provision of nutrients within studies with the use of parenteral nutrition (<LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK>). There was a trend toward increased number of apneas per patient in infants fed by the continuous tube feeding method (p = 0.05), but this trend is in contrast to results observed in other studies. <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> noted that one infant in the intermittent nasogastric feeding group was switched to intermittent orogastric feedings because of carbon dioxide retention secondary to nasal obstruction most likely caused by the feeding tube. Finally, there was a trend toward earlier discharge in infants &lt; 1000 grams birth weight fed by the continuous tube feeding method (p = 0.05), but this trend was seen only in one study, again with a small sample size. Overall, there was no difference in days to discharge between groups.<BR/>
<BR/>These results, particularly time to achieve full feeds, should be interpreted with caution as findings may be confounded by the definition and management of feeding intolerance. For example, six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK>) had predetermined criteria to advance feeds and to identify and manage feeding intolerance. Gastric residual volume was a major criterion in determining feeding tolerance. Three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK>) reported a greater incidence of residuals in infants fed by continuous tube feeding, and this may have resulted in a greater number of interruptions of feeds and / or slower increases in feeds, thereby increasing the number of days taken to reach full feeds. <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK> reported that regression analysis suggested that only the method of feeding affected feeding intolerance defined as presence of residual &gt; 20 % of the feed volume. In this study, continuous feeding was associated with increased feeding intolerance. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> reported no difference in rates of feeding intolerance, gastric residuals, or vomiting between infants in the continuous nasogastric feeding and intermittent nasogastric feeding method. However, infants in the intermittent orogastric feeding method had higher rates of feeding intolerance, gastric residuals, and vomiting. <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK> reported an association between the greater number of residuals in the continuous group and increased time to full feeds. <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK> similarly reported that there was an association between feeding intolerance and time to full feeds and time to reach discharge weight. On the other hand, <LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK> found that only infants in the intermittent group were removed from the study protocol for feeding-related reasons, including significant residuals. Depending on the individual tolerance for and response to gastric residuals, the management of feeding intolerance may significantly affect the reported feeding tolerance and the time taken to reach full feeds. The need for an evidence based approach to management of gastric residual volumes is apparent. Furthermore, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>) included all infants in the results whether or not they were able to adhere to the feeding protocol. <LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK> included all infants in the analysis for subgroup analysis but not for overall analysis. Unfortunately, there were several infants in each study who were removed from the treatment protocol for various reasons including feeding intolerance and protocol violation. Exclusion of these infants might influence study outcomes such as days to full feeds.</P>
<P>There was statistical heterogeneity in the outcomes of weight gain and the number of infants who failed to complete the protocol because of feeding intolerance. Potential sources of heterogeneity might include differences in participants, intervention, and study quality.</P>
<P>
<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>In five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK>) infants were stratified into groups, either by birth weight or gestational age prior to randomisation because the feeding method may influence outcomes differently across different weight groups. However, stratification varied between these studies (see Characteristics of Included Studies). <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> had two control groups in order to identify the influence of feeding tube placement (i.e., nasal versus oral).</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>
<BR/>Although feeding protocols had been predetermined for all studies, both the timing of initiation of feeds and the type of feeding varied between studies. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK>), it is not clear when feeds were initiated, or if they were initiated at the same postnatal age for all infants. Although one study (<LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1992</LINK>) states on day two of life milk route was determined and milk feedings initiated, it is unclear if all study infants were able to start feeds on day two. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>, infants within each feeding group were randomised to early or late feedings to be initiated on postnatal day four or 14 respectively (actual initiation day six and 16 respectively). The number of infants who started feeds early versus late was similar between the two groups. <LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> reported similar timing of feeds for infants in the intermittent and continuous feeding method groups. Infants in the <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> study were maintained nil per os for a mean of 2.5 days (SD = 4.0) in the intermittent group and a mean of 3.3 days (SD = 6.7). There was no significant difference between groups. <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK> reported similar timing of feeds for infants in the two groups (intermittent 5.6 +/- 2.2 days; continuous 5.7 +/- 2.1 days). <LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK> initiated feeds later (intermittent 7.3 +/- 4.8 days; continuous 9.7 +/- 7.1 days), but the difference between groups was not significant.</P>
<P>The type of feeding might also influence feeding tolerance and advancement to full enteral feeds. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK>) excluded infants fed infant formula. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Macdonald-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Macdonald 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK>) excluded infants fed human milk. The other three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK>) included infants fed either human milk or infant formula. In the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK>, there were more infants fed human milk in the intermittent bolus group as compared with the continuous group (<LINK REF="STD-Dollberg-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dollberg 2000</LINK> 4 versus 2 respectively, and <LINK REF="STD-Toce-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toce 1987</LINK> 5 versus 0 respectively). Both the timing and the type of feedings might influence outcomes such as days to reach full feeds, feeding intolerance and somatic growth.</P>
<P>
<B>Study quality</B>
<BR/>Only four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK>) reported use of a power calculation to determine sample size. The primary outcome used to determine the sample size differed in each of the three studies and included days to full feeds, days to full oral feeds, and rate of weight gain. This systematic review includes 511 infants. The mean and standard deviation for days to full feeds from the largest study, <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK>, was used to determine the sample size required to show a significant difference between Continuous and Intermittent bolus milk feeding. Based on a 2-tailed unpaired t-test, alpha level of 0.05 and power of 0.8, the sample size was estimated at 400 per group.</P>
<P>Only three studies included infants dropped from the feeding protocols in the analyses. <LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schanler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schanler 1999</LINK> included all infants in the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Silvestre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestre 1996</LINK> included all infants in the analyses of stratified groups, but excluded the infants dropped from the feeding protocols from the overall analysis. In each of the six studies included in this review, several infants were dropped from the treatment groups for various reasons, including feeding intolerance, protocol violations, and transfer to another hospital at two weeks of life. Exclusion of these infants who were unable to feed according to the assigned protocol might have impacted on outcomes including feeding tolerance, days to full feeds and days to discharge, as well as incidence of NEC and apnoea.</P>
<P>Caregivers were not blinded to the intervention as this would not be feasible. This may have introduced bias in decisions related to feeding management of infants.</P>
<P>Finally, although all studies attempted to compare demographic data and various indices of acuity between groups, the health state of the infant might affect some of the outcomes of interest. For example, smaller, sicker infants may take longer to reach full feeds, and be discharged later. <LINK REF="STD-Akintorin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Akintorin 1997</LINK> reported that infants with feeding intolerance were more likely to weigh less than 1000 grams and to require ventilatory support for a longer period of time. In that study, 20 of 28 infants with feeding intolerance were &lt; 1000 grams birth weight.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research is needed to determine if either feeding method is more appropriate for the initiation of feeds, and if either method may be better tolerated by infants who experience feeding intolerance, a question not addressed in the current review. A rigorous methodology should be adopted, defining feeding protocols and feeding intolerance consistently for all infants. Infants should be stratified according to birthweight and gestation, and possibly according to illness. </P>

<P>Excluded nine infants from analysis. Of four patients excluded from the continuous group, one had been switched to breastfeeding, but none were excluded for feeding intolerance. Of five infants excluded from the intermittent group, three infants were excluded for protocol violation (feeding intolerance not specified) and one had been switched to breastfeeding.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Excluded two infants post randomisation because of diagnosed malformations. One infant in the control group was switched to the continuous feeding method group because of severe apnoea and bradycardia secondary to gastroesophageal reflux. Data for this infant was included as randomised. In the early intervention phase, three infants died (one infant in each feeding group) due to respiratory and circulatory collapse. Two infants in the continuous feeding method group died at postmenstrual ages of 33 and 47 weeks secondary to septicaemia and severe respiratory and circulatory distress and chronic lung disease.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Enrolled 13 babies in the continuous feeding method group but only 12 completed the study as one infant was transferred to another hospital at age two weeks of life. Three of the 15 infants enrolled in the bolus feeding method group died within the first week of life, before milk feedings were established and were therefore excluded from the analysis.</P>

<P>Complete follow-up. Infants were removed from the treatment protocol if they were not able to adhere to the feeding protocol for more than one week. Ten infants in the continuous group and one in the intermittent group were removed from their assigned feeding protocols because of feeding intolerance. However, data from these infants were included in the analysis.</P>

<P>Reported complete follow-up only for stratified groups. In this study, 11 infants were removed from treatment protocols and excluded from overall analyses. Of three infants excluded from the continuous group, none were excluded for feeding intolerance, although one was excluded for protocol violation. Of eight infants excluded from the intermittent group, three were excluded for feeding intolerance and another two for protocol violation.
