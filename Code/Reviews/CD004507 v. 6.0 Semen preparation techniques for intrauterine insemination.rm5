<P>The effectiveness of specific semen preparation techniques for increasing pregnancy rates in subfertile couples undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI) is unknown.</P>
<P>Semen preparation techniques are used in assisted reproduction to separate sperm which have a normal appearance and move spontaneously from the fluid portion of the semen in which the sperm are suspended. It is known that white blood cells, bacteria and dead sperm in semen can impair fertilization of the egg. This review found that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific semen preparation technique for subfertile couples undergoing intrauterine insemination (a procedure which places sperm directly into the uterus) as there were no differences in pregnancy rates using the different techniques. More research is needed.<BR/>

<P>Five RCTs, including 262 couples in total, were included in the meta-analysis (Dodson 1998; Grigoriou 2005; Posada 2005; Soliman 2005; Xu 2000). Xu 2000 compared all three techniques. Soliman 2005 compared a gradient versus a wash technique.

<P>There was no evidence of a difference between pregnancy rates (PR) for swim-up versus a gradient technique (PR 30.5% versus 21.5% respectively; Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.57, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.32). A swim-up technique versus wash and centrifugation also showed no significant difference in PR (PR 22.2% versus 38.1% respectively; Peto OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.10). Two studies compared a gradient versus wash centrifugation technique (PR 23.5% versus 13.3%; Peto OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 5.44).

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-27 15:30:01 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-08-27 15:18:42 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The success of the treatment of subfertile couples has made substantial progress over the last two decades. Subfertile couples are defined as couples who have tried unsuccessfully to conceive for at least one year despite regular and unprotected coital exposures (sexual intercourse) (<LINK REF="REF-Evers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evers 2002</LINK>). Involuntary subfertility is a common problem, affecting up to 15% of couples (<LINK REF="REF-Evers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evers 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Templeton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Templeton 1990</LINK>). Demand for infertility treatment is on the rise as increasing numbers of women delay having children till an age when natural female fertility is in decline (<LINK REF="REF-Delhanty-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delhanty 2001</LINK>) and there is a raised chance of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases and continually falling sperm counts (<LINK REF="REF-Swan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swan 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>With the emergence of in vitro fertilization (IVF) with uterine transfer of embryos (IVF-ET), semen preparation techniques were developed to separate motile sperm that are morphologically normal (normal appearance) from seminal plasma (the fluid portion of the semen in which the spermatozoa are suspended) and foreign material. It is known that white blood cells, bacteria and dead spermatozoa produce oxygen radicals that negatively influence the ability of normal spermatozoa to fertilize the egg (<LINK REF="REF-Aitken-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aitken 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Jonge-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Jonge 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parinaud-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parinaud 1997</LINK>). A randomised controlled trial (RCT) of prepared sperm compared to unprepared first split ejaculates showed that semen preparation significantly increased the probability of conception after intrauterine insemination (IUI) in a group of couples with male subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 1992</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Furthermore, in IUI the use of fresh unprepared semen has been reported to cause uterine cramps and may induce pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, cervicitis or vaginitis, as well as an increased likelihood of miscarriage, premature delivery or a malformed fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Yan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1991</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Some research has suggested an association between the probability of conception after IUI and the absolute number of motile sperm that are inseminated. Some retrospective studies have defined a threshold level beyond which pregnancy rates reached a plateau (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huang-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khalil-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khalil 2001</LINK>). However, the threshold levels found in these studies differed substantially from one to five million motile sperm, which makes these results less useful in practice. One prospective controlled trial demonstrated links between total sperm motility and the probability of conception after IUI (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Voorhis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Voorhis 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>In couples with subfertility, the yield of as many motile, morphologically normal spermatozoa as possible is important as it influences treatment choices and therefore outcomes. A high yield can lead to a preference for IUI or IVF, whereas a lower yield could result in a preference for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). ICSI is an IVF procedure in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg, a procedure that is most commonly used to overcome severe male infertility problems. The treatment outcome after ICSI is not related to the number of available motile sperm.<BR/>
</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-08-27 15:25:30 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of semen preparation is to separate the normal sperm from the debris of the ejaculate and, in the case of IUI, to yield as many normal motile spermatozoa as possible. The number of motile sperm after preparation in relation to the total number of motile sperm before preparation is expressed as the recovery rate. Preparation techniques that have higher recovery rates are considered superior for IUI. However, although spermatozoa recovery rates are interesting when you compare different semen preparation techniques, clinicians and prospective parents regard live birth rate as the most important outcome.</P>
<P>Many sperm preparation procedures are available but there are three main groups of methods. Firstly, spermatozoa may be selected on their ability to swim, known as the 'swim-up technique'. This technique is performed by layering culture medium over the liquefied semen. Motile spermatozoa swim up into the culture. The upper part of the layered medium is then carefully removed for further use. The second method of selecting spermatozoa is by the use of density gradients. The semen sample is pipetted on top of the density column, which is then centrifuged. Density gradient centrifugation separates spermatozoa according to their density. This way you can select the motile, morphologically normal spermatozoa in the solution with the highest concentration of gradient, which is aspirated for further use (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). The third method is the conventional wash method in combination with centrifugation, previously only used for diagnostic procedures. The semen sample is diluted with a medium and centrifuged. Subsequently, the pellet (the bottom part after centrifugation) is resuspended in a small amount of medium and incubated until the time of insemination.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-08-27 15:26:57 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One type of semen preparation technique might be superior to another in relation to clinical outcome after IUI. Sperm preparation with the use of density gradient centrifugation has been a standard technique in assisted reproductive techniques. Fresh semen samples have been centrifuged on Percoll gradients in the 40% to 90% range with good recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Byrd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byrd 1996</LINK>). In late 1996, Percoll was removed from clinical human use. This product was replaced by silica stabilized with covalently bound hydrophilic silane, marketed under several commercial names. In the past, clinical studies have concentrated on the use of Percoll, but research demonstrated that the new products appear to be as effective as Percoll for the recovery of good, progressively motile sperm (<LINK REF="REF-Centola-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Centola 1998</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-27 15:30:01 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The comparison of different semen preparation techniques in relation to semen parameters has been the focus of a substantial amount of research. Studies addressing semen parameters after different semen preparation techniques may be less useful since different practitioners have different methods of sperm analysis, resulting in less comparable data. Clinical outcomes are objective and of interest to patients and clinicians. However, there is no consensus in the literature on this topic. Differences found in individual trials do not always reach significance. It seemed appropriate to perform a meta-analysis combining the results of available randomised controlled trials. This systematic review investigated which semen preparation technique is superior.</P>

<P>Subfertility was defined as couples who have tried unsuccessfully to conceive for at least one year, despite regular and unprotected coital exposures (<LINK REF="REF-Evers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evers 2002</LINK>). A variety of causes for subfertility were included, such as unexplained subfertility, male subfertility (as defined by <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>), mild endometriosis, cervical factor and ovulatory dysfunction. Unexplained subfertility was defined as infertility for at least one year without any abnormality found at routine fertility check-up (normal results in semen analyses, luteal phase assessment, tubal patency, postcoital testing, immunological testing and investigations into uterine anomalies). We did not include fertile participants or healthy volunteers.</P>

<P>Two authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. </I>Results were summarised in the risk of bias tables for all included studies.</P>
<P>Eligibility and risk of bias was assessed on the following criteria:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Random sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>Describes the method used to generate the allocation sequence. Biased allocation to interventions would result in a selection bias.  </P>
<P>Method of randomisation:<BR/>Truly randomised (e.g. by computer, or random number tables, or drawing lots).<BR/>Quasi-randomised (e.g. by hospital number or date of birth), these studies are not included in the meta-analysis.<BR/>Not clear (e.g. stated but not further described).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Describes the method used to conceal the allocation sequence. Biased allocation to interventions due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment would also result in a selection and performance bias.  </P>
<P>- Good quality of concealment of allocation<BR/>Yes, (e.g. sealed in opaque envelopes, computerized allocation in a non-participating centre).<BR/>Unclear (not stated).<BR/>No, (e.g. open list of random numbers, open envelopes, tables).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding of participants and personnel</HEADING>
<P>Bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by participants and personnel during the study can result in a performance or detection bias.  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding of outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>Bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome assessors can result in detection bias. However, the primary outcome (ongoing) pregnancy rate was not susceptible to this kind of bias.  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Attrition bias is a kind of selection bias caused by attrition (loss of participants), it included drop-outs, protocol deviators, withdrawals. This type of study is not susceptible to protocol deviators or withdrawals. However, the drop out rates (&lt;10%?) and reasons, and selective loss to follow up were assessed for each study. In addition, the number and reason of cancelled cycles was assessed (&lt;10%?). Was an intention to treat analysis performed? What was the duration of follow-up?   </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selective reporting</HEADING>
<P>Within-study selective reporting bias applies to the failure to report outcomes within studies. This bias was assessed by considering whether individual studies reported all relevant and expected outcomes.</P>
<P>Publication bias is a form of reporting bias referring to the review as a whole rather than individual studies. It refers to the phenomenon by which trials with positive results are more likely to be published (and thus identified) than trials with negative results (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1989</LINK>). A way to detect such a bias is the construction of a funnel plot, plotting sample size versus effects size. In the absence of bias the graph is symmetrical. The number of trials needed to construct a plot is arbitrarily minimal 4 studies.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-08-27 15:58:26 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The pregnancy and live birth rates were considered positive consequences of treatment. Therefore a higher proportion achieving these outcomes was considered a benefit. The outcomes of adverse effects (multiple pregnancy, miscarriage,ectopic pregnancy, fetal abnormalities and infections) are negative consequences of treatment and therefore higher numbers were considered to be detrimental. This needs to be taken into consideration when viewing the summary graphs. In order to make these results easier to interpret and compare with the other trials, we calculated several results from the data in each trial. We calculated standard deviations (SDs) where standard errors (SEMs) were presented. If results in a trial were presented in a graph, we extracted data from the graphs. When data were presented in different subgroups (not of interest) we calculated a pooled mean and a pooled SD for the entire group. When we performed these calculations we reported the method in the notes section of the additional tables.<BR/>

However there was a large difference in the direction of effect. The Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests did not show significant statistical heterogeneity.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-27 16:44:56 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The increasing availability of therapeutic choices resulting from advances in subfertility research poses a problem in trying to determine whether these options are equally effective in clinical care. The aim of this review was to investigate which semen preparation technique is superior in clinical outcome.</P>
<P>The first conclusion that can be drawn from this systematic review is that large, high-quality randomised controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of a gradient, swim-up or wash and centrifugation technique, alone or in combination, and reporting clinical outcomes (pregnancy rate or live birth rate) are lacking. Only six RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Carrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carrell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dodson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dodson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grigoriou-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Grigoriou 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Posada-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Posada 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soliman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soliman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2000</LINK>) which compared a gradient technique versus a swim-up technique or a wash technique for IUI were identified. All six studies reported pregnancy rates. However, only <LINK REF="STD-Dodson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dodson 1998</LINK> compared the miscarriage and multiple pregnancy rates. Miscarriage rates were also reported by <LINK REF="STD-Posada-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Posada 2005</LINK>. Other outcomes (live birth rate, ongoing pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, infections, fetal abnormalities rate per couple and laboratory time) were not reported by any of the included studies.</P>
<P>One cross-over RCT was identified, which was excluded from the meta analysis but included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Carrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carrell 1998</LINK>) since data prior to crossing over could not be extracted. <LINK REF="STD-Carrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Carrell 1998</LINK> found inferior results in clinical outcomes after a wash technique versus a swim-up or gradient technique.</P>
<P>In conclusion, the meta-analysis did not show evidence of a difference in the effectiveness of a swim-up versus gradient or wash technique on pregnancy rates per couple. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn from the trials included in this review due to both unclear reporting of the methodology and lack of power.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-08-27 16:48:30 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only randomised controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. Only one of the six included studies used and described an adequate method of allocation concealment. The studies included in the review were carried out over a long period of time (22 years). The lack of blinding in most studies may be acceptable in terms of the overall quality since the outcomes are objective. None of the studies reported live birth, which is the outcome most relevant to subfertile couples, and data on adverse events were available for only two of the studies.</P>
<P>As noted above, the studies were limited by unclear reporting of methodology and lack of power. However, many fertility trials lack power. A prospective power calculation should always be performed, although the calculated sample size in most cases will be prohibitively large. Accruing this number of participants would require several years or a multi-centre design to complete the trial. In both cases this would increase clinical heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Daya-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daya 2001</LINK>) but might also ensure that studies more closely resemble the heterogeneity of daily practice. Only one of the trials performed an intention-to-treat analysis. The performance of this analysis minimizes an exclusion bias. A strategy to minimize this bias is to conduct the randomisation as late as possible in the study design; the dictum of 'select subjects early but randomise late' is particularly relevant in subfertility research (<LINK REF="REF-Daya-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daya 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>In 2010 the WHO published a WHO laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). The manual describes the choices for sperm preparation. It is dictated by the nature of the semen sample (<LINK REF="REF-Canale-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canale 1994</LINK>). For example, the direct swim-up technique is often used when the semen sample is considered to be largely normal, whereas in cases of severe oligozoospermia, teratospermia or asthenospermia density gradients are usually preferred because of the greater total number of motile spermatozoa recovered.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-08-27 16:50:36 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Considering the clinical outcomes after IUI, there are insufficient data from RCTs to recommend any of the three semen preparation techniques over each other (swim-up, gradient, wash and centrifugation).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-27 16:52:59 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More research needs to be performed on this topic as firm conclusions can not be drawn from the literature available. Next to large RCTs the results from thorough phase II research with semen parameters as an outcome would have substantial meaning for optimizing the techniques. These type of studies are suitable for within participant comparisons (such as <LINK REF="STD-Ricci-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ricci 2009</LINK>).<BR/>It may be interesting to combine a split sample study on semen parameters at initial semen analysis (at fertility check-up) and subsequently randomise semen preparation techniques (in the treatment cycle) to investigate whether the type of preparation needs to be individualized according to semen parameters after different preparation techniques.</P>
<P>Studies should report clinically relevant outcomes, such as ongoing pregnancy or preferably live birth rate per woman, rather than per cycle. Yet most research in the fertility field focuses on fertilisation rates, recovery rates and embryo development. Many fertility trials lack adequate reporting of methodology. The methods of randomisation and allocation concealment should be reported (<LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>). Adherence to the recommendations in the guideline for reporting clinical trials (CONSORT) would create a massive improvement. Because of a large range of factors contributing to the outcome in fertility research, a clear definition of the population, inclusion and exclusion criteria and a comparison of these factors in the treatment groups is recommended. In addition, the methodology of semen preparation needs to be standardised in order to allow appropriate comparison. Since all three techniques seem to be equally effective an analysis of laboratory time and costs would be of value.</P>

<P>After identifying the studies eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, some changes were made to the protocol for this review. Initially we intended to include studies investigating clinical outcomes after IUI, IVF or GIFT. We decided to limit the review to IUI due to a large difference in the amount and quality of sperm needed for IUI compared to IVF and GIFT.</P>
