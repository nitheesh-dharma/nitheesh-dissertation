<TITLE>The routine use of traction before surgery in adults with hip fracture</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-05 16:49:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>For people with hip fractures, traction involves either using tapes (skin traction) or pins (skeletal traction) attached to the injured leg and connected to weights via a pulley. The application of traction before surgery is thought to relieve pain and make the subsequent surgery easier. Where traction is not used, the injured limb is usually placed on a pillow and the patient encouraged to adopt a position of greatest comfort.</P>
<P>This review summarising the evidence from randomised controlled trials included 11 trials with 1654 participants. Consistent with the general hip fracture population, most of the trial participants were older persons of around 80 years of age and the majority were female. Ten trials compared traction versus no traction and two trials, including one of the preceding 10 trials, compared skin and skeletal traction. As well as limitations in the trial methods, there were very limited data for pooling and a lack of information about the longer-term consequences of applying or not applying traction. Nonetheless, the evidence from the 10 trials consistently showed no evidence to support the supposed advantages of traction described above. There were inconclusive data for pressures sores (skin ulcers) and other complications. One trial reported three adverse effects (sensory disturbance and skin blisters) related to skin traction; all were minor.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (April 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to April week 2 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 week 16), and CINAHL (1982 to 1 April 2011), conference proceedings, trials registries and reference lists of articles.</P>

<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing either skin or skeletal traction with no traction, or skin with skeletal traction for patients with an acute hip fracture prior to surgery.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-08-24 10:18:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>At least two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Additional information was sought from all trialists. Wherever appropriate and possible, data were pooled.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-09-05 16:41:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>One new trial was included in this update. In all, 11 trials (six were randomised and five were quasi-randomised), involving a total of 1654 predominantly elderly patients with hip fractures, are included in the review. Most trials were at risk of bias, particularly that resulting from inadequate allocation concealment, lack of assessor blinding and incomplete outcome assessment. Only very limited data pooling was possible.</P>
<P>Ten trials compared predominantly skin traction with no traction. The available data provided no evidence of benefit from traction either in the relief of pain (pain soon after immobilisation (visual analogue score 0: none to 10: worst pain): mean difference 0.11, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.50; 3 trials), ease of fracture reduction or quality of fracture reduction at time of surgery. There were inconclusive data for pressures sores and other complications, including fracture fixation failure. Three minor adverse effects (sensory disturbance and skin blisters) related to skin traction were reported.</P>
<P>One of the above trials included both skin and skeletal traction groups. This trial and one other compared skeletal traction with skin traction and found no important differences between these two methods, although the initial application of skeletal traction was noted as being more painful and more costly.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-10-06 16:40:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>From the evidence available, the routine use of traction (either skin or skeletal) prior to surgery for a hip fracture does not appear to have any benefit. However, the evidence is also insufficient to rule out the potential advantages for traction, in particular for specific fracture types, or to confirm additional complications due to traction use.</P>
<P>Given the increasing lack of evidence for the use of pre-operative traction, the onus should now be on clinicians who persist in using pre-operative traction to either stop using it or to use it only in the context of a well-designed randomised controlled trial.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-05 12:45:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-10-03 18:00:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-10-03 18:00:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fractures of the proximal femur encompass intracapsular (femoral neck) and extracapsular (trochanteric and subtrochanteric) fractures of the hip. They occur predominantly in older people (aged over 65 years), especially women. The incidence of hip fracture varies considerably between different populations (<LINK REF="REF-Bjorgul-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorgul 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koh 2001</LINK>). An incidence rate of 1024 per 100,000 for women over 50 and 452 per 100,000 for men over 50 was reported for Norway between 1998 and 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Bjorgul-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorgul 2007</LINK>). The absolute incidence of hip fractures is increasing due to an ageing population (<LINK REF="REF-Bergstrom-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergstrom 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kannus-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannus 1996</LINK>). Hip fractures are associated with significant mortality with mortality rates of up to 37% within the first year after fracture reported (<LINK REF="REF-Lyons-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyons 1997</LINK>). Additionally, hip fractures are associated with significant morbidity with many older patients never returning to their home environment. The economic burden associated with these fractures is substantial due to the cost of the initial acute hospital admission and the subsequent rehabilitation or provision of long term residential care (<LINK REF="REF-Haentjens-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haentjens 2005</LINK>). There has been a concerted effort to improve the outcome of hip fracture treatment with an emphasis on early surgery and multidisciplinary management by both orthopaedic and geriatric teams from the initial time of admission to hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Moran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moran 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>At the time of fracture, the fracture ends may be displaced relative to each other or are at risk of displacing due to muscle forces acting across the hip. A displaced fracture causes pain, makes reduction difficult and puts the patient at an increased risk of complications such as fracture non-union, avascular necrosis and nerve injury.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-11-22 23:45:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joseph Queally">
<P>It has been, and in some places remains, standard orthopaedic practice to apply skeletal or skin traction to the injured limb following an acute hip fracture, prior to surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Billsten-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Billsten 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brink-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brink 2005</LINK>). Traction may be either 'skin' or 'skeletal'. Skin traction may be applied by way of adhesive tape, tapes bandaged to the limb or a traction boot. Skeletal traction involves passing a metal pin through the proximal tibia or distal femur, under local or general anaesthesia. Traction is then applied using ropes and weights attached to the end of the tapes or pin.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-09-05 16:50:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joseph Queally">
<P>The main theoretical advantages that are advocated for traction are that it will reduce pain at the fracture site and assist the reduction of the fracture thereby making the subsequent operation easier to perform. For intracapsular fractures further advantages of traction have been proposed in the reduction of circulatory complications. Firstly, traction may reduce any tamponade effect (pressure caused by the build up of excess fluid that acts to compress blood vessels and block blood flow) within the joint (<LINK REF="REF-Maruenda-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maruenda 1997</LINK>). Secondly, it may reduce the movement at the fracture surfaces and deformity at the fracture site. Either effect proposed for traction might reduce the risk of obstruction of, or damage to the tenuous blood supply to the femoral head via the retinacular vessels. It has been postulated that this might lead to a reduction in the incidence of non-union or avascular necrosis (also termed osteonecrosis) for those fractures treated by internal fixation, however clinical evidence to support this is lacking.</P>
<P>Traction does, however, have potential disadvantages. It makes nursing of the patient more difficult: for example, in lifting the patient onto a bedpan or in pressure area care prior to surgery. Other possible adverse effects of skin traction are damage to the skin by mechanical shearing (<LINK REF="REF-Shabat-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shabat 2002</LINK>), ischaemia to the limb from tight bandages or allergy to adhesive strapping. If skeletal traction is used with a tibial pin the application of this can be uncomfortable, with the occasional complication of sepsis at the pin site. Furthermore, clinical studies have suggested that slight flexion, abduction and external rotation of the hip results in the lowest intracapsular pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Stromqvist-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stromqvist 1988</LINK>). Traction with the hip in extension may thereby increase intracapsular pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Svalastoga-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svalastoga 1989</LINK>), although this may not apply for traction with the hip in the position described in the previous sentence (<LINK REF="REF-Maruenda-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maruenda 1997</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-24 22:05:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Over several years and seven updates this review has continued to show a lack of benefit of pre-operative traction for fractures of the proximal fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2006</LINK>). However, while the findings from the trials have been consistent, the available evidence has been from trials with sub-optimal and flawed methodology. Despite this lack of demonstrable benefit, traction continues to be used as standard treatment in some centres (<LINK REF="REF-Kemler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindholm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindholm 2008</LINK>). More recent studies have pointed to increased complications associated with traction (<LINK REF="REF-Kemler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindholm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindholm 2008</LINK>). Inadequate evidence, variation in practice and the potential for traction to be less benign than previously thought warrant the updating of this review.</P>

<P>Risk of bias was independently assessed by two authors (JQ and HH) for previously included trials and by all three authors for the newly included trial. There was no masking of authors or sources. We used the risk of bias tool outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>). This tool incorporates assessment of randomisation (sequence generation and allocation concealment), blinding (of participants, treatment providers and outcome assessors), completeness of outcome data, selection of outcomes reported and other sources of bias. We considered subjective and objective outcomes separately in our assessment of blinding and short-term outcomes (measured up to and including surgery) and longer-term (post-operative) outcomes for completeness of outcome data. We assessed two additional sources of bias: selection bias resulting from major imbalances in key baseline characteristics (age, sex, previous mobility, fracture type, previous residence); and performance bias resulting from lack of comparability in the experience of care providers and provision of treatment interventions such as pre-operative pain relief and timing of surgery. Any differences were resolved through discussion.</P>

<P>All 11 trials were considered at high risk of detection bias relating to lack of blinding of subjective outcomes, principally assessment of pain. Objectively-assessed outcomes were generally judged to be less susceptible to bias; and trials were either rated as being at low or unclear risk of blinding-related bias. Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghnaimat-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ghnaimat 2005</LINK>) included any blinded assessment, which was for ease of fracture reduction in both cases.</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Draper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Draper 1997</LINK>, the large difference in the numbers in each intervention group (121 versus 182) suggests a failure of randomisation methodology.

Post-randomisation exclusions were considered very likely in <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1992</LINK>.

Although compensatory analyses were carried out by <LINK REF="STD-Draper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Draper 1997</LINK> in an attempt to counteract the difference in mental function scores of the two groups, the highly statistically significant imbalance in the scores (reported to be P &lt; 0.001) and the numbers who scored zero (2 participants of the traction group versus 37 of the no traction group) point to more fundamental problems which probably cannot be totally remedied by post-hoc analyses. Draper estimated that approximately 17 people assigned traction were not given traction, but the lack of a definite number also indicates some slackness in the conduct of this trial.

<P>Given the above mentioned problems with adherence to trial allocation in <LINK REF="STD-Draper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Draper 1997</LINK>, this trial could not be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. While <LINK REF="STD-Draper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Draper 1997</LINK> attempted to remedy this by using statistical methods to exclude an alternative hypothesis that the trial results reflected the difference in mental function scores, doubts remain about the validity of the results of this study.</P>
<P>The various data provided in the study reports for time intervals, such as time between trauma and surgery, hospital admission and surgery, and treatment (traction) and surgery, showed no apparent difference between the treatment groups in individual studies. The time to surgery was around 24 hours in most trial participants, which reflects current trends. From an inspection of a graph in <LINK REF="STD-Ghnaimat-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ghnaimat 2005</LINK>, we estimate that the mean time to surgery was between two and three days in this trial. The mean time to surgery was 53 hours (2.2 days) in <LINK REF="STD-Saygi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saygi 2010</LINK> and 4.7 days in <LINK REF="STD-Yip-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yip 2002</LINK>.</P>

The data for <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1993</LINK> were extracted, from a bar chart of pre-operative analgesia given in the first three days of admission, provided in the trial report. The data from <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 2001</LINK> represent trial participants who requested pain medication between hospital admission and surgery; on average the time to surgery was between 1.2 days (traction group) and 1.3 days (pillow group). Although there was a tendency for more traction group participants to receive analgesics in the first day in <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1993</LINK> there was no significant difference between the two groups (54/101 versus 71/151; RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.46); and there was no difference between the two groups in the proportions of trial participants, still awaiting surgery, who received analgesia in the second day (32/64 versus 44/90; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.41). <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1993</LINK> concluded that there was "no difference" between the groups in terms of analgesic use.

Twenty-two separate pressure sites on each person were inspected daily until the seventh post-operative day in <LINK REF="STD-Draper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Draper 1997</LINK>. No difference was found in the "global" scores of the two groups, and the only site to show any significant difference, in favour of the traction group, was the heel of the contralateral leg to the injured leg (P = 0.016). However, the clinical significance of this finding was questioned by <LINK REF="STD-Draper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Draper 1997</LINK>, who indicated that there were no cases of skin ulceration or skin breakage at this site. There were no deep sores in <LINK REF="STD-Draper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Draper 1997</LINK> and few (21) observations of sites with ulceration; Draper considered that the regular examination of pressure sites might have helped reduce the risk of pressure sores. <LINK REF="STD-Jerre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jerre 2000</LINK> noted that, prior to surgery, five participants of the traction group developed grade 1 pressure or wound sores as opposed to none in the group with no traction (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>: RR 11.0, 95% CI 0.62 to 194.63). <LINK REF="STD-Ghnaimat-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ghnaimat 2005</LINK> reported that 14 patients developed a grade 2 pressure sore while in hospital.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-10-05 11:06:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The continuing relevance of the review question is shown by the continuing variation in practice and the availability of new trials. Traction prior to surgery for an acute hip fracture used to be routine and in some hospitals remains standard practice. For example, a survey of 78 hospitals in Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-Billsten-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Billsten 1996</LINK>) showed that a quarter of these routinely applied skin traction to all hip fractures. Another survey (<LINK REF="REF-Brink-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brink 2005</LINK>) found pre-operative traction was standard practice in 20% of trauma departments in the Netherlands, mainly for an assumed reduction in pain. In a study of hip fracture and pressure sores, <LINK REF="REF-Lindholm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindholm 2008</LINK> reported that traction had been applied in 6% of patients from centres from four north Europeon countries and 74% of patients from three south European countries. Notably, guidelines based on evidence from the previous versions of this review have advised against the routine use of traction (<LINK REF="REF-NZGG-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NZGG 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2009</LINK>).</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-05 11:06:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review summarizes the evidence from 11 randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (1654 participants) examining the use of pre-operative traction in adults with hip fracture. Ten trials compared traction versus no traction (injured limb placed on an ordinary pillow) and two trials, including one of the preceding 10, compared skin traction versus skeletal traction. Only limited pooling of results was possible due to the different outcome measures used or incomplete data. There were very limited data available for long term outcomes.</P>
<P>For the traction versus no traction comparison, none of the available data showed significant differences between the groups in pain reduction after the application of traction as measured by visual analogue scores or analgesic use. Although the data were just from three trials, it is noteworthy that the pooled 95% confidence interval (-0.27 to 0.50) in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> did not include minimal clinically important differences. The few pressure sores data available for graphical presentation also showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups; this was claimed also by other trials reporting this outcome. A similar result of no statistically significant difference was generally found for the available data, often from single trials, for secondary outcomes, namely ease of fracture reduction, fracture fixation complications, complications, operative time and blood loss, length of hospital stay. For most of these outcomes, the results favoured no traction more than the traction group. All three complications reported as directly linked to traction use were minor and resolved without sequelae. Overall, despite significant limitations in the methodology of most trials and the limited availability of data for pooling, the evidence from these 10 trials consistently failed to show any benefit from pre-operative traction during the peri-operative period. All of the trials included in this review so far have concluded that since traction does not significantly reduce the degree of pain the patient experiences pre-operatively or, where recorded, aid reduction of the fracture, its routine use may be superfluous.</P>
<P>Limited data from the two trials comparing skin with skeletal traction showed no important differences between these two methods in pain, analgesic requirement, ease of fracture reduction or operative time. However, the initial application of skeletal traction was noted as being more painful and more costly.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-08-25 10:12:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The included trials had varied and incomplete ascertainment of outcome, and only very limited pooling of results was possible. It is clearly unsatisfactory but unavoidable to be reporting findings from trials that cannot be included in a meta-analyses or otherwise examined. The consistency of pain results from the available data for analysis and reported lack of differences between traction and no traction in the other trials not providing data adds credibility to this finding. This has been supported by the addition of comparable data from yet another trial in this update. As described below, the data for the other primary outcome of pressure sores are even more unsatisfactory and incomplete.</P>
<P>Hypothetically, people treated with traction are more likely to suffer from pressure sores since the use of traction inhibits the proper turning of the patient. This is not confirmed in this review but various deficiencies in the trials and the available data prevent conclusions being drawn. One major issue is the monitoring and measurement of pressure sores. The monitoring of complications including pre-operative pressure sores was poorly reported in most trials, and separate group data for the more serious grades of pressure sore were not available for four trials reporting these. By far the most assiduous collection of pressure sore data was done by <LINK REF="STD-Draper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Draper 1997</LINK>, who reported that of 46,958 observations of 22 pressure sites in each patient on a daily basis over seven days, there were 21 instances of skin ulceration. But again data split by treatment group were not available for this albeit flawed trial.</P>
<P>The majority of participants were over 80 years of age and female; and thus representative of the general population with these fractures in many countries. However, five trials excluded patients with dementia or cognitive impairment. The applicability of the review findings is enhanced by the availability of data from several countries. It is notable though that while the time to surgery was around 24 hours in most trial participants, which reflects current trends and aspirations in several countries, time to surgery was greater in three more recently included trials based in Hong Kong (mean 4.7 days), Jordan (2 to 3 days) and Turkey (mean 2.2 days). The median time between arrival and surgery was 90 hours in centres in three south European countries in <LINK REF="REF-Lindholm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindholm 2008</LINK>. It is not clear from the trial results whether prolonged traction may confer additional benefit or be associated with increased complications. However, the extended use of traction in <LINK REF="STD-Yip-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yip 2002</LINK> did not appear to be of advantage: the graphs of pain scores and analgesic requirement presented in the trial report showed a decline for both groups in pain and analgesic consumption after peaking in the day following admission.</P>
<P>There was no evidence to examine whether the arguments for and against traction apply equally for both intracapsular and extracapsular fractures; or for other subgroups of hip fracture patients, such as those with displaced intracapsular fractures or subtrochanteric fractures. Though two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jerre 2000</LINK>) presented separate data for extracapsular and intracapsular fractures, the numbers of patients within these groups were too small to be able to draw conclusions. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Resch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Resch 2005</LINK>) stated without providing evidence that "fracture type did not affect outcome". As noted by <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2009</LINK>, "The small numbers and limitations of the studies cannot exclude possible advantages of traction for specific fracture types".</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-09-08 09:03:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the trials included in this review continues to disappoint. The trial (<LINK REF="STD-Saygi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saygi 2010</LINK>) newly included in this update was quasi-randomised, as were two of the three trials added in the more recent updates. Inspection of <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>, which summarises the judgements about each risk of bias item across all included studies, shows that 10 out of the 11 included trials were at high or unclear risk of selection bias. Detection bias of subjective outcomes (primarily pain) is arguably inevitable for these trials. An attempt at 'placebo' traction in <LINK REF="STD-Saygi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saygi 2010</LINK>, which found statistically significant results in favour of the placebo group, prompts the question of whether the non-use of weights can be considered 'placebo' traction. We do not think it does. Another serious weakness and source of bias in these trials results from incomplete outcome data; a clear description of participant flow was available in only two trials. Newly considered in this update is selective reporting bias. Absence of trial protocols meant that we were unable to judge any trial as being at 'low' risk of bias for this important item. However, four trials were considered at high risk. In the results we drew attention to the problems surrounding <LINK REF="STD-Draper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Draper 1997</LINK>, including a major imbalance in baseline characteristics. The problems of <LINK REF="STD-Draper-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Draper 1997</LINK> show the immense care that is required in conducting trials, including having robust methods of allocation concealment, and guarding against breaches in the trial protocol.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-08-24 21:47:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While our search was comprehensive it is likely that we have failed to identify some randomised trials, particularly those reported only in abstracts or in non-English language publications. The latter possibility is reinforced by geographical distribution of the included trials. However, we are almost certain that substantial randomised controlled trials that could provide the definitive evidence needed in this area would be published and identifiable by our search. Systematic processes were undertaken throughout the review and a cautious approach taken in interpreting the evidence. The planned summary of findings tables were not compiled given the limited and variably reported results.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-10-05 12:09:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>From the limited evidence available, there is no proven benefit for the routine use of traction (either skin or skeletal) prior to surgery for a hip fracture. However, the limited numbers of patients involved and the flawed methodology of the studies means that potential advantages for traction, in particular for specific fracture types, cannot be refuted. The potential for complications, such as pre-operative pressure sores, arising from the use of traction should also be considered. </P>
<P>The continuing and increasing lack of evidence over successive updates to support pre-operative traction is noteworthy. We suggest that this should give considerable pause for thought where pre-operative traction is being considered, with the onus being on clinicians to provide the evidence for its use.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-10-05 12:10:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The trials so far conducted have not shown any benefit from the use of traction prior to surgery for hip fracture but were not sufficient to confirm this, nor additional complications due to traction use. We recommend that clinicians continuing to use pre-operative traction should do so in the context of a randomised controlled trial. In any future trials planned, the aim should be to minimise bias particularly by allocation concealment and blind assessment of appropriate outcome measures, including patient satisfaction and fracture healing complications, defined in the study protocol. Confounding should be minimised by ensuring that, other than the traction option, care programmes are the same for all participants. Full reporting of trial methods and outcomes, including the provision of standard deviations where appropriate, is also essential. Given the potential of trials to influence both clinical practice and future research, we recommend that original data should be retained to enable future scrutiny.</P>

<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Additional report of trial provided by main author. <BR/>The number of participants in the two groups were dissimilar (121 versus 182), as was the number of participants with low (0) mental test scores (2 versus 37). The authors suggested the reason for this might be failure by nursing staff to apply traction to mentally confused participants allocated to the traction group; these were then included in the non-traction group. Because of this potential bias in the different characteristics of the two groups, analysis of co-variance was undertaken by the authors to try to correct for the imbalance.</P>
