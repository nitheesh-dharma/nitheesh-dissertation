<TITLE MODIFIED="2012-12-20 01:33:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Iron therapy for improving physical and intellectual development in children under the age of three who are anaemic due to a lack of iron</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-05-30 10:04:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been suggested that a lack of iron in young children negatively affects their physical and intellectual development and therefore those who are anaemic should be treated. To assess the effects of iron therapy on psychomotor development and cognitive function in very young iron deficient anaemic children, we searched eight electronic databases in April 2013 for relevant studies. We looked for studies where children less than three years of age with iron deficiency anaemia were randomly assigned either to receive iron or iron plus vitamin C versus a placebo ('dummy pill') or vitamin C alone, and their developmental status or cognitive function was independently assessed by someone who did not know if they had received any iron. To make sure we had not missed any studies, we also searched reference lists, ran citation searches and contacted key experts in this area.</P>
<P>Two review authors independently read through all the titles and abstracts retrieved from the searches to see if the studies were relevant. Where necessary, we looked at the full-text version of the paper to check if it matched the inclusion criteria for our review. The same review authors independently extracted data from the studies for analysis and assessed the risk of bias in each of the studies. We analysed the data separately depending on whether assessments were performed within one month of beginning iron therapy or after one month.</P>
<P>We found eight studies to include in the review. Six studies (involving 225 children) looked at the effects of iron therapy within 30 days of starting it and we were able to combine the results of five of them. Iron therapy did not appear to improve scores on either the Bayley Scale Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) or the Bayley Scale Mental Development Index (MDI). Two studies (160 children) considered the effects of iron therapy more than 30 days after starting it. One study found no benefit of iron therapy on the acquistion of skills as measured by the Denver Developmental Screening Test. The other study, however, found that scores on the Bayley scales PDI and MDI were significantly higher for the group receiving iron therapy.</P>
<P>This review concludes that there is no convincing evidence that iron given by mouth or by injection will improve physical or intellectual development in young children who are anaemic because of a lack of iron within one month after start of treatment. It is unclear whether longer-term treatment is beneficial for physical and intellectual development in these children. Large randomised controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed in the future.<BR/>

<P>Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) are common in young children. It has been suggested that the lack of iron may have deleterious effects on children's psychomotor development and cognitive function. To evaluate the benefits of iron therapy on psychomotor development and cognitive function in children with IDA, a Cochrane review was carried out in 2001. This is an update of that review.</P>

<P>We identified one eligible study in the update search that had not been included in the original review. In total, we included eight trials.</P>
<P>Six trials, including 225 children with IDA, examined the effects of iron therapy on measures of psychomotor development and cognitive function within 30 days of commencement of therapy. We could pool data from five trials. The pooled difference in pre- to post-treatment change in Bayley Scale Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) between iron and placebo groups was -1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) -4.56 to 2.06, P value = 0.65; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 33% for heterogeneity, random-effects meta-analysis; low quality evidence) and in Bayley Scale Mental Development Index (MDI) was 1.04 (95% CI -1.30 to 3.39, P value = 0.79; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 31% for heterogeneity, random-effects meta-analysis; low quality evidence).</P>
<P>Two studies, including 160 randomised children with IDA, examined the effects of iron therapy on measures of psychomotor development and cognitive function more than 30 days after commencement of therapy. One of the studies reported the mean number of skills gained after two months of iron therapy using the Denver Developmental Screening Test. The intervention group gained 0.8 (95% CI -0.18 to 1.78, P value = 0.11, moderate quality of evidence) more skills on average than the control group. The other study reported that the difference in pre- to post-treatment change in Bayley Scale PDI between iron-treated and placebo groups after four months was 18.40 (95% CI 10.16 to 26.64, P value &lt; 0.0001; moderate quality evidence) and in Bayley Scale MDI was 18.80 (95% CI 10.17 to 27.43, P value &lt; 0.0001; moderate quality evidence).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-05-28 14:27:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-05-28 14:27:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Iron is important in the production of haemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin and as co-factor in the metabolism of some neurotransmitters including dopamine. In addition, it has been suggested that iron is required for the myelin production in the developing brain (<LINK REF="REF-Larkin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larkin 1990</LINK>). Animal studies, mainly in rats, have suggested that severe iron deficiency can lead to a deficit of brain iron, that iron deficiency may be associated with alterations in motor activity and behaviour and that these deficits may persist (<LINK REF="REF-Dallman-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dallman 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Felt-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felt 1996</LINK>). In the clinical literature, children with severe iron deficiency are often described as irritable and apathetic with a poor appetite. Most, but not all, of the large number of observational studies that have examined the association between iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) and psychomotor development have found lower scores on tests of psychomotor development in young children with IDA (<LINK REF="REF-Lansdown-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lansdown 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The reported prevalence of IDA in toddlers varies in different populations, depending in part on the case definition used, with estimates ranging from around 10% in Western societies to around 50% in less developed societies (<LINK REF="REF-De-Maeyer-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Maeyer 1985</LINK>). IDA is generally defined as an Hb level of less than 110 g/L (with a microcytic, hypochromic picture after the exclusion of haemoglobinopathies). Children may also be classified as iron deficient without anaemia on the basis of decreased serum ferritin (&lt; 10 &#956;g/L), raised erythrocyte protoporphyrin (&gt; 2.5 &#956;g/g Hb), a decreased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (&lt; 72 fL) or some combination of these since earlier stages of iron deficiency may lead to decreased Hb synthesis before the appearance of frank anaemia. The choice of a particular cut-off point is essentially arbitrary as there is no clear evidence to determine at which level iron deficiency begins to have significant deleterious effects (<LINK REF="REF-Logan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Logan 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-05-28 14:27:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Iron therapy can be administered to children less than three years of age with IDA orally (ferrous sulphate, ferrous fumarate, sodium iron ethylenediaminetetra-acetate and ferrous gluconate), intravenously (iron dextran, iron sucrose and ferric carboxymaltose) or intramuscularly (iron dextran) (<LINK REF="REF-Goddard-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goddard 2011</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-05-28 14:27:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A number of possible mechanisms have been suggested for a postulated effect of iron deficiency on children's psychomotor development (<LINK REF="REF-Lozoff-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozoff 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roncagliolo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roncagliolo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walter 1994</LINK>). Lack of iron might interfere with the metabolism of neurotransmitters, which either might affect psychomotor function directly or might affect scores on tests of psychomotor function indirectly through effects on behaviour. Iron is important in the synthesis of Hb and myoglobin, and deficiency might adversely affect oxygen transport or storage, which might have effects on either the central nervous system or motor function. Finally, lack of iron at a critical stage of development of the nervous system might lead to interference with myelination. Iron therapy acts by replenishing the iron stores in the body. Since iron is essential to neurotransmitters, Hb and myelination, iron therapy may improve psychomotor development and cognitive function in iron deficient anaemic children.</P>
<P>The timing of any therapeutic response to iron therapy will depend on what mechanisms underlie the relationship between iron and psychomotor function. Many early studies were designed to look for rapid effects of iron, partly because clinicians treating children and adults with severe IDA often reported dramatic improvements in mood soon after beginning treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1993</LINK>). Such rapid effects (i.e. within days of beginning treatment) would be consistent with the effects of iron being attributable to direct effects on the central nervous system, perhaps as a result of effects on metabolism of neurotransmitters. However, although children with IDA show raised levels of Hb soon after commencing treatment with iron, the full effect on Hb synthesis develops over weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1993</LINK>). If an effect of iron on psychomotor function were mediated via effects of iron deficiency on oxygen transport or storage, then it might be expected that the therapeutic effects of iron would take some weeks to manifest in changes in scores on tests of psychomotor function. If this latter mechanism were involved, the inclusion of results of assessments of outcome carried out before sufficient time has elapsed would introduce bias. For this reason, in this review, studies were analysed separately depending on how long after institution of treatment the outcomes were measured (with an arbitrary cut-off 30 days after beginning of treatment).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-05-28 14:27:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If lack of iron is associated with adverse effects on children's psychomotor development and these effects could be reversed by administration of iron, there would be a strong argument for either population supplementation with iron or screening of young children for IDA. It is widely acknowledged that the age period from birth to three years old is critical for psychomotor development and cognitive development, thus children under the age of three years would be the most sensitive population for this review. Consequently, we considered only children under the age of three years in this review. Safety outcomes are important to a Cochrane review. However, the purpose of this review is to assess the effect of iron therapy specifically on psychomotor development and cognitive development. The assessment of harm of iron therapy is beyond the scope of this review.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2001</LINK>). The original review concluded that there is no convincing evidence that iron therapy of iron deficient anaemic children under three years of age improves psychomotor development or cognitive function within 30 days of beginning treatment, and the effect of longer-term treatment remains unclear.</P>

The trials involveed 225 children with IDA. As described above, data from one study could not be included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Lozoff--1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lozoff 1987</LINK>). All studies included measures of development before and between 5 to 11 days after commencement of therapy and used the Bayley Scales of Infant Development in the assessment of outcome.</P>
<P>The pooled difference in pre-post treatment change in the Bayley Scale PDI between iron-treated and placebo groups was -1.25 (95% CI -4.56 to 2.06, P value = 0.65; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 33% for heterogeneity, random-effects meta-analysis, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) and in the Bayley Scale MDI was 1.04 (95% CI -1.30 to 3.39, P value = 0.79; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 31% for heterogeneity, random-effects meta-analysis, <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Funnel plots for both outcomes indicated small study effects (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). The quality of evidence for both outcomes was low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis showed compatible results between fixed-effect methods and random-effects methods. We pooled data from four trials reporting the post-treatment difference between iron-treated and placebo groups. The pooled difference in the post-treatment Bayley Scale PDI was -1.62 (95% CI -9.79 to 6.55, P value = 0.70; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 51% for heterogeneity, random-effects meta-analysis) and in the Bayley Scale MDI was -0.01 (95% CI -9.17 to 9.15, P value = 0.97; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 62% for heterogeneity, random-effects meta-analysis).</P>
<P>The trial that was excluded from the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Lozoff--1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lozoff 1987</LINK>), included 19 children randomised to receive intramuscular iron, 16 oral iron and 17 oral placebo. The authors compared both groups receiving iron with those only receiving placebo, and found that neither intramuscular iron nor oral iron treatments differed from placebo treatment in effects on Bayley Scale scores.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Long-term effects of iron therapy</HEADING>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aukett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Aukett 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Idjradinata-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Idjradinata 1993</LINK>), including 160 randomised children with IDA, examined the effects of iron therapy on measures of psychomotor development more than 30 days after commencement of therapy. The use of very different outcome measures precluded the combination of results from these two studies: the Bayley Scale assesses developmental skills across a wide range of different aspects of development, while the Denver Developmental Screening Test was devised as a screening test for developmental problems rather than as an assessment tool for psychomotor development and only tests for a limited number of psychomotor skills. Therefore, we reported the results of these two studies separately.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Aukett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Aukett 1986</LINK> assessed changes in children's development by administering 24 items taken from the Denver Developmental Screening Test at the beginning of the study and after two months of iron or placebo treatment. The results were reported as the mean number of skills gained over the period. On average, the intervention group gained 0.8 (95% CI -0.18 to 1.78, P value = 0.11) more skills than the control group. The quality of evidence for this outcomes was moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Idjradinata-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Idjradinata 1993</LINK> assessed the children's development using the Bayley Scales at the beginning of the study and after four months of iron or placebo treatment. The difference in pre- to post-treatment change in Bayley Scale PDI between iron-treated and placebo-treated groups was 18.40 (95% CI 10.16 to 26.64, P value &lt; 0.0001) and in Bayley Scale MDI was 18.80 (95% CI 10.17 to 27.43, P value &lt; 0.0001). The post-treatment difference between iron-treated and placebo-treated groups in Bayley Scale PDI was 14.50 (95% CI 8.82 to 20.18, P value &lt; 0.00001) and in Bayley Scale MDI was 15.20 (95% CI 8.96 to 21.44, P value &lt; 0.00001).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-31 11:59:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of the studies included in this review provide no convincing evidence that administration of iron improves children's scores on tests of psychomotor development within six to 11 days of receiving intramuscular or commencing oral iron supplements (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The relatively small numbers of children included in these studies means, however, that the CIs around the effects of treatment are wide and the results could be compatible with moderate positive or adverse effects of short-term iron therapy. Five other possible explanations have been advanced to explain this finding (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sachdev-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachdev 2004</LINK>). First, prevention of neurodevelopmental consequences of IDA may require acting to prevent iron deficiency rather than detection and treatment of existing iron deficiency. Second, the duration of iron treatment may have been too short to correct the iron deficiency; all six trials that examined the effects of iron therapy within 30 days of commencement of therapy intervened for less than 11 days. Third, structural brain changes caused by iron deficiency or IDA may be irreversible in younger children below three years of age. Fourth, it is also arguable that changes in Bayley Scale scores, the outcome measures employed in these studies, may well be an insensitive measure of real changes, particularly of attributes such as attention or mood. Fifth, prevention of neurodevelopmental consequences may require screening and early treatment of multiple nutritional deficiencies, rather than IDA alone.</P>
<P>On the basis of the data included here, the effects of longer periods of iron therapy on psychomotor development in children with IDA remain unclear (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The larger of the two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aukett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Aukett 1986</LINK>), unfortunately employed a test designed to be used as a screening tool on a single occasion as the outcome measure, not a tool for the assessment of psychomotor development or for changes in psychomotor development. This measure may well be an insensitive instrument for the detection of changes in psychomotor development. Accepting these limitations, the data from this study did not suggest a substantial beneficial effect on psychomotor development of two months of iron therapy for children with IDA. On the contrary, <LINK REF="STD-Idjradinata-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Idjradinata 1993</LINK> reported extremely large effects, greater than one population SD of the tests, of four months of iron therapy in these children. Given the high prevalence of IDA in most populations, if an effect of this magnitude on children's psychomotor development could be achieved by the treatment of IDA, this intervention would have an enormous impact. However, given the inconsistency in the results of these two trials and the small numbers of children studied, the data should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Overall, the evidence that lack of iron affects the psychomotor development of young children with IDA is unclear. Given the high prevalence of iron deficiency, there is an urgent need for large-scale randomised controlled trials of iron therapy in young children with IDA.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-05-28 14:33:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review aimed to determine the effects of iron therapy on psychomotor development and cognitive function in children with IDA less than three years of age, but data were only available for children aged less than 26 months of age, and failed to include those aged 26 to 36 months. In terms of administration routes of iron therapy, only oral and intramuscular routes were addressed and the effects of iron therapy by the intravenous route were not investigated in this review. This means that the results of this review cannot be directly extrapolated to children aged 26 to 36 months or to iron therapy administrated intravenously.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-05-28 15:15:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For changes in Bayley Scale PDI and MDI within 30 days of commencement of therapy, 162 children from five studies and 164 children from five studies were included, respectively. Neither serious methodological limitations of nor statistical heterogeneity across studies were found. The quality of the evidence for both outcomes was low due to possible publication bias and imprecision of results.</P>
<P>For changes in Bayley Scale PDI and MDI more than 30 days of commencement of therapy, one study with 46 children was included (<LINK REF="STD-Idjradinata-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Idjradinata 1993</LINK>). No serious methodological limitations of the study existed. The quality of evidence for both outcomes was moderate due to imprecision of results. </P>
<P>For changes in Denver Developmental Screening Test, more than 30 days after commencement of therapy, only one study with 97 children was included (<LINK REF="STD-Aukett-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Aukett 1986</LINK>). No serious methodological limitations of the study were identified and the quality of evidence was moderate due to imprecision of results.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-05-28 14:33:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three limitations merit consideration. First, a comprehensive search strategy was developed and a large body of the published literature was scrutinised. However, we did not handsearch key journals and<B> </B>grey literature websites for this update. A potential publication bias should be taken into account in those outcomes for which no funnel plots were used. Second, one eligible study was not included in the meta-analysis due to unavailable data (<LINK REF="STD-Lozoff--1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lozoff 1987</LINK>). However, the finding of this study that there was no evidence of effects of iron therapy on psychomotor development or cognitive function within seven days of commencement of therapy was consistent with the meta-analysis. Third, SDs for changes in pre- to post-test scores were imputed in five studies. Sensitivity analysis using post-treatment measures, however, demonstrated the robustness of the results. All review authors had no conflicts of interest in the review process.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-05-28 14:33:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this updated review do not differ from those of the original review, which was first published 2001. One systematic review of randomised controlled trials evaluated the effect of iron supplementation on mental and motor development in children (less than 18 years old, including both anaemic and non-anaemic) (<LINK REF="REF-Sachdev-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachdev 2004</LINK>). It found that there was no convincing evidence (Bayley Scale MDI, MD 0.95, 95% CI -0.56 to 2.46) that iron treatment had an effect on mental development in children below 27 months of age or on motor development. This has provided support to the result of our review to some degree. Another recently published systematic review of randomised controlled trials assessed the effect of iron supplementation in non-anaemic children less than three years of age on mental development (<LINK REF="REF-Szajewska-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szajewska 2010</LINK>). It found limited available evidence suggesting a possible positive effect on the Bayley Scale PDI (MD 4.21, 95% CI 2.31 to 6.12) and no effect on the MDI (MD 1.66, 95% CI -0.14 to 3.47). It is proposed that the inconsistency between <LINK REF="REF-Szajewska-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szajewska 2010</LINK> and our review is caused by different types of participants (iron deficient anaemic versus non-anaemic) or different precisions of results, or both.</P>

<P>Most clinicians seeing a child with IDA would elect either to treat with elemental iron or to attempt to improve the child's intake of dietary iron. However, clinicians cannot be sure if treatment of IDA to remedy the anaemia will result in positive changes to psychomotor development and cognitive function.<BR/>

<P>There is an urgent need for large randomised controlled trials of iron therapy in young children less than three years old with IDA with long-term follow-up, and Bayley Scales of Infant Development should be used to assess development both at and more than one month after commencement of iron therapy. Meanwhile, appropriate methodologies in design and implementation should be used and clearly reported in these studies, including adequate allocation sequence generation; allocation concealment; and blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors.</P>

<SUP>6</SUP> P values were derived from a repeated measures analysis of variance. For PDI, P values were treated as if resulting from unpaired t-tests (for the between group differences in changes). For MDI, P values were treated as if resulting from paired t-tests (for within group changes). The SD for the change MDI in the intervention group (25.09) was used for the SDs of the change in MDI in the control group, which was impossible to be imputed. However, the estimated SDs for change in MDI would imply correlations between pre- and post-test scores substantially in excess of -1, which is impossible. It was, therefore, decided instead to estimate SDs from these reported scores and standard errors, following methods described by Follmann (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>), assuming a correlation of 0 between pre- and post-treatment test scores. This provided an estimate of the SD for the change in MDI of 15.26 for the control group and 14.90 for the intervention group and of the SD for the change in PDI of 14.21 for the intervention group and 14.58 for the control group.<BR/>
