It is caused by inadequate blood flow to the muscles of the leg due to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Exercise therapy provides significant symptomatic benefit for patients with intermittent claudication. Patients are recommended to walk at least three times a week by themselves. However, they can also participate in a formal supervised exercise program that involves walking on a treadmill or complete a structured home-based exercise program with an observation component (e.g., exercise logbooks, pedometers).</P><P><B>Study characteristics and key results</B></P><P>We included 21 trials in which a total of 1400 participants with intermittent claudication (65% male, mean age 66 years) had been assigned to supervised exercise therapy, home-based exercise therapy, or walking advice (search last run December 2016). The overall methodological quality of included trials was moderate to good. However, some trials had enrolled only small numbers of participants. Trials lasted from six weeks to two years.</P><P>This review shows that patients participating in a supervised exercise program improve their walking ability to a greater extent than those completing a home-based exercise program or just following walking advice. After three months, the maximal walking distance for participants following the supervised exercise program was 120 or 210 meters farther than the maximal walking distance for those who followed a home-based exercise program or received walking advice, respectively. To put these increases in context, a US football field is roughly 90 meters (or 100 yards) long. Before participating in the exercise program, the maximal walking distance of participants was 290 meters with a pain-free walking distance of 140 meters, so this improvement is likely to have a positive impact on their lives. Results of the home-based exercise program were similar to those reported for walking advice.</P><P>Compared with home-based exercise therapy, supervised exercise therapy was more beneficial for pain-free walking distance but had no effect on quality of life measures nor on self-reported functional impairment. Compared with walking advice, supervised exercise therapy was more beneficial for pain-free walking distance and self-reported functional impairment, as well as for some quality of life measures (e.g., physical functioning, pain, and physical component summary after 12 months), and home-based exercise therapy had no effect.</P><P>Data show no obvious effects on mortality rates. Thirteen of the 1400 participants died, but no deaths were related to exercise therapy. Overall, adherence to supervised exercise therapy was approximately 80%, which was similar to that reported with home-based exercise therapy. Only limited adherence data were available for walking advice groups.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>Evidence of moderate and high quality shows that supervised exercise therapy improves walking distance (maximal and pain-free) to a greater extent than home-based exercise therapy and walking advice, respectively. Trials show no clear differences in quality of life measures nor in self-reported functional impairment between supervised exercise therapy and home-based exercise therapy. However, evidence is of low and very low quality, respectively. Investigators detected some improvements in quality of life favoring supervised exercise therapy over walking advice, but analyses were limited by small numbers of studies and participants. More research is needed on disease-specific quality of life and other functional outcomes, such as walking behavior and physical activity, as well as on long-term follow-up.</P><P>Adhering to an exercise program is important because it leads to decreased leg pain and improved quality of life, as well as to likely improvement in general physical condition.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-04-02 14:06:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-23 14:30:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Although supervised exercise therapy (SET) provides significant symptomatic benefit for patients with intermittent claudication (IC), it remains an underutilized tool. Widespread implementation of SET is restricted by lack of facilities and funding.

This is the second update of a review first published in 2006.</P></ABS_BACKGROUND><ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-02-02 09:43:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The primary objective was to provide an accurate overview of studies evaluating effects of SET programs, HBET programs, and WA on maximal treadmill walking distance or time (MWD/T) for patients with IC. Secondary objectives were to evaluate effects of SET, HBET, and WA on pain-free treadmill walking distance or time (PFWD/T), quality of life, and self-reported functional impairment.</P></ABS_OBJECTIVES><ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2018-03-20 08:33:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (December 16, 2016) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, Issue 11). We searched the reference lists of relevant studies identified through searches for other potential trials. We applied no restriction on language of publication.</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-02-02 09:43:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included parallel-group randomized controlled trials comparing SET programs with HBET programs and WA in participants with IC. We excluded studies in which control groups did not receive exercise or walking advice (maintained normal physical activity). We also excluded studies comparing exercise with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, bypass surgery, or drug therapy.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2018-03-29 19:03:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Three review authors (DH, HF, and LG) independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed trials for risk of bias. Two other review authors (MvdH and JT) confirmed the suitability and methodological quality of trials. For all continuous outcomes, we extracted the number of participants, mean outcome, and standard deviation for each treatment group through the follow-up period, if available. We extracted Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 outcomes to assess quality of life, and Walking Impairment Questionnaire outcomes to assess self-reported functional impairment. As investigators used different scales to present results of walking distance and time, we standardized reported data to effect sizes to enable calculation of an overall standardized mean difference (SMD). We obtained summary estimates for all outcome measures using a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-04-02 14:06:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>For this update, we included seven additional studies, making a total of 21 included studies, which involved a total of 1400 participants: 635 received SET, 320 received HBET, and 445 received WA. In general, SET and HBET programs consisted of three exercise sessions per week. Follow-up ranged from six weeks to two years. Most trials used a treadmill walking test to investigate effects of exercise therapy on walking capacity. However, two trials assessed only quality of life, functional impairment, and/or walking behavior (i.e., daily steps measured by pedometer). The overall methodological quality of included trials was moderate to good. However, some trials were small with respect to numbers of participants, ranging from 20 to 304.</P><P>SET groups showed clear improvement in MWD/T compared with HBET and WA groups, with overall SMDs at three months of 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12 to 0.62; P = 0.004; moderate-quality evidence) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.07; P &lt; 0.00001; high-quality evidence), respectively. This translates to differences in increased MWD of approximately 120 and 210 meters in favor of SET groups. Data show improvements for up to six and 12 months, respectively. The HBET group did not show improvement in MWD/T compared with the WA group (SMD 0.30, 95% CI -0.45 to 1.05; P = 0.43; moderate-quality evidence).</P><P>Compared with HBET, SET was more beneficial for PFWD/T but had no effect on quality of life parameters nor on self-reported functional impairment. Compared with WA, SET was more beneficial for PFWD/T and self-reported functional impairment, as well as for some quality of life parameters (e.g., physical functioning, pain, and physical component summary after 12 months), and HBET had no effect.</P><P>Data show no obvious effects on mortality rates. Thirteen of the 1400 participants died, but no deaths were related to exercise therapy. Overall, adherence to SET was approximately 80%, which was similar to that reported with HBET.

Although its clinical relevance has not been definitively demonstrated, this benefit translates to increased MWD of 120 and 210 meters after three months in SET groups. These increased walking distances are likely to have a positive impact on the lives of patients with IC. Data provide no clear evidence of a difference between HBET and WA. Trials show no clear differences in quality of life parameters nor in self-reported functional impairment between SET and HBET. However, evidence is of low and very low quality, respectively. Investigators detected some improvements in quality of life favoring SET over WA, but analyses were limited by small numbers of studies and participants. Future studies should focus on disease-specific quality of life and other functional outcomes, such as walking behavior and physical activity, as well as on long-term follow-up.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-04-02 23:42:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-04-02 14:46:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:43:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a chronic arterial occlusive disease caused by progressive atherosclerosis. Several arterial segments can be affected, such as the aorta and iliac, femoral, popliteal, and lower leg arteries. The incidence of PAD increases progressively with age, in particular after age 40. The prevalence of PAD, defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI; the ratio of blood pressure in the lower legs to blood pressure in the arms) &lt; 0.90 in either leg, is 0.9% between the ages of 40 and 49, 2.5% between the ages of 50 and 59, 4.7% between the ages of 60 and 69, and 14.5% in those 70 years of age and older (<LINK REF="REF-Selvin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selvin 2004</LINK>). In 2010, 202 million people worldwide were coping with PAD (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 2013</LINK>). During the preceding decade, the number of affected individuals increased by 13% in high-income countries and by 29% in low-income or middle-income countries. These huge numbers illustrate that PAD has become a global health problem affecting vast numbers of individuals. Risk factors for the development of lower limb PAD are similar to those for coronary artery disease and include smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia (<LINK REF="REF-Gerhard_x002d_Herman-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerhard-Herman 2017</LINK>).</P><P>PAD presentation comprises a spectrum ranging from asymptomatic disease to intermittent claudication (IC), critical limb ischemia (CLI), and finally limb loss. The most common symptom is IC, defined as a cramping leg pain that occurs during walking and is relieved by a short period of rest. Because of this condition, patients have diminished maximal and pain-free walking capacity. IC restricts activity and mobility and considerably reduces health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Dumville-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumville 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDermott-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDermott 2001</LINK>). In addition, IC is closely associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality owing to the ongoing generalized atherosclerotic process. Patients with IC have a five-year all-cause mortality rate of 10% to 15%, and a 20% chance of a non-fatal cardiovascular event (<LINK REF="REF-Gerhard_x002d_Herman-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerhard-Herman 2017</LINK>). When IC progresses to CLI, an even higher mortality rate of 25% after one year has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Conte-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conte 2015</LINK>).</P><P>The primary treatment goal in patients with IC is to improve ambulatory function and quality of life. Traditionally, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of therapeutic interventions have used treadmill walking performance as an objective measure reflecting patients&#8217; functional limitations. The graded treadmill test has a large dynamic range that can reproducibly define an individual&#8217;s PAD-limited maximal and pain-free walking capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Brass-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brass 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gardner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labs-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labs 1999</LINK>). Maximal walking distance or time represents a physiological peak performance based on the patient&#8217;s limb pathophysiology. When used as a primary endpoint, maximal walking capacity assessed by a graded treadmill test is sensitive to change with a variety of interventions.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-04-01 19:48:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Because of serious health risks, all patients with IC should receive multi-component therapy consisting of cardiovascular risk modification, lifestyle coaching, and symptomatic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Conte-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conte 2015</LINK>). Symptomatic treatment options for IC include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), bypass surgery, and drug therapy. However, current evidence supports exercise therapy as the primary treatment for improvement of walking capacity and health-related quality of life in patients with IC (<LINK REF="REF-Aboyans-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboyans 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conte-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conte 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerhard_x002d_Herman-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerhard-Herman 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Layden-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Layden 2012</LINK>). Erb first suggested this effective treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Erb-1898" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erb 1898</LINK>). In 1966, the first RCT of exercise therapy for patients with IC demonstrated obvious improvement in treadmill walking ability (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1966</LINK>). In a Cochrane systematic review of RCTs, Leng and later, in the updated version, Lane described significantly improved maximal walking time: mean difference 4.51 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.11 to 5.92) with overall improvement in walking ability of approximately 50% to 200% associated with exercise compared with usual care or placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Leng-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lane-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2014</LINK>). However, the exercise programs included in this meta-analysis varied widely, ranging from physician-recommended unsupervised walking in the community to formal supervised exercise programs involving walking on a treadmill.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-04-01 19:08:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Exercise therapy provides significant symptomatic benefit for patients with IC. However, the exact mechanisms for this improvement remain unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Beckitt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beckitt 2012</LINK>). Mechanisms of response to exercise therapy have been reviewed previously and include improvement in walking efficiency, induction of vascular angiogenesis, reduced inflammatory activation, increased exercise pain tolerance, reduced endothelial and mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic adaptations within skeletal muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Conte-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conte 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gustafsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gustafsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamburg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamburg 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zwierska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zwierska 2005</LINK>). Further benefits of exercise therapy include reduction in cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, exercise is implemented in secondary prevention therapies for patients with coronary artery disease (<LINK REF="REF-Piepoli-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepoli 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2011</LINK>). Given its clear benefits, the importance of exercise therapy is highlighted in contemporary international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Aboyans-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboyans 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conte-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conte 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerhard_x002d_Herman-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerhard-Herman 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Layden-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Layden 2012</LINK>). Exercise programs are usually regular commitments that are run twice or three times per week for a minimum of 30 minutes per session, lasting from six weeks to a year. In daily practice, lack of specific individual guidance and absence of uniform supervision appear to be important barriers to initiation and continuation of exercise therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bartelink-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartelink 2004</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-04-02 14:46:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Before the original version of this review was released in 2006, prescribed exercise therapy consisted mostly of &#8220;go home and walk&#8221; advice (walking advice [WA]) received from the physician (e.g., general practitioner, vascular surgeon), sometimes accompanied by a brochure (<LINK REF="REF-Bendermacher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bendermacher 2006</LINK>). After this review was published, more studies compared supervised exercise therapy (SET) with non-supervised exercise therapy. Although SET programs proved more effective in increasing maximal and pain-free walking distance or time compared with non-supervised exercise programs, they remain an underutilized tool. In 2012, an international survey found that only 30% of vascular surgeons had access to SET programs, and members of this group showed significant heterogeneity in the way they implemented these programs (<LINK REF="REF-Makris-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makris 2012</LINK>). Widespread implementation of SET is restricted by the combination of an insufficient number of available facilities and issues of reimbursement, awareness, and motivation (<LINK REF="REF-Conte-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conte 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fokkenrood-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkenrood 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lauret-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauret 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makris-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makris 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2008</LINK>). To overcome some of these problems in the Netherlands, a community-based network for SET was implemented (<LINK REF="REF-Lauret-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauret 2012</LINK>). Community-based SET solves the problems of transportation time and costs for individual patients, as well as the restricted capacity of hospital-based SET (<LINK REF="REF-Bendermacher-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bendermacher 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kruidenier-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruidenier 2009</LINK>). Others have suggested that exercise programs should be initiated in a home-based environment, thereby diminishing the scope of labor-intensive supervision (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Regensteiner-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Regensteiner 1997</LINK>). Structured home-based exercise therapy (HBET) with an observation component (e.g., exercise logbooks, pedometers) and specific walking advice may provide an effective alternative, especially when facilities and funding for SET programs are not available (<LINK REF="REF-Makris-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makris 2012</LINK>).</P><P>Several reviews have assessed the value of different conservative treatment options in IC (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Jundi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Jundi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Back-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Back 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fakhry-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fakhry 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gommans-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gommans 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lane-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makris-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makris 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vemulapalli-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vemulapalli 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wind-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wind 2007</LINK>). However, to date, few meta-analyses have compared SET with HBET and WA. Previous versions of this Cochrane review (search last run September 2012) compared SET with non-supervised exercise therapy that involved both WA and HBET programs (<LINK REF="REF-Bendermacher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bendermacher 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fokkenrood-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkenrood 2013</LINK>). Although these different approaches are likely to vary somewhat in terms of clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Jundi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Jundi 2013</LINK>), no direct comparisons between HBET and WA were made. For this update, we reviewed effects of these unsupervised exercise interventions separately. With disregard for all financial and organizational aspects, we believe it is important to provide an accurate systematic review of effects of SET programs in relation to non-supervised exercise programs on walking distance or time, quality of life, and functional impairment for patients with IC.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-04-02 14:24:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The primary objective was to provide an accurate overview of studies evaluating effects of SET programs, HBET programs, and WA on maximal treadmill walking distance or time (MWD/T) for patients with IC.

In this circumstance, we used weighted means to standardize reported means and standard deviations (SDs) to a uniform scale before they could be combined.

To interpret the clinical relevance and impact of the intervention effect on walking capacity, we re-expressed the pooled effect in meters. For this purpose, we multiplied the overall SMD by the SD for meters. We obtained this SD as the pooled SD in all studies that presented the results of walking capacity on the meter scale. If outcome measurements in all studies were based on the same scale (quality of life and functional impairment), we calculated an overall difference in means (mean difference [MD]).

Clear differences in improvement in maximal treadmill walking distance or time (MWD/T) consistently favored supervised exercise therapy (SET) compared with home-based exercise therapy (HBET) and walking advice (WA). Data show no clear differences between HBET and WA. Heterogeneity was present in the SET versus WA analysis at three and 12 months, as well as in the HBET versus WA analysis at three months. This heterogeneity is likely a result of individual study effects (<LINK REF="STD-Cheetham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheetham 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gardner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mays-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mays 2015</LINK>). Indeed, removing these trials from the analyses resulted in absence of statistical heterogeneity and continued differences in MWD/T favoring SET.</P><P>In addition to chance alone, several factors may have contributed to observed heterogeneity in SET versus WA analyses. First, in <LINK REF="STD-Gardner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 2011</LINK>, participants in the SET group more often were female and more often had diabetes mellitus compared with those in other trials. Women with intermittent claudication (IC) and diabetes mellitus represent a vulnerable subgroup of patients who respond poorly to a program of exercise rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Gardner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 2011</LINK>). This provides a possible explanation for smaller improvements reported with SET compared with WA at three months. Second, in <LINK REF="STD-Cheetham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheetham 2004</LINK>, participants in the SET group were five years younger than those in the WA group. This could have resulted in greater differences between SET and WA at 12 months.</P><P>Furthermore, several factors in <LINK REF="STD-Mays-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mays 2015</LINK> may have contributed to outlying positive results of HBET compared with WA at three months. First, some participants had undergone percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) before baseline testing. However, data show no significant interaction between response and subgroups of participants (those with PTA vs those without PTA). Second, participants in the HBET group received in-hospital exercise therapy on a treadmill for the first two weeks, thereby increasing the intensity of supervision compared with that provided in other trials. Third, this trial used data at 14 weeks' follow-up in the three-month analysis, whereas other trials used data at 12 weeks' follow-up.</P><P>Reported data on MWD/T were standardized to allow calculation of the difference in increase between the three treatment groups. When standardized data were translated back to walking distances, summary estimates of MWD/T showed differences in increases of approximately 120 and 210 meters favoring SET over HBET and WA at three months, respectively. To put these increases in context, a US football field is roughly 90 meters (or 100 yards) long. These differences were maintained after six months in the SET versus HBET analysis, and after 12 months in the SET versus WA analysis.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING><P>In line with MWD/T, pain-free treadmill walking distance or time (PFWD/T) showed a greater increase with SET than with HBET and WA, with differences in increases of approximately 120 and 140 meters favoring SET over HBET and WA at three months, respectively. These differences were maintained after six months in the SET versus HBET analysis, and after 12 months in the SET versus WA analysis. Again, data show no clear differences between HBET and WA. However, substantial heterogeneity was evident in the HBET versus WA analysis at three months. Sensitivity analysis performed by removing each study one at a time did not significantly change the results. We have failed to identify a plausible explanation for this inconsistency.</P><P>At three and six months, quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form [SF] 36]) outcomes were not different between SET programs and non-supervised exercise programs. However, physical functioning, pain, and physical component summary after 12 months showed clear improvement with SET compared with WA. Although most other subscales suggested possible benefit of SET, these changes were not clear. This may be explained by an underpowered analysis. Moreover, quality of life analyses between HBET and WA were limited by the small number of included studies. Overall, we obtained complete SF-36 data from four studies (n = 364) at three months' follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Guidon-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Guidon 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicolai-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolai 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Savage 2001</LINK>), from five studies (n = 455) at six months' follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kakkos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kakkos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicolai-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolai 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Savage 2001</LINK>), and from three studies (n = 295) at 12 months' follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Guidon-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Guidon 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kakkos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kakkos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicolai-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolai 2010</LINK>). Four other studies also recorded SF-36 outcomes, but we were not able to obtain the raw data (<LINK REF="STD-Cheetham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheetham 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gardner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gardner-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mays-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mays 2015</LINK>). This could have led to potential reporting bias. Furthermore, a paucity of disease-specific participant-reported outcomes prevented meta-analysis of disease-specific quality of life. Thus, caution is recommended in interpreting these findings.</P><P>Self-reported functional impairment (Walking Impairment Questionnaire [WIQ]) outcomes were increased by SET compared with WA. At six and 12 months, two domains as well as combined scores showed clear improvement with SET, and the other domain suggested possible benefit. However, data show no clear differences in SET versus HBET and HBET versus WA analyses. In line with the SF-36 analyses, some of the WIQ analyses may be underpowered, in particular those between SET and HBET.</P><P>Data show no obvious effects on mortality rates. Thirteen of the 1400 participants died, but no deaths were related to exercise therapy. Overall, adherence to SET was approximately 80%, which was similar to that reported with HBET.

On the basis of trial results, nothing can be suggested about the influence of methods used for measuring adherence on effects of exercise therapy.</P></SUBSECTION></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-04-02 15:35:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING><P>Both inclusion and exclusion criteria were variable across studies. As most people with IC are elderly, comorbidities are common. However, investigators excluded many patients with pre-existing medical conditions because exercise was deemed not practical or safe. Perceived uncertainties regarding safety may also contribute to underuse of SET in daily practice. However, the <LINK REF="REF-Gommans-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gommans 2015</LINK> review reported an exceedingly low all-cause complication rate (only eight adverse events per 82,725 patient-hours of SET).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING><P>All trials were performed in a hospital-based setting, except for one trial that was performed in a community-based setting (<LINK REF="STD-Nicolai-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolai 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Kruidenier-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruidenier 2009</LINK> concluded that community-based SET was as effective as SET provided through a hospital-based approach, so it seems unlikely that this potential factor of heterogeneity limits the applicability of trial results. In four trials, walking training was complemented with exercises for lower limb strengthening or cardiovascular training (<LINK REF="STD-Cheetham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheetham 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guidon-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Guidon 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parr-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Parr 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1997</LINK>), and in another, SET included calf muscle exercises without walking (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2008</LINK>). Data provide no indications that these SET sessions were less stringent than those provided in other trials. In a Cochrane review, <LINK REF="REF-Lauret-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauret 2014</LINK> compared the effectiveness of different modes of exercise therapy. Review authors concluded that data provide no clear evidence of differences between supervised walking exercise and alternative exercise modes in improving MWD and PFWD. However, the sample sizes of included studies were very small. Thus, more research is needed to allow meaningful comparisons. Seven trials had a partially supervised follow-up period (<LINK REF="STD-Cheetham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cheetham 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guidon-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Guidon 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kakkos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kakkos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Savage-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Savage 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treat_x002d_Jacobson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Treat-Jacobson 2009</LINK>). When sensitivity analyses were performed by removing these trials, differences in MWD/T favoring SET were unchanged. This suggests that SET with a partially supervised follow-up period has a prolonged positive effect on walking capacity and could be as effective as SET with a fully supervised follow-up period.</P><P>HBET programs were considerably heterogeneous, ranging from specific walking advice and use of exercise logbooks to programs combining psychological interventions and behavior change techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Jundi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Jundi 2013</LINK>). However, in many cases, intervention components were poorly described and unjustified. The aggregated sample size of the HBET group was considerably smaller than that of the other two treatment groups. These facts may have contributed to an indistinct effect assessment and may also explain the absence of a difference between HBET and WA groups.</P><P>WA varied from simple walking advice to a more specific exercise prescription. However, no supervision or monitoring was provided.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures</HEADING><P>All trials used a treadmill walking test to investigate the effectiveness of exercise therapy, except for two trials that did not assess walking capacity (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guidon-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Guidon 2013</LINK>). For over 30 years, MWD/T performed on a graded treadmill test has been the "gold standard" for estimating the walking capacity of patients with IC. The treadmill test has a sound physiological basis, has received broad acceptance in clinical practice, and has well-established test characteristics and the ability to safely and robustly quantify changes associated with efficacious interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Hiatt-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiatt 2014</LINK>). Nonetheless, treadmill testing may be problematic in clinical trials that compare SET with non-supervised exercise therapy, as participants in the SET group will be more familiar with treadmill walking, possibly leading to a disproportionate apparent benefit. Moreover, single MWD/T assessment may not properly reflect walking impairment in patients with IC because substantial variability has been noted between parameters (<LINK REF="REF-Fokkenrood-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkenrood 2015a</LINK>). In contrast, evidence on patients with IC demonstrates that walking performance measured by the six-minute walk test (6MWT) may better represent daily physical functioning and quality of life, and may better predict risk for mortality and mobility loss (<LINK REF="REF-McDermott-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDermott 2014</LINK>). However, a major limitation of the 6MWT is that it is limited to a relatively short duration, which induces a ceiling effect, potentially leading to underestimation of walking capacity in patients with IC with mild to moderate limitations. Unfortunately, included studies rarely reported 6MWT results, preventing meta-analysis. Community-based global positioning system (GPS) measurement has been recently proposed as a potentially innovative way to assess outdoor walking distance and speed in patients with IC, opening new perspectives in the study of walking capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Le-Faucheur-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Faucheur 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Le-Faucheur-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Faucheur 2015</LINK>). Future studies should compare the graded treadmill test, 6MWT, and community-based GPS procedure to determine the best functional outcome measure in peripheral artery disease (PAD).</P><P>The discrepancy between quality of life and walking distances may be due to lack of disease-specific quality of life assessment in most studies (<LINK REF="REF-Vemulapalli-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vemulapalli 2015</LINK>). Generic quality of life tools, such as the SF-36 and EuroQol, typically do not address the emotional and psychosocial impact of disease-specific physical limitations, and thus may not adequately assess therapy-related improvements in quality of life. Conversely, validated disease-specific tools, such as the Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire, Peripheral Artery Questionnaire, and Peripheral Artery Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire, address not only limitations in walking capacity and activities of daily living, but also the emotional and psychosocial impact of these limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spertus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spertus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Treat_x002d_Jacobson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treat-Jacobson 2012</LINK>). Therefore, both generic and disease-specific quality of life questionnaires are recommended as endpoints for future studies.</P><P>Additionally, functional impairment questionnaires, such as the WIQ, provide data about patient-perceived walking performance. It is interesting to note that lower baseline WIQ stair-climbing scores and greater declines in WIQ stair-climbing, distance, and speed scores were associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with PAD (<LINK REF="REF-Jain-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jain-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 2013</LINK>). Furthermore, previous work demonstrated that self-reported outdoor walking speed is likely to be strongly associated with overall health and mortality risk (<LINK REF="REF-McDermott-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDermott 2016</LINK>). Thus, poor WIQ scores may identify a subset of patients with poorer overall cardiovascular status and greater mortality risk. Consequently, interventions that improve WIQ scores, such as SET programs, may reduce mortality in people with PAD. Further study is needed to determine whether SET programs are associated with survival benefit.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Applicability</HEADING><P>To determine the clinical relevance of the ability to walk 120 and 210 meters farther than HBET and WA groups, respectively, one should realize that the mean MWD at baseline is 290 meters with an even shorter mean PFWD of 140 meters. Hence, this improvement is likely to help with independence. In addition to improving walking ability, exercise therapy is effective in preventing cardiovascular events, and this can fulfill an important role in cardiovascular risk management for patients with IC (<LINK REF="REF-Horton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2002</LINK>). Results of our review reveal improved treadmill walking performance in favor of SET. However, treadmill walking is an artificial form of walking that does not necessarily correspond to walking ability in daily life (<LINK REF="REF-Gommans-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gommans 2016</LINK>). A recent study demonstrated that patients who are able to walk farther will not always use this capacity to walk more often, longer, or with greater intensity (<LINK REF="REF-Fokkenrood-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkenrood 2015b</LINK>). This finding suggests that solely focusing on improvement in walking capacity has limited value in optimizing SET treatment efficacy. Future research should therefore focus on optimization of SET programs other than for increasing walking capacity alone. In line with growing interest in potential associations between sedentary activity and its impact on cardiovascular risk reduction and mortality, walking behavior and physical activity measured by accelerometer may be incorporated as outcome parameters in future studies comparing different treatment modalities for PAD.</P></SUBSECTION></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-03-26 16:50:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The overall methodological quality of included trials was moderate to good.

However, the previous review of 2013 suggested that publication bias was not a matter of importance (<LINK REF="REF-Fokkenrood-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkenrood 2013</LINK>).</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-04-02 23:42:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Our findings are in line with those reported in previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Bendermacher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bendermacher 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fokkenrood-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkenrood 2013</LINK>), as well as with findings of several other systematic reviews. <LINK REF="REF-Lane-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2014</LINK> suggested that exercise therapy should play an important part in the care of selected patients with IC, to improve walking times and distances. Effects were demonstrated following three months of SET, although some programs lasted longer than one year. <LINK REF="REF-Wind-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wind 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Vemulapalli-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vemulapalli 2015</LINK> concluded that SET was more effective than non-supervised exercise therapy in improving MWD and PFWD for patients with IC. However, data show no differences in generic quality of life (SF-36) nor in self-reported functional impairment (WIQ) (<LINK REF="REF-Vemulapalli-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vemulapalli 2015</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Fakhry-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fakhry 2012</LINK> compared SET with non-interventional observation to identify the most important exercise components resulting in an optimal training protocol. SET was effective in improving MWD and PFWD for patients with IC. However, none of the predefined exercise components including intensity, duration, or content of the program were independently associated with significant improvements in MWD or PFWD.</P><P>Several other systematic reviews have investigated effects of structured HBET programs in patients with IC (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Jundi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Jundi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Back-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Back 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makris-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makris 2012</LINK>). Based on low quality of evidence, these reviews concluded that HBET programs may improve MWD/T, PFWD/T, and quality of life when compared with baseline, or in comparison with usual care/observation control. However, improvements attained with HBET programs may be inferior to those evoked by SET.</P><P>The <LINK REF="REF-Gommans-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gommans 2014</LINK> meta-analysis studied the effect of supervision on walking capacity in patients with IC by categorizing RCTs according to type of support: no exercise, WA, HBET, and SET. The intensity of supervision was directly related to improved MWD and PFWD. SET was superior to other conservative treatment regimens with respect to improvement in walking distance at all follow-up times. However, the difference between HBET and SET at six months' follow-up was not significant.</P><P>Several plausible mechanisms might explain the beneficial results of SET over non-supervised exercise programs. The workload for treadmill walking as performed during SET is generally greater than the workload for level ground walking at "normal" pace as performed during non-supervised exercise therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Degischer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Degischer 2002</LINK>). Although it is very difficult to objectify the intensity of training, it is generally assumed that home training cannot be considered to be performed with the same energy expenditure as required for training under supervision (<LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1975</LINK>). A higher workload will lead to a larger positive effect on the general physical condition of the patient, possibly as a result of increased cardiovascular stress, providing a better stimulus for exercise-induced adaptations (<LINK REF="REF-Hamburg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamburg 2011</LINK>). Furthermore, direct supervision offers additional encouragement and motivation to patients, possibly resulting in a higher adherence rate, which can be explained in part by the Hawthorne effect, as mentioned by <LINK REF="REF-Wind-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wind 2007</LINK>. The Hawthorne effect describes the fact that awareness of being under observation can alter the way a patient behaves, or can positively influence the outcome. In this review, adherence to SET was similar to that reported with HBET. However, adherence in the supervised setting is effortlessly measurable during the session in contrast to adherence in the home setting.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-04-01 21:24:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-04-01 21:24:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Evidence of moderate and high quality shows that SET provides an important benefit for treadmill-measured walking distance (MWD and PFWD) compared with HBET and WA, respectively. Although its clinical relevance has not been definitively demonstrated, this benefit translates to increased MWD of 120 and 210 meters after three months in SET groups. These increased walking distances are likely to have a positive impact on the lives of patients with IC. Data provide no clear evidence of a difference between HBET and WA. Trials show no clear differences in quality of life parameters nor in self-reported functional impairment between SET and HBET. However, evidence is of low and very low quality, respectively. Investigators detected some improvements in quality of life favoring SET over WA, but analyses were limited by small numbers of studies and participants.</P><P>Our results are consistent with international guidelines recommending SET as first-line treatment for patients with IC (<LINK REF="REF-Aboyans-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboyans 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conte-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conte 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerhard_x002d_Herman-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerhard-Herman 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Layden-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Layden 2012</LINK>). Nevertheless, most patients with IC do not participate in SET. Availability of SET programs varies widely throughout the world. Moreover, medical insurance typically does not pay for SET services. Recently, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services in the USA determined that evidence is sufficient to cover SET for beneficiaries with IC for treatment of symptomatic PAD (<LINK REF="REF-CMS-Decision-Memo-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">CMS Decision Memo 2017</LINK>). Professionals in the vascular field are obliged to make SET available for all patients with IC.<BR/></P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-26 10:10:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Robust evidence shows effects of exercise therapy on walking capacity parameters in IC. However, studies assessing the impact of exercise programs on walking behavior, physical activity, and costs, as well as their long-term effects on cardiovascular risk factors, morbidity, and mortality, are lacking. Future studies should focus on disease-specific quality of life and patient expectations and satisfaction. Furthermore, research is needed to explore ways to optimize exercise program components (e.g., frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise sessions; different modes of exercise therapy; endurance training vs interval training; implementation of lifestyle interventions). Future research should include a variety of functional outcome measures (i.e., treadmill test, 6MWT, GPS tracking, WIQ, generic and disease-specific quality of life), as well as people who have comorbidities, as these are more representative of the PAD population.</P><P>An SET program appears to be the preferred treatment option, and ongoing program modifications could lead to a more viable exercise schedule for patients with IC. Future research should focus on identifying an optimal mixture of SET and HBET programs. It is interesting to note that monitoring options could be extended by incorporating eHealth and mHealth technologies (<LINK REF="REF-Fokkenrood-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fokkenrood 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makris-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makris 2012</LINK>). Modern smartphones contain GPS functions, are widely used, and often are carried throughout the day. A dedicated application on a smartphone may be a valid alternative for measuring walking behavior over prolonged periods. Such technologies may improve adherence and consequently treatment effectiveness.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-03-26 15:58:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We acknowledge the support provided by Dr. Marlene Stewart, Managing Editor of Cochrane Vascular; Dr. Cathryn Broderick, Assistant Managing Editor of Cochrane Vascular; and Dr. Karen Welch, Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist, in updating this review.</P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2018-02-02 10:03:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>David Hageman: none known.<BR/>Hugo JP Fokkenrood: none known.<BR/>Lindy NM Gommans: none known.<BR/>Marijn ML van den Houten: none known.<BR/>Joep AW Teijink: none known.</P></CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST><CONTRIBUTIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-02 10:03:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>David Hageman: selected trials, assessed trial quality, extracted data, performed data analysis, and wrote the text of this update.<BR/>Hugo JP Fokkenrood: selected trials, assessed trial quality, extracted data, and revised the text.<BR/>Lindy NM Gommans: selected trials, assessed trial quality, extracted data, and revised the text.<BR/>Marijn ML van den Houten: confirmed the suitability and quality of trials and revised the text.<BR/>Joep AW Teijink: confirmed the suitability and quality of trials and revised the text.</P></CONTRIBUTIONS><PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2018-04-02 15:46:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The protocol of this review can be obtained from <LINK REF="REF-Bendermacher-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bendermacher 2005</LINK>.</P><P>We assessed the methodological quality of trials using the risk of bias method provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and we completed "Risk of bias" tables.
