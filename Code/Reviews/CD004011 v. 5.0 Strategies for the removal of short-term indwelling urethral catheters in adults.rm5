<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Strategies for removing catheters used in the short term to drain urine from the bladder in hospitalised patients</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Patients in hospital with a brief severe illness or following surgery may have a tube placed into the passage from the bladder (an in-dwelling urethral catheter). Potential complications are infection, tissue damage and patient discomfort. This review identified 26 controlled trials looking at the best strategies for removal of catheters. In 11 studies comparing late night versus early morning removal, removal at midnight resulted in a longer time to first void and patients passing significantly larger volumes, although these findings varied widely. There was no apparent effect on the number of patients who required recatheterisation because of subsequent urinary retention, but patients with catheters removed at midnight were discharged from hospital significantly earlier than those with morning removal. Based on findings from 13 trials, limiting how long a catheter was left in place was linked<B> </B>to a shorter stay in hospital and less risk of infection. The information available from three trials was too limited to assess whether clamping prior to removal, to simulate normal filling of the bladder, improved outcomes. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Approximately 15% to 25% of all hospitalised patients have indwelling urethral catheters, mainly to assist clinicians to accurately monitor urine output during acute illness or following surgery, to treat urinary retention, and for investigative purposes. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to determine the best strategies for the removal of catheters from patients with a short-term indwelling urethral catheter. The main outcome of interest was the number of patients who required recatheterisation following removal of indwelling urethral catheter.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 7 December 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to 12 July 2006), EMBASE (January 1980 to 12 July 2006), CINAHL (January 1982 to 12 July 2006), Nursing Collection (January 1995 to January 2002) and reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings were searched. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. No language or other restrictions were applied.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of alternative strategies for removal of short-term indwelling urethral catheters on patient outcomes were considered for inclusion in the review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Eligibility of the trials for inclusion in the review, details of eligible trials and the methodological quality of the trials were assessed independently by two reviewers. Relative risks (RR) for dichotomous data and a weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where synthesis was inappropriate, trials were considered separately. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty six trials involving a total of 2933 participants were included in the review. One trial included three treatment groups. </P>
<P>In 11 RCTs amongst 1389 people, there was no significant difference in need for recatheterisation, although recatheterisation after removal at night was more likely to be during working hours. Pooled results demonstrated that, following urological surgery and procedures, patients whose indwelling urethral catheters were removed at midnight passed significantly larger volumes at their first void (Difference (fixed) 96 ml; 95% CI 62 to 130). Similar findings were reported for patients following TURP (Difference (fixed) 27; 95% CI 23 to 31). Removal at midnight was also associated with longer time to first void, and shorter lengths of hospitalisation (relative risk of not going home on day of removal = 0.71, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.79). </P>
<P>Results in 13 trials amongst 1422 participants having early rather than delayed catheter removal were consistent with a higher risk of voiding problems and a lower risk of infection, with shorter hospitalisation. </P>
<P>In three trials involving 234 participants the data were too few to assess differential effects of catheter clamping compared with free drainage prior to withdrawal. No eligible trials compared flexible with fixed duration of catheterisation, or assessed prophylactic alpha sympathetic blocker drugs prior to catheter removal.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a benefit from midnight removal of the indwelling urethral catheter. There are resource implications but the magnitude of these is not clear from the trials. The evidence also suggests shorter hospital stay after early rather than delayed catheter removal but the effects on other outcomes are unclear. There is little evidence on which to judge other aspects of management, such as catheter clamping.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Approximately 15% to 25% of all patients admitted to hospital are catheterised to monitor urine output during acute illness or following surgery, or to treat urinary retention, or for investigative purposes (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 2000</LINK>). Short-term use of an indwelling urethral catheter is a safe and effective strategy in the maintenance of bladder and renal health and judicious use contributes to improved outcomes. However, insertion of an indwelling urethral catheter is not without the risk of complications. Catheter associated bacteriuria is common and increases by 5 to 8% each day during the period of catheterisation (<LINK REF="REF-Getliffe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Getliffe 1996</LINK>). Other complications include structural damage to the urinary tract, bleeding, creating a false passage, and patient discomfort (<LINK REF="STD-Crowe-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Crowe 1994</LINK>). Retention of urine has also been reported as a common problem following the removal of indwelling urethral catheters (<LINK REF="STD-Crowe-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Crowe 1994</LINK>). This is associated with a risk of over distension and permanent detrusor muscle damage (<LINK REF="REF-Rosseland-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosseland 2002</LINK>) which can occur from 7 to 48 hours after removal (<LINK REF="STD-Wyman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wyman 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>While there is extensive literature on the type, maintenance, and techniques for insertion of urinary catheters, limited attention has been given to the policies and procedures for their removal. Although the insertion, removal and management of the catheter is usually undertaken by nurses, decisions about the removal of the catheter often remain with the medical practitioner. While the importance of short-term urethral catheter management is recognised, there is no consensus among clinicians about the optimal time and the method for removal of indwelling urethral catheters. Policies are likely to be based on personal preference and established practices (<LINK REF="STD-Irani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Irani 1995</LINK>) rather than on research evidence. While clinicians have established policies, there has been no objective and systematic examination of the effect of the time of day the catheter is removed, the length of time the catheter is left in place, or if clamping the catheter prior to removal influences patient outcomes.</P>
<P>One argument for removal of the catheter in the early morning (<LINK REF="REF-Blandy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blandy 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crowe-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Crowe 1994</LINK>) is that reduced staff at night might fail to respond to complications, such as urinary retention, that can develop following the removal of the catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Blandy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blandy 1989</LINK>). Other suggested benefits of removal of the catheter in the early morning include allowing the patient to rest through the night, and then to adjust back to their normal voiding pattern during the day (<LINK REF="STD-Crowe-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Crowe 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>The justification for removal of the catheters at midnight is that people tend to void on waking in the morning (<LINK REF="STD-Chillington-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chillington 1992</LINK>). Therefore removal of indwelling urethral catheters at midnight enables urinary retention and other complications to be detected early in the day and treated during working hours when there is access to resources and services (<LINK REF="STD-Chillington-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chillington 1992</LINK>). Researchers have also reported that patients whose catheters were removed in the night had larger volumes at first void compared to other people whose catheters were removed in the morning (<LINK REF="STD-Chillington-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chillington 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noble-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Noble 1990</LINK>). It has been suggested that the timing of catheter removal may affect a patient's length of stay in hospital with consequent resource implications. In one study it was found that removal of catheters at midnight resulted in patients being discharged a mean of 0.7 days earlier than patients whose catheters were removed in the morning (<LINK REF="STD-Chillington-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chillington 1992</LINK>) thus resulting in economic benefits related to shorter length of hospitalisation and efficient discharge planning.</P>
<P>There is also debate about whether flexible policies are better than relatively fixed policies for catheter removal (<LINK REF="STD-Wyman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wyman 1987</LINK>). Practice is known to vary. For example, local clinical audits for catheter removal have indicated that 49% of catheters are removed either at the discretion of the nurse or at the time of the medical rounds, and only 34% were removed at midnight (<LINK REF="STD-Watt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Watt 1998</LINK>). Of those indwelling urethral catheters that were scheduled for removal in the morning, only 70% were removed on time (<LINK REF="STD-Noble-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Noble 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Watt 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Practice also varies with respect to the length of time the catheter is left in situ and the procedure for its removal. Factors influencing these decisions include clinician preference, patient tolerance and the reasons for the insertion of the catheter. Historically, the removal of indwelling urethral catheters has occurred 24 to 72 hours following vaginal surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Guzman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Guzman 1994</LINK>), 3 to 5 days following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) (<LINK REF="STD-Mamo-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mamo 1991</LINK>), 12 to 14 days following perineal prostatectomy, and 10 days following abdominoperineal resection (APR) (<LINK REF="STD-Oberst-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Oberst 1981</LINK>). Timing may affect length of hospital stay. For example, in paediatric patients undergoing ureteroneocystostomy, removal of the indwelling urethral catheter within 24 hours following surgery resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the length of hospital stay when compared to removal of the indwelling urethral catheter after 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez 1998</LINK>). Recent literature advocates early removal of the catheters, particularly after TURP. Too early removal after radical prostatectomy may, however, lead to complications such as haematuria leading to clot formation and anastomotic urinary extravasation possibly resulting in urinoma formation and pelvic abscess (<LINK REF="REF-Little-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>Bladder dysfunction and postoperative voiding impairment have been documented following catheterisation and these can lead to infections of the urinary tract (<LINK REF="STD-Oberst-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Oberst 1981</LINK>). The intermittent clamping of the indwelling urethral catheter draining tube prior to withdrawal has been suggested on the basis that this simulates normal filling and emptying of the bladder (<LINK REF="REF-Roe-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roe 1990</LINK>). While clamping catheters might minimise postoperative neurogenic urinary dysfunction, it could also result in bladder infection or distension if the clamps are not released as scheduled (<LINK REF="REF-Roe-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roe 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another strategy practiced prior to removal of urethral catheters is the use of alpha adrenergic blocker drugs. It has been reported that alpha blockers are effective in the treatment of voiding dysfunction by enhancing detrusor contractility and lowering urethral resistance in patients with underactive bladder (<LINK REF="REF-Yamanishi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamanishi 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>To date, the literature relating to the policies for the removal of indwelling urethral catheters has not been evaluated in a manner that will enable clinicians to develop evidence-based policies for practice. This systematic review summarised the evidence from randomised controlled trials related to alternative approaches to the removal of short-term indwelling urethral catheters.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to determine the best strategies for the removal of catheters from patients with a short-term indwelling urethral catheter. </P>
<P>The following comparisons were made:<BR/>(1) removal of the catheter at one time of the day versus at another time (eg at 0600 to 0800 hours versus 2200 to 2400 hours);<BR/>(2) removal after a shorter duration of catheter use versus after a longer duration, as defined by trialists;<BR/>(3) removal after a flexible duration of catheter use versus after a fixed duration; <BR/>(4) removal of a catheter after a period of clamp and release versus removal of a free-draining catheter;<BR/>(5) removal of a catheter using prophylactic alpha adrenergic blocker drugs versus removal without drug treatment. </P>

<P>The references and abstracts identified from the search were independently assessed against the inclusion/exclusion criteria by two review authors and the full text obtained of potentially relevant reports. If the title and abstract were inconclusive full text were obtained for further assessment. Trials that had been reported in more than one publication were included only once. Decisions about study eligibility were reached by consensus.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the eligible randomised controlled trials was assessed independently by two review authors using the quality assessment tool as described in the Incontinence Group module (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 2002</LINK>). Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third person. Each study was critically appraised and the methodological quality was assessed using the following checklist: <BR/>(1) detailed description of inclusion and exclusion criteria used to obtain the sample;<BR/>(2) evidence of allocation concealment at randomisation;<BR/>(3) the validity of methods of outcome assessment;<BR/>(4) description of withdrawals and dropouts; <BR/>(5) the potential for bias in outcome assessment.<BR/> <BR/>Data extraction from the included trials was undertaken and summarised independently by two review authors using a data extraction tool that was developed for the review. The data extraction tool was piloted by three independent reviewers prior to use. Discrepancies between review authors were resolved by discussion. Data were collected relating to:<BR/>(a) patient demographics; <BR/>(b) patient inclusion/exclusion criteria; <BR/>(c) types (eg different shapes, lengths, sizes) of short-term indwelling catheters;<BR/>(d) types of operation categories; <BR/>(e) description of the interventions; <BR/>(f) description of the outcomes; <BR/>(g) prespecified outcomes (volume of the first void , time to first void, length of hospitalisation, incidence of urinary retention and recatheterisation, urinary tract infection, time of day recatheterised, urethral pain and discharge, secondary haemorrhage, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), epididymitis, recurrence of strictures cost effectiveness and patient satisfaction)<BR/>(h) follow-up period;<BR/>(i) the number and reasons for withdrawals and dropouts.<BR/>Attempts were made to obtain missing data by contacting the authors. </P>
<P>Included trial data were processed as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>The trials were assessed for clinical heterogeneity by considering the settings, populations, interventions and outcomes. Based on this, a decision was taken about whether or not it was appropriate to combine the data. As a general rule, a fixed effect model was used to combine data in meta-analyses. Consideration was given to using a random effects model if there was significant statistical heterogeneity (as judged by the chi square or I² test) that could not be explained by differences in the characteristics of included studies, or the data were not summarised. </P>
<P>Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous data. Analysis of continuous data was undertaken using the mean and standard deviation (SD) values to derive weighted mean differences (WMD) and their 95% CIs. Where actual P values obtained from t-tests were quoted, standard deviations were extracted by first obtaining the corresponding t-value from a table of the t-distribution (noting that the degrees of freedom are given by NE [sample size in the experimental group] plus NC [sample size in the control group] minus 2). The standard error of the difference in means was obtained by dividing the mean difference by the t-value. Using this data, a treatment effect estimate was calculated based upon the generic inverse variance (GIV). Due to the paucity of data, sensitivity analyses could not be undertaken. Where synthesis was inappropriate, individual trials were considered separately. </P>
<P>Planned subgroup analyses were undertaken to consider differences between the sexes and reasons for catheterisations. In addition, subgroup/sensitivity analysis by different catheter sizes was planned but could not be undertaken due to the absence of data to allow this analysis. All calculations were made using the Cochrane statistical package Review Manager (RevMan) Version 4.2. </P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-17 15:05:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review was undertaken to investigate policies for the removal of urethral catheters used for the short-term management of adults and children. An exhaustive search of the literature resulted in 26 published trials (eight new) that were eligible for inclusion in this review. The trials involved both male and female adult patients. None involved children; therefore the findings of the review cannot be generalised to this population. While all the 26 trials met the methodological criteria for inclusion in the review, no study was described as either being single or double-blind as this was not possible given the nature of the intervention.</P>
<P>The interpretation of the review is complicated by differences between the trials in terms of reasons for catheterisation, the types of surgery, the types of anaesthesia used during the surgical procedure and the hydration status of the patients. The type of anaesthesia used was reported in only four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ind-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ind 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Irani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Irani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koh-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Koh 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2004</LINK>) and only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Webster-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2006</LINK>) reported on the hydration status of the patients although two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lyth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lyth 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2000</LINK>) reported that patients were asked to drink copiously. The absence of such relevant information should be considered when interpreting the findings. The lack of measures of dispersion (eg standard deviations) also prevented the use of many of the data in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>While only trials that involved similar participants were combined statistically for a particular outcome, the data from all trials addressing the same broad question for that outcome were tabulated in the same comparison tables. Readers may question whether it is appropriate to consider such trials together, but the approach did allow patterns to be identified. We recognise that these should be interpreted cautiously given the heterogeneity in terms of the reasons for catheterisation, and the potential for the results of small trials like those reported here to over or underestimate treatment differences.</P>
<P>A discussion relating to each comparison is presented below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Removal of catheter at one time of day versus another time (eg late night versus early morning)</HEADING>
<P>Eleven trials involving 1389 participants compared late night with early morning removal of indwelling urethral catheters. The reasons for catheterisation were variable, but the most common was TURP and other urological surgery. The trials were generally consistent in showing after removal at midnight (rather than early morning):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>larger volumes of the first void;</LI>
<LI>longer times to first void (although one trial suggests the opposite);</LI>
<LI>shorter length of hospitalisation (with one trial suggesting the opposite);</LI>
<LI>no clear statistical difference in the need for recatheterisation, but with confidence intervals that do not rule out an important difference;</LI>
<LI>limited evidence suggesting that the midnight removal avoided recatheterisation at unsocial hours;</LI>
<LI>no clear difference in the likelihood of a catheter being removed on time;</LI>
<LI>and a suggestion that it is cost-effective.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Urinary retention is a common occurrence following the removal of the indwelling urethral catheter (<LINK REF="STD-Crowe-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Crowe 1994</LINK>). Therefore monitoring the volume of the first void as an indicator of voiding dysfunction is imperative (<LINK REF="STD-Crowe-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Crowe 1994</LINK>). Larger volumes of urine demonstrates a return to normal voiding function.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Duration of catheterisation</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen trials involving 1422 participants compared various durations of catheterisation. The wide range (from 1 to 28 days), heterogeneity of patient groups and small sample sizes complicated and limit conclusions. As might be expected, there was a tendency for later removal to be associated with fewer short-term voiding problems, but increasing risk of urinary tract infection, more dissatisfaction and longer hospital stay.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clamping of the indwelling urethral catheter</HEADING>
<P>Three trials involving 234 participants compared clamping versus free drainage of the indwelling urethral catheter prior to removal. Unlike the other two comparisons, the trials mainly comprised women. Two of the three trials clearly described the protocol for clamping prior to the removal of the indwelling urethral catheters. The limited evidence obtained from the review does not provide a robust base for the development of practice guidelines.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Resource implications</HEADING>
<P>In clinical practice, the timing of removal and the duration of the indwelling urethral catheter have significant resource implications. The principal determinant of cost is the length of hospital stay. The analyses of this outcome for timing of removal are difficult to interpret: while most trials were consistent with shorter hospital stay, the size of the difference varied significantly. A similar pattern of results was obtained for duration of catheterisation. These data do provide a credible range for the potential effect of midnight removal and shorter duration of catheterisation on length of hospital stay but do not provide a reliable summary estimate.</P>
<P>In this review only one trial amongst 100 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chillington-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chillington 1992</LINK>) undertook a simple cost analysis that suggested that midnight removal of the indwelling urethral catheter was associated with an annual saving of UK £1500, as more participants were discharged on the same day following the removal of the indwelling urethral catheter. However it should be noted that the estimate is based on costs in the early 1990s of 17 extra bed days. Nevertheless this finding may have significant implications for hospital administrators relating to economic benefits associated with shorter length of stay and efficient discharge planning. It can be inferred from these trials that early (within 1 to 3 days) removal of the indwelling urethral catheter would decrease hospital costs. However as none of the other trials reported costs it is not possible to undertake a comparison between the studies. More detailed assessment of the economic impact of the timing and the duration of the indwelling urethral catheter in future research would be beneficial.</P>
<P>Patient satisfaction is assuming greater significance as a measure of quality of health care. Two trials reported formal methods to assess participant satisfaction: one reported a significant association between sleep disturbances and removal of the indwelling urethral catheter at midnight (<LINK REF="STD-Ganta-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ganta 2005</LINK>); and the other showed more participants dissatisfied with longer duration of catheterisation (though not significantly so, <LINK REF="STD-Hansen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hansen 1984</LINK>). Others that used informal reports from participants indicated that removal of the indwelling urethral catheter at midnight did not cause any inconvenience or distress. Participants reported they were pleased that the indwelling urethral catheter was removed at midnight enabling them to have a restful night.<U>

</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence is consistent with midnight, rather than early morning, catheter removal leading to shorter hospital stays with consequent resource savings. Other evidence suggests that the timing of catheter removal is a balance between avoiding increased risk of infection (by early removal) and circumventing voiding dysfunction (by later removal). Early removal appears to reduce mean hospital stay, however. The evidence for assessing clamping indwelling urethral catheters prior to removal is limited, and there was no evidence regarding the use of alpha adrenergic blocker drugs. Until stronger evidence becomes available practices relating to clamping indwelling urethral catheters will continue to be dictated by local preferences and cost factors.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review has provided a guide to future priorities for research.<BR/>1. Further randomised trials using larger sample sizes are needed to address all the questions in the review more precisely and reliably, and to allow secondary analyses amongst discrete subgroups.<BR/>2. Further trials should include the range of outcomes sought in this review, including measures of quality of life and resource use.<BR/>3. Outcome measures (eg urinary retention) need to be well defined and also confirm to standardised definitions (where these exist e.g. for catheter-associated infection) to facilitate comparisons between studies as well as to increase the robustness of further trials. The main issues are the need for recatheterisation and time to hospital discharge.<BR/>4. Evaluation in wider settings and on specific groups of patients would enhance generalisability.<BR/>5. Future randomised trials should compare the effects of midnight or early morning indwelling urethral catheter removal to removal at any time of the day. <BR/>6. Similarly, randomised trials using larger samples are needed to provide robust evidence of the effects of clamping or free drainage of the indwelling urethral catheters, and adjunctive use of alpha blockers, prior to removal.<BR/>7. Examination of supra-pubic catheters should be included in further research.</P>
