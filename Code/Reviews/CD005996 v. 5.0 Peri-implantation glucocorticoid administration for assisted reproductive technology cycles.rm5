<P>Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones with potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. In order to improve embryo implantation for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles, the use of glucocorticoids has been advocated to improve the intrauterine environment. This review investigated whether the administration of glucocorticoids around the time of implantation improved clinical outcomes in women undergoing IVF or ICSI when compared to no glucocorticoid administration. The review of trials found no evidence that glucocorticoids helped to improve live birth rates. However, there was some evidence of increased pregnancy rates, rather than live birth rates, among women undergoing IVF. This was not found in women undergoing ICSI. More research is needed to elucidate the possible role of this therapy in well defined patient groups.</P>

<P>Fourteen studies (involving 1879 couples) were included. Three studies reported live birth rate and these did not identify a significant difference after pooling the (preliminary) results (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.19). With regard to pregnancy rates, there was also no evidence that glucocorticoids improved clinical outcome (13 RCTs; OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.44). However, a subgroup analysis of 650 women undergoing IVF (6 RCTs) revealed a significantly higher pregnancy rate for women using glucocorticoids (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.13). There were no significant differences in adverse events, but these were poorly and inconsistently reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-05-16 15:38:30 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, there was no clear evidence that administration of peri-implantation glucocorticoids in ART cycles significantly improved the clinical outcome. The use of glucocorticoids in a subgroup of women undergoing IVF (rather than ICSI) was associated with an improvement in pregnancy rates of borderline statistical significance and should be interpreted with care. These findings were limited to the routine use of glucocorticoids and cannot be extrapolated to women with autoantibodies, unexplained infertility or recurrent implantation failure. Further well designed randomised studies are required to elucidate the possible role of this therapy in well defined patient groups.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-05-07 23:19:58 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-05-07 23:19:58 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Despite substantial progress in the treatment of subfertile couples over the last two decades and numerous advances in the field of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), the 'take home baby' rate remains at 20% to 30% per treatment cycle. Although implantation failure has been the focus of a substantial amount of research, little progress has been made in the development of therapeutic strategies. A number of studies have been carried out to assess the possible value of interventions aimed at improving the embryo factor in implantation. Of the embryo manipulative techniques, assisted hatching (artificial disruption of the outer coat of the embryo) is most widely advocated (<LINK REF="REF-Magli-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magli 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1995</LINK>). A recent Cochrane Review concluded that clinical pregnancy rates with assisted hatching in a clinic with a success rate of 25% could anticipate improving the pregnancy rates to between 29% and 49% (<LINK REF="REF-Das-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 2009</LINK>). No differences in live birth rates were found however. Pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS), which identifies the number of chromosomes in an embryo, has also been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Gianaroli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gianaroli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pehlivan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pehlivan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verlinsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verlinsky 2004</LINK>). A recent Cochrane Review on PGS in ART concluded that there is insufficient data to determine whether PGS is an effective intervention for treating implantation failure (<LINK REF="REF-Twisk-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twisk 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-05-07 16:38:03 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>In recent years, attention has also focused on the intrauterine environment. Uterine receptivity is controlled by locally-acting growth factors and cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Chard-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giudice-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giudice 1994</LINK>). Cytokines are a family of low molecular weight proteins that play important roles in the regulation of immunological and non-immunological responses. Natural killer (NK) cells have also been shown to play an important role in early implantation (<LINK REF="REF-Croy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ledee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ledee 2004</LINK>). A defect in the integrity of this network of cytokines and an excess of NK cell activity have been implicated in implantation failure and recurrent miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Ledee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ledee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ledee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ledee 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quenby-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quenby 2005</LINK>). Therefore, it has been proposed that glucocorticoids may improve the intrauterine environment by acting as immunomodulators to reduce the NK cell count to the normal range (<LINK REF="REF-Pountain_x002c_-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pountain, 1993</LINK>) and normalise the cytokine expression profile in the endometrium and by suppression of endometrial inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1990</LINK>). Moreover, there is some evidence that glucocorticoids may also be useful in improving the ovarian response (<LINK REF="REF-Fridstrom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fridstrom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keay-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keay 2001</LINK>) and this topic is currently the subject of a Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Pandian-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandian 2009</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-05-07 16:40:37 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>The published trials on glucocorticoids for embryo implantation are insufficiently powered to draw conclusions on their efficacy and the trials reveal inconsistent results. Therefore, it seems appropriate to consider pooling the results from the available randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In order to analyse the effectiveness of adjuvant glucocorticoids for embryo implantation, live birth rate was defined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were pregnancy and implantation rates. Adverse effects of glucocorticoids have also been addressed in the review.</P>

A way to detect such a bias is the construction of a funnel plot, plotting sample size versus effects size. In the absence of bias the graph is symmetrical. The number of trials needed to construct a plot is arbitrarily a minimum of ten studies.</P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1997</LINK>) included two different populations of women: endometriosis and tubal factor or only tubal factor. Among women with endometriosis and tubal factor, 38.1% of women showed positive titers for autoantibodies. Since this systematic review focused on the routine use of glucocorticoids to improve implantation, only the second group of women with tubal factor infertility were included in this analysis. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ando-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ando 1996</LINK>) included data from women who were positive and women who were negative for autoantibodies; data from autoantibody positive women were excluded from this analysis.

Only one study used subzonal sperm injection (SUZI) (<LINK REF="STD-Catt-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Catt 1994</LINK>), which involves direct placement of sperm into the space between the zona pellucida and the oocyte. This technique is comparable to but less invasive for the oocyte than ICSI. In addition to IVF cycles, <LINK REF="STD-Moffitt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Moffitt 1995</LINK> also included transfer cycles of frozen-thawed embryos. <LINK REF="STD-Bider-1996_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Bider 1996-2</LINK> only included transfers of frozen-thawed embryos obtained after IVF treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Kemeter-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kemeter 1986</LINK> was an older study which used a different ovarian stimulation protocol, by using clomiphene in combination with gonadotrophins without GnRH analogue treatment.

<LINK REF="STD-Kemeter-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kemeter 1986</LINK> reported a high rate of cancelled cycles (19%). No intention-to-treat analysis was performed.

The authors equalised the difference in the number of drop-outs between the two study arms by removing at random an additional 10 patients from the glucocorticoid group. This atypical method of dealing with drop-outs, rather than using an intention to treat analysis, has resulted in an underestimation of the treatment effect of glucocorticoids.

<P>Protocols were not available for any of the included studies. However, none of the studies failed to report the outcomes that they planned to in their methods section.

<LINK REF="STD-Salah-Edeen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salah Edeen 2009</LINK> was also classified as at high risk of selective reporting since no data on pregnancy or live birth rates were reported, only the risk of OHSS.</P>
<P>Three studies assessed the primary outcome, namely 'live birth rate per couple' (<LINK REF="STD-Ando-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ando 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bider-1996_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Bider 1996-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moffitt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Moffitt 1995</LINK>).

<P>A funnel plot of precision versus odds ratio showed a suggestion of publication bias for pregnancy rate per couple (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).

<OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES MODIFIED="2012-05-14 14:25:27 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>The risk of other biases was unclear in five studies. Regarding baseline comparability, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bider-1996_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Bider 1996-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Botti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Botti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mottla-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mottla 1996</LINK>) only provided data on maternal age to assess the comparability of the two intervention groups. Therefore baseline comparability of other potential prognostic factors, such as prior IVF attempts, cause and length of infertility, semen quality and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), was unclear. Next to this potential source of bias, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Botti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Botti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ezzeldin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ezzeldin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salah-Edeen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Salah Edeen 2009</LINK>) were abstracts which did not describe their methods in detail.

<P>The aim of this review was to investigate whether the administration of glucocorticoids during the peri-implantation period improved clinical outcomes in subfertile women undergoing IVF or ICSI when compared to no glucocorticoid or placebo administration. Overall there is no clear evidence that administration of peri-implantation glucocorticoids improved clinical outcome. Nevertheless, the use of glucocorticoids in a subgroup of women undergoing IVF (rather than ICSI) was associated with an improvement in pregnancy rates that was of borderline statistical significance and should be interpreted with caution (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.19) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-05-16 12:46:36 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Live birth rate is the standard primary outcome for RCTs of this nature (<LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>). Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ando-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ando 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bider-1996_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">Bider 1996-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moffitt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Moffitt 1995</LINK>) reported this outcome and showed no evidence of a beneficial effect of glucocorticoids. Using pregnancy rate as a surrogate endpoint is of dubious accuracy. Pregnancy rate was reported by all studies. The difference in pregnancy rate was not significant, however all trials except for <LINK REF="STD-Ubaldi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ubaldi 2002</LINK> showed a trend which favoured the use of glucocorticoids versus controls. These results cannot easily be extrapolated to live birth rate due to the high rate of multiple pregnancies and subsequent higher rates of perinatal mortality. The implantation rates per embryo transferred are not appropriate for pooling (<LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>) however the results are presented in the table of comparisons. All confidence intervals cross the line of no effect and the direction differs substantially between the trials. Adverse effects were also considered as a secondary outcome. However only three trials reported the incidence of side effects from glucocorticoids and no cases were documented.</P>
<P>These findings are limited to the empirical use of glucocorticoids (routine use in a non-selected IVF or ICSI population) and cannot be extrapolated to women with unexplained infertility, endometriosis or recurrent implantation failure. This would be subject of another review since it involves a different mechanism of effect.<B> </B>None of the studies that were included focused on these patient subgroups. With these underlying conditions, women may have a higher chance of benefiting from peri-implantation glucocorticoids since an impaired intrauterine environment could be a cause for their infertility and immunomodulation may improve endometrium receptivity. Additionally, there may be a subgroup of women with high numbers of uNK cells, shown to be correlated with recurrent implantation failure (<LINK REF="REF-Ledee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ledee 2005</LINK>), which can be reduced by the administration of 20 mg prednisolone per day from cycle day 1 to 21 (<LINK REF="REF-Quenby-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quenby 2005</LINK>). It is unclear whether women with an increased expression of uNK cells may benefit from glucocorticoid administration. Moreover, these results can not be extrapolated to women with positive autoantibodies. <LINK REF="STD-Geva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Geva 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ando-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ando 1996</LINK> administered glucocorticoids to women with anti-nuclear, anti-double stranded DNA, anti-cardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant in a randomised controlled trial; promising results were found. Furthermore, women with tubal factor and endometriosis, of whom 38.1% were found positive for autoantibodies, were randomised by <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1997</LINK>. Women receiving glucocorticoids showed significantly higher pregnancy rates versus the controls. However, <LINK REF="STD-Shohayeb-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Shohayeb 2005</LINK> investigated the use of glucocorticoids in women with anti-thyroid antibodies in a RCT and no significant differences in pregnancy rates were reported.</P>

<P>Only randomised controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. No studies were graded as high risk of selection bias related to sequence generation or allocation concealment. The lack of blinding in most studies may be acceptable in terms of the overall quality since the primary and secondary outcomes, live birth and pregnancy rates, are objective. Sample sizes were relatively small. However, many fertility trials lack power. A prospective power calculation should always be performed although the calculated sample size in most cases will be prohibitively large. The consistency of the results and rather narrow confidence intervals increase the strength of the evidence.</P>
<P>There are a number of methodological considerations to be taken into account when interpreting these results as there is a substantial degree of heterogeneity between the 13 trials in the meta-analysis. Although significant statistical heterogeneity between trials was not present, differences in clinical parameters are often considerable (clinical heterogeneity). Clinical heterogeneity cannot be avoided because most centres use their own 'materials and methods'. The underlying assumption when similar trials are pooled, is that differences found between the trials are likely to be differences in the extent of treatment effect rather than direction of treatment effect. For example, clinical heterogeneity between the studies may result in different outcomes between the studies however they all show more or less the same trend in treatment effect. Moreover, when all trials find similar results despite differences in clinical parameters, this renders more robust conclusions drawn.</P>
<P>The cause of infertility, type of ART and intervention protocol all varied considerably between the trials. Most importantly, there was no uniformity of dose and timing of the intervention. Subgroup analyses of higher and lower doses of steroids and timing (during or before implantation) did not reveal any significant differences in pregnancy rates with glucocorticoid administrations versus controls; there was no apparent dose response relationship. However, most trials included a mix of the three factors. As a result, the effect of individual confounders could not be assessed.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity existed between the trials with regards to most aspects of trial methodology. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Ezzeldin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ezzeldin 2003</LINK> was most heavily weighted in the meta-analysis due to its large sample size (526 participants) but this abstract did not report the method of randomisation and concealment of allocation. Only three studies were double blinded by using a placebo, which may have introduced bias in the other studies. However, these trials did not show unusual results. In order to investigate the effect of methodological quality on treatment effect we performed sensitivity analyses on studies with an adequate concealment of allocation and studies in which the method of randomisation was described. These sensitivity analyses did not reveal a change in treatment effect.</P>
<P>A funnel plot of precision versus odds ratio showed a suggestion of publication bias for the pregnancy rate per couple (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), which is reason to believe that the set of studies is not fully representative. Publication bias would result in an overestimation of treatment effect. This has to be taken into account when interpreting the results. Even though there is some evidence of publication bias, no evidence of significant treatment effects was found.<B> </B>No funding streams have been reported in any of the included studies.</P>

<P>There is no clear evidence that routine administration of peri-implantation glucocorticoids in ART cycles improves the clinical outcome in a non-selected IVF or ICSI population. There is evidence that glucocorticoid administration may improve pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF without ICSI. However, these data were of borderline statistical significance and require confirmation. Meanwhile glucocorticoids should only be administrated in the context of well designed clinical trials such as are currently in preparation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-05-08 00:09:52 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<UL>
<LI>There is a paucity of RCTs investigating the use of glucocorticoids among women with unexplained infertility, recurrent failure of embryo implantation or high numbers of uterine natural killer cells</LI>
<LI>RCTs should follow the consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) guidelines; many fertility trials lack adequate reporting of methodology</LI>
<LI>Trials should be of sufficient duration to have live birth as their primary outcome and should ideally report all outcomes listed in this review</LI>
<LI>Avoid cross-over designs in trials where pregnancy is an intended outcome</LI>
