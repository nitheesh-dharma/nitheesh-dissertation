<P>Blepharitis, defined as inflammation of the eyelids, is a common eye condition and affects both children and adults. Blepharitis can be categorized in several different ways. First, categorization is based on the length of disease process: acute or chronic blepharitis. Second, categorization is based on the anatomical location of disease: anterior, or front of the eye (e.g. staphylococcal and seborrheic blepharitis), and posterior, or back of the eye (e.g. meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)). This review focuses on chronic blepharitis and stratifies anterior and posterior blepharitis. There were 34 studies (2169 participants with blepharitis) included in the review, 20 of which included participants with anterior blepharitis and 14 of which included participants with posterior blepharitis. For anterior blepharitis, topical antibiotics provided some symptomatic relief and were effective in clearing bacteria from the eyelid margins. There was no difference between the types of topical antibiotics used. Topical steroids also provided some symptomatic relief; however, they were ineffective in eliminating bacteria. Lid hygiene, including warm compresses and lid scrubs, showed some symptomatic relief in both anterior and posterior blepharitis. Overall, there was no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis. Further research should be done to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for blepharitis, with particular attention paid to adequate diagnosis and classification of the disease.</P>

<P>Blepharitis, an inflammatory condition associated with itchiness, redness, flaking, and crusting of the eyelids, is a common eye condition that affects both children and adults. It is common in all ethnic groups and across all ages. Although infrequent, blepharitis can lead to permanent alterations to the eyelid margin or vision loss from superficial keratopathy (abnormality of the cornea), corneal neovascularization, and ulceration. Most importantly, blepharitis frequently causes significant ocular symptoms such as burning sensation, irritation, tearing, and red eyes as well as visual problems such as photophobia and blurred vision. The exact etiopathogenesis is unknown, but suspected to be multifactorial, including chronic low-grade infections of the ocular surface with bacteria, infestations with certain parasites such as demodex, and inflammatory skin conditions such as atopy and seborrhea. Blepharitis can be categorized in several different ways. First, categorization is based on the length of disease process: acute or chronic blepharitis. Second, categorization is based on the anatomical location of disease: anterior, or front of the eye (e.g. staphylococcal and seborrheic blepharitis), and posterior, or back of the eye (e.g. meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)). This review focuses on chronic blepharitis and stratifies anterior and posterior blepharitis.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-04-10 21:10:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To examine the effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of chronic blepharitis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-04-05 10:53:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2012), the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT) (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/">www.controlled-trials.com</A>), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en">www.who.int/ictrp/search/en</A>). We searched the reference lists of included studies for any additional studies not identified by the electronic searches. There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 9 February 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-01-13 15:26:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials (CCTs) in which participants were adults aged 16 years or older and clinically diagnosed with chronic blepharitis. We also included trials where participants with chronic blepharitis were a subset of the participants included in the study and data were reported separately for these participants. Interventions within the scope of this review included medical treatment and lid hygiene measures.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-04-01 14:42:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed search results, reviewed full-text copies for eligibility, examined risk of bias, and extracted data. Data were meta-analyzed for studies comparing similar interventions and reporting comparable outcomes with the same timing. Otherwise, results for included studies were summarized in the text.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-03 09:52:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were 34 studies (2169 participants with blepharitis) included in this review: 20 studies (14 RCTs and 6 CCTs) included 1661 participants with anterior or mixed blepharitis and 14 studies (12 RCTs and 2 CCTs) included 508 participants with posterior blepharitis (MGD). Due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics among the included studies, with respect to follow-up periods and types of interventions, comparisons, and condition of participants, our ability to perform meta-analyses was limited. Topical antibiotics were shown to provide some symptomatic relief and were effective in eradicating bacteria from the eyelid margin for anterior blepharitis. Lid hygiene may provide symptomatic relief for anterior and posterior blepharitis. The effectiveness of other treatments for blepharitis, such as topical steroids and oral antibiotics, were inconclusive.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-04-11 11:40:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite identifying 34 trials related to treatments for blepharitis, there is no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis. Commercial products are marketed to consumers and prescribed to patients without substantial evidence of effectiveness. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatments. Any RCT designed for this purpose should separate participants by type of condition (e.g. staphylococcal blepharitis or MGD) in order to minimize imbalances between groups (type I errors) and to achieve statistical power for analyses (prevent type II errors). Medical interventions and commercial products should be compared with conventional lid hygiene measures, such as warm compresses and eyelid margin washing, to determine effectiveness, as well as head-to-head to show comparative effectiveness between treatments. Outcomes of interest should be patient-centered and measured using validated questionnaires or scales. It is important that participants be followed long-term, at least one year, to assess chronic outcomes properly.</P>

<P>Blepharitis, defined as inflammation of the eyelids, is one of the most common ocular conditions and affects both children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Lemp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemp 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viswalingham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viswalingham 2005</LINK>). Blepharitis can be categorized in several different ways. First, categorization is based on the length of disease process: acute and chronic blepharitis. Acute blepharitis, referred to by some as lid infection, may be bacterial, viral, or parasitic in etiology (<LINK REF="REF-Eliason-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eliason 2005</LINK>) and is beyond the scope of this review. The more common form is chronic blepharitis, or lid inflammation. Though <LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1982</LINK> previously classified chronic blepharitis into six categories, it more recently has been divided into three categories: staphylococcal, seborrheic, and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2008</LINK>). Further, many clinicians prefer to classify blepharitis based on anatomic location where anterior blepharitis causes inflammation primarily at the base of the eyelashes (staphylococcal and seborrheic blepharitis are often grouped together and referred to as anterior blepharitis), posterior blepharitis affects the posterior lid margin (the section of the eyelid that comes into contact with the cornea and bulbar conjunctiva), and marginal blepharitis includes both anterior and posterior blepharitis (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2011</LINK>). MGD affects primarily the oil glands located on the posterior lid and therefore it is included as a subset of posterior blepharitis.</P>
<P>Staphylococcal blepharitis is believed to be associated with staphylococcal bacteria on the ocular surface. However, the mechanism by which the bacteria cause symptoms of blepharitis is not fully understood. Comparisons in bacterial flora between normal eyes and those diagnosed with staphylococcal blepharitis have identified some differences. Only 8% of normal patients had cultures positive for <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> as compared to 46% to 51% of those diagnosed with staphylococcal blepharitis (<LINK REF="REF-Dougherty-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dougherty 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1984</LINK>). Patients with staphylococcal blepharitis were found to be similar dermatologically to matched controls (<LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1985</LINK>). Hordeolum, a nodular inflammatory lesion of the eyelid arising from either the hair follicles or the meibomian gland, is often associated with staphylococcal blepharitis (<LINK REF="REF-Probst-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Probst 2005</LINK>). On the other hand, in two studies, 92% to 97% of patients with blepharitis had cultures positive for <I>Staphylococcus epidermis</I>, proportions not significantly different from control populations (<LINK REF="REF-Dougherty-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dougherty 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since only half of patients diagnosed with staphylococcal blepharitis had positive cultures for <I>S. aureus</I> it is likely that there are additional contributing factors. Some researchers have hypothesized that toxins produced by certain strains of <I>S. aureus</I> or <I>S. epidermis</I> may be a cause of irritation (<LINK REF="REF-Valenton-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valenton 1973</LINK>). However, a specific toxin more associated with clinically blepharitic lids than controls has not been identified (<LINK REF="REF-Seal-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seal 1990</LINK>). Enhanced cell-mediated immunity to <I>S. aureus</I> was found in 40% of patients with blepharitis and these patients more often required topical corticosteroid therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Ficker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ficker 1991</LINK>). The significance of these findings is poorly understood.</P>
<P>Seborrheic blepharitis is characterized by less inflammation than staphylococcal blepharitis but with more oily or greasy scaling. Some patients with seborrheic blepharitis also exhibit characteristics of MGD. Since the meibomian glands are derived from the sebaceous glands of the skin, the finding of MGD in patients with generalized sebaceous gland abnormality is not surprising (<LINK REF="REF-Raskin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raskin 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Posterior blepharitis is characterized by inflammation of the posterior lid margin and has various causes, such as MGD, infectious or allergic conjunctivitis, and systemic conditions such as acne rosacea (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2011</LINK>). MGD is a condition that affects the glands on the posterior lid margin that are responsible for secreting meibum, the outermost oily layer of the tear film. This substance has several functions important in normal eye health and comfort. Meibum is responsible for slowing evaporation of the tear film, preventing contamination of the tear film, thickening the tear film, and smoothing the tear film to provide an even optical surface (<LINK REF="REF-Driver-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Driver 2005</LINK>). Patients with MGD have tears that evaporate more quickly than controls (<LINK REF="REF-Mathers-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathers 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolando-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolando 1985</LINK>), leaving the eye susceptible to ocular surface damage and discomfort.</P>
<P>Quantitative or qualitative deficiencies in meibum may be responsible for the symptoms experienced in MGD blepharitis. Hyperkeratinization of the meibomian gland epithelium (thickening of the lining of the glands) may lead to obstruction and a decrease in the quantity of meibomian gland secretions (<LINK REF="REF-Jester-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jester 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jester-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jester 1989b</LINK>). Meibomian gland obstruction has been found to be associated with increased tear evaporation and ocular surface damage and discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-Shimazaki-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shimazaki 1995</LINK>) due to a quantitative decrease in the protective oil layer.</P>
<P>Qualitative differences in the composition of meibum between patients with MGD and controls have also been reported. <LINK REF="REF-Dougherty-1986a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dougherty 1986a</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Dougherty-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dougherty 1991b</LINK> found that patients with MGD had significant differences in free fatty acids in the secretions of their meibomian glands as compared to controls. Similarly, <LINK REF="REF-Shine-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shine 1991</LINK> found cholesterol esters in all patients with MGD but only half of normal controls. It is not known whether these differences are present in endogenous secretions or whether bacterial enzymes may modify the secretions on the surface of the eye (<LINK REF="REF-Dougherty-1986b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dougherty 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dougherty-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dougherty 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Probst-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Probst 2005</LINK>). Changes in these protective portions of the tear film may decrease their effectiveness and contribute to inflammation and irritation.</P>
<P>Demodex mites have also been considered a causative factor for blepharitis (<LINK REF="REF-Czepita-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czepita 2007</LINK>). The mites, which infest the eyelid margin around the lash follicles and sebaceous glands, may have a role in both anterior and posterior blepharitis. It is theorized that the infestation and waste of the mites causes blockage of the follicles and glands and/or an inflammatory response.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Though not sight-threatening, chronic blepharitis is one of the most common ocular disorders encountered by ophthalmologists (<LINK REF="REF-McCulley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 2000</LINK>). In a survey of US ophthalmologists and optometrists, 37% to 47% of patients seen by those surveyed had signs of blepharitis (<LINK REF="REF-Lemp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemp 2009</LINK>). In 1982 blepharitis was responsible for 590,000 patient visits in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-NDTI-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">NDTI 1982</LINK>). However, few epidemiologic data exist that estimate the true prevalence of blepharitis.</P>
<P>In a case-control study conducted in the San Francisco Bay area and Texas, staphylococcal blepharitis occurred more commonly in women and had an average age of onset of 42 years (<LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1985</LINK>). Also, it was postulated that staphylococcal blepharitis occurred more frequently in warmer climates (<LINK REF="REF-Bowman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowman 1987</LINK>). Approximately 25% to 50% of cases were associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), a class of dry eye syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1985</LINK>). KCS is associated with a reduced aqueous tear film production in contrast to dry eyes from abnormal evaporation.</P>
<P>In the same study the mean age of participants with seborrheic blepharitis was 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1985</LINK>). There was no difference in prevalence between men and women. Ninety-five per cent of participants with seborrheic blepharitis also had seborrheic dermatitis that presents with symptoms of flaking and greasy skin on the scalp, retroauricular area, glabella, and nasolabial folds (<LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1982</LINK>). Approximately one third of those participants had KCS (<LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of MGD increases with age (<LINK REF="REF-Driver-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Driver 2005</LINK>). The average age in the <LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1982</LINK> group of MGD blepharitis patients was 50 years and prevalence was equal between men and women (<LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1984</LINK>). MGD may be more common in cooler climates (<LINK REF="REF-Bowman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowman 1987</LINK>). MGD seems to be more common in fair-skinned individuals but this may be due to its association with acne rosacea, which is also more prevalent in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Driver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Driver 1996</LINK>). Acne rosacea is characterized by skin telangiectasias (dilated superficial blood vessels), erythema, papules, and pustules. It was diagnosed in 20% of MGD patients (<LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1982</LINK>). Also, 46% were diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis (<LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1982</LINK>). Chalazia are more common in patients with MGD. Since a chalazion (a sterile, chronic, nodular inflammation of the meibomian glands) is thought to be due to obstruction of the gland orifice it is expected that patients with MGD would be at risk.</P>
<P>In a study conducted in Florida, <LINK REF="REF-Groden-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groden 1991</LINK> found that the prevalence of acne rosacea was 44% and the prevalence of KCS was 30% in a cohort of participants with all types of blepharitis. In an Austrian study of 407 patients with chronic blepharitis, 14.5% of participants had KCS, 32.9% had seborrheic dermatitis, and 26.7% had acne rosacea (<LINK REF="REF-Huber_x002d_Spitzy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huber-Spitzy 1991</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Symptoms of blepharitis include burning, itchiness, gritty feeling of the eyes, contact lens intolerance, photophobia (light-sensitivity), and redness and crusting of the eyelid margins. Symptoms are usually worse in the mornings and a patient may have several exacerbations and remissions.</P>
<P>Staphylococcal blepharitis is characterized on examination by erythema and edema of the eyelid margin. Telangiectasia may be present on the anterior eyelid. Brittle scales may be seen in the eyelashes and these may form collarettes, which encircle the lash at the base or further up as the lash grows. In severe and long-standing cases trichiasis (misdirection of eyelashes toward the eye), poliosis (depigmentation of the eyelashes), madarosis (loss of eyelashes), eyelid ulceration, and eyelid and corneal scarring may occur (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seborrheic blepharitis is differentiated by less erythema, edema, and telangiectasia of the lid margins as compared to staphylococcal blepharitis but an increased amount of oily scale and greasy crusting on the lashes (<LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Posterior blepharitis may be seen clinically by examining the posterior eyelid margin. The meibomian glands may appear capped with oil, be dilated, or be visibly obstructed. The secretions of the glands are usually turbid and thicker than normal. Telangiectasias and lid scarring may also be present in this area. In all forms of blepharitis examination of the tear film may show instability and rapid evaporation.</P>

<P>Though the pathophysiology of anterior and posterior blepharitis may be different, the treatment options are similar. Current practice is such that patients generally are offered treatment if they report discomfort or experience visual symptoms. Initial treatment is eyelid hygiene, which includes warm compresses, eyelid massage, and eyelid scrubs (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geerling-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerling 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1984</LINK> recommends that warm compresses be applied two to four times daily with a warm facecloth for 5- to 10-minute intervals in the acute phase of blepharitis. The warm compresses raise the temperature of the eyelid above the melting point for meibomian gland secretions and thus aid in expression. Eyelid massage, which consists of pressing the eyelid against the eyeball, is thought to help milk excess secretions from the meibomian glands. Eyelid scrubs, which consist of gently scrubbing the eyelids with a wet washcloth and detergent such as baby shampoo or one of a number of commercially available products, are performed after the warm compresses to clear away scale and debris that have accumulated on the eyelid margin. As blepharitis is a chronic disease, eyelid hygiene must be performed even after an acute exacerbation has resolved. Adverse effects of lid hygiene treatment are few but may include mechanical irritation from overly vigorous scrubbing or sensitivity reaction to the detergents used.</P>
<P>All forms of blepharitis may benefit from a course of treatment with topical corticosteroid drops to decrease inflammation in an acute exacerbation. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2008</LINK>) recommends applying drops several times daily, tapered to discontinuation over one to three weeks. However, corticosteroids may have significant adverse effects over the long-term such as increased intraocular pressure (IOP), posterior subcapsular cataract formation, and superinfection. For this reason they are not recommended for long-term use.</P>
<P>Staphylococcal and seborrheic blepharitis may be treated with topical antibiotics, preferably in ointment form in order to coat the lids better. Ointment is applied after lid hygiene maneuvers once or twice daily depending on the severity of the inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Raskin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raskin 1992</LINK>). Erythromycin and bacitracin are commonly prescribed. Antibiotic therapy may be discontinued in two to eight weeks or once symptoms resolve. Some patients require chronic therapy in order to remain symptom free (<LINK REF="REF-McCulley-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulley 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>In patients with posterior blepharitis, oral tetracycline or doxycycline may be effective (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2008</LINK>). Though clinical improvement requires several weeks, once it is achieved therapy may be discontinued or tapered to maintenance doses. Improvement in posterior blepharitis with tetracyclines may be related to inhibition of bacterial lipases in both <I>S. aureus</I> and <I>S. epidermidis</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Dougherty-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dougherty 1991a</LINK>). Tetracyclines are also effective in the treatment of facial acne rosacea (<LINK REF="REF-Driver-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Driver 2005</LINK>). Adverse effects include photosensitization, gastrointestinal upset, vaginitis, and hypersensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2008</LINK>). Tetracyclines should not be used orally in pregnant or lactating women or children younger than eight years old because of the risk of tooth enamel abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Driver-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Driver 1996</LINK>). Also they interact with some medicines such as coumadin and oral cholesterol-lowering drugs. Oral minocycline, a broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic, showed some benefit in treating MGD in two case series (<LINK REF="REF-Aronowicz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronowicz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shine-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shine 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>A report from the International Workshop on MGD recommends increasing dietary intake of essential fatty acids, specifically omega-3 fatty acid, in cases of mild-to-severe MGD (<LINK REF="REF-Geerling-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerling 2011</LINK>). The recommendation was added to the overall treatment algorithm for MGD because essential fatty acids may be beneficial to anti-inflammatory processes and because oral supplements have been associated with reduced dry eye symptoms.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-04-01 15:25:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Blepharitis is a common chronic disease whose etiology is poorly understood. Commercial products are available and marketed to patients, but it is not clear whether or not they are effective. The AAO Preferred Practice Pattern Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2008</LINK>) rate the strength of evidence to support lid hygiene, topical antibiotics, topical corticosteroids, and oral tetracyclines as treatment for blepharitis as level III - a consensus opinion in the absence of substantial controlled evidence. Since the literature search by the AAO encompassed only English-language articles published between 1997 and 2007 a more complete systematic approach is warranted to identify trials and to highlight any evidence gaps in the literature. This review focuses on the evidence to support therapeutic interventions for blepharitis.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-04-03 11:48:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review was to examine the effectiveness of medical and mechanical interventions in improving patient symptoms, as well as clinical signs, for the treatment of chronic blepharitis. For the purposes of this review, mechanical interventions include any nonmedical and nonsurgical intervention aimed to physically treat the condition, such as eyelid hygiene (washing or scrubbing of the eyelid margin) and the application of warm compresses.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2012-04-03 10:24:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included trials in which participants were adults aged 16 years or older, clinically diagnosed with chronic blepharitis, inclusive of staphylococcal, seborrheic, or MGD. Because there were no standardized diagnostic protocols for chronic blepharitis or for the three subtypes we also included studies where the type of chronic blepharitis was not specified and studies that categorized chronic blepharitis using a different classification (e.g. meibomitis, primary meibomitis, meibomian keratoconjunctivitis). We included trials where participants with chronic blepharitis were a subset of the participants included in the study as long as outcomes were reported separately for these participants.</P>

<P>Some treatments often were used for short periods of time. Other treatments, such as oral antibiotics, often were used chronically. There were, therefore, no minimum or maximum periods of follow-up required for inclusion. Because of the possibility of difficulty in differentiating between persistent blepharitis symptoms and recurrent exacerbations, sensitivity analyses were performed to gauge the impact on review findings of studies with follow-up greater than four weeks.</P>

We judged the studies on five parameters: selection bias (sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (masking of participants and researchers), detection bias (masking of those responsible for assessing outcomes), attrition bias (rates of follow-up between groups and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis), and reporting bias (selective outcome reporting) as well as other sources of bias. For each bias domain, two review authors independently judged the study to have a low risk of bias, an unclear risk of bias, or a high risk of bias. We presented descriptive documentation of the details of each parameter for each study in table format also.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-04-03 10:33:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We anticipated that the included studies would use different rating scales for assessing clinical outcomes. For each included study we assessed the validity and reliability of each rating scale as supported by previous studies. Data from valid rating scales with more than 10 categories were to be treated as continuous variables with a normal distribution. When this assumption could not be made we planned to dichotomize using a clinically relevant cut-off point (e.g. reduction in patient symptom report score by one unit) and treat it as a dichotomous variable. When the included studies used different cut-off points for valid rating scales we adopted their definitions in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We reported the weighted mean difference for all continuous outcomes and rating scales. We reported the standardized mean difference when different valid rating scales were reported in the included studies.

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2012-04-05 11:38:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were 34 studies included in the review (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Twenty-six (76%) of the studies were RCTs and the remainder were CCTs. A summary of the study participants, interventions, and follow-up periods from the included studies is presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The included studies were published between 1956 and 2011, enrolled 13 to 464 participants with blepharitis each, and followed participants from 30 minutes to 12 months. Individual trials typically were small; only seven enrolled 100 or more participants. Overall 2383 participants, of which 2169 had blepharitis or blepharoconjunctivitis, were enrolled in the included studies. For the purposes of this review, studies were stratified by the anatomic location of blepharitis: anterior/mixed (e.g. staphylococcal and seborrheic) and posterior (e.g. MGD).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Anterior/mixed staphylococcal and seborrheic blepharitis</HEADING>
<P>Twenty (59%) of the 34 included studies examined the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of anterior or mixed blepharitis (1661 participants). Of these 20 studies, 14 (70%) studies were RCTs and six (30%) studies were CCTs. In 13 (65%) studies all participants had blepharitis, whereas the remaining seven studies included participants with varying ocular conditions, a subset of whom had blepharitis. The number of participants with blepharitis enrolled in each study ranged from 13 to 464. The follow-up periods ranged from seven days to eight months; the majority of which were four weeks or less.</P>
<P>The interventions and comparisons investigated varied across studies. Four studies were two-arm trials comparing topical antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Laibovitz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Laibovitz 1991</LINK>) or antibacterial agents (<LINK REF="STD-Behrens_x002d_Baumann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Behrens-Baumann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyndiuk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hyndiuk 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-More-1968" TYPE="STUDY">More 1968</LINK>) with placebo. Three studies were two-arm trials comparing ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution with another topical antibiotic, one of which used the same doses for each treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Bloom-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 1994</LINK>), one used differing doses (<LINK REF="STD-Adenis-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Adenis 1996a</LINK>), and one did not report the doses (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 1990</LINK>). One study was a partial cross-over trial investigating a topical antibiotic and an oral antibiotic, using topical and oral placebos as controls (<LINK REF="STD-Seal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Seal 1995</LINK>). Five studies compared combinations of topical antibiotics/antibacterial agents and corticosteroids with the same dose of topical antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Donshik-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Donshik 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1982</LINK>) or antibacterial agents (<LINK REF="STD-Aragones-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Aragones 1973</LINK>) alone, corticosteroids alone (<LINK REF="STD-Donshik-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Donshik 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1982</LINK>), and/or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Donshik-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Donshik 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1982</LINK>), with or without lid hygiene. One study compared combination topical antibiotic and corticosteroid with another combination of topical antibiotic and corticosteroid (<LINK REF="STD-White-2008" TYPE="STUDY">White 2008</LINK>). Three other studies investigated drug interventions: <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1956</LINK> compared topical antifungal drugs with placebo and the same dose of topical antibacterial agent, respectively, and <LINK REF="STD-Collum-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Collum 1984</LINK> compared a topical anti-inflammatory agent with placebo.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Posterior blepharitis/MGD</HEADING>
<P>Fourteen studies (41% of included studies), including 12 RCTs and two CCTs, assessed the effectiveness of interventions among participants with MGD. All studies were limited to participants with MGD (508 participants). Follow-up periods varied from one day to one year. Sample sizes ranged from 14 to 150 participants in each study.</P>
<P>There was considerable variation in the types of interventions investigated. Two studies investigated treatment with antibiotics: one studied topical antibiotics plus warm compresses versus warm compresses alone (<LINK REF="STD-Luchs-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luchs 2008</LINK>) and the other studied high and low doses of oral antibiotic versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Yoo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yoo 2005</LINK>). Two studies compared a topical immunosuppressant agent with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2006</LINK>) or with topical antibiotics plus steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Rubin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 2006</LINK>). One study evaluated a treatment regimen of topical antibiotics and steroids plus warm compresses and artificial tears with or without supplementation with an oral mucolytic agent (<LINK REF="STD-Yal_x00e7_in-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yalin 2002</LINK>). A topical mucolytic agent was compared with artificial tears in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Akyol_x002d_Salman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Akyol-Salman 2010</LINK>). One long-term study compared a dietary supplement with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Macsai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Macsai 2008</LINK>). One study compared a dietary supplement and lid hygiene with either the supplements or lid hygiene alone (<LINK REF="STD-Pinna-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pinna 2007</LINK>). One study looked at oil eyedrops versus normal saline solution as control (<LINK REF="STD-Goto-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goto 2002</LINK>). Four studies compared warm compresses with no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Mori-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2003</LINK>), control compresses at room temperature (<LINK REF="STD-Olson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 2003</LINK>), another type of warm compress (<LINK REF="STD-Ishida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ishida 2008</LINK>), or warm moist air treatment at the same temperature (<LINK REF="STD-Matsumoto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matsumoto 2006</LINK>).

<P>Twenty-six (76%) of the included studies were RCTs. Fourteen of the RCTs (54%) had adequate sequence generation methods (such as random numbers lists, randomization schemes, or independent coordinating centers) and were, therefore, judged to have a low risk of sequence generation bias (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Further, eight of these RCTs also were judged to have adequately concealed allocation by using coded prescription bottles (<LINK REF="STD-Aragones-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Aragones 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1990</LINK>), sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1982</LINK>), or sequentially numbered treatment kits (<LINK REF="STD-White-2008" TYPE="STUDY">White 2008</LINK>); allocating participants to treatment groups after study enrollment (<LINK REF="STD-Behrens_x002d_Baumann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Behrens-Baumann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donshik-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Donshik 1983</LINK>); or assigning treatment groups through a pharmacy department or individual separate from the recruiting department (<LINK REF="STD-Mori-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Seal 1995</LINK>). Investigators of one RCT did not conceal allocation following randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Pinna-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pinna 2007</LINK>). Authors of the other five studies did not report methods for allocation concealment and we assessed these studies as having an unclear risk of bias for this parameter (<LINK REF="STD-Akyol_x002d_Salman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Akyol-Salman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luchs-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luchs 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macsai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Macsai 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1982</LINK>). Treatment groups were divided randomly by a co-author for one RCT (4%); however, it was not clear what method of randomization was used (<LINK REF="STD-Goto-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goto 2002</LINK>). The method of allocation concealment for this study was not reported. Methods for randomization and allocation concealment were not reported for the remaining 11 RCTs (44%).</P>
<P>There were eight (24%) CCTs included in the review. Three studies reported how treatment groups were divided: left eye versus right eye (<LINK REF="STD-Key-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Key 1996</LINK>), odd versus even birth date (<LINK REF="STD-More-1968" TYPE="STUDY">More 1968</LINK>), or alternate allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Matsumoto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matsumoto 2006</LINK>). Based on these grouping methods, allocation could not be concealed for these studies. The authors of the remaining five studies did not give details on how groups were assigned or whether allocation was concealed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Masking (performance bias and detection bias) </HEADING>
<P>Participants, healthcare providers, and outcome assessors were masked in 13 (38%) of the 34 included studies (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Two studies reported being double-masked, but no details were given as to how masking was done or who was masked (<LINK REF="STD-Bloom-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laibovitz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Laibovitz 1991</LINK>). As such these studies were judged to have an unclear risk of bias for masking for all study participants and personnel. Two studies were reported as open trials and thus no masking was done (<LINK REF="STD-Adenis-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Adenis 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friedland-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Friedland 2011</LINK>). One study did not report masking (<LINK REF="STD-Sore-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sore 2002</LINK>). Studies that were unmasked or did not report masking were considered to have a high risk for bias for these parameters.</P>
<P>In addition to the 13 studies for which all study participants and personnel were masked, there were three studies in which participants were masked to treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Collum-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Collum 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yoo 2005</LINK>). Using identically packaged, coded bottles and/or distributing placebo to nonactive treatment groups was considered adequate masking of participants. Due to differences between the interventions under investigation, participants could not be masked to treatment allocation in nine studies (26%) (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Key-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Key 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luchs-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luchs 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matsumoto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matsumoto 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mori-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinna-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pinna 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wasserman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wasserman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yal_x00e7_in-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yalin 2002</LINK>). Authors of one study reported that participants were not masked (<LINK REF="STD-White-2008" TYPE="STUDY">White 2008</LINK>) and authors of two studies did not report masking participants (<LINK REF="STD-Akyol_x002d_Salman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Akyol-Salman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rubin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 2006</LINK>). Studies that were unmasked or for which masking was not reported were considered to have a risk for bias for this parameters. Authors of one study reported that participants were masked to treatment groups, but that the two eye warming masks being studied "had obvious design and appearance differences" (<LINK REF="STD-Ishida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ishida 2008</LINK>). Since there were observable differences between the interventions for the two groups, we assessed the risk of bias in masking participants as unclear for this study.</P>
<P>There were an additional four studies in which healthcare providers were masked (<LINK REF="STD-Mori-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinna-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pinna 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2008" TYPE="STUDY">White 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yoo 2005</LINK>). Masking of healthcare providers was classified as adequate when masked codes were used to assign treatment, identically packaged and coded bottles were dispensed, treatment was dispensed through a pharmacy, and/or masking of healthcare providers was reported specifically in the paper. In five studies healthcare providers were unmasked due to allocation, study methods or differences between the interventions under investigation (<LINK REF="STD-Akyol_x002d_Salman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Akyol-Salman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Key-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Key 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rubin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Authors of one study that also reported to be double-masked provided methods for masking of participants, but did not specify who else was masked or how (<LINK REF="STD-Collum-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Collum 1984</LINK>). Hence, masking for healthcare providers and outcome assessors was classified as unclear for this study. There was one study in which masking of participants was reported, but masking for other study personnel was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 1990</LINK>). For five studies in which masking of participants could not be done or was not done, masking was not reported or not done for either healthcare providers or outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Ishida-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ishida 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luchs-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Luchs 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matsumoto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matsumoto 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wasserman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wasserman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yal_x00e7_in-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yalin 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Outcome assessors were masked in three additional studies (<LINK REF="STD-Akyol_x002d_Salman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Akyol-Salman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinna-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pinna 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2008" TYPE="STUDY">White 2008</LINK>). Masking of outcome assessors was judged as adequate when study treatments were coded and/or masking of outcome assessors was reported specifically in the paper. In four studies outcome assessors were unmasked due to allocation, study outcomes, or differences between the interventions under investigation (<LINK REF="STD-Key-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Key 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mori-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rubin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 2006</LINK>).

Studies that followed ITT analysis were judged to have a low risk of bias for this parameter. ITT analysis was defined as 1) keeping participants by the intervention groups to which they were randomized, regardless of the intervention they actually received; 2) measuring outcome data on all participants; and 3) including all randomized participants in the analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

Including participants with multiple conditions was considered to introduce potential bias when allocation was not stratified by condition leading to an imbalance between groups (type I errors) or insufficient power for subgroup analyses (type II errors)</LI>
<LI>in one study (3%), every effort was made to recruit and enroll participants wearing contact lenses (<LINK REF="STD-Key-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Key 1996</LINK>). The concurrent use of contact lenses during treatment for blepharitis typically is not recommended and could introduce bias if proportionately different between treatment groups.

The distribution of use of lenses or type of lenses was not reported by treatment group</LI>

Two studies reported the proportion of participants in each treatment group who were cured or had clinical improvement in signs and/or symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Hyndiuk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hyndiuk 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-More-1968" TYPE="STUDY">More 1968</LINK>). One study reported per cent improvement of clinical signs based on a 4-point rating scale (<LINK REF="STD-Donshik-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Donshik 1983</LINK>). One study reported only P values for patient- and clinician-reported clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Laibovitz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Laibovitz 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>At day 3, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hyndiuk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hyndiuk 1990</LINK>) found overall mean sign and symptom scores to be significantly lower for the antibiotic group compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) -0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.47 to -0.33) and another study (<LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1982</LINK>) reported mean change in overall scores was not significantly different between treatment groups (MD -1.03; 95% CI not estimable) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Donshik-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Donshik 1983</LINK> noted that improvement in lid discharge was not different between groups and <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1982</LINK> reported that neither lid edema nor lid erythema were different between groups at day 3. The <LINK REF="STD-Hyndiuk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hyndiuk 1990</LINK> study, which favored antibiotics when comparing mean scores, did not show a significant effect when comparing the proportion of participants cured or improved in the antibiotic group with the placebo group (RR 1.53; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.38).</P>
<P>At day 7, five studies reported final means or mean changes from baseline in overall sign and symptom scores, three of which provided sufficient data for meta-analysis. The summary estimate (MD -0.76; 95% CI -1.30 to -0.23) suggests topical antibiotics are more effective than placebo in reducing signs and symptoms of blepharitis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>); however, this estimate is heavily influenced by the <LINK REF="STD-Hyndiuk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hyndiuk 1990</LINK> study. <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1982</LINK> reported overall mean change in scores were not significantly different between treatment groups (MD 0.84; 95% CI not estimable) and <LINK REF="STD-Donshik-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Donshik 1983</LINK> noted that improvement in lid discharge did not differ significantly between groups. The <LINK REF="STD-Hyndiuk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hyndiuk 1990</LINK> study, which was the only study to favor antibiotics at day 7, also found a statistically significant effect when comparing the proportion of participants cured or improved in the antibiotic group with the placebo group (RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.84).</P>
<P>At day 14, two studies comparing mean improvement in overall sign and symptom scores suggested a beneficial effect for topical antibiotic use compared with placebo, but were not combined in meta-analysis due to significant statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 72%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1982</LINK> reported overall mean change in scores were not significantly different between treatment groups (MD 0.20; 95% CI not estimable) and <LINK REF="STD-Donshik-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Donshik 1983</LINK> noted that improvement in lid discharge did not differ significantly between groups. The <LINK REF="STD-Behrens_x002d_Baumann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Behrens-Baumann 2006</LINK> study, which was the only individual study to favor antibiotics at day 14, reported that the proportion of participants with severe or very severe grading was significantly lower in the antibiotic group compared with the placebo group for separate assessments of lid edema, lid erythema, and meibomitis. Also, the proportion of participants with severe or very severe grading for lid debris were lower in the antibiotic group compared with the placebo group, but there was no statistically significant difference between groups. This study reported that participants rated greater improvements in ocular discomfort with antibiotic treatment than with placebo as well (P = 0.011). In <LINK REF="STD-Donshik-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Donshik 1983</LINK>, a 62% improvement for clinical rating of signs and symptoms was observed for the antibiotic group compared with 57% in the placebo group.

<P>Results of an eight-week cross-over trial showed no significant difference between topical antibiotics and placebo in treating chronic blepharitis (<LINK REF="STD-More-1968" TYPE="STUDY">More 1968</LINK>). At the end of the first four-week phase, 6/6 participants in the antibiotic group had improvement in both signs and symptoms compared with 6/7 in the placebo group (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.69).</P>

<P>Subjective improvements of participants' sensation of lubrication and smoothness during blinking were assessed with face score questionnaires. Face scores were graded 1 (happiest) through 9 (saddest).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Anterior/mixed staphylococcal and seborrheic blepharitis</HEADING>
<P>The results of interventions for treatment of blepharitis are mixed. Mixed results may be due in large part to the fact that most studies included participants with blepharitis from various etiologies.</P>
<P>When only anterior blepharitis and blepharoconjunctivitis cases were included, there was some suggestion that clinical outcomes were better with topical antibiotic versus placebo (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). However, even when evaluating studies based on anatomical location, there was a mixture of staphylococcal blepharitis and seborrheic blepharitis cases among participants included in the study population. It is likely that staphylococcal blepharitis and seborrheic blepharitis respond to antibiotics differently, leading to the potential for null bias (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 1995</LINK>). Studies measuring microbiologic outcomes demonstrated that topical antibiotics were effective in obtaining negative cultures from the ocular surface, but the clinical significance of this finding was not so clear. In terms of whether one antibiotic was superior to another, there was no difference between different kinds of antibiotics when compared directly. The most common adverse event reported with topical antibiotic use was ocular discomfort, which was reported infrequently.</P>
<P>Overall, the antibiotic studies were short-term (most were up to 14 days) and evaluated different types of topical antibiotics. There were no consistently significant differences between antibiotics compared with placebo or another type of antibiotic for clinical outcomes. One problem with assessing the clinical effectiveness of blepharitis therapies is the large placebo effect. Even among the placebo groups, some clinical improvement was observed. Furthermore, not all cultures were negative following treatment with the topical antibiotics. Therefore it is not known how bacteriologic improvements with antibiotic use translate to clinically significant effects on signs and symptoms.</P>
<P>Treatment with steroids may show clinical improvements in the short-term by masking the primary signs and symptoms of blepharitis, such as inflammation and infection. However, chronic use of steroids is not recommended due to the side effects of long-term use. Also, bacteriologic outcomes were not affected by topical steroid treatment.</P>
<P>Studies that evaluated both topical antibiotics and topical steroids did not show clinically significant improvements from baseline for either treatment individually or compared with each other. Although these studies also showed that antibiotic therapy significantly decreased bacteriologic cultures compared with steroid therapy, bacteriologic improvement was not associated with clinical improvement. Combined antibiotic plus steroid studies demonstrated the greatest effect in anterior blepharitis and blepharoconjunctivitis cases. Ocular surface cultures were significantly reduced compared with steroid alone or placebo. Side effects were not serious and most were reports of discomfort. However, treatment in these studies was short term, lasting only a few weeks. Long-term side effects of steroids, such as development of glaucoma and the formation of cataracts, can be potentially harmful.</P>
<P>Topical antifungal agents appear to be ineffective in the treatment of blepharitis as compared with antibiotics or placebo.</P>
<P>Mechanical measures using lid hygiene and/or detergents demonstrated improvements of signs and symptoms in the great majority of the participants with no side effects. However, the two studies assessing these measures used different types of detergents and comparison groups. Compliance to lid hygiene and lid scrubs may also be an issue for long-term use.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Posterior blepharitis/MGD</HEADING>
<P>Many therapies were studied for the treatment of posterior blepharitis. Due to the variation in medical and mechanical interventions under study, most comparisons of treatment were evaluated only by a single study.</P>
<P>Beneficial effects of topical azithromycin plus warm compresses were observed compared to warm compresses alone in one study; however, the study was small, open-label, and industry-funded. Later, multicenter, double-masked, phase II studies conducted by the same pharmaceutical company did not confirm these results (<LINK REF="REF-Inspire-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inspire 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oral doxycycline was observed to have an effect on clinical improvements at high (200 mg, twice daily) and low (20 mg, twice daily) doses, with adverse events occurring more frequently in the high-dose group compared with the low-dose group. Some side effects of doxycycline can be serious (e.g. liver failure, interaction with other medications, teratogenicity, etc.).</P>
<P>Topical cyclosporine was studied long-term (3 months) and showed mixed results for clinical tests (e.g. corneal staining scores, Schirmer scores, tear BUT, etc.) when compared with placebo or topical antibiotics plus steroids. However, the clinical significance of changes in test scores is questionable and may not be appreciated by patients.</P>
<P>Castor-oil-containing eyedrops were better than saline eyedrops in terms of improving tear function, especially stability. The explanation may be that posterior blepharitis is associated with poor meibum secretion and adding oily substances may help with improving tear film stability.</P>
<P>Heat application showed some benefit in terms of patient symptoms and some effectiveness regarding tear BUT. This finding can be explained by the fact that heat helps express the meibum secretion.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-04-02 16:10:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A major problem with blepharitis trials is that it is very difficult to differentiate between various types of anterior blepharitis cases, such as seborrheic, staphylococcal, and demodex-related blepharitis. Mostly the forms coexist, which is perhaps the reason that studies have failed to show consistent patterns of effectiveness.</P>
<P>Only six (18%) of the 34 included studies were published in or after 2008, when the definitions and classifications for blepharitis were updated by the American Academy of Ophthalmology (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2008</LINK>). We did not identify any study published since the report by the Definition and Classification subcommittee of the International Workshop on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction was published in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2011</LINK>). The changing definitions and classifications for blepharitis, as well as improvements in study design and methodology, over the past few years make interpreting the evidence from differing eras difficult.</P>
<P>Also, there were multiple ways outcomes were measured by the studies included in this review (e.g. subjective physician assessment, clinical tests, patient-reported improvement). Thus results for many studies could not be combined in meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Most of the studies included in this review were only two weeks or less in duration. For a chronic disease, short follow-up times do not provide evidence of a lasting effect.</P>

<P>There is no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing blepharitis. Treatment of asymptomatic patients with blepharitis remains a topic for discussion. Numerous commercial products are available to patients, although limited evidence are available to support their effectiveness. Mechanical lid hygiene and warm compresses may provide some symptomatic relief for both anterior and posterior blepharitis; however, they have not been shown to cure the condition. For flare-ups, perhaps combination therapy can be used for short periods of time. Oral antibiotics may not be appropriate for patients with severe problems due to possible side effects. Long-term treatment is necessary.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-04-11 11:41:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for blepharitis. Substantial heterogeneity between studies in the current literature make drawing conclusions on the effectiveness of current treatments difficult. Better clinical definitions and improved diagnosis are needed. Also, outcomes for future research should be based on clinically relevant outcomes and outcomes important to patients, not bacteriologic outcomes alone since it is unclear how the elimination of bacteria relates to clinical improvement for this condition. Future research aimed at comparing the effectiveness of topical antibiotics with over-the-counter lid hygiene products would be informative.</P>
<P>A randomized controlled trial designed to investigate the effectiveness of an intervention for chronic blepharitis should separate participants by type of condition, either by including only a subset of patients (e.g., patients with either staphylococcal, seborrheic, or meibomian gland dysfunction) or by stratifying randomization by type in order to minimize imbalances between groups (type I errors) and to achieve statistical power for analyses (minimize type II errors). Medical interventions and commercial products should be compared with conventional lid hygiene measures, such as warm compresses and washing of the eyelid margin, to determine effectiveness, as well as head-to-head to show comparative effectiveness between treatments. Masking of all study participants and personnel should be done when possible. Outcomes of interest should be patient-centered, such as reduction or elimination of ocular irritation, burning, tearing, or itching, and measured using validated questionnaires or scales. As this is a chronic condition, participants should be followed long-term, at least one year, to measure time to resolution of the initial episode and rates of recurrence.</P>
