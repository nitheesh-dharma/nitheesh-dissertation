<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Review question: We reviewed the evidence about the effect of weaning protocols (guidelines) used by clinicians on reducing the time that critically ill patients spent on a breathing machine.</P>
<P>Background: Helping patients to breathe with the use of a mechanical ventilator can be life saving. Yet the longer someone stays on a ventilator, the greater the likelihood of harmful effects including infection of the lungs and complications of prolonged immobility such as blood clots in the legs or lungs. It is important, therefore, to recognize early on when patients are ready to breathe for themselves so they can gradually come off the ventilator (this is called weaning). Usually, weaning is left to the judgement of clinicians, but recently protocols for weaning have been found to be safe for patients and useful for clinicians. Some studies said protocols led to better practice, but there was no clear evidence that using them actually produced beneficial results for patients.</P>
<P>Search date: The evidence is current to January 2014.</P>
<P>Study characteristics: This updated Cochrane review included 17 studies involving 2434 critically ill men and women who were being cared for in medical, surgical, neurosurgical and mixed medical/surgical intensive care units (ICUs). The studies compared the use of protocols to wean patients from the ventilator against usual practice. They were conducted in ICUs in America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The ICUs cared for patients with heart conditions, breathing difficulties, head injuries, trauma and following major surgery. In 13 studies, clinicians used weaning protocols to guide them to reduce the ventilator support. In four studies ventilator support was reduced automatically by programmed computers following a protocol.</P>
<P>Results: In comparison with usual practice without protocols, the average total time spent on the ventilator was reduced by 26%. The duration of weaning was reduced by 70% and length of stay in the ICU reduced by 11%. Using protocols did not result in any additional harms. We found considerable variation in the types of protocols used, the criteria for considering when to start weaning, the medical conditions of the patients and usual practice in weaning. This means that we cannot say exactly which protocols will work best for particular patients, but we do know they have not been beneficial in neurosurgical patients.</P>
<P>Quality of evidence: We graded the quality of the available evidence as moderate for duration of ventilation and harmful effects, and low for the duration of weaning and ICU length of stay. The reasons for our grading were that results were not consistent across the studies, and studies lacked sufficient detail about usual care practices.</P>

<P>This is an update of a review last published in Issue 5, 2010, of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. Reducing weaning time is desirable in minimizing potential complications from mechanical ventilation. Standardized weaning protocols are purported to reduce time spent on mechanical ventilation. However, evidence supporting their use in clinical practice is inconsistent.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The first objective of this review was to compare the total duration of mechanical ventilation of critically ill adults who were weaned using protocols versus usual (non-protocolized) practice.</P>
<P>The second objective was to ascertain differences between protocolized and non-protocolized weaning in outcomes measuring weaning duration, harm (adverse events) and resource use (intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, cost).</P>
<P>The third objective was to explore, using subgroup analyses, variations in outcomes by type of ICU, type of protocol and approach to delivering the protocol (professional-led or computer-driven).</P>

<P>We included 17 trials (with 2434 patients) in this updated review. The original review included 11 trials.

Reductions were most likely to occur in medical, surgical and mixed ICUs, but not in neurosurgical ICUs. Weaning duration was reduced by 70% (N = 8 trials, 95% CI 27% to 88%, P = 0.009); and ICU length of stay by 11% (N = 9 trials, 95% CI 3% to 19%, P = 0.01). There was significant heterogeneity among studies for total duration of mechanical ventilation (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 67%, P &lt; 0.0001) and weaning duration (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 97%, P &lt; 0.00001), which could not be explained by subgroup analyses based on type of unit or type of approach.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>There is evidence of reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, weaning duration and ICU length of stay with use of standardized weaning protocols. Reductions are most likely to occur in medical, surgical and mixed ICUs, but not in neurosurgical ICUs. However, significant heterogeneity among studies indicates caution in generalizing results. Some study authors suggest that organizational context may influence outcomes, however these factors were not considered in all included studies and could not be evaluated. Future trials should consider an evaluation of the process of intervention delivery to distinguish between intervention and implementation effects. There is an important need for further development and research in the neurosurgical population.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Prolonged mechanical ventilation for critically ill patients is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including physiological and psychological experiences. Consequently, in an effort to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with mechanical ventilation, clinical and research attention, over the last 20 years, has been focused on reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation, by improving the processes of ventilator weaning. For approximately 77% of patients, resuming spontaneous, unassisted breathing is accomplished easily (<LINK REF="REF-Esteban-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteban 2008</LINK>); for others it is more difficult. Patients who experience difficulty in discontinuing mechanical ventilation present significant challenges to clinicians involved in their care. These patients frequently require longer hospital stays and generally have a higher morbidity, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated lung injury and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Boles-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boles 2007</LINK>). Moreover, ventilator-dependent patients generally remain in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting, as they require specialized care and frequent monitoring. In the current climate of limited ICU bed availability, maximizing use of limited ICU resources (including nursing and equipment costs) is an important goal of providing care to critically ill patients. Thus, timely and safe discontinuation of mechanical ventilation is a desirable outcome for patients and clinicians alike.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The process leading to discontinuation of mechanical support is known as 'weaning' and has been classically defined as follows. "Weaning from mechanical ventilation represents the period of transition from total ventilatory support to spontaneous breathing" (<LINK REF="REF-Mancebo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mancebo 1996</LINK>). However, there are many interpretations of the 'period of transition' and the endpoint of 'spontaneous breathing'.</P>
<P>The transition period may take many forms, ranging from abrupt to gradual withdrawal from ventilatory support (<LINK REF="REF-Alia-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alia 2000</LINK>). Some clinicians do not view abrupt withdrawal as weaning and suggest the term 'discontinuation' as a better descriptor, with 'weaning' being used to describe the more gradual withdrawal process (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hess-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hess 2011</LINK>). There are differing schools of thought regarding this gradual process of weaning. Some clinicians maintain that the transition should be initiated gradually right from the outset of mechanical ventilation, with as much of the breathing workload transferred to the patient as tolerated; which obscures the onset of weaning. Other clinicians believe that the transition should only be attempted when the condition that indicated the need for respiratory support has significantly resolved. Another view is to provide full support during an initial period and then attempt to transfer the breathing workload to the patient when the patient's condition shows early signs of improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Marini-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marini 1995</LINK>). The work of Levine and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Levine-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 2008</LINK>) showing marked atrophy of diaphragmatic myofibrils after less than three days of ventilation would support strategies that lead to some early spontaneous breathing during the phase of mechanical ventilatory support. Gradually transferring the breathing workload requires titrating ventilatory support to the needs of the patient. Titration may mean increasing or decreasing support and may be so gradual that it leads to problems in defining the time when weaning commenced.</P>
<P>The end of the weaning process can be defined as the cessation of mechanical ventilation, which implies the return of spontaneous breathing, but the term spontaneous breathing is ambiguous. All forms of spontaneous breathing involve the initiation of each breath by the patient, and contraction of the respiratory muscles. If the patient is free from all respiratory support (disconnected from the ventilator and extubated, or disconnected but still intubated and breathing through a T-piece circuit), the depth or size of the patient's breath will depend upon the strength and duration of respiratory muscle contraction, airways resistance and lung compliance. If the patient is still connected to a ventilator, the patient-initiated breath may be augmented by mechanical (albeit minimal) assistance from the ventilator. Both these situations are considered to be spontaneous breathing. Furthermore, some clinicians view the end of the weaning process as extubation without the need for (i) reintubation and (ii) ventilatory support within the following 48 to 72 hours (<LINK REF="REF-MacIntyre-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacIntyre 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Identifying when the patient is ready to wean, and deciding on the most appropriate method of weaning is influenced by the judgement and experience of the clinician (<LINK REF="REF-Sahn-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahn 1973</LINK>). In some cases, clinicians tend to underestimate the probability of successful discontinuation of mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="STD-Strickland-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Strickland 1993</LINK>) and predictions, based on judgement alone, have low sensitivity (ability to predict success) and specificity (ability to predict failure) (<LINK REF="REF-Stroetz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroetz 1995</LINK>). Until recently, there have been few standards of care in this area based on scientifically sound data. As a result, variation exists in weaning practice. There are several options, or weaning methods, for decreasing support. They include intermittent T-piece trials involving short time periods of spontaneous breathing through a T-piece circuit; synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV) involving gradual reductions in the ventilator rate, by increments of 1 to 4 breaths/min; pressure support ventilation (PSV) involving the gradual reduction of pressure by increments of 2 to 6 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O; spontaneous breathing through a ventilator circuit with the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and combinations of these and newer options, such as bi-level, positive airway pressure. The evidence is equivocal as to which method is superior, although it has been suggested that SIMV is the least effective method (<LINK REF="REF-Brochard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brochard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esteban-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteban 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>A weaning protocol is a structured guide for reducing, or discontinuing, or both, mechanical ventilatory support, and it generally contains three components. The first component is a list of objective criteria based on general clinical factors used to help decide if a patient is ready to breathe without the help of a ventilator, often referred to as 'readiness to wean' criteria (such as that used by <LINK REF="STD-Ely-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ely 1996</LINK>). The second component consists of structured guidelines for reducing ventilatory support. This may be abrupt (for example spontaneous breathing trials) or gradual by using a stepwise reduction in support to achieve discontinuation (for example SIMV or PSV), such as used by <LINK REF="REF-Brochard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brochard 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Esteban-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteban 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kollef-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kollef 1997</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Marelich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Marelich 2000</LINK>. The third component consists of a list of criteria for deciding if the patient is ready for extubation (such as that used by <LINK REF="REF-Hendrix-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hendrix 2006</LINK>). In many ICUs, protocols are presented as written guides or algorithms and ventilator settings are manually adjusted by healthcare professionals. More recently, progress in ventilator microprocessor technology has enabled the development of computer-assisted management of ventilation and weaning. Computer ventilatory management adapts the ventilator output to the patient's needs using closed loop systems. These systems measure and interpret respiratory data in real time and provide continual adjustment of the level of assistance within targeted values. It is suggested that through enabling 'interaction' between the patient and the ventilator, the closed loop systems may improve mechanical ventilation tolerance and reduce the work of breathing (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2008</LINK>). Multiple, commercial computerized ventilation and weaning programs have been developed, including adaptive support ventilation, proportional assist ventilation and PSV(SmartCare<SUP>TM</SUP>/pressure support) (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2007</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-05 13:05:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Clinicians have different experiences, skills and weaning philosophies, thus there is potential for variation. As a result, there has been increasing interest in establishing more consistent practice in ICUs by developing and using weaning protocols that provide structured guidance. Protocols are based on the principle that the collective knowledge of a group is usually better than that of an individual. Protocols are intended to reduce variation, to improve efficiency of practice by reducing the influence of subjectivity of judgement and experience, and by seeking to apply objectivity (<LINK REF="REF-Murtagh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murtagh 2007</LINK>). Furthermore, they can empower the nurse and respiratory therapist to initiate the process of early weaning from the ventilator by identifying patients who are ready.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Our initial review of 11 trials concluded that weaning protocols are safe and effective in reducing the time spent on mechanical ventilation. Notwithstanding, we found considerable heterogeneity in results reporting total duration of ventilation and weaning duration. The variability may reflect the fact that protocols differ in more ways than in composition alone. While many protocols include readiness to wean criteria and guidelines for reducing ventilator support, the criteria applied and guidance used varied. Trials of protocolized weaning are continuing (<LINK REF="STD-Roh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Roh 2012</LINK>) and the adoption of weaning protocols is growing. Surveys show reported use in ICUs of 8% in Greece, 56% in Italy, Denmark and Norway, 61% in the UK, 68% in Switzerland and the Netherlands (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2011</LINK>), 22% in Poland (<LINK REF="REF-Kubler-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kubler 2013</LINK>), and 71% in Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2012</LINK>). For these reasons. it is important that findings from recent trials are synthesized to guide future practice.</P>
<P>In addition to weaning protocols, another key feature in the management of weaning is the use of sedation and analgesia. Mechanical ventilation is generally accompanied by administration of high doses of sedative medications, and sedative management is known to influence the duration of mechanical ventilation. Recent clinical trials evaluating sedation management strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Bucknall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucknall 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Girard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girard 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2012</LINK>) have all reported effects on the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. A systematic review of the effectiveness of protocol-directed sedation on duration of mechanical ventilation is underway (<LINK REF="REF-Aitken-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aitken 2012</LINK>); therefore this review does not include sedation protocols.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The first objective of this review was to compare the total duration of mechanical ventilation of critically ill adults who were weaned using protocols versus usual (non-protocolized) practice.</P>
<P>The second objective was to ascertain differences between protocolized and non-protocolized weaning in outcomes measuring weaning duration, harm (adverse events) and resource use (intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, cost).</P>
<P>The third objective was to explore, using subgroup analyses, variations in outcomes by type of ICU, type of protocol and approach to delivering the protocol (professional-led or computer-driven).</P>

<P>We compared two strategies to achieve discontinuation from invasive mechanical ventilation: protocolized weaning and non-protocolized weaning (or usual practice). For the purpose of this review, discontinuation was defined as the time when mechanical ventilatory support was discontinued and the patient was breathing spontaneously through a T-piece circuit or following extubation. In addition, protocolized weaning was defined as a method of limiting the duration of invasive ventilation that includes at least the first two of the following three components.</P>
<OL>
<LI>A list of objective criteria based on general clinical factors for deciding if a patient is ready to tolerate discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.</LI>
<LI>Structured guidelines for reducing ventilatory support, such as a spontaneous breathing trial or a stepwise reduction in support to achieve discontinuation (e.g. synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV) or pressure support ventilation (PSV)).</LI>
<LI>A list of criteria for deciding if the patient is ready for extubation.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We did not exclude studies that did not include formal extubation criteria as not all studies included this component; and delay in extubation may be caused by organizational factors and not necessarily by delays in weaning. Usual weaning practice was defined as the usual practice in an ICU (as stated by the authors) where no written guides were applied. Where possible, usual practice was described in the review.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>BB and KB used The Cochrane Collaboration's domain-based evaluation tool for assessing the risk of bias in included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>), in the following seven domains.</P>
<P>1. Random sequence generation</P>
<P>Random allocation sequence generation included any method that used an unpredictable sequence of allocating participants to groups, such as a random table; computer-generated random numbers; throwing dice; or shuffling envelopes.</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment</P>
<P>Adequate allocation concealment included central randomization (for example allocation by a central office unaware of participant characteristics); on-site computer system combined with allocation kept in a locked unreadable computer file accessed only after the characteristics of an enrolled participant were entered; sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes or other similar approaches that ensured the person who generated the allocation scheme did not administer it.</P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants and personel</P>
<P>We report any attempts to blind up until the point of randomization.</P>
<P>4. Blinding of outcome assessment</P>
<P>We ascertained if study outcome assessors were independent from the clinical personnel delivering or supervising the assigned intervention.</P>
<P>5. Incomplete outcome data</P>
<P>6. Selective reporting</P>
<P>7. Other bias</P>
<P>Within each study we described what was reported for each domain and contacted the authors for additional information, where necessary. We evaluated the risk of bias for each domain as follows.</P>
<P>Low risk: criteria appropriately applied and described in the report or ascertained in communication with the primary author of the study.<BR/>Unclear: criteria not described and impossible to acquire from or clarify with the author.<BR/>High risk: criteria inappropriately applied.</P>
<P>Blinding of study personnel (domain 3) is impossible in these trials and, as a result, all studies were assessed as high risk of bias in this domain. Therefore, we amended the previous version of classification of included studies as follows.</P>
<P>A - Low risk of bias: all criteria met, except domain 3.<BR/>B - Moderate risk of bias: domain 3 not met, and one or more criteria unclear.<BR/>C- High risk of bias: two or more criteria not applied or met.</P>

<P>For continuous variables (duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of weaning, ICU and hospital length of stay) the data were skewed; therefore, these data were log transformed for the primary analyses. In three studies the authors provided the means and standard deviations on the log scale (<LINK REF="STD-Ely-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ely 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Navalesi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Navalesi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2008</LINK>).

In five studies where only means and standard deviations of the unlogged data were available (<LINK REF="STD-de-Carvalho-Oliveira-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Carvalho Oliveira 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kollef-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kollef 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piotto-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Piotto 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simeone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Simeone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strickland-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Strickland 1993</LINK>) approximations were used to calculate the mean and standard deviation on the log scale using Method 1 in Higgins (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). In five studies we could only obtain outcomes reported as the median and interquartile range (<LINK REF="STD-Chaiwat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chaiwat 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krishnan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marelich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Marelich 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Namen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Namen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stahl-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stahl 2009</LINK>): we approximated the mean using the median as suggested previously (<LINK REF="REF-Hozo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hozo 2005</LINK>) and approximate standard deviation estimates were calculated from the interquartile range on the log scale as suggested in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>). The difference between the treatment and control groups in the mean of a variable on the log scale was exponentiated to give the ratio of geometric means of the variable on the unlogged scale. This was generally reported as a percentage increase (or reduction) in geometric mean in the treatment group compared with the control group for ease of understanding (see <LINK REF="REF-Bland-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1996</LINK> for more details). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Fan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fan 2013</LINK>) reported the mean with no standard deviation for duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of weaning, ICU length of stay and cost; we excluded this study from meta-analyses of these outcomes. We undertook meta-analyses for similar comparisons and the same outcomes across studies. We calculated pooled estimates of the difference in means using either the fixed-effect model or the random-effects model, depending on the degree of heterogeneity.</P>

BB and POH independently graded the evidence prior to agreement and construction of the 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE software (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>).

In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Marelich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Marelich 2000</LINK> used a stepwise reduction in PEEP, SIMV and pressure support prior to the SBT in patients ventilated for more than 72 hours, and <LINK REF="STD-Roh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Roh 2012</LINK> used a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) trial followed by gradual reduction of pressure support prior to the SBT. One trial used a weaning protocol consisting of stepwise reductions in SIMV and pressure support with extubation (<LINK REF="STD-Simeone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Simeone 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kollef-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kollef 1997</LINK> implemented different protocols in four ICUs: SBT and extubation; SIMV reduction and extubation; and pressure support reduction and extubation. Weaning parameters varied among trials. SBTs ranged from 30 to 120 minutes, delivered through a T-tube or ventilator circuit with CPAP ranging from 2 to 5 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O with or without pressure support of 6 or 7 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O. In pressure support weaning protocols, the pressure support was reduced to levels ranging from 4 to 8 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O prior to extubation. In SIMV weaning protocols, respiratory rates were reduced to between 0 and 6 breaths/minute prior to a SBT or extubation. In automated weaning protocols, the pressure support was reduced to levels between 5 or 7 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O prior to a SBT.</P>

We present the results in three sections. In section one, we present the primary analysis for total duration of mechanical ventilation, weaning duration, ICU and hospital length of stay using log-transformed data due to the skewed distribution of these outcomes. We also present subgroup analyses for type of ICU and approach on the durations of mechanical ventilation and weaning. In section two, we present a sensitivity analysis of the logged data for duration of mechanical ventilation and weaning duration that excludes studies judged at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Krishnan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piotto-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Piotto 2011</LINK>). In section three, we present a further sensitivity analysis using the mean and standard deviation prior to log-transformation for total duration of mechanical ventilation, weaning duration, ICU and hospital length of stay for all studies. We present this sensitivity analysis to show the effects without log-transformation.</P>

Pooled data, using the random-effects model because of significant (P &lt; 0.0001) and substantial heterogeneity (I² = 67%), showed a significant reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation in the protocolized weaning group (mean log -0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.46 to -0.14, P = 0.0002) equivalent to a reduction of 26% (95% CI 13% to 37%) in the geometric mean. <LINK REF="STD-Fan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fan 2013</LINK> reported a non-significant reduction of 151.52 hours for the protocolized weaning group (mean 272.01 versus 423.53, P = 0.20).</P>
<P>We performed a subgroup analysis to assess the impact of type of ICU on the total duration of mechanical ventilation. The ICU subgroups included: mixed ICUs that incorporated medical, surgical and trauma patients (<LINK REF="STD-de-Carvalho-Oliveira-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Carvalho Oliveira 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kollef-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kollef 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marelich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Marelich 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogica-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ogica 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piotto-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Piotto 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2008</LINK>); neurosurgical ICUs (<LINK REF="STD-Namen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Namen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Navalesi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Navalesi 2008</LINK>); surgical ICUs (<LINK REF="STD-Chaiwat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chaiwat 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simeone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Simeone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stahl-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stahl 2009</LINK>); and medical ICUs (<LINK REF="STD-Ely-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ely 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krishnan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Roh 2012</LINK>). Pooled data from the neurosurgical subgroup showed no difference in duration of mechanical ventilation (mean log -0.01, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.18, P = 0.93; equivalent to a 1% reduction, 95% CI 20% reduction to 18% increase in geometric mean). Pooled data in the other three subgroups showed a significant reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation in the protocolized weaning arm: mixed ICU subgroup (N = 6 trials, mean log -0.23, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.02, P = 0.03, equivalent to a 21% 95% CI 2% to 36% reduction in geometric mean); surgical ICU subgroup (N = 3 trials, mean log -0.63, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.22, P = 0.003 equivalent to a 47%, 95% CI 20% to 65% reduction in geometric mean); and medical ICU subgroup (N = 3, mean log -0.34, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.07, P = 0.01 equivalent to a 29%, 95% CI 7% to 46% reduction in geometric mean).

<P>The larger number of trials included in this updated review allowed us to perform a subgroup analysis on type of protocol (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Protocol subgroups were a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) (comprising daily assessment of readiness to wean followed by SBT) and stepwise reduction (comprising a gradual reduction in either intermittent mandatory ventilation or pressure support ventilation (PSV) with or without a SBT). We included automated systems in this latter subgroup as these involved stepwise reductions in support. Eight trials evaluated a SBT protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Chaiwat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chaiwat 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Carvalho-Oliveira-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Carvalho Oliveira 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ely-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ely 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krishnan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Namen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Namen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Navalesi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Navalesi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogica-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ogica 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piotto-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Piotto 2011</LINK>). Pooled data indicated a trend towards reduced duration of ventilation in the SBT subgroup with low heterogeneity (39%), but was not significant (mean log -0.18, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.00, P =0.05; equivalent to a 16%, 95% CI 0% to 30% reduction in geometric mean).

<P>The conclusions of our updated review remain the same as the original (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwood-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwood 2010</LINK>). In comparison with usual (non-protocolized) weaning practice, protocolized weaning significantly reduced the total duration of ventilation, weaning duration and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay without impacting on mortality or adverse events. There is significant heterogeneity among effect sizes. The evidence from trials of protocolized weaning to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults is derived from 17 trials which have a variety of settings, participants, interventions and outcome measures. The main outcome, duration of mechanical ventilation, was reported in 15 trials and data were available for seven out of eight secondary outcomes. The methodological quality of the studies varied from low to high. Fifteen trials were randomized and two were quasi-randomized.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact on ventilation duration</HEADING>
<P>In comparison with usual (non-protocolized) weaning practice, protocolized weaning significantly impacted on ventilation durations, reducing the total duration of mechanical ventilation by an average of 26% in geometric mean and weaning duration by 70%. However, substantial heterogeneity among study effect estimates (67% and 97% respectively) indicated that findings should be interpreted with caution. Subgroup analysis of total duration of mechanical ventilation by type of ICU, showed a significant difference in effect estimates between subgroups. In comparison with usual weaning practice, protocolized weaning significantly reduced the duration of ventilation in surgical (47% reduction in geometric mean), medical (29%) and mixed ICUs (21%), but not neurological ICUs (1%). There were no significant differences between subgroup effect estimates for type of delivery (professional and automated) and type of protocol (spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and stepwise reduction). However, protocolized weaning delivered by professionals significantly reduced the geometric mean duration of mechanical ventilation (23%), as did protocols consisting of stepwise reductions in ventilator support (34%). For weaning duration, there was no evidence of a difference in effect estimates for type of ICU subgroups, but there were significant differences in effects for the type of delivery and type of protocol subgroups. Protocols delivered by professionals significantly reduced weaning duration by 85%, and although automated systems showed a 29% reduction in geometric mean, this did not reach significance. The SBT protocol group showed an unsurprising reduction in geometric mean (96%) (unsurprising because the SBT duration is generally fixed at 2 hours duration), while protocols comprising stepwise reductions in support, also showed a significant, albeit smaller, reduction (37%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact on mortality and adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Protocolized weaning did not impact on ICU or hospital mortality. Neither did it impact on adverse events such as reintubation, self extubation, tracheostomy, or protracted weaning at 7, 14 and 21 days.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact on resource utilisation</HEADING>
<P>Protocolized weaning significantly reduced the mean geometric length of stay in ICUs by 11%, but with no impact on overall hospital length of stay. Basic costing exercises undertaken in four trials showed no statistically significant differences between groups in either ICU or hospital costs. However, these fail to provide a full understanding of the true impact of protocolized weaning, including costs associated with training. A cost-effectiveness analysis would be beneficial in enabling policymakers to compare the costs associated with protocolized weaning with the benefits gained.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We are confident that our search strategy obtained all available updated studies and, through contact with experts, we were also able to obtain additional studies that did not appear in the previous search. The majority of trials evaluated spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) or stepwise reduction in pressure support ventilation (PSV) protocols and thus provide a clear reflection of the evidence applicable to current weaning practice.</P>
<P>It is not easy to isolate the reasons for heterogeneity because weaning from ventilation is a complex process. It is plausible that heterogeneity may be due to contextual factors (differences in patient populations and usual practice within units); intervention factors (differences in determining readiness to wean and weaning protocols, trial fidelity); or inconsistency in measuring ventilation outcomes. A Cochrane synthesis review is in progress exploring the contribution of these factors in the trials included in this review, and on protocolized weaning in general, and may help explain the heterogeneity demonstrated in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In contrast to the original review, this updated review showed a significant impact for protocolized weaning in mixed and medical ICU groups: previously protocols only impacted favourably in the surgical group. There was one additional study in a neurological intensive care unit (ICU), but as we could not include this in the meta-analysis it is difficult to assess a change in impact. Another important contextual factor, and one that causes controversy in ICU studies of non-pharmacological interventions, is the use of the &#8216;usual care&#8217; group as a control in trials (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2007</LINK>). Usual care in ICUs may encompass a wide variety of styles. For example usual care may be standardized around high level evidence and thus represent best practice, but it may also be highly variable and include unfavourable practice (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2007</LINK>). Consequently, if the culture of an ICU is such that usual care is a standardized high level approach to weaning, albeit not formally laid out in guidelines, then it may not differ greatly from that delivered in a weaning protocol. Thus in a trial of effectiveness, the gap between usual care and protocolized weaning may be too narrow to show a significant difference between groups. For example, the <LINK REF="STD-Marelich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Marelich 2000</LINK> study was conducted in one medical and one surgical and trauma ICU, and the authors reported variable practice between units. The medical ICU had no standardized approach to weaning whereas the surgical ICU had a standardized approach to ventilatory management, although extubation was based on subjective decisions. Thus, while combined data from both units demonstrated a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation time, when data were analysed separately for each unit, the reduction in mechanical ventilation was only statistically significant in the medical ICU, where there was variability in weaning practice. Similarly, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2008</LINK> attributed their lack of effect between computer-directed weaning and non-protocolized weaning to usual practice in their ICU. They reported unlimited assessment of weaning and readiness to wean by experienced and relatively autonomous critical care nurses, a one-to-one nurse-to-patient ratio supported by 24-hour medical staff and twice-daily intensivist rounds. These examples suggest that one might not find any further beneficial effect from using weaning protocols in comparison with standardized high level approaches to weaning. Twelve of the 17 trials included in this review did not describe usual care in their control group; as a result it is impossible to determine if this was a cause of heterogeneity and, further, it limits generalizability of findings.</P>
<P>This review has highlighted inconsistency in defining outcome measures that may have contributed to heterogeneity in effects. The review noted variation in defining the start time of randomization (unreported in 44% of included studies) and criteria for determining readiness to wean. Furthermore, although readiness to wean criteria usually involved similar indicators of oxygenation, factors such as positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) varied from 5 to 8: as a consequence, the leniency or restrictiveness of criteria may have contributed to differences in effects across studies. Substantial variation in the selection and definition of ventilation outcomes is an ongoing issue that was highlighted in a recent review of trials published from 2007 to 2012 in eight main critical care journals. From 66 trials measuring duration of mechanical ventilation, 75% did not define start and endpoint measures, and prompted the authors to call for establishment of a core outcome set (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwood-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwood 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Weaning of sedation is an important accompanying feature in ventilation weaning, yet only two trials included minimal sedation as a criterion for weaning, making it difficult to ascertain if sedation management impacted on outcomes. Concerning the weaning protocols themselves, although they mainly included gradual reductions in pressure support, or SBT, or both, reflecting contemporary weaning practice, only two studies used an identical weaning protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Ely-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ely 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Namen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Namen 2001</LINK>). Even so, they reported conflicting results in the duration of mechanical ventilation and weaning that could reflect differences in the type of patient population (medical and neurosurgical) and unreported usual practice within the units.</P>
<P>A limitation of the review is that outcome data for duration of mechanical ventilation and weaning duration were skewed: this is likely why some authors reported median and interquartile ranges. In our primary analysis, the estimates were based on approximations of the data presented (as described in the methods) and this may have impacted on our analysis. However, we feel this is likely to have had negligible impact as we conducted a sensitivity analysis of the unlogged data and this had little effect on the main findings. Similarly, when high risk studies were removed from the analysis, heterogeneity and effect estimates were similar to those from the primary analysis, indicating that high risk of bias studies did not adversely impact on overall results.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence was low for weaning duration and ICU length of stay due to substantial variability in effect estimates for weaning duration and wide confidence intervals. The quality of evidence was moderate for duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality and reintubation. We rated the majority of trials as low risk of bias across all six domains with the exception of performance bias. The nature of protocolized weaning means it is not possible to blind clinicians involved in the weaning process. Only four studies fully reported the trial sufficiently to enable a clear rating of risk of bias in all domains.</P>

</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Automated computerized systems are increasingly being employed in an attempt to improve the adaptation of mechanical support to the needs of patients. Computers can continuously monitor changes in ventilation, interpret real time physiological changes and adapt ventilation in response to these changes. This is evident from the automated weaning studies included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Reardon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Reardon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stahl-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stahl 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strickland-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Strickland 1993</LINK>). However, in comparison with usual care of non-protocolized weaning, their efficacy in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation has yet to be demonstrated. It should be noted that the practice of protocolized weaning has increased to the point where it is 'usual practice' in many units. As one might expect, we are beginning to see studies that compare automated weaning with protocolized weaning practice and a review of automated versus non-automated systems summarises the findings from these trials (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2013</LINK>). Similar to this review, automated systems also impact favourably on the duration of mechanical ventilation and weaning without causing harm, but with significant heterogeneity in effect estimates.</P>
<P>A review of protocolized weaning in children (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwood-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwood 2013</LINK>) highlighted the paucity of trials in the paediatric population. Three trials reported findings from three different interventions. Only one large trial was adequately powered to detect an effect, therefore the benefits and harms of protocolized weaning on children could not be determined.</P>
<P>The paediatric review and this updated review of protocolized weaning are being augmented by a systematic review of qualitative evidence to identify contextual factors and processes that might explain the observed heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 2012</LINK>). The qualitative review will enhance these reviews by synthesizing trial-related qualitative evidence to help explain the observed heterogeneity. It will extend the reviews by undertaking a specific search for and synthesis of evidence from relevant qualitative research to address questions raised by the review. These questions concern the contextual factors (for example, ICU culture, organization, staffing levels and extent of collaboration), and their interplay, that may impact on the effective use of weaning protocols in mechanical ventilation. Both the enhancing and extending reviews of qualitative evidence will add value to the reviews of protocolized weaning by exploring questions to do with the development, delivery, uptake, implementation, experience and evaluation of weaning protocols.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>There are several important implications for practice arising from our systematic review and meta-analysis. First, the use of protocolized weaning may result in decreased total duration of mechanical ventilation, weaning duration, and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. The reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation and weaning may be due to consistent application of objective criteria for determining early readiness to wean, and a guided approach to reducing support. Similarly, the reduction in ICU stay may be attributable to the reduction in mechanical ventilation. However, in ICUs where objective criteria and guided approaches are already standard weaning practice, further beneficial effects of protocolized weaning may not be gained on these outcomes. There are insufficient studies in neurological ICUs, and studies comparing automated systems with standard practice to determine effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-11-06 08:26:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Studies included in this review varied considerably in reporting details of their intervention groups, the implementation of their intervention, and outcome measures. In many studies neither usual practice nor organizational context (for example staffing ratios and frequency of medical rounds) were described in sufficient detail. Thus it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which weaning practice differed between the intervention and control groups in the individual studies. It is important that future trials fully report the details of weaning protocols, usual practice and the context into which weaning protocols are introduced, as this would enable clinicians to gain a more accurate picture of the potential impact of weaning protocols in their own environment. From a methodological perspective, it is also important that future trials report key outcomes using standardized definitions. This will enable the effects of interventions reported in different trials to be compared in an unbiased, reliable and robust manner.</P>
<P>Given that protocolized weaning is a complex intervention with multiple interrelated and interdependent components (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwood-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwood 2006</LINK>), future research should take into account the contextual and intervention factors that are likely to impact on protocolized weaning. These need to be described in sufficient detail to enable clinicians to more readily generalize findings to their particular ICUs. We strongly recommend that trials fully evaluate the components of this complex intervention by following a framework that incorporates process evaluation (such as that advocated by the Medical Research Council; <LINK REF="REF-MRC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 2008</LINK>). This will enable an understanding of how the clinical context influences outcome, as well as provide insights to aid implementation in other settings, and an ability to separate effectiveness of the intervention from effectiveness of implementation.</P>
<P>In addition, an economic evaluation taking into consideration the cost-effectiveness of protocolized weaning, not only from the payer's perspective, but also from that of service users and society as a whole, would be useful for decision makers.</P>
<P>Further research into development and testing of protocolized weaning to aid early detection of readiness and safe weaning is required in the neurological population.</P>

<P>
<SUP>1 </SUP>The assumed risk is derived from the median reported in a large epidemiological study of characteristics and outcomes in patients (N = 4968) receiving mechanical ventilation by <LINK REF="REF-Esteban-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteban 2008</LINK>. The reported medians were used as an approximation for the means used for illustrative comparisons of all continuous variables. The table shows the mean duration of mechanical ventilation, weaning and ICU length of stay if patients are not weaning by protocol (non-protocolized weaning) and what would be expected with protocolized weaning based on the effect estimates from our review.</P>
<P>
<SUP>2</SUP> There was considerable variability in effect estimates (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%) that could not be explained by subgroup analysis although variability was lower than the previous review. The confidence interval was narrower in this review and the difference at the lower limit would still be clinically significant.</P>
<P>
<SUP>3</SUP> There was considerable variability in effect estimates (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 97%) and the wide confidence intervals indicate imprecision in results. The lower limit suggests a one hour difference in weaning that is not clinically significant.</P>
<P>
<SUP>4</SUP> There was no heterogeneity among trials effects estimates, but wide confidence intervals indicate imprecision in results.</P>
<P>
<SUP>5</SUP> There was moderate variability in effect estimates (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 50%).</P>
<P>
