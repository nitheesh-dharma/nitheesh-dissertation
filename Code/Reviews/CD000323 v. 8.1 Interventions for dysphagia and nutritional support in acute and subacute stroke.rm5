<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-09-03 11:08:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Stroke is often complicated by problems with swallowing (dysphagia) and poor nutrition. Normal oral feeding in those with swallowing problems may lead to pneumonia and an increased risk of death. Therapies to improve swallowing are designed to accelerate recovery of swallowing function and reduce the risk of developing pneumonia. We reviewed 33 studies involving 6779 patients (the average age of patients across the studies was 71 years). There was some evidence that acupuncture and behavioural interventions may reduce dysphagia but the roles of drug therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, pharyngeal electrical stimulation, physical stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation remain unclear. Liquid food may be given directly into the stomach through feeding tubes, either via the gullet, using a nasogastric tube (NGT), or directly into the stomach via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. Starting tube feeding (with either NGT or PEG) early after stroke may reduce death although the information available remains inconclusive. If longer-term feeding is required PEG feeding provides better nutrition and is more secure than a NG tube. The available trial evidence does not support the routine use of protein and energy supplements in acute stroke patients who are able to take food by mouth; supplements may show benefit in those who have signs of malnutrition, for example through reducing pressure sores.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-03 11:08:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 33 studies involving 6779 participants.</P>
<P>Swallowing therapy: acupuncture, drug therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, pharyngeal electrical stimulation, physical stimulation (thermal, tactile), transcranial direct current stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation each had no significant effect on case fatality or combined death or dependency. Dysphagia at end-of-trial was reduced by acupuncture (number of studies (t) = 4, numbers of participants (n) = 256; OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.46; P &lt; 0.0001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) and behavioural interventions (t = 5; n = 423; OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.88; P = 0.01; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 22%). Route of feeding: percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding did not differ for case fatality or the composite outcome of death or dependency, but PEG was associated with fewer treatment failures (t = 3; n = 72; OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.51; P = 0.007; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (t = 1; n = 321; OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.69; P = 0.007), and higher feed delivery (t = 1; n = 30; MD 22.00; 95% CI 16.15 to 27.85; P &lt; 0.00001) and albumin concentration (t = 3; n = 63; MD 4.92 g/L; 95% CI 0.19 to 9.65; P = 0.04; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 58%). Although looped NGT versus conventional NGT feeding did not differ for end-of-trial case fatality or death or dependency, feed delivery was higher with looped NGT (t = 1; n = 104; MD 18.00%; 95% CI 6.66 to 29.34; P = 0.002). Timing of feeding: there was no difference for case fatality, or death or dependency, with early feeding as compared to late feeding. Fluid supplementation: there was no difference for case fatality, or death or dependency, with fluid supplementation. Nutritional supplementation: there was no difference for case fatality, or death or dependency, with nutritional supplementation. However, nutritional supplementation was associated with reduced pressure sores (t = 2; n = 4125; OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.96; P = 0.03; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%), and, by definition, increased energy intake (t = 3; n = 174; MD 430.18 kcal/day; 95% CI 141.61 to 718.75; P = 0.003; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 91%) and protein intake (t = 3; n = 174; MD 17.28 g/day; 95% CI 1.99 to 32.56; P = 0.03; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 92%).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-07 10:37:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There remains insufficient data on the effect of swallowing therapy, feeding, and nutritional and fluid supplementation on functional outcome and death in dysphagic patients with acute or subacute stroke. Behavioural interventions and acupuncture reduced dysphagia, and pharyngeal electrical stimulation reduced pharyngeal transit time. Compared with NGT feeding, PEG reduced treatment failures and gastrointestinal bleeding, and had higher feed delivery and albumin concentration. Nutritional supplementation was associated with reduced pressure sores, and increased energy and protein intake.<BR/>

<P>Dysphagia after stroke is common, affecting 27% to 64% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Odderson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odderson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smithard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smithard 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2006a</LINK>). Half of these patients will recover within two weeks; some will die and others will require long-term feeding with significant impairment of function, recovery, and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Barer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barer 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smithard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smithard 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2004</LINK>). Complications of dysphagia include aspiration leading to chest infection and pneumonia, malnutrition, inability to rehabilitate, increased risk of infection, prolonged length of stay in hospital, and an increased risk of death (<LINK REF="REF-Smithard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smithard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Odderson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odderson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finestone-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finestone 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smithard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smithard 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martino-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martino 2005</LINK>). Dysphagia improves spontaneously in many stroke patients although at one month after stroke 15% of patients still have swallowing problems (<LINK REF="REF-Smithard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smithard 1993</LINK>). The early identification and management of dysphagia has been shown to reduce pneumonia rates (<LINK REF="REF-Odderson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odderson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hinchey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hinchey 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Under-nutrition is common in stroke patients at the time of their admission (8% to 28%) and worsens during their hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Axelsson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Axelsson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gariballa-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gariballa 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FOOD-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">FOOD 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crary-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crary 2006</LINK>). Malnutrition is associated with increased mortality, length of hospital stay (thereby increasing costs), inability to rehabilitate, and poor functional status (<LINK REF="REF-Smithard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smithard 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finestone-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finestone 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gariballa-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gariballa 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Correia-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Correia 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FOOD-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">FOOD 2003</LINK>). Whether and how food should be supplemented in stroke patients remains unclear.</P>
<P>Under-nutrition and dysphagia after a stroke are risk factors for poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, treatment of these conditions may be beneficial.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-03 11:08:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interventions for treating dysphagia are often administered by speech and language therapists (SLTs). These interventions involve the modification of fluid and food consistencies, postural techniques, swallowing exercises, and stimulation of oral and pharyngeal structures (<LINK REF="REF-Lazarra-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazarra 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Logemann-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Logemann 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Logemann-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Logemann 1993</LINK>). Local stimulation techniques include thermal and electrical stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are also under investigation (<LINK REF="REF-Power-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Power 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamdy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamdy 2006</LINK>). Acupuncture techniques are used routinely in some countries.</P>
<P>A number of types of pharmacological agents (capsaicin, black pepper oil, cabergoline, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and nifedipine) have also been studied in patients (<LINK REF="STD-Ebihara-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ebihara 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arai-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Arai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arai-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Arai 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebihira-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ebihira 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebihira-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ebihira 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebihara-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ebihara 2006</LINK>), mostly with chronic or mixed aetiology dysphagia.</P>
<P>The nutritional intake of patients with dysphagia may be managed by using modified diet consistencies or tube feedings. For the latter, tube feedings can be inserted in the nose and positioned in the stomach (nasogastric tube (NGT)), jejunum (nasojejunal tube (NJT)) or surgically placed in the stomach (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)), radiologically inserted gastrostomy (RIG) tube feeding, or parenteral (intravenous (iv)) feeding. Insertion of an NGT is relatively easy, but requires training and awareness of the risks, which, although low (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Mahony-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Mahony 1995</LINK>), have been highlighted by safety alerts from the UK National Patient Safety Agency (<LINK REF="REF-NPSA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NPSA 2005</LINK>). Many patients find NGTs uncomfortable, have poor understanding secondary to their stroke, and repeatedly pull out the tube resulting in interruption of feeding and subsequent worsening of their nutritional state. PEG insertion is an invasive procedure and can be complicated by bleeding, local infection, peritonitis, perforation, and aspiration leading to pneumonia and increased mortality in older stroke patients (<LINK REF="REF-Wanklyn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wanklyn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCEPOD-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEPOD 2004</LINK>). PEG is more acceptable and less irritating to patients and is superior in delivery of feed and maintaining nutritional status in long-term dysphagic patients with traumatic brain damage and stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Wicks-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wicks 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Norton 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Erdil-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erdil 2005</LINK>). Radiologically inserted equivalents such as RIG are available, but are less commonly used. It remains unclear whether PEG is superior to NGT in patients with acute stroke, the ideal time to start feeding following stroke onset, and after what time period PEG tubes are best inserted. The role of methods such as mittens for restraint, nasal bridles for holding NGT in place, and NJTs remains unclear. Intravenous feeding of dysphagic patients is generally not used unless there is enteral failure because of high complication rates through infection and thromboembolism.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-03 11:08:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These physical and pharmacological techniques may help recovery of dysphagia following stroke. In addition, they might hasten the natural recovery process. However, the improvement in swallowing and other measures could simply be because of the natural recovery process. Similarly, feeding, fluid, or nutritional supplementation may enhance stroke recovery or may accelerate the natural recovery process or improvements may only be because of natural recovery.<B> </B>

<P>It remains unclear whether patients managed by these physical and pharmacological techniques fare better than those receiving no therapy.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-09-03 11:13:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 33 studies that assessed feeding and swallowing treatment strategies in stroke patients. A further 14 studies are ongoing (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eighteen completed studies assessed the effect of swallowing therapy in patients with post-stroke dysphagia. A variety of stimulatory techniques have been tested - acupuncture, behavioural therapy, drug therapy, NMES, PES, physical stimulation, TDCS, and TMS. None of the techniques showed, individually, significant effects on functional outcome (primary outcome) or case fatality, albeit each based on limited data. Both acupuncture and behavioural interventions significantly reduced dysphagia at the end of trial. In the absence of significant effects on the primary outcome, significant findings in secondary and explanatory outcomes may reflect chance (e.g. owing to multiple comparisons) and further trials are needed to test these observations.</P>
<P>Limited evidence from five studies suggested that there might be a trend towards a lower death rate with PEG as compared with NGT feeding, although the results were heterogeneous and largely reflected the results from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Norton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Norton 1996</LINK>) where timings for NG feeding were much later than current practice. PEG feeding appeared to improve overall delivery of feed.</P>
<P>The data related to timing of feeding suggested that enteral nutrition should be commenced earlier (within seven days) rather than later (<LINK REF="STD-FOOD-2-2005" TYPE="STUDY">FOOD 2 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nutritional supplementation involving seven studies was associated with a non-significant reduction in case fatality although, again, considerable heterogeneity existed. Pressure sores were significantly lower with nutritional supplementation. However there was no effect on death or dependency, length of stay in hospital, or albumin concentration. Albumin is a poor marker of nutritional status and more closely relates to sepsis, severe illness, and inflammatory conditions. Several studies assessing nutritional supplementation have provided data on albumin levels and it was the main reason for adding this biochemical indicator into the present version of this review. Studies included post-stroke patients irrespective of their swallowing status and had variable baseline nutritional status. Of four studies, the first recruited under-weight stroke patients (<LINK REF="STD-Rabadi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rabadi 2008</LINK>), the second recruited older (over 65 years) stroke patients (<LINK REF="STD-Ha-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ha 2010</LINK>), the third trial recruited a small number of under-nourished patients (<LINK REF="STD-FOOD-1-2005" TYPE="STUDY">FOOD 1 2005</LINK>), and the fourth recruited patients only with under-nutrition (<LINK REF="STD-Gariballa-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gariballa 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>No studies reported data on food intake using calories or volume of feed. This measurement would be useful concordance with the reported energy intake (kcals/day) consumption measures that are already reported in this review, especially during transition from non-oral feeding routes to oral dietary consumption (liquids or thickened liquids) of high-calorie supplements.</P>
<P>Results of the present analysis were subject to several caveats. First, we excluded 108 studies from the analysis. One common reason for exclusion was that studies compared two active treatments without having a control or placebo. Therefore, we would encourage trialists to design a control or placebo group for future trials. Lack of uniformity in outcome measures and lack of data on clinical outcomes, such as dependency, mortality, institutionalisation, and chest infections, has led us to exclude many trials. These trials have used various swallowing assessment techniques, cortical excitability techniques, and videofluoroscopic measurements. In future, trialists should be encouraged to report clinical outcomes. Second, a further 38 studies are awaiting assessment and we acknowledge that this is a significant number of publications that may have the potential to affect the results of the review. We will seek full-text articles for these studies and we will add them to the review as soon as possible. Third, with regard to acupuncture, data from the three studies may have been confounded owing to the use of 'routine' acupuncture or a different type of acupuncture as control, variation in the delivery of therapy, and the risk of language bias since the majority of acupuncture literature is only available in full in Chinese language journals. Fourth, the risk of bias assessments were completed for newly added studies in this update; however, these were incomplete for some studies that were already in the review, mainly because the publications did not provide the relevant information.</P>
<P>In addition, the present analysis included studies up to six months from stroke onset. However, in future, it may be useful to analyse acute and rehabilitation studies separately.</P>
<P>Ongoing trials should add substantially to the existing data (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>).</P>

<P>Acupuncture and behavioural therapy (as provided by SLTs) may reduce dysphagia, although the components of each that are effective remain unclear. In the short term, the available evidence suggests that survival may be better if feeding is started earlier, and there is no clear advantage of PEG over NG feeding. For those patients who require long-term nutritional support (feeding beyond six months) PEG feeding results in fewer treatment failures and gastrointestinal bleeding and better feed delivery. Finally, nutritional supplements do not appear to be of value to the majority of patients except for those who are admitted malnourished or possibly in those who are at particular risk of malnourishment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-15 09:57:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research is needed to discover which components of swallowing therapy, including acupuncture, are beneficial. Research studies into dysphagia and under-nutrition need to ensure that standardised outcome measures are used to allow comparison of trials. However, measuring nutritional status is difficult and there are no indicators validated in the stroke population. Reporting of proportions of patients who develop pneumonia or have signs of aspiration should be an important outcome measure in all dysphagia and feeding-related trials. Few studies (<LINK REF="STD-FOOD-1-2005" TYPE="STUDY">FOOD 1 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FOOD-2-2005" TYPE="STUDY">FOOD 2 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FOOD-3-2005" TYPE="STUDY">FOOD 3 2005</LINK>) assessed quality of life, which has relevance when balancing the risks and benefits of interventions in severely disabled stroke survivors. In addition, several studies have compared active treatments without a control group and were excluded from this review. For future studies we recommend trialists include a control or placebo group.</P>
<P>A number of studies assessing interventions for dysphagia and nutritional support are ongoing and these will add further information on this important research question (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>). A number of studies of mixed groups of chronic dysphagia have been done or are ongoing: a systematic review of these studies may inform the management of acute and subacute dysphagia post stroke.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Modification of analysis methodology</HEADING>
<P>The analysis methodology was changed from fixed-effect to random-effects models (OR, MD) since significant trial and statistical heterogeneity were present. Three studies had more than one intervention group (<LINK REF="REF-Yuan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yuan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carnaby-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carnaby 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jing-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jing 2007</LINK>) equating with different treatment intensities. In these cases the low-intensity (middle) groups were divided and data from the study entered as two data sets (e.g. data set 1: medium (M), low (L), or none, and data set 2: high (H), medium (M)).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Modification of type of stroke patients</HEADING>
<P>To fit the timing of interventions after stroke better, we included subacute trials so that trials enrolling patients within six months were included. (Previously, subacute trials were variably included or excluded depending on what proportions of participants were enrolled acutely.)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Addition or modification of outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>We divided swallowing therapy into subcategories: acupuncture, drug therapy, NMES, PES, physical stimulation (thermal, tactile), TDCS, and TMS.</P>
<P>We added additional outcome measures, especially focusing on intermediate outcomes: pneumonia rates, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pressure sores. We divided swallowing therapy outcomes into relevant types of intervention (e.g. acupuncture, behavioural, drug therapy, and electrical stimulation). Outcomes related to improvement of dysphagia remained as listed with dysphagia at end of trial. However, we also included changes in some measurements on videofluoroscopy (pharyngeal transit time) and changes of swallow scores. We added food intake (as calories or volume) as an outcome measure. Discharge destination was included within the outcome 'institutionalisation'; the number of patients discharged to long-term care.</P>
