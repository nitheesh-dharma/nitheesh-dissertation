<BODY MODIFIED="2009-01-22 15:36:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Cough is a very common and troublesome symptom of respiratory disease. Non-specific cough has been defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2001</LINK>) and is common in childhood. The majority of these children have no signs of other current disease processes and, in the absence of research to guide clinical practice, are treated with a variety of therapies. They present a major management problem and cause considerable anxiety to parents. </P>
<P>Treatment of cough is problematic, and many over-the-counter medications are readily available and widely used. These include anti-tussives, mucolytics and anti-histamines, though there is no good evidence for their effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 2002</LINK>). Two randomised controlled trials have been carried out on the use of asthma medication, (inhaled salbutamol and corticosteroids), in children with isolated, chronic cough, but neither recommended using these therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Davies-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1999</LINK>). Antibiotics are frequently prescribed with variable effect. Difficulties in the interpretation of drug trials lie in the fact that cough usually resolves spontaneously, i.e. the period effect.</P>
<P>Non-pharmacological treatments, to compliment pharmacological therapies, are also very popular. There is a wide variety available and this is a growing market. These include air modifiers, e.g. ionisers, vaporisers, humidifiers, air filters, regular vacuuming and other methods for dust reduction, which are mainly used in the home. Ionisers remove particles from the air, which are likely to include airborne allergens and smoke particles, via electrostatic precipitation. A previous Cochrane review on ionisers in asthma concluded that their use cannot be recommended, (<LINK REF="REF-Blackhall-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackhall 2003</LINK>). One study reviewed showed an increase in the frequency of nighttime cough during the ionisation period and recommended that this be looked at further (<LINK REF="STD-Warner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 1993</LINK>). Many of these therapies are carried out without good evidence for their use. There is a paucity of randomised controlled trials in this area, and many studies in the literature are based on case reports. A systematic review examining the efficacy of air modification modalities for prolonged, non-specific cough in children would be useful.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-28 14:20:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>From the title, abstract, or descriptors, three reviewers (DED, ME &amp; ABC) independently reviewed literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials for full review. Searches of bibliographies and texts were conducted to identify additional studies. From the full text, using specific criteria, the same two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion. Agreement was measured using kappa statistics, where appropriate. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-28 14:21:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Trials that satisfied the inclusion criteria were to be reviewed and the following information recorded: study setting, year of study, source of funding, patient recruitment details (including number of eligible children), inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomisation and allocation concealment method, numbers of participants randomised, blinding (masking) of participants, care providers and outcome assessors, type of non-pharmacological therapy used, duration of therapy, co-interventions, numbers of patients not followed up, reasons for withdrawals from study protocol (clinical, side-effects, refusal and other), details on side-effects of therapy, and whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible. Data was to be extracted on the outcomes described previously. Further information was to be requested from the authors where required.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-07-28 14:21:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Studies included in the review were to undergo quality assessment performed independently by all reviewers. Four components of quality were to be assessed:<BR/>1. Allocation concealment. Trials were to be scored as: Grade A: Adequate concealment, Grade B: Unclear, Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment. (Grade A = high quality).<BR/>2. Blinding. Trials were to be scored as: Grade A: Participant and care provider and outcome assessor blinded, Grade B: Outcome assessor blinded, Grade C: Unclear, Grade D: No blinding of outcome assessor (Grade A, B = high quality).<BR/>3. Reporting of participants by allocated group. Trials were to be scored as: Grade A: The progress of all randomised children in each group described, Grade B: Unclear or no mention of withdrawals or dropouts, Grade C: The progress of all randomised children in each group clearly not described. (Grade A = high quality).<BR/>4. Follow-up. Trials were to be scored as: Grade A: Outcomes measured in &gt;90% (where withdrawals due to complications and side-effects are categorised as treatment failures), Grade B: Outcomes measured in 80-90%, Grade C: Unclear, Grade D: Outcomes measured in &lt;80%. (Grade A = high quality).<BR/>While only the allocation concealment quality assessment was to be displayed in the meta-analysis figures, all assessments were to be included in the "Characteristics of included studies" table. Inter-reviewer reliability for the identification of high quality studies for each component was to be measured by the Kappa statistic.</P>
<P>Each study was to be also assessed using a 1 to 5 scale described by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>, and summarised as follows:<BR/>Was the study described as randomised? (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>Was the study described as double blind? (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts? (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>Was the method of randomisation clearly described and appropriate? (1=yes; 0=no)<BR/>Was the method of double blinding well described and appropriate? (1=yes; 0=no)</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-07-28 14:21:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, relative and absolute risk reductions were to be calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This analysis assumes that children not available for outcome assessment have not improved (and probably represents a conservative estimate of effect). An initial qualitative comparison of all the individually analysed studies was to examine whether pooling of results (meta-analysis) was reasonable. This took into account differences in study populations, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions, outcome assessment, and estimated effect size.</P>
<P>The results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported any of the outcomes of interest were to be included in the subsequent meta-analyses. The summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (fixed effects model) were to be calculated using the inverse of the variance of each study result for weighting (Cochrane statistical package, RevMan version 4.1). The number needed to treat was to be calculated using the summary odds ratio and the average control event rate described in the relevant studies. The cough indices were assumed to be normally distributed, continuous variables so the mean difference in outcomes could be estimated (weighted mean difference). If studies reported outcomes using different measurement scales, the standardised mean difference was to be estimated. Any heterogeneity between the study results was to be described and tested to see if it reached statistical significance using a chi-squared test. The 95% confidence interval estimated using a random effects model was to be included whenever there were concerns about statistical heterogeneity.</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>No randomised controlled trials comparing interventions of air modification in children with non-specific cough were identified. Cohort studies were also not available and thus no guide is available to guide any time response. </P>

<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on the evidence currently available from randomised controlled trials, a recommendation can not be given for air modification interventions in the treatment of prolonged, non-specific cough in children.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the popularity of air modification interventions, randomised controlled trials of these interventions to determine the effectiveness in treating children with non-specific cough are clearly needed. Trials should be parallel studies and double blind, given the known problems in studying cough, specifically the large placebo and time period effects (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1999</LINK>). Outcome measures for the clinical studies on cough should be clearly defined using validated subjective data and supported by objective data when possible.</P>
