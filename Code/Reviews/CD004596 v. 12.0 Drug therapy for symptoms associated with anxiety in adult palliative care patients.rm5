<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We aimed to answer the question "how good are drugs at treating anxiety and worry in adults who have an illness which is getting worse and are in the last year of their life?"</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Anxiety or worry is a common problem for people who have an illness which is getting worse and are in the last year of their life. People may be anxious for many reasons. These reasons include being worried about pain and treatment, having to rely on other people to help them and having to face death. Anxiety can make it difficult for people to cope with their illness. Anxiety can make other problems worse and harder to manage, problems such as pain or feeling short of breath. For people who are nearing the end of their life due to illness, it is important to reduce their worry if possible. The use of some medicines may help to reduce anxiety. However, anxiety in people who are nearing the end of life has not be studied very much. People with anxiety often do not have their anxiety properly treated.</P>
<P>We searched for studies which looked at how good medicines were at reducing worry in adults nearing the end of their life. We were interested in studies that compared use of a medicine to no medicine, another medicine or a different dose of that medicine, or treatments such as talking to someone or relaxation therapy. We were interested in studies that measured anxiety. We were interested in trials designed to ensure that participants had an equal chance of receiving any of the treatments being tested in each trial. This review was first done in 2004 and updated in 2012. This is the second update. We searched to May 2016 for studies to include in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found no studies to include in this review. No studies were found for the original 2004 review or for the 2012 update. There is a lack of studies assessing the effect of drugs on reducing anxiety in adults who are nearing the end of their life. We found two relevant studies which may be included in a future update, but we need more information before we can make a judgement. Anxiety can have a big impact on how a person can cope with their illness, and we therefore need to know how to reduce their anxiety. Good-quality studies on how to reduce anxiety are needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-16 14:22:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004 (Issue 1) and previously updated in 2012 (Issue 10). Anxiety is common in palliative care patients. It can be a natural response to the complex uncertainty of having a life-limiting illness or impending death, but it may represent a clinically significant issue in its own right.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-05-16 14:22:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of drug therapy for treating symptoms of anxiety in adults with a progressive life-limiting illness who are thought to be in their last year of life.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-16 14:22:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We ran the searches for this update to May 2016. We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsychLIT (Silver Platter) and PsycINFO (Ovid). We searched seven trials registers and seven pharmaceutical industry trials registers. We handsearched the conference abstracts of the European Association of Palliative Care.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-05-16 14:22:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials which examined the effect of drug therapy for the treatment of symptoms of anxiety in adult palliative care patients, that is, people with a known progressive life-limiting illness that is no longer responsive to curative treatment, including advanced heart, respiratory and neurological diseases (including dementia). Comparator treatments included placebo; another drug therapy or different dose schedule; or a non-drug intervention such as counselling, cognitive behaviour therapies or relaxation therapies.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-05-16 14:22:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant papers for inclusion in the review. We sought full-text reports for all papers retained at this stage and two reviews authors independently assessed these for inclusion in the review. We planned to assess risk of bias and extract data including information on adverse events. We planned to assess the evidence using GRADE and to create a 'Summary of findings' table.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-16 14:22:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update, we identified 707 potentially relevant papers and of these we sought the full-text reports of 10 papers. On examination of these full-text reports, we excluded eight and two are awaiting classification as we have insufficient information to make a decision. Thus, in this update, we found no studies which met our inclusion criteria. For the original review, we identified, and then excluded, the full-text reports of six potentially relevant studies. For the 2012 update, we sought, and excluded, two full-text reports. Thus, we found no studies that assessed the effectiveness of drugs to treat symptoms of anxiety in palliative care patients.</P>

<P>There is a lack of evidence to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of drug therapy for symptoms of anxiety in adult palliative care patients. To date, we have found no studies that meet the inclusion criteria for this review. We are awaiting further information for two studies which may be included in a future update. Randomised controlled trials which assess management of anxiety as a primary endpoint are required to establish the benefits and harms of drug therapy for the treatment of anxiety in palliative care.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-05-16 14:22:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is the second update of the review "Drug therapy for anxiety in adult palliative care patients" originally published in Issue 1, 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2004</LINK>) of the Cochrane Library and published as a first update in Issue 10, 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Candy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candy 2012)</LINK>.</P>
<P>Anxiety can be an intractable and crippling condition. It impacts on the person's ability to cope emotionally and to function socially, and may make physical symptoms more difficult to manage (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2010</LINK>). In the advanced stages of a progressive, life-limiting illness it may also manifest with concomitant depression and result in the person experiencing even greater difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2007</LINK>). The symptoms of anxiety include feelings of apprehension, fear, irritability and tension. Cognitively, anxiety manifests itself as excessive worry or difficulty concentrating. Behavioural symptoms involve avoidant or compulsive tendencies, and physical and somatic symptoms include diarrhoea, sweating, restlessness, fatigue, and insomnia. People may also present with more acute symptoms including palpitations, tachycardia, and shortness of breath (<LINK REF="REF-Thielking-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thielking 2003</LINK>). Anxiety is a term for a number of disorders, specifically generalised anxiety disorders (GAD), substance-induced anxiety, adjustment disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, specific phobias such as in response to medical interventions, panic disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_5-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-5 2013</LINK>). GAD and panic disorder were found in one study to be the most common anxiety disorders in advanced disease (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2007</LINK>). The importance of a holistic approach to managing all symptoms including anxiety has been reaffirmed by frameworks around palliative and end of life care including Ambitions for Palliative and End of Life Care (<LINK REF="REF-National-Palliative-and-End-of-Care-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Palliative and End of Care 2015</LINK>) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on end of life care (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011a</LINK>).</P>
<P>In people with a progressive life-limiting illness, anxiety can be a natural reaction to the extraordinary psychological and physical challenges to be faced including the prognostic and treatment uncertainties often associated with the situation. The prevalence of symptoms of excessive anxiety is under researched, but it is one of the most common reasons for a psychiatric consultation in this patient group (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 2007</LINK>). Anxiety can increase because of a broad range of concerns faced, such as how well symptoms will be managed, increasing dependency on other people, increased social isolation, confrontation with existential issues, and a growing inability to support and be with family and friends. Anxiety may also occur as the result of poorly controlled symptoms, such as pain, or the use of medications. Despite these known risks, anxiety in terminally ill people is underdiagnosed and undertreated, and is less extensively researched than depression (<LINK REF="REF-Kolva-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolva 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the challenges in palliative care is to distinguish between excessive or maladaptive anxiety, and normal distress. There are numerous causes; in particular, it has been highly correlated with uncontrolled pain (<LINK REF="REF-Payne-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 1995</LINK>). In addition, many studies looking at psychiatric states in people with a life-limiting diagnosis do not clearly separate their assessments of depression and anxiety states or define clearly their study populations with respect to where a person is on their illness journey. This makes it more difficult to identify if anxiety is associated with specific stages in an illness journey, such as the palliative phase.</P>
<P>Anxiety may be a manifestation of a change in metabolic state such as hypoxia or hypoglycaemia, or in the dying phase (last 48 hours of life) as part of the result of multiple organ failure. Certain medications commonly used in caring for people near the end of life may produce symptoms that can be confused with anxiety, for example, akathisia or motor restlessness. These include phenothiazines (e.g. prochlorperazine), butyrophenones (e.g. haloperidol), methotrimeprazine and metoclopramide. Abrupt discontinuation of certain substances can also lead to withdrawal and precipitate an anxiety state, for instance alcohol, nicotine, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, clonidine, corticosteroids, opioids and sedative-hypnotics (<LINK REF="REF-Maguire-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maguire 1993</LINK>). Numerous other medications and substances have been associated with anxiety symptoms and, therefore, a thorough medication history should always precede changes in a drug therapy regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-16 14:22:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While there are clinical guidelines for the treatment of clinically significant anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE--2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>), few are specific to palliative care where treatments may need to be different because of the added psychological and physical burden of living with a terminal disease (<LINK REF="REF-National-Consensus-Project-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Consensus Project 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE--2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>). Treatment in palliative care can include behavioural techniques, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (<LINK REF="REF-Moorey-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moorey 2009</LINK>), and drug therapy. In deciding on treatment options, the clinician has to consider whether a person has both sufficient energy to engage with non-pharmacological interventions and the time needed to establish the benefit of such interventions. In deciding whether a pharmacological approach may be useful, the severity of the person's symptoms and the degree to which they interfere with overall function and well-being are important factors to consider. In addition, the clinician needs to assess whether the person has compromised hepatic and renal function, and must also consider the potential adverse effects of the drug therapy. Short-acting benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and oxazepam, are often the drugs of choice in terminally ill people (<LINK REF="REF-Breitbart-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breitbart 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noyes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noyes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 2007</LINK>). However, they may not be suitable for everyone because of adverse effects such as excessive sedation and confusion, which are associated with an increased risk of falls. Furthermore, if benzodiazepines are given for longer than a few weeks, there is the potential risk of physical dependency. The palliative care literature lists a variety of other potentially useful agents in the management of anxiety including antidepressants, buspirone, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, hydroxyzine, levomepromazine, ketamine and atypical antipsychotic drugs (e.g. olanzapine, risperidone) (<LINK REF="REF-Khojainova-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khojainova 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mintzer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mintzer 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-05-16 14:22:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review explores the evidence for the effectiveness of drugs to treat anxiety in palliative care patients. These medications have a variety of mechanisms of action, including some drugs where the exact mechanism is unknown. Drug therapy for treatment of anxiety can be considered to work from two distinct approaches. The first is related to the mechanism of action at the level of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. These include dopamine, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), noradrenaline and serotonin.</P>
<P>The second approach is aimed at reducing the physical symptoms of anxiety that result from autonomic hyperactivity, such as tremors and palpitations. In some instances, it is these physical manifestations that worsen the cognitive aspects of anxiety, such as an inability to concentrate or sense of foreboding. The use of drugs such as beta-blockers, which slow the heart rate, may reduce or eliminate these physical manifestations and so reduce the overall impact of anxiety. The use of agents to treat physical manifestations may reduce or possibly eliminate the need for agents aimed at altering neurotransmitter systems.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-05-16 14:22:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anxiety is a distressing condition that is particularly common and troublesome for people dealing with the advanced stages of a life-limiting condition. Excessive anxiety can manifest itself as both physical and emotional symptoms and can reduce a person's ability to cope physically and mentally with the life-limiting condition. Drugs represent one way of allaying a person's anxiety, but choosing the most appropriate drug is dependent on the clinician having access to evidence reviewing the effectiveness of drugs for anxiety in people with life-limiting conditions. To our knowledge prior to the original review in 2004 there had been no systematic search of the international literature for evidence regarding the effectiveness of drug therapy for anxiety disorders in palliative care patients.</P>

<P>For the purposes of the review, we defined palliative care patients as people with a progressive, life-limiting illness, no longer responsive to disease-modifying treatments who were thought to be in the last year (or so) of life and were, or would be, eligible to receive palliative care. We did not include studies in which participants were in the last 24 to 48 hours of life. At this time, symptoms of anxiety may also be in part a manifestation of irreversible processes such as multiple organ failure, and treatment may differ from that considered in earlier phases of the disorder.</P>

<P>We planned for two review authors (SS and CM) to independently assess risk of bias for each study, using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), with any disagreements resolved by discussion. We planned to complete a 'Risk of bias' table for each included study using the 'Risk of bias' tool in Review Manager 5 (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=z1308011321235400927252992551715&amp;format=REVMAN_NOTES#REF-RevMan-2014">RevMan 2014</A>).</P>
<P>We aimed to assess the following for each study.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). We planned to assess the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); unclear risk of bias (method used to generate sequence not clearly stated). We planned to exclude studies using a non-random process (e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number).</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). The method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment determines whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment, or changed after assignment. We planned to assess the methods as: low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); unclear risk of bias (method not clearly stated). We aimed to exclude studies that did not conceal allocation (e.g. open list).</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). We planned to assess the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We aimed to assess methods as: low risk of bias (study stated that it was blinded and described the method used to achieve blinding, such as identical tablets matched in appearance or smell, or a double-dummy technique); unclear risk of bias (study stated that it was blinded but did not provide an adequate description of how it was achieved). Studies that were not double-blind were considered to have high risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). We aimed to assess the methods used to blind study participants and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We planned to assess the methods as: low risk of bias (study had a clear statement that outcome assessors were unaware of treatment allocation, and ideally described how this was achieved); unclear risk of bias (study stated that outcome assessors were blind to treatment allocation but lacked a clear statement on how it was achieved). We considered studies where outcome assessment was not blinded as having a high risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias). We aimed to assess whether primary and secondary outcome measures were prespecified and whether these were consistent with those reported. We aimed to assess selective reporting as: low risk of bias (studies reported primary and secondary outcomes); high risk of bias (not all prespecified outcomes reported or only for certain data collection time points).</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data). We planned to assess the methods used to deal with incomplete data as: low risk of bias (less than 10% of participants did not complete the study or used 'baseline observation carried forward' analysis), or both; unclear risk of bias (used 'last observation carried forward' analysis); high risk of bias (used 'completer' analysis).</LI>
<LI>Size of study (checking for possible biases confounded by small size). We aimed to assess studies as being at low risk of bias (200 participants or greater per treatment arm); unclear risk of bias (50 to 199 participants per treatment arm); high risk of bias (fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm)</LI>

<P>We planned that two review authors (SS and CM) would independently rate the quality of the outcomes.

<P>The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The GRADE system uses the following criteria for assigning grade of evidence:</P>
<UL>
<LI>high: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect;</LI>
<LI>moderate: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different;</LI>
<LI>low: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect;</LI>
<LI>very low: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We planned to decrease the grade rating by one (-1) or two (-2) if we identified:</P>

<P>We found no studies assessing the effectiveness of drug therapy for treating symptoms of anxiety in adults with a progressive life-limiting illness and who were thought to be in their last year of life. There was a lack of RCTs; while we identified five RCTs, three studies assessed depression rather than anxiety and were thus excluded. There are two studies awaiting classification which may be included in a future update.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-05-16 14:22:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We undertook a comprehensive search for studies, including searching trials registers and handsearching of conference abstracts with no restrictions on language of study reports. One potential problem we encountered with identifying papers for inclusion was that when first reading a paper the title and abstract might suggest that the study participants were experiencing with anxiety but, on closer inspection, participants were assessed using scales which predominantly measured depression and thus studies did not meet our inclusion criteria.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-05-16 14:22:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One systematic review of anxiety therapy for palliative care patients with cancer was undertaken at a similar time to the first update of this Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-N_x00fc_bling-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nübling 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-N_x00fc_bling-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nübling 2012</LINK> included four RCTs in their review but stated that they did not make recommendations for pharmacological treatments based on the findings of these four studies because of "deficiencies in the studies or the analyses." All four studies were excluded from the original Cochrane Review of 2004 as study participants were not considered those of interest for this review. <LINK REF="REF-Traeger-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Traeger 2012</LINK> examined the evidence for treatment of anxiety in people with cancer and identified two of the studies included in the <LINK REF="REF-N_x00fc_bling-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nübling 2012</LINK> review. <LINK REF="REF-Traeger-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Traeger 2012</LINK> concluded that finding evidence for effective treatments of anxiety in people with cancer is challenging as anxiety is a complex problem, thus making a diagnosis of anxiety and assessing the effects of treatment is difficult.</P>

<P>Due to the lack of evidence on the role of drug therapy for treating anxiety in palliative care patients, this review cannot draw any conclusions specific to any medications or drug classes in this patient population. To the best of our knowledge, clinical guidelines from the main health organisations across the world recommend non-drug therapy treatments for anxiety in palliative care patients such as psychological support and intervention (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>), in preference to drug treatment except in the last days of life (<LINK REF="REF-NICE--2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2015</LINK>). In the case of severe anxiety, guidelines recommend referral to a psychiatrist (<LINK REF="REF-National-Consensus-Project-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Consensus Project 2009</LINK>). In addition, there is evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy as a psychological intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Moorey-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moorey 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Until there is evidence indicating harms caused by the drugs currently used in palliative care to manage anxiety, their use is likely to be continued. However, their administration should be based on the severity of symptoms and an assessment of the risk of increased sensitivity to drugs. As addressed in the review, underlying causes for anxiety should be thoroughly evaluated to determine if the cause of a person's anxiety is related to other symptom management or the use of other medications or substances. If appropriate, treating another symptom (e.g. pain) or eliminating an agent that is causing or exacerbating anxiety (e.g. caffeine) may pre-empt the need for another medication to treat anxiety. If drugs are started, they should be at a lower dose than would be prescribed for physically healthy people and any increase should be attempted cautiously and with consideration of other drugs the person may be taking (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 2007</LINK>). The drug group of choice commonly stated in the literature for palliative care patients (prior to the final dying phase) is short-acting benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam or midazolam (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>Depression and anxiety are often measured using the same scale, thus it is necessary that future trials specifically assess and report measures of anxiety.

<LI>In the first update and this second update we searched a range of trial registers that were not searched in the original Cochrane Review. However, while the ISRCTN Trials Register (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn">www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn</A>) was searched in the first update, it was not searched in this latest update as it is covered by WHO Portal.</LI>
<LI>We did not search the Cochrane Pain, Palliative &amp; Supportive Care Register as its contents are captured by CENTRAL.</LI>
<LI>We added an additional 25 drugs to our search and thus database searches for these were rerun from 2012 (see <LINK REF="APP-09" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 9</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>We updated the Background section to include references to more recently published work.</LI>
<LI>We updated the Methods section to take into account changes in the search strategy. We thought that we should be searching for studies currently in progress, in addition to published studies, and thus undertook searches of trial registers.</LI>
<LI>We added new outcomes, and specified primary and secondary outcomes. We specified that we will report outcomes assessed at one week.</LI>
<LI>We changed the description of 'Types of participants' and 'Types of interventions' to reflect current terminology. We also added comparators of interest.</LI>
<LI>We expanded our risk of bias descriptions.</LI>
<LI>We stated that we planned to construct a 'Summary of findings' table and to assess the quality of the evidence used the GRADE approach.</LI>
<LI>The Results and Discussion sections were updated to take into account the fact that no studies were found to include in the review and to include references to more recently published work.</LI>
<LI>All sections were updated and revised to conform with current Cochrane style guidelines.</LI>
