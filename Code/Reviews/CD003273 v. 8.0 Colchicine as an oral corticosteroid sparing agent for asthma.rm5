<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Asthma can be treated with drugs which aim to reduce inflammation in the airways. Inhaled corticosteroids are frequently used, but occasionally individuals require oral steroids for adequate control. However, oral steroids are frequently associated with severe side-effects. Colchicine has been suggested as a useful 'add-on' therapy to oral steroid treatment with the aim of reducing the dose requirement in such asthma. There is a need for well-designed trials addressing this question before recommendations can be made.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-06 10:29:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma is now considered an inflammatory disease that usually responds to treatment that focuses on reducing airway inflammation. To achieve control of the inflammation of the airways, inhaled and systemic corticosteroid drugs have been shown to be of proven benefit in asthmatic patients. However, since large doses of systemic corticosteroid drugs can result in unwanted and potentially serious side effects, the treatment of choice has focused on inhaled corticosteroids. Unfortunately, there remains a small sub-section of patients who do not respond to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. These patients tend to fall into two categories. Either they cannot be controlled by high doses of inhaled corticosteroids and, therefore need frequent or continued use of oral corticosteroids, or simply fail to respond to systemic corticosteroid therapy altogether. While this sub-section of patients is indeed small (it has been estimated that this occurs 1:1000 to 1:10,000 <LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1996</LINK>) the clinical course of these types of asthma are often characterised by greater severity and more persistent symptoms. As a result of this clinical dilemma there have been a number of clinical trials examining the use of 'second-line' steroid sparing agents. The concept that these drugs may be of benefit in asthma has arisen from studies showing their benefits in other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. One such agent is colchicine which is an immuno-modulating agent. </P>
<P>Colchicine is an inexpensive, anti-inflammatory, immuno modulating agent that has been used for many years with few side effects to treat various inflammatory disorders including the treatment of patients with gout, primary biliary cirrhosis, Mediterranean fever and Behcet's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Dinarello-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dinarello 1974</LINK>). Patients with familial Mediterranean fever and primary biliary cirrhosis both have a deficiency of Con-A induced suppressor cell function. Suppressor T cells are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. Patients with asthma show a similar deficiency of Con-A induced suppressor cell function. In vitro studies show that oral colchicine may partially correct such a deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Ilfeld-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ilfeld 1985</LINK>) and thus suggest a potential role for colchicine in the treatment of asthma. </P>
<P>The use of agents such as colchicine as an adjunct to oral corticosteroids has been reported in both open and randomised controlled studies in asthma. These studies have employed differing methodology and to date, the results have been conflicting. Previous narrative reviews give the overall impression that it is of benefit, but this has not been established. A systematic review with meta-analysis was proposed to help to synthesise the data.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of colchicine as an oral corticosteroid sparing agent in the treatment of chronic steroid-dependent asthma.</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review clearly demonstrates that there is a lack of RCTs addressing the efficacy of adding colchicine as an oral corticosteroid-sparing agent for asthma. As previously stated, this oral corticosteroid-dependent sub-section of asthmatic patients is small, but they often have asthma of greater severity and more persistent symptoms and are at risk of side effects from chronic oral steroid dosing. There is a need for trials that assess 'add on' therapies. There are two separate outcomes to consider in assessing these types of therapies: efficacy and steroid-sparing quality. </P>
<P>There has been a small amount of research assessing colchicine subsequent to inhaled steroid withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Fish-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fish 1997</LINK>) and as a steroid tapering agent with inhaled triamcinolone (<LINK REF="STD-Newman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Newman 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Fish-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fish 1997</LINK> did not report any significant differences between colchicine and placebo on clinical outcomes, and attrition rate was high. Due to the nature of the study the efficacy of colchicine as a steroid tapering agent could not be assessed. <LINK REF="STD-Newman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Newman 1997</LINK> reported data for a small number of participants (N = 13) and could not detect a difference between colchicine and placebo in terms of average reduction of inhaled steroid (colchicine group: 400 mcg per day; placebo group: 443 mcg per day), or in terms of the number of participants able to reduce their steroid intake (four out of five participants in the colchicine group versus five out of seven in the placebo group). </P>
<P>Current evidence suggests that inhaled steroid therapy remains the treatment of choice for controlling active asthma since they offer a safe, effective treatment without long term, serious side-effects at least up to 1000 mcg of drug per day (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005a</LINK>). It is only when inhaled steroids fail to control symptoms and chronic oral corticosteroids are required, that oral steroid-sparing agents such as colchicine, may be considered. The objective of this review was to assess the oral steroid -sparing effect of colchicine. Evidence remains inconclusive as to whether colchicine might be a reliable safe replacement of oral steroids. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No relevant trials have been published, so this review concludes that there is no evidence to indicate that colchicine is beneficial or otherwise in the management of oral steroid-dependent asthmatic patients.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for robust, well-designed randomised controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of adding colchicine to oral steroid-dependent asthmatic patients in order to reduce oral corticosteroid consumption.</P>
