<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Motorcyclists are at high risk in traffic crashes, particularly for head injury. A review of studies concluded that helmets reduce the risk of head injury by around 69% and death by around 42%. There is, so far, insufficient evidence to compare the effectiveness of different types of helmet. Some studies have suggested that helmets may protect against facial injury and that they have no effect on neck injury, but more research is required for a conclusive answer. The review supports the view that helmet use should be actively encouraged worldwide for rider safety.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-09-22 15:47:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Motorcycle crash victims form a high proportion of those killed or injured in road traffic crashes. Injuries to the head, following motorcycle crashes, are a common cause of severe morbidity and mortality. It seems intuitive that helmets should protect against head injuries but it has been argued that motorcycle helmet use decreases rider vision and increases neck injuries. This review will collate the current available evidence on helmets and their impact on mortality, and head, face and neck injuries following motorcycle crashes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of wearing a motorcycle helmet in reducing mortality and head and neck injury following motorcycle crashes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (up to April 2007), EMBASE (up to April week 16, 2007), CINAHL (January 1982 to February 2003), TRANSPORT (up to issue 12, 2006) (TRANSPORT combines the following databases: Transportation Research Information Services (TRIS) International Transport Research Documentation (ITRD) formerly International Road Research Documentation (IRRD), ATRI (Australian Transport Index) (1976 to Feb 2003), Science Citation Index were searched for relevant articles. Websites of traffic and road safety research bodies including government agencies were also searched. Reference lists from topic reviews, identified studies and bibliographies were examined for relevant articles. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We considered studies that investigated a population of motorcycle riders who had crashed, examining helmet use as an intervention and with outcomes that included one or more of the following: death, head, neck or facial injury. We included any studies that compared an intervention and control group. Therefore the following study designs were included: randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies. Ecological and case series studies were excluded. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-22 15:47:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Two authors independently screened reference lists for eligible articles. Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion criteria. Data were extracted by two independent authors using a standard extraction form.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Sixty-one observational studies were selected of varying quality. Despite methodological differences there was a remarkable consistency in results, particularly for death and head injury outcomes. Motorcycle helmets were found to reduce the risk of death and head injury in motorcyclists who crashed. From four higher quality studies helmets were estimated to reduce the risk of death by 42% (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.68) and from six higher quality studies helmets were estimated to reduce the risk of head injury by 69% (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.38). Insufficient evidence was found to estimate the effect of motorcycle helmets compared with no helmet on facial or neck injuries. However, studies of poorer quality suggest that helmets have no effect on the risk of neck injuries and are protective for facial injury. There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether differences in helmet type confer more or less advantage in injury reduction. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Motorcycle helmets reduce the risk of death and head injury in motorcycle riders who crash. Further well-conducted research is required to determine the effects of helmets and different helmet types on mortality, head, neck and facial injuries. However, the findings suggest that global efforts to reduce road traffic injuries may be facilitated by increasing helmet use by motorcyclists. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-11 13:07:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Road traffic injuries contribute significantly to mortality and the burden of disease throughout the world, but particularly in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ameratunga-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ameratunga 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nantulya-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nantulya 2002</LINK>). In many developing countries, the majority of those injured in road traffic crashes are pedestrians, cyclists and motorised two-wheel riders (that is, motorcycles, motor scooters etc) For instance, in 1994 in Malaysia, 57% of all road deaths were riders of motorised two-wheelers (<LINK REF="REF-Mohan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohan 2002</LINK>). The number of road fatalities attributed to motorised two-wheelers in industrialised countries, where four-wheeled private vehicles are more prevalent, is also disproportionately high (<LINK REF="REF-Mohan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohan 2002</LINK>). In 1998, in Britain, motorcycle riders accounted for less than 1% of total road users but contributed to 15% of those killed or seriously injured on the roads (<LINK REF="REF-DFT-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DFT 1998</LINK>). With increasing modernisation in many developing countries, road traffic deaths are increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Odero-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odero 1997</LINK>), and traffic deaths are projected to become the third most important health problem by 2020 (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>). Interventions to address this rising epidemic should, therefore, be assessed. </P>
<P>Injuries to the head, following motorcycle crashes, are a common cause of severe morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Bachulis-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bachulis 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sosin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sosin 1990</LINK>). Intuitively, wearing of motorcycle helmets should reduce the number of such head injuries. Results from large scale ecological type studies have suggested that when helmet use rates increase with implementation of a law, injury and mortality rates decrease (<LINK REF="REF-Branas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Branas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McSwain-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McSwain 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sosin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sosin 1990</LINK>). However, in both developing and developed countries, resistance to legislation on motorcycle helmets still coexists with debate on the effectiveness of motorcycle helmets in reducing morbidity and mortality. </P>
<P>Arguments against helmets for motorcycle riders include the possibility that they increase the risk of neck injuries in crashes (<LINK REF="STD-Krantz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Krantz 1985</LINK>) and could decrease rider visibility. Questions also surround the effectiveness of helmets in reducing mortality, given the severity of other body injuries sustained by riders in motorcycle crashes. The type of helmet worn, correct fastening of helmets and cost are secondary issues that are particularly relevant to motorcycle helmet usage in developing countries. </P>
<P>A review of the effectiveness of bicycle helmets, compared with 'no helmet', found they had significant advantage in reducing head and facial injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>). Motorcycles, like bicycles, are a convenient and popular form of transport. However, motorcycles travel at far higher speeds than bicycles, with the potential for greater impact in accidents and hence greater injury. This review collates the current available evidence on helmets and their impact on mortality, and head, face and neck injuries following motorcycle crashes. A reliable estimate of the effectiveness of helmets will assist in road safety research, particularly in assessing the likely cost-effectiveness of introducing helmet legislation and enforcement in countries where motorcycle injuries are common and legislation does not currently exist.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Studies comparing an intervention and control group were considered. This included any randomised controlled trials, controlled trials, cohort and retrospective cohort studies and case-control studies. Ecological-type studies and case (or case series) studies were excluded. For ethical reasons, randomised controlled trials on interventions such as motorcycle helmets are rarely, if ever, conducted. Evidence for motorcycle helmets in injury prevention, therefore, often comes from non-randomised trials. Control of confounders in non-randomised study design is particularly important to achieve a valid estimate of effect.</P>

<P>The effect of the interventions on the outcome measures was analysed. Studies were classified according to study type. For outcomes with a similar measure of effect, a combined estimate of effect was calculated. The outcome measure used for analysis was the odds ratio (OR). Graphical presentation was done by means of a Forest plot, to show the OR and 95% confidence interval for each study. The RevMan statistical package was used for data analysis. The generic inverse variance method for adjusted OR was employed for those studies providing confounder adjusted effect measures. Unadjusted data was also analysed in RevMan to give unadjusted ORs. Subgroup analysis by study type was conducted for the outcome of head injury.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>For additional details of individual studies see 'Characteristics of included studies' table. </P>
<P>A total of 61 eligible studies were identified. No randomised controlled trials or other controlled trials were found. There was great variation in study designs and quality. However, the majority of identified studies were cross-sectional designs that examined one or more of the outcomes (head injury, mortality, facial injury or neck injury) in relation to helmet use. There were four studies utilising a 'matched-pair' design and all of these examined the outcome of mortality in relation to helmet use. Four case-control studies and one cohort study were also identified. </P>
<P>Thirty studies examined the outcome of death in relation to helmet use, 36 examined head injury, 16 examined neck injury and 10 examined facial injury. Eight studies looked at the combined outcome of head and/or neck injury in relation to helmet use and seven studies examined different types of helmets in relation to a variety of outcomes of head injury, neck injury and facial injury. </P>
<P>The observational data were obtained from a wide variety of settings, including some developing countries (<LINK REF="STD-Conrad-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Conrad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakahara-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nakahara 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phuenpathom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Phuenpathom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 1988</LINK>). However, the majority of studies were based on populations from developed countries. The study participants were identified by a variety of means including motorcycle crash presentations at hospital, linking data from police reported crashes to hospital data, databases of routinely collected information (such as the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) in the US) and trauma databases. Some investigators only examined the outcome of interest in a dead population (<LINK REF="STD-Krantz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Krantz 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1995</LINK>). The only cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2001</LINK>) recruited college students as participants. </P>
<P>Notably some studies used the same study population or overlapping periods of data for their study population. Both <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1986</LINK> used different statistical models on data collected by <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1981</LINK> to estimate helmet effectiveness and the four matched pair studies used overlapping time periods from the FARS database. For this reason, these studies could not be included in a meta-analysis. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>For additional details of individual studies see 'Characteristics of included studies' table. </P>
<P>While there was great variation in the quality of the 61 included studies, in general the methodological quality was poor. Only 14 studies made any attempt to measure and control for confounders in their estimate of effect and a further five studies presented their results stratified by potential confounders. In addition to this, most studies were either affected by selection bias or had the potential for this to influence their results. While some investigators made attempts to include all motorcycle crash victims in their defined geographic area (<LINK REF="STD-Gabella-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gabella 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 1996</LINK>), many studies simply examined patients at a single 'level one' trauma centre or a few non-randomly selected hospitals. Others were only able to capture a convenience sample or a small percentage of crash victims in their area (for instance only 20%, <LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1981</LINK>) or had to exclude large proportions of crash victims due to missing data, non-linkage of data or loss to follow up. The potential for selection bias to occur in these situations is a real possibility but difficult to quantify. Few studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kraus-1995c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraus 1995c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norvell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Norvell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orsay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Orsay 1995</LINK>) were able to provide any data to demonstrate that participants excluded from their study due to selection issues were not significantly different from those included. </P>
<P>As most studies relied on retrospectively obtained data, measurement of outcome and exposure generally had consistent methodology. Outcomes were measured by medical records or death certificates. Similarly, exposure measurement relied mostly on medical or police records although some investigators relied on direct on-the-scene measurement (<LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2002</LINK>) or crash victim self-report (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2005</LINK>). Due to the fact that no studies were controlled trials, and most relied on retrospective data, blinding of outcome and exposure assessors did not occur. </P>
<P>Quality ranking scales can be unreliable and may introduce bias into the review process (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenland-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenland 1994</LINK>). As there were no randomised controlled trials identified, the only objective criteria to subgroup studies was found to be study design and whether potential confounders had been controlled for. Those studies that attempted to control for confounders were ranked as higher quality.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>As no randomised controlled trials were found, we relied on observational data for this review. Although we identified many studies that addressed the study question, on the whole the methodological quality was poor. A variety of different study designs were included, as long as the design allowed for a control or comparison group. Cross-sectional studies were the predominant study type identified. Although cross-sectional studies are frequently criticised as the outcome is prone to 'length-biased sampling' (<LINK REF="REF-Rothman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothman 1998</LINK>), for this review, investigators have measured only new events (incident injuries or death after a motorcycle crash) over the study period rather than the prevalence of these conditions. Hence, in this case, this criticism does not apply and the cross-sectional studies included are in fact similar to a case-control design. </P>
<P>Besides study design, the only objective quality ranking criteria applicable to studies included in this review was measurement and adjustment for confounding. Factors such as motorcycle speed, alcohol consumption, rider age and gender are often associated with motorcycle crash fatalities and injuries (<LINK REF="STD-Braddock-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Braddock 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Offner-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Offner 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wick-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wick 1998</LINK>) and there is good reason to suspect these factors may differ between those who wear motorcycle helmets and those who do not (<LINK REF="STD-Hurt-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hurt 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skalkidou-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skalkidou 1999</LINK>). Hence in non-randomised studies, control of these potential confounders is essential for a valid estimate of effect and therefore this criterion was used as the main quality item to differentiate higher and lower quality studies. <BR/>
<BR/>Despite using observational studies and the difficulties with poor quality, there is no doubt that motorcycle helmets compared with no helmets reduce the likelihood of head injuries. The estimate of effectiveness ranges from OR 0.23 to 0.35. Notably, among the confounder adjusted estimates, the case-control studies provided a similar estimate to that from the cross-sectional studies confirming the argument that a difference in the study design of included papers in this review is unlikely to bias results. Studies that made no attempt to adjust for confounding gave a more conservative estimate of effect and the study by <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1981</LINK> that stratified helmet effectiveness by speed further supports this finding (that is, the overall unadjusted estimate of helmet effectiveness (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.57) is more conservative than the estimates obtained after stratification). Given the variability among the types of confounders adjusted for in individual studies, it is difficult to postulate reasons for this observed difference between adjusted and unadjusted estimates. However, the overall consistency among the results irrespective of study design, setting and quality issues confirms the effectiveness of helmets in protecting against head injury. </P>
<P>Studies estimating the effect of helmets on mortality were very consistent in their results, suggesting a protective effect. Among the studies controlling for confounders, the four cross-sectional studies provided an overall adjusted estimate of OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.68, although the potential confounders adjusted for (including age, alcohol use, speed limit, vehicle damage and physical environment) varied substantially. This estimate is similar to that from the four matched pair studies. <LINK REF="STD-Shibata-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Shibata 1994</LINK> found that for motorcyclists who crashed at lower speeds helmets significantly decreased the risk of death but at speeds greater than 50km/hr there was no significant benefit from wearing a helmet although the direction of the OR in both strata was the same, that is suggesting a protective effect. The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Keng-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Keng 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sauter-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sauter 2005</LINK> made attempts to factor in motorcycle speed in their estimates by adjusting for the speed limit at the crash site. However this may not reflect the true motorcycle speed at the time of the crash. The matched pair studies control for speed by the nature of their study design however there may be differences in motorcycle riders who ride as pairs such as different dynamics at the time of crash that afford more protection than in single riders. Hence it is difficult to make any conclusions about the impact of speed on the protective effect of helmets on mortality. Overall the combined estimate from the 'unadjusted' studies OR 0.58 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.73) was similar to the adjusted studies. Hence the evidence shows helmets reduce mortality compared with no helmets but this should be further investigated in relation to their interaction with speed. <BR/>
<BR/>There is insufficient evidence to make conclusions about helmet effects on neck and facial injuries, although findings are not inconsistent with a protective effect on facial injuries. Of the two studies that attempted to adjust for confounders for the outcome of neck injury, one (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2005</LINK>) found no effect although the numbers of eligible participants were small and the third (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1986</LINK>) has been criticised for flawed statistical methodology (<LINK REF="REF-Bedi-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bedi 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1992</LINK>). Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions on the effectiveness of different helmet types. Only one study adjusted for confounders when providing an estimate of effect comparing full-face helmets and non-full-face helmets with no helmet, and the author (<LINK REF="STD-Tsai-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 1995</LINK>) suggested the study result may be biased by measurement error due to the fact that the quality of 'full' and 'partial coverage' helmets in Taiwan are suboptimal as many do not have an impact absorbing liner. </P>
<P>The findings from this review, particularly in relation to helmet effectiveness for head injury, are consistent with the conclusions drawn from other literature. Before-after studies conclude that following the implementation of a helmet law, a reduction in motorcycle-related head injuries occurs (<LINK REF="REF-Chiu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1995a</LINK>) while the repeal of a law results in increased death and injury (<LINK REF="REF-McSwain-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McSwain 1984</LINK>). Ecological-type studies also suggest that motorcycle helmet laws result in a reduction in motorcycle head injury-related deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Sosin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sosin 1990</LINK>) and that helmet laws result in a reduction in motorcycle related death rates (<LINK REF="REF-Branas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Branas 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Given the significant impact head injuries have on the burden of disease worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 2000</LINK>) the results of this review should be contemplated widely. However, care must be taken in generalising the findings. Of note, most higher quality studies were conducted in developed countries where more technologically advanced emergency services exist and some studies used only dead populations (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romano-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Romano 1991</LINK>) or paired motorcycle riders (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norvell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Norvell 2002</LINK>). Head injury definitions mostly did not include minor injuries such as soft-tissue or scalp injuries so the results of this review relate primarily to more serious head injuries such as brain injury and skull fractures. Also, <LINK REF="STD-Shibata-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Shibata 1994</LINK> noted that in the relevant study period, Japan had no emergency on-the-scene medical treatment which may affect the estimates of mortality given in this study. </P>
<P>Few studies discussed the issue of helmet quality and measured whether helmets worn by riders met safety standards. <LINK REF="STD-Tsai-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 1995</LINK> commented on the quality of helmets in Taiwan but only a few authors actually examined helmets worn by study participants to ensure they complied with safety standards. It has been noted in both high and middle/low income countries that 'counterfeit helmets' are available (<LINK REF="REF-Peek_x002d_Asa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peek-Asa 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2003</LINK>) and one study has suggested that such helmets may result in more injury in crashes (<LINK REF="REF-Peek_x002d_Asa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peek-Asa 1999</LINK>). Most of the studies in this review came from developed countries, where this is unlikely to be a major issue, but the results from this review should be viewed with this potential misclassification in mind. Furthermore, the enforcement of helmet safety standards must go hand in hand with motorcycle helmet legislation which has been shown to be effective in increasing helmet wearing rates (<LINK REF="REF-Kraus-1995c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraus 1995c</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various authors suggest that protective measures such as helmets and seat belts may decrease an individual's perception of risk and thereby increase their propensity to engage in risk-taking behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilde-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilde 2002</LINK>). Although this review did not aim to investigate the effect of wearing motorcycle helmets on the likelihood of increasing risk-taking behaviour such as speeding, this issue of 'risk compensation' deserves mention. No doubt the arguments supporting and refuting this theory need to be considered when applying the findings of this review to policy. </P>
<P>In terms of reporting risk reduction, the odds ratio, the primary measure of effect in most of the included studies, provides an estimate of the relative risk provided by helmets in the population, that is, motorcycle riders who crash (<LINK REF="REF-Hennekens-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hennekens 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahn-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rothman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schlesselman-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesselman 1982</LINK>). Therefore it is appropriate to estimate that motorcycle helmets reduce the risk of head injury by 69% and death by 42%. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Observational studies that control for confounders demonstrate that helmets are effective in reducing head injuries in motorcyclists who crash by 69% and death by 42%. There is some evidence to suggest that the effect on mortality may be modified by other crash factors such as speed at impact. Currently no conclusive evidence exists on the effect of motorcycle helmets on neck or facial injuries. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further high quality studies are required to address the issue of whether motorcycle helmets influence neck injury, facial injury and the effects of motorcycle speed on the risk of death for motorcycle riders wearing helmets. In addition, the effectiveness of different helmet types needs to be addressed in a well conducted controlled trial. Issues of cost-effectiveness and enforcement of industry approved helmets are further issues that need to be considered. </P>
