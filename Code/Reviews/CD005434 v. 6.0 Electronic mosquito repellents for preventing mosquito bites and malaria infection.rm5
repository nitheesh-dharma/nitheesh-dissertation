<P>Malaria is a major health problem that particularly affects people living in sub-Saharan Africa and other tropical parts of the world. It often causes considerable morbidity and mortality especially in children under five. It is transmitted by mosquito bites from infected female mosquitoes. Several strategies and approaches are available for preventing mosquito bites and malaria infection, including repellents, and these approaches will be considered by those living in affected areas and by travellers to areas where there is high risk of infection. Electronic mosquito repellents (EMRs) are designed to repel female mosquitoes by emitting high-pitched sounds almost inaudible to the human ear. EMRs are claimed by their manufacturers to be effective in repelling mosquitoes and preventing disease. No randomized controlled trials were found, but 10 field studies looking at the number of mosquitoes caught on the bare body parts of humans were assessed. These studies were conducted in various parts of the world with different species of mosquitoes and were controlled for factors such as locality and timing. One study used just one observer with seven observations, while the highest assessment included 18 observers with 324 observations. There was no evidence in the field studies to support any repelling effects of EMRs, hence no evidence to support their promotion or use. Future randomized controlled trials are not proposed as there was no suggestion in the field studies that EMRs show any promise as a preventive measure against malaria.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-12 09:24:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Malaria affects more than 250 million people and causes more than a million deaths each year (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). One important control strategy against this and other mosquito-borne diseases is mosquito control, which aims to reduce human-mosquito contact. Different control measures are used routinely against mosquitoes and their larvae, including chemical (eg insecticide), biological (eg larvivorous fish or pathogenic fungi), environmental (eg land filling or drainage), and personal protection (eg mosquito repellents formulated as pills, coils, ointments, lotions, and sprays; and insecticide-treated or untreated bed nets). </P>
<P>Electronic mosquito repellents (EMRs) are marketed in response to a huge demand from the public for convenient, safe, and effective antimosquito products. Female Anopheles mosquitoes transmit malaria by sucking blood from humans, and these small handheld, battery-powered EMRs are intended to repel them by emitting a high frequency buzz almost inaudible to the human ear. They can be used both indoors and outdoors, and are claimed to repel mosquitoes within a range of up to 2.5 metres (<LINK REF="STD-Kutz-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Kutz 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helson-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Helson 1977</LINK>). No adverse effects have been reported in the literature. Mobile phone companies also market a ring tone that is claimed to repel mosquitoes within a one-metre radius (<LINK REF="REF-BBC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BBC 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Some of the EMRs seem to be based on known aspects of mosquito behaviour, while others have no scientific data to substantiate their claims. Manufacturers have put forward at least two reasons to explain the alleged repellent action of sound against mosquitoes. One reason is that the flight sound of males repels females once they have been inseminated (<LINK REF="STD-Foster-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Foster 1985</LINK>); hence, whatever mimics the males' flight sound may repel females. However, research has shown that male mosquitoes are actually the ones attracted by the female flight sound and females normally have a very weak sensitivity for sound compared with the males (<LINK REF="REF-Wigglesworth-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wigglesworth 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McIver-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIver 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michelsen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michelsen 1985</LINK>). Another reason is that mosquitoes avoid the ultrasonic cries of bats (<LINK REF="STD-Foster-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Foster 1985</LINK>). Although both explanations may be conceivable, there is no published scientific information to support either idea. </P>
<P>Different brands of EMRs have been examined for their efficacy under laboratory conditions, none of which showed any effects for the devices tested (<LINK REF="STD-Singleton-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Singleton 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curtis-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Curtis 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iglisch-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Iglisch 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foster-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Foster 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Andrade-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Andrade 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cabrini-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cabrini 2006</LINK>). There are review articles concluding that the EMRs are ineffective in repelling mosquitoes (<LINK REF="REF-Coro-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coro 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coro-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coro 2000</LINK>). Scientific skepticism over the last 30 years and a successful prosecution of EMR sellers under the UK Trade Description Act in 1980s (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BBC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BBC 2005</LINK>) seems to have done little to deter manufacturers marketing EMRs and the people who buy them. This is a concern because it is likely to lead to consumers not using other protective methods that are proven to work. This could result in an increased risk of infection with mosquito-borne diseases, especially malaria (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Despite the scientific view and research findings, EMRs are still widely promoted and used by the public. We therefore decided to systematically review all reliable research about the effects of high-pitched sounds in preventing mosquito bites and, hence, to assess whether there is any evidence that EMRs have any potential in preventing malaria in the field setting. We included only field studies since laboratory studies do not reflect influences on mosquito behaviour, including climate, mosquito density, and composition of different species in the same locality.</P>

<P>To assess whether EMRs prevent mosquito bites, and to assess evidence of impact on malaria infection.</P>

<P>We identified 18 potentially relevant studies of EMR to prevent mosquito bites and included 10 (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' for study details); none were randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that used EMR to prevent malaria. We excluded eight studies because they were only laboratory based or because they did not provide any data or did not control for locality, time, and blinding (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>'). The papers for the 10 included studies contained 22 experiments, of which 15 were field experiments that met the reviews inclusion criteria; the excluded seven experiments were only laboratory based or used chemical repellents.</P>
<P>Seven studies were carried out in the North America, three in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Helson-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Helson 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belton-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Belton 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1982</LINK>) and four in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Gorham-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Gorham 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutz-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Kutz 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreck-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Schreck 1977</LINK>).

One study was undertaken in Russia (<LINK REF="STD-Rasnitsyn-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Rasnitsyn 1974</LINK>).</P>

<P>All studies counted mosquitoes landing on the bare body parts (mostly arms, legs and/or feet) of the human participants for definite time periods with the EMR switched on or off, or, in some studies, with or without a functional EMR as case and control. None of the field studies performed in North America and Russia were on Anopheles mosquitoes; they used Aedes, Culex, Culiseta, and Mansonia mosquitoes. The two studies in Africa were on Anopheles as well as other mosquitoes. The lowest number of observers was one (with 7 observations; <LINK REF="STD-Gorham-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Gorham 1974</LINK>) and the highest was 18 (with 324 observations; <LINK REF="STD-Sylla-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sylla 2000</LINK>). Also, timing and length of collections varied, ranging from one minute (<LINK REF="STD-Kutz-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Kutz 1974</LINK>) to over a 12-hour period (<LINK REF="STD-Sylla-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sylla 2000</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-10-07 22:43:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, all studies made some attempts to control for locality (geography) of the study area (wooded area, forest, plain, beach) as they measured landing rates with and without the EMR in the same geographical area. Different individuals may have different attraction for the mosquitoes, and the studies controlled for this, usually by swapping the EMR between the participants so that the same individuals acted as both case and control. </P>
<P>The density of mosquitoes and the intensity with which they attempt to bite varies throughout day and night. Our inclusion criteria required studies to attempt to control for time. This was clearly described in all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia 1976</LINK>). </P>
<P>One study blinded the observers to whether they were measuring during a control or experimental phase (<LINK REF="STD-Sylla-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sylla 2000</LINK>). The use of blinding was unclear or not used in the other studies. </P>
<P>In order to test significance, we intended to consider rates per person in participants in control or intervention areas. As landing rates were not given per person, we were unable to compare these data statistically. We recorded the number of times observations were repeated to gain some insight into data quality, arbitrarily defining this as adequate (with 20 or more repeated observations or human participants) and inadequate (less than 20 observations). Three studies were of adequate quality by this criterion.</P>

<P>The number of mosquitoes landing per collection with and without EMR are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. All 10 studies reported that the landing rates with and without the EMR were little different and that the EMRs failed to repel mosquitoes. These results occurred regardless of the study location, mosquito density, mosquito genera, or time of study (ie day or night with day-biting and night-biting mosquitoes).</P>
<P>No trials were found to assess the effects of EMRs on malaria infection.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The included studies were of good quality, had controlled for locality, and all but one had explicitly controlled for time of day or night, and the human bait for the mosquitoes. The results of this review provide clear evidence from field-based studies that there is no hint that these devices have any effect on mosquito landing rates. The studies reported here examined the effectiveness of the EMRs with different methods, settings, mosquito species (since they may respond differently to the high-pitched sounds emitted by the EMRs), frequencies of the sound emitted by the EMRs (since mosquitoes may respond to a particular sound wavelength), and times of day (since day-biting and night-biting mosquitoes may behave differently to the sound emitted by the EMRs), and mosquito density (since this may affect EMR efficacy), but none of them supported the claims of the EMRs' effectiveness. Although we did not conduct a meta-analysis of the included studies, there was no suggestion of difference in landing rates between cases and controls in any trial. In 12 of the 15 experiments, the landing rates in the groups with functioning EMR was actually higher than in the control groups. The absolute number of mosquitoes landing on the human participants during the experiments while the EMR was functioning was too high to consider the EMR a repellent. <BR/> <BR/>EMRs are claimed to be effective by mimicking the sound waves produced by the beating of male mosquitoes' wings, especially during swarms. Female mosquitoes, which bite humans, are claimed to be repelled by this sound since they mate only once in their lives. Hence the repellent mechanism should be based on the hearing mechanism in females. However, this theory is implausible since the hearing ability of the females is relatively weak (<LINK REF="REF-Wigglesworth-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wigglesworth 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michelsen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michelsen 1985</LINK>). It is the hearing system of males that is relatively strong, and the presence of numerous sound and vibration receptors (known as Johnston organ) on their plumose antennae enables them to detect the vibration in the environment as well as the sound of female mosquitoes (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1982</LINK>). Thus it is not surprising that the included studies did not produce any evidence that EMRs act as repellents.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>EMRs are not effective in repelling mosquitoes and should not be recommended or used.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is no evidence of an effect of EMRs on landing rates. Thus there is no evidence that these EMRs could potentially be useful in preventing malaria in humans. Given these findings from 10 carefully conducted studies, it would not be worthwhile to conduct further research on EMRs in preventing mosquitoes biting or in trying to prevent the acquisition of malaria.</P>
