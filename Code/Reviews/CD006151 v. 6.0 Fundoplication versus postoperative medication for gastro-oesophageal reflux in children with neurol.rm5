<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-02 21:47:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Children with cerebral palsy often have oral motor impairment and need help with eating and drinking. Frequently this entails surgery to place a feeding tube (gastrostomy) directly into their stomach. They may also be found to have gastro-oesophageal reflux (where stomach acid flows back up into the feeding tube (oesophagus)), which can be made worse by gastrostomy surgery. Reflux can be treated either with additional surgery at the same time as the gastrostomy (a fundoplication) or with antireflux medications. We carried out this review to determine which was the safest and most effective form of treatment. We found no randomised controlled trials that provided scientific evidence on which to base a conclusion, highlighting the need for a trial comparing the two interventions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-02 21:58:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-08-02 20:49:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Children with neurological impairments frequently experience profound feeding difficulties, which can lead to malnutrition and growth failure. These are often seen as inevitable consequences of many neurological disorders due to their associated physical abnormalities, communication difficulties and motor impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Samson_x002d_Fang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samson-Fang 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The causes of malnutrition in children with neurological impairments are multifactorial. Physiological abnormalities may manifest as oro-motor dysfunction and the associated inco-ordination of oropharyngeal reflexes (<LINK REF="REF-Puntis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wadie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadie 2002</LINK>). Children may also be severely compromised in their inability to feed independently and subsequently experience frustration and behavioural problems (<LINK REF="REF-Puntis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntis 2000</LINK>). Many of the factors that lead to malnutrition and failure to thrive dictate a need to find alternative measures of providing adequate nutrition, such as an enteral feeding tube (<LINK REF="REF-Wadie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadie 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Enteral feeding is considered to be justified to prevent or reverse growth failure when other efforts to increase nutritional intake, such as dietary supplementation, have failed (<LINK REF="REF-Puntis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntis 2000</LINK>). The placement of a gastrostomy feeding tube is now the preferred method of providing long-term nutritional support to children with neurological impairments. A gastrostomy is considered when enteral feeding is required beyond the short-term period (that is, greater than six weeks), when there are prolonged feeding times, inadequate weight gain and an unsafe swallow (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samson_x002d_Fang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samson-Fang 2003</LINK>). The use of gastrostomy tube feeding has previously been shown to increase weight, improve overall health and decrease feeding times for children with neurological impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2005</LINK>). It has also demonstrated a significant, measurable improvement in the quality of life of carers (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2004</LINK>). The literature on prevalence of gastrostomy insertion in this population is limited but a study carried out in the UK by <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2000</LINK> showed that 8% of children with neurological impairments were gastrostomy fed (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gastrostomy tube insertion can be performed by laparotomy, laparoscopy or endoscopy, and the most favoured procedure for tube placement has become percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which was introduced by Gauderer in 1981 (<LINK REF="REF-Gauderer-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gauderer 1981</LINK>). PEG is associated with decreased morbidity in comparison with other techniques for gastrostomy insertion and has been assessed to be both efficient and cost-effective (<LINK REF="REF-Byrne-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byrne 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samuel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuel 2002</LINK>). Complications may arise as a result of gastrostomy placement including infection, perforation, bleeding, tube migration/dislocation, intestinal fistulas and obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Razeghi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Razeghi 2002</LINK>). In addition, the development or worsening of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) has been widely reported and is considered to be one of the long-term sequelae of gastrostomy placement (<LINK REF="REF-Mollitt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mollitt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Razeghi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Razeghi 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>GOR in children with neurological impairments is a well-described phenomenon. It is attributed to a motility disturbance affecting the oesophagus and the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) mechanism, and leads to retrograde, involuntary, effortless regurgitation of gastric contents into the oesophagus (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richards-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 2001</LINK>). The prevalence of GOR among children with neurological impairments has been reported to range from 14% to 75% depending on the diagnostic criteria of GOR used, highlighting the fact that the role of reflux in this group is not well understood and may have a wide range of manifestations and symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reyes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gangil-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gangil 2001</LINK>). The pathophysiological mechanisms of GOR are multifarious. The underlying neurological damage may cause delayed gastric emptying and oesophageal dysmotility, while scoliosis, seizures, spasticity of abdominal musculature or constipation can all cause increased abdominal pressure. Due to their often profound physical disabilities, many children spend long periods in the supine position, thus minimising the effect of gravity to aid oesophageal clearance (<LINK REF="REF-Halpern-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halpern 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spitz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenplas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenplas 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-08-02 21:58:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>For children with neurological impairments who have pre-existing GOR and are referred for the insertion of a gastrostomy, the placement itself can lead to a worsening of symptoms with severe vomiting and aspiration (<LINK REF="REF-Mollitt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mollitt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wheatley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheatley 1991</LINK>). Historically, medical management of GOR in children with neurological impairments has had a high failure rate (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gold-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gold 2002</LINK>). This has led to the frequent use of surgical treatment in the form of an antireflux procedure (ARP) such as a Nissens, Thal, Toupet or Belsey fundoplication (<LINK REF="REF-Ostlie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostlie 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hassall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassall 2005</LINK>). Fundoplication involves strengthening the barrier to acid reflux by wrapping the fundus of the stomach around the oesophagus at the gastro-oesophageal junction. Fundoplication procedures vary according to the degree of fundal wrap that is performed at the distal oesophagus and can range from a full 360° wrap to a partial 180° wrap depending on the operation performed (<LINK REF="REF-Hassall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassall 2005</LINK>). The fundoplication is designed to prevent GOR by correcting hiatal herniation, lengthening the intra-abdominal portion of the oesophagus, tightening the crura and increasing the pressure of the LOS (<LINK REF="REF-Di_x002d_Lorenzo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di-Lorenzo 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite its value in preventing GOR, fundoplication has other consequences. It permanently alters the gastro-oesophageal anatomy and function, and, as has been shown in animal work, may lead to vagal nerve damage that sensitises the emetic reflex (<LINK REF="REF-Richards-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 2000</LINK>). Complications may ensue from these changes (<LINK REF="REF-Di_x002d_Lorenzo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di-Lorenzo 2002</LINK>). These may be related to the underlying condition of the child; for example, seizure disorders or pulmonary disease may lead to increased abdominal pressure, or may arise from the effect of the surgery itself (<LINK REF="REF-Kimber-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimber 1998</LINK>). Complications directly related to the surgery may include gas bloat syndrome, impaired gastric accommodation, gastric hypersensitivity, rapid gastric emptying (or 'dumping syndrome'), retching or dysphagia (<LINK REF="REF-Di_x002d_Lorenzo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di-Lorenzo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2005</LINK>). The challenging anatomy and physiology of this group of children mean they suffer from many conditions seemingly unrelated to GOR, such as scoliosis and epilepsy, which subsequently make it difficult for any antireflux intervention to be a guaranteed success. The ARP (fundoplication) is associated with a high recurrence rate and significant morbidity and mortality in this group of children, with a 40% surgical failure rate (<LINK REF="REF-Isch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kimber-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimber 1998</LINK>). About 12% to 30% of children with neurological impairments experience recurrent reflux post fundoplication, while 59% of children experience postoperative complications with a 1% to 3% mortality rate (<LINK REF="REF-Byrne-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byrne 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditional medical therapies for GOR in this group of children include milk thickeners, acid suppression drugs (histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs)), acid buffering agents (antacids) and gut motility stimulants (prokinetics). These therapies have poor response rates with studies showing that only 13% of neurologically impaired children respond completely to medical management, the remainder experiencing persistence of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gold-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gold 2002</LINK>). The prokinetic drug, cisapride, was withdrawn from the market in many countries following concerns over safety and a lack of robust evidence of efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Gold-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gold 2002</LINK>), and there is now no effective prokinetic drug available.</P>
<P>Since the 1990s, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), for example omeprazole, have played a larger part with the medical management of GOR in children with neurological impairment. Uncontrolled studies of omeprazole have reported high levels of tolerability and efficacy suggesting high rates of healing, symptom relief and reduction of vomiting in up to 90% of participants (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hassall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassall 2005</LINK>). PPIs are reported to work by decreasing the acidity of the refluxate and decreasing gastric acid secretion volume, thereby improving gastric emptying (<LINK REF="REF-Hassall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassall 2005</LINK>). The long-term effects of PPI use are not known at this point, but after a decade of use in the adult population, this group of medications have been found to have a good safety profile (<LINK REF="REF-Gold-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gold 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review aims to assess the efficacy of fundoplication for neurologically impaired children who are at a high risk of ARP failure compared with medical antireflux treatment. This is clinically important as there is some evidence of poor outcomes from surgery and the uncontrolled studies suggest that PPIs may be a safe, appropriate, cost-effective alternative (<LINK REF="REF-Heudebert-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heudebert 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hassall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassall 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>The other papers we discarded involved, for example, alternative options for reflux treatment, effectiveness studies of different surgical antireflux techniques, and risk and benefit studies of gastrostomy surgery with fundoplication.

<P>The objective of this review was to compare the effectiveness of antireflux fundoplication surgery with the use of antireflux medications in children with neurological impairments undergoing gastrostomy feeding tube insertion. We identified no relevant RCTs. This review has demonstrated that there is no evidence available from reliable sources on which to draw any conclusions. We cannot provide data on the comparable risks or benefits of either treatment and are subsequently unable to provide recommendations for the best approach in this group of children.<BR/>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-07 12:35:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-08-07 12:07:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>There continues to be considerable uncertainty regarding optimal treatment option when faced with the decision of performing surgery or prescribing medications for gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) in children with neurological impairment who are undergoing a gastrostomy. As surgeons and physicians should ensure that parents are fully informed about the risks and benefits of both treatments, the fact there is a lack of high-quality evidence regarding the relative merits and drawbacks of each option should be shared with families.</P>
<P>It is important to highlight the fact that, although this review deals specifically with the comparison of fundoplication versus medication, other surgical and endoscopic treatment options are becoming available for managing GOR in this group of children. The durability and long-term outcomes are not yet known within the paediatric population and further research is required before they are included as part of clinical practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-07 12:35:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>A randomised controlled trial of fundoplication versus postoperative medication for children with neurological impairment and severe GOR undergoing gastrostomy should be undertaken to resolve the current uncertainties about the optimal management strategy, for preference, a large multicentre trial. Due to the nature of the two treatment options, it would not be possible to blind trialists or participants to allocation, but assessor blinding may be possible when measuring pre- and postoperative GOR. The trial would have to be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis as those randomised to the medication arm of the trial could subsequently suffer worsening reflux and require fundoplication, but those having surgery could not revert to the medication arm post procedure. There would need to be strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify those children with very severe GOR, such as those experiencing life-threatening events, in whom a fundoplication is strongly indicated.</P>
<P>Through personal communication with Professor David Lloyd (<LINK REF="REF-Lloyd-2006-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lloyd 2006 [pers comm]</LINK>) and Professor Jacob Langer (<LINK REF="REF-Langer-2006-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer 2006 [pers comm]</LINK>), an ethical consideration was brought to the review authors' attention with regards to the process of randomisation. Children with neurological impairments who are referred for gastrostomy insertion and have pre-existing reflux may have previously been treated with medications that have not resolved their symptoms. It would not be ethical in this instance to allocate them randomly to a treatment group knowing that one of the two options had previously failed to alleviate symptoms. This would not provide a fair chance of symptom relief from either therapy. In order to avoid this issue when performing a trial, children would need to be randomised to a treatment arm as soon as the diagnosis of GOR was made, and the gastrostomy surgery, with or without fundoplication, should proceed as soon as possible.</P>
<P>While it is important to acknowledge that any research performed with this group of children will be difficult due to their anatomical and physiological problems, this is a population with ever increasing health needs and this is an area that is critically in need of research.</P>

<B>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</B>
</P>

</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Selected studies will be independently evaluated by two review authors (AVR and PBS) using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Disagreements over suitability for inclusion will be resolved by discussion or adjudication, or both, by editors of the Cochrane Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems Group. The tool will assess the following items: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. Studies will be assigned a quality category (high, low and unclear risk of bias) and supporting evidence will be presented in a 'Risk of bias' table. We will make our judgements based on the following criteria.</P>
<P>
<I>Adequate sequence generation</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>'low' indicates that adequate methods of concealment were used for random allocation. This would include computer-generated random numbers, a random numbers table, coin-tossing or dice throwing if the procedure was performed by someone now otherwise involved in participant recruitment.</LI>
<LI>'unclear' indicates uncertainty as to whether allocation was adequately concealed from trialist or participant. This would include methodology where the method of concealment is not known. If the method of concealment and allocation is unclear the study authors will be contacted to obtain precise information.</LI>
<LI>'high' indicates that although the methods of randomisation were described, the method was inadequate to guarantee allocation concealment. This would include alternation, dates of birth or any procedure that is transparent before allocation such as an open list of random numbers.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Allocation concealment</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>'low' indicates the use of centralised or pharmacy-controlled randomisation, telephone randomisation or sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes.</LI>
<LI>'unclear' indicates that allocation concealment was not clearly stated or the methods were not described.</LI>
<LI>'high' indicates that the allocation sequence was not concealed from investigators or participants.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Blinding of participants and personnel</I>
</P>
<P>Blinding to the study intervention following allocation would not be possible either for trialists or participants in these studies. The intervention compares a surgical procedure to a medication regimen following insertion of a gastrostomy feeding tube. This means it would be very difficult to eliminate detection and performance bias.</P>
<P>
<I>Incomplete outcome data </I>
</P>
<P>In the event that data are missing or unclear in any aspect of the trial (from methodological aspects to trial results) primary investigators will be contacted. Data will, if possible, be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.</P>
<P>
<U>Follow-up</U>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>'low' indicates that losses to follow-up were equally distributed between treatment and comparison groups, and the reasons for dropout or withdrawal were adequately reported.</LI>
<LI>'unclear' indicates that information about losses to follow-up was unavailable.</LI>
<LI>'high' indicates that losses to follow-up were in excess of 30% or unevenly (more than 10% difference) distributed between treatment and comparison groups.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<U>Intention to treat</U>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>'low' indicates that intention-to-treat analyses was performed or could be performed using available data.</LI>
<LI>'unclear' indicates that information about whether intention-to-treat analyses were performed was not available and could not be acquired by contacting the researchers of the study.</LI>
<LI>'high' indicates that intention-to-treat analyses were not performed and could not be done using available data.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Selective reporting</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>'low' indicates that the prespecified primary outcomes have been reported and all collected data has been reported.</LI>
<LI>'unclear' indicates that it is insufficient information to allow a judgement to be made.</LI>
<LI>'high' indicates that the primary outcome data have not been reported or have been reported incompletely.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Other sources of bias</I>
</P>
<P>We will attempt to avoid publication bias by seeking data from all sources including conference proceedings and unpublished data from pharmaceutical companies (see search strategy). Should sufficient data be identified, funnel plots will be drawn to investigate any relationship between effect size and study precision (closely related to sample size). Such a relationship could be due to publication or related biases, systematic differences between small and large studies, or poor methodology. If a relationship is found, clinical diversity of the studies will be further examined as a possible explanation.</P>

<P>Result consistency will be examined graphically to determine overlap of confidence intervals, poor overlap signifying heterogeneity.

Both fixed-effect and random-effects analyses will be performed.</P>
