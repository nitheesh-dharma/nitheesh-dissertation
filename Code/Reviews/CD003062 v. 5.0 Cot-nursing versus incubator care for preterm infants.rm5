<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-26 21:23:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prematurely born infants are usually nursed in incubators to provide the warmest environment possible. Using cots instead of incubators, allows mothers to have easier access to their babies. However, additional warmth is needed to maintain their body temperature, such as extra clothing, bedding and a heated room. This updated review randomly assigned 247 preterm infants (in five trials), to an intervention of cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress. The control babies received routine care in an air heated incubator. One trial had three-arms, including cot-nursing in a room heated with a manually controlled space heater. In the included trials infants in the incubator groups were nursed naked apart from wearing a nappy, except in one trial in which the infants also wore a cotton jacket and booties. Three comparisons were undertaken: the overall comparison of cot-nursing versus incubator care, and two subgroup comparisons: cot-nursing with heated water-filled mattress versus incubator care, and cot-nursing using warming of the nursery versus incubator care. The results of the review showed no evidence of effect of cot-nursing versus incubator care on weight gain in the overall analysis, or in the subgroup analysis comparing cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress with incubator care. However, cot-nursing with warming of the nursery during week one when compared to incubator care revealed poorer weight gain. The primary outcomes related to temperature control (mean body temperature and episodes of cold stress) indicated on overall analysis no effect of cot-nursing compared to incubator care. Episodes of hyperthermia in the cot-nursing group were reported more frequently in one trial. The secondary outcomes of oxygen consumption, breast feeding at hospital discharge, episodes of nosocomial sepsis, maternal perceptions of infant's condition, maternal stress and anxiety and death prior to hospital discharge revealed there was no effect of cot-nursing compared to incubator care. There was, however, a strong trend towards less death prior to hospital discharge. This was largely related to the results were obtained from the trials undertaken in Turkey and Ethiopia and thus may not be applicable to neonatal nurseries in developed countries. Nevertheless the implications of these findings deserve consideration, particularly in the context of a developing country.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-26 21:20:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven potential studies were identified of which five, involving 247 infants, were included in this review. When compared to incubator care, cot-nursing resulted in no significant difference in mean body temperature (MD 0.02 degrees C; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.07, four trials), though the one trial that reported on episodes of hyperthermia found this to be statistically more common in the cot-nursing group (RR 1.48; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.09). There were no statistically significant differences in weight gain. In the cot-nursing group, fewer infants were breast fed on discharge (typical RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.14, three trials, 150 infants) and fewer infants died prior to hospital discharge (typical RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.25, four trials, 235 infants) but these results failed to reach statistical significance. The comparison of cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress versus incubator care, which included five trials and a total of 231 infants, produced similar results. Cot-nursing with warming of the nursery resulted in statistically significantly smaller weight gain during week one compared to the incubator group in one trial that involved 38 infants (MD -5.90 g/kg/day; 95% CI -11.13 to -0.67) but no significant difference was found for weeks two and three.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-05-26 21:21:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress has similar effects to incubator care with regard to temperature control and weight gain. Important clinical outcomes need to be investigated further using randomised controlled trials. This is especially the case in the situation of developing countries, where differences in these outcomes are likely to be encountered. As limited data is available on cot-nursing using a space-heated room, this method is not recommended as practice.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-26 21:24:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-05-26 21:24:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An optimal thermal environment is desirable for preterm infants. When an infant is challenged by cold, the baby attempts to conserve body heat by vasoconstriction and to maintain body temperature by increasing the rate of heat production. This involves thermogenesis by the metabolism of brown adipose tissue and an increase in oxygen consumption. The increase in energy expenditure may reduce weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Glass-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1969</LINK>). Traditionally for preterm infants in the intensive care unit, temperature has been maintained by the use of air heated incubators or thermo controlled radiant heaters. The more stable preterm infants have usually been nursed in incubators, being moved to open cots at 1700 to 1800 g (<LINK REF="REF-Sutter-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutter 1988</LINK>), though practice varies widely between neonatal units.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-05-26 21:24:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the complexities of caring for a preterm infant in an incubator, there is a need to assess the effectiveness of nursing in an open cot. This method of nursing does require a number of extra measures to ensure body temperature is maintained. These have included extra clothing/bedding, warming up the nursery and heating the cot mattress.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-06-25 15:00:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Metabolic effects were studied in infants in an open nursery cot provided with a small electric heating element below the mattress (<LINK REF="REF-Hey-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hey 1970</LINK>). Oxygen consumption and heat loss fell compared to when the infants were studied in an unheated cot. In more recent years, a heated water-filled mattress (HWM) has been developed to maintain the temperature of a preterm infant, who would otherwise be nursed in an air heated incubator (<LINK REF="REF-Tunell-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunell 1986</LINK>). The mattress can be placed in a standard baby cot. With the HWM there is conductive heat transfer to the baby and indirect heating of the air around the baby (limiting convective heat loss), thus tending to keep the baby at a normal temperature. Preliminary clinical results indicated that during treatment in the heated cot, the skin temperature was generally found to be 35 to 37 degrees C in all parts of the body covered by a blanket, while the skin of the face exposed to room air was 3 to 4 degrees C lower (<LINK REF="REF-Tunell-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunell 1986</LINK>). This may be beneficial, as it has been suggested that a lower skin face temperature may have a positive effect on thermal comfort and behavioural state (<LINK REF="REF-Bruck-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruck 1968</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-06-07 20:09:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Glenda Hawley">
<P>Parents experience a feeling of loss following the birth of a preterm infant. This is compounded by the separation of an infant in an incubator from its mother. Stress and anxiety are frequently experienced by new mothers (<LINK REF="REF-Shields_x002d_Poe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields-Poe 1997</LINK>). Maternal perceptions of their infants may influence infant development (<LINK REF="REF-Watt-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watt 1989</LINK>). Maternal perceptions and feelings may be more positive in the case of infants receiving cot-nursing because of greater maternal access to babies in open cots. Additionally, nursing staff may perceive that better care may be provided to infants nursed in open cots due to increased accessibility.</P>
<P>The cost of an air-heated incubator is substantial compared to the relatively cheap alternative of an open cot. If it could be demonstrated that nursing an infant in an open cot instead of an incubator could be achieved without adverse effect, then considerable benefit could accrue in economic terms both in developing and developed countries.</P>
<P>Although there may be benefits of nursing infants in open cots, there may be potential risks. It is possible that Infants nursed in cots may be handled more due to easier open access, which could may result in an increased risk of nosocomial infection. Conversely, there may be risks of nursing infants in incubators, such as exposure to excessive noise, resulting in negative effects on behavioural state and longer term development (<LINK REF="REF-Benini-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benini 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>The results of this review come from five studies involving a total of 247 babies. Three comparisons were undertaken: the overall comparison of cot-nursing vs incubator care, and two subgroup comparisons: cot-nursing with heated water-filled mattress vs incubator care, and cot-nursing using warming of the nursery versus incubator care.</P>
<P>
<B>Cot-nursing (any type) vs. incubator (COMPARISON 1):</B>
<BR/>Five trials of 247 infants contributed to this comparison. Data were available for pre-specified primary outcome measures, body temperature, episodes of cold stress, episodes of hyperthermia and weight gain, and for the secondary outcomes of oxygen consumption, not breast feeding at hospital discharge, episodes of nosocomial sepsis, maternal perceptions of infant's condition, maternal stress and anxiety and death prior to hospital discharge.</P>

<I>Body temperature (Outcomes 1.1 - 1.3):</I>
</B>
<BR/>There was no difference between the cot- nursing and incubator groups in mean body temperature [mean difference (MD) 0.02 degrees C; 95% confidence interval (CI) - 0.20 to 0.07]. There was, however, statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>83%) due to the inclusion of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sarman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Sarman 1989b</LINK>) in which most of the babies on recruitment had a temperature &lt; 36 degrees C. As the <LINK REF="STD-Green_x002d_Abate-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Green-Abate 1994</LINK> trial only reported the core-skin temperature gradient, it was not possible to use this data in the meta-analysis. Only the <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2004</LINK> trial reported the number of infants with episodes of cold stress and hypothermia. No differences between the cot-nursing and incubator groups were found. Similarly only the <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2004</LINK> trial reported on episodes of hyperthermia, with this outcome being found to occur more frequently in the cot-nursing group (RR 1.48; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.09). <LINK REF="STD-Green_x002d_Abate-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Green-Abate 1994</LINK> reported on the number of temperature measurements in the hypothermic and hyperthermic range per person-hours and hence these data were not used in this analysis.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-27 11:40:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of the review showed no evidence of effect of cot-nursing versus incubator care on weight gain in the overall analysis, or in the subgroup analysis comparing cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress with incubator care. However, cot-nursing with warming of the nursery during week one when compared to incubator care revealed poorer weight gain which was on average 6 g/kg/day less (<LINK REF="STD-Green_x002d_Abate-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Green-Abate 1994</LINK>). The primary outcomes related to temperature control - mean body temperature and episodes of cold stress indicated on overall analysis no effect of cot-nursing compared to incubator care. Episodes of hyperthermia in the cot-nursing group were reported more frequently in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2004</LINK>). It was reported that it was considered concerns raised by staff providing nursing care at the beginning of the trial of the possibility of cold stress/hypothermia, may have led to the temperature of the mattress being set higher than appropriate. The secondary outcomes of oxygen consumption, breast feeding at hospital discharge, episodes of nosocomial sepsis, maternal perceptions of infant's condition, maternal stress and anxiety and death prior to hospital discharge revealed there was no effect of cot-nursing compared to incubator care. There was, however, a strong trend towards less death prior to hospital discharge. This was largely related to the results were obtained from the trials undertaken in Turkey (<LINK REF="STD-Sarman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Sarman 1989b</LINK>) and Ethiopia (<LINK REF="STD-Green_x002d_Abate-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Green-Abate 1994</LINK>) and thus may not be applicable to neonatal nurseries in developed countries. Nevertheless the implications of these findings deserve consideration, particularly in the context of a developing country.</P>
<P>The protocol did not place strict a priori definitions for the primary or secondary outcomes. Hence we used the operational definitions as reported by the investigators in the eligible trials.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-05-27 11:41:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has a number of limitations. The numbers of babies enrolled in the included trials are relatively small and data were either not available or only available for very few infants for many of the pre-specified important clinical outcomes for this review. Importantly, the outcome measure related to safety - episodes of nosocomial sepsis was only addressed in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sarman-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Sarman 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2004</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-05-27 11:42:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No trials were identified that compared care in newborn cots with additional warmth provided by extra clothing/bedding or a heated element below the mattress. Furthermore, comparisons of cot nursing interventions with varying methods for incubator care e.g. servo-controlled incubators, naked babies in incubators, could not be performed due to lack of available trials. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sarman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Sarman 1989b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green_x002d_Abate-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Green-Abate 1994</LINK>) took place in developing countries (Ethiopia and Turkey) where major differences in medical and nursing care were evident in comparison to developed countries. In the study carried out in Turkey (<LINK REF="STD-Sarman-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Sarman 1989b</LINK>), a limited number of nurses were available in the nursery, with care largely being provided by the mothers. Accordingly, one may not be able to generalize from these the results.</P>
<P>One included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2004</LINK>) assessed the effect of cot-nursing on maternal perceptions and maternal stress and anxiety and found no difference in comparison to the incubator group of infants. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Sarman--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sarman 1993</LINK>) reported mothers' perceptions of their preterm infants treated in a cot with a heated water-filled mattress versus in an incubator. This pilot study suggested that the babies treated in a cot on a heated water-filled mattress were healthier and more vigorous than those in an incubator and that the mothers felt that their babies 'belonged to them'. These data could not be included as the infants were subsets of two other trials.</P>
<P>The heated water-filled mattress was designed as a cheap and technically simple device that when placed in a cot could be used as an alternative to incubator care (<LINK REF="REF-Tunell-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunell 1986</LINK>). No studies were identified which compared the costs of cot-nursing compared to nursing a baby in an incubator.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-11-01 23:14:58 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Glenda Hawley">
<P>The results of the review provides evidence that cot nursing is comparable to incubator care, without any indication that there is an increased risk of adverse outcome. Indeed it has been recommended that when a preterm infant is stable without the requirement for respiratory support, then cot-nursing and in particular using the HWM may replace incubator care (<LINK REF="REF-Tunell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunell 2004</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-11-11 23:25:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Glenda Hawley">
<P>Despite there being a relatively small number of trials included and infants studied, it would seem overall that cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress has similar effects to incubator care with regard to temperature control and weight gain. While limited data are available for important secondary outcomes including episodes of nosocomial sepsis, not breast feeding at hospital discharge and death prior to hospital discharge, together with cost it is suggested that cot-nursing with a heated water-filled mattress may be employed for preterm infants. Even though little information is available on cot-nursing in a space-heated room, it is suggested that cot-nursing in this manner is not appropriate.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-11 23:25:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Glenda Hawley">
<P>Further investigation of the role of cot-nursing for preterm infants using randomised controlled trials is necessary. Different forms of providing extra warmth to the infants while in cots need to be examined in comparison with varying methods of incubator care. Important clinical outcomes to be addressed in future research include thermoregulation, weight gain, breast feeding, mortality and nosocomial infection. The issue of cost is important, especially as it pertains to developing countries. A formal assessment of expenditure for equipment purchase, the cost of nursing care and length of hospital stay needs to be carried out.</P>
