<TITLE MODIFIED="2009-09-30 12:51:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">Minocycline for acne vulgaris: efficacy and safety</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-06 09:23:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Acne is the most common skin disease of adolescence, and in most cases it clears spontaneously. However, in some people it persists in to adulthood. There are many different treatment options, but there is little good evidence to inform doctors and individuals about which to choose.</P>
<P>Minocycline was the most prescribed antibiotic used to treat acne because it was thought to be better than other options, despite the original version of this review finding no reliable evidence that it was any better than other treatments. Over recent years it has been used less, which was due to serious concerns about its safety, including skin pigmentation, which in some cases is irreversible. It was also more expensive than other treatments.</P>
<P>Since the first version of this review, minocycline's cost has fallen. In the UK, the daily cost of generic minocycline is now one third the cost of tetracycline. This update was undertaken to identify whether there was any new evidence that might change the conclusions of the original review or provide information on risks associated with minocycline therapy. Twelve new RCTs were identified, making a total of 39 RCTs (6013 participants).</P>
<P>In summary, there is no evidence to support the first-line use of minocycline in the treatment of acne. All of the trials showed that, on average, people treated with minocycline experienced an improvement in their acne. However, no study conclusively showed any important clinical difference between minocycline or other commonly-used therapies. The analysis found that minocycline may act more quickly than oxytetracycline or tetracycline, but there is no overall difference in the end. There is no evidence that it is more effective in acne that is resistant to other therapies, or that the effects last longer. Although it is often claimed that the more expensive once-daily slow-release preparation is a more attractive option to teenagers with acne, the evidence in this review does not show it to be any better or safer compared to other oral antibiotics that have to be taken more frequently.</P>
<P>Despite a thorough search for evidence, it is still not known which of the tetracyclines are the safest to take overall as they are all associated with side-effects. The only conclusion that we could make was that people treated with minocycline for acne are at a significantly greater risk of developing an autoimmune (lupus-like) syndrome than those given tetracycline or no treatment.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-04 10:02:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Minocycline is an oral antibiotic used for acne vulgaris. Its use has lessened due to safety concerns (including potentially irreversible pigmentation), a relatively high cost, and no evidence of any greater benefit than other acne treatments. A modified-release version of minocycline is being promoted as having fewer side-effects.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-05-26 14:38:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess new evidence on the effects of minocycline for acne vulgaris.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-07-04 16:26:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Searches were updated in the following databases to November 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched trials registers and checked reference lists for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P>
<P>The Cochrane Skin Group's Trials Search Co-ordinator undertook searches exploring minocycline's adverse effects in EMBASE and MEDLINE in February 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-06-22 11:38:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing minocycline, at any dose, to an active or a placebo control, in participants with inflammatory acne vulgaris. For adverse effects, we selected additional studies that reported the number of adverse effects and the number of participants treated.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-06-21 22:08:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Outcome measures used in the trials included lesion counts, acne grades/severity scores, doctors' and participants' global assessments, adverse effects, and dropout rates. Two authors independently assessed the quality of each study. Effect sizes were calculated, and meta-analyses were undertaken where possible.</P>
<P>Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria for the review of adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-06 12:04:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 12 new RCTs for this update, giving a total of 39 RCTs (6013 participants). These additional 12 RCTs have not changed the original conclusions about the clinical efficacy of minocycline.</P>
<P>The identified RCTs were generally small and poor quality. Meta-analysis was rarely possible because of the lack of data and different outcome measures and trial durations. Although minocycline was shown to be an effective treatment for moderate to moderately-severe acne vulgaris, there was no evidence that it is better than any of the other commonly-used acne treatments. One company-sponsored RCT found minocycline to be less effective than combination treatment with topical erythromycin and zinc. No trials have been conducted using minocycline in those participants whose acne is resistant to other therapies. Also, there is no evidence to guide what dose should be used.</P>
<P>The adverse effects studies must be interpreted with caution. The evidence suggests that minocycline is associated with more severe adverse effects than doxycycline. Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, is associated with lupus erythematosus, but the risk is small: 8.8 cases per 100,000 person-years. The risk of autoimmune reactions increases with duration of use. The evidence does not support the conclusion that the more expensive extended-release preparation is safer than standard minocycline preparations.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-06-17 16:29:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Minocycline is an effective treatment for moderate to moderately-severe inflammatory acne vulgaris, but there is still no evidence that it is superior to other commonly-used therapies. This review found no reliable evidence to justify the reinstatement of its first-line use, even though the price-differential is less than it was 10 years ago. Concerns remain about its safety compared to other tetracyclines. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-10 14:12:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Please see the Glossary in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for an explanation of terms used in this review.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-03 22:04:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Acne is the most common skin disease of adolescence, and few teenagers escape the experience (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2012</LINK>). The severity of acne varies considerably, and in some individuals, acne persists well beyond the teens for reasons that are not yet clear (<LINK REF="REF-Goulden-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulden 1997</LINK>). Acne usually begins before or during puberty when the output of sebum (grease) by tiny hair follicles on the face and upper trunk increases substantially (<LINK REF="REF-Rothman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothman 1993</LINK>). The production of sebum is controlled by male hormones (androgens) in both sexes. Spots form in follicles that respond abnormally to the hormones producing sebum. At the same time that sebum production increases, some of the openings through which the sebum flows (pores) become blocked by horny impactions made up of dead skin cells. The sebum acts as a nutrient for a resident skin bacterium called <I>Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes)</I>, which colonises both healthy and diseased follicles. The role of <I>P. acnes</I> in the pathogenesis of acne has never been formally proven, and there is some doubt that it has any role to play (<LINK REF="REF-Shaheen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaheen 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the absence of effective treatment, acne persists for an average of 8 to 12 years in most sufferers (<LINK REF="REF-Cunliffe-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunliffe 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cunliffe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunliffe 1996</LINK>), before it resolves spontaneously, usually but not always, by the early 20s.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-07-10 14:12:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Conventional treatments act by interfering with one or more of the factors (described above) that cause spots to form. Thus, drug treatments that reduce sebum production or the blockage of the pores, inhibit the growth of the acne bacillus, or both, are commonly used (<LINK REF="REF-Leyden-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leyden 1997</LINK>). Alternative approaches, such as dietary manipulation, relaxation therapy, homeopathy, Chinese herbs, and counselling, have been tried in acne management, especially in those people who do not want to use conventional methods for extended periods. Most available treatments, such as antibiotics, antiandrogens (including the combined oral contraceptive), and agents that unblock pores, only stop spots forming whilst the drug is being used, and therefore must be used extensively and continuously. The only potential cure for acne is oral isotretinoin (Roaccutane&#8482;), which reduces sebum production permanently (<LINK REF="REF-Saurat-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saurat 1997</LINK>). However, oral isotretinoin is a teratogen (a drug that, like thalidomide, may cause abnormalities in unborn babies) and causes significant side-effects; therefore, prescribing is limited to individuals whose acne is severe, persistent, or unresponsive to alternative medications. It is also recommended in people who scar easily as well as those who are emotionally distressed (<LINK REF="REF-Ortonne-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortonne 1997</LINK>). Thus, oral and topical antibiotics continue to be widely prescribed.</P>
<P>Minocycline is an orally-taken antibiotic that belongs to a class of drugs known as the tetracyclines. These can be subdivided into two classes: the original or 'first-generation' tetracyclines (oxytetracycline and tetracycline) and the 'second-generation' tetracyclines (such as minocycline, doxycycline, and lymecycline), which were chemically adapted to provide additional benefits. Historically, the preferential use of minocycline in the treatment of acne arose because of several perceived advantages over the other tetracyclines (that were fostered by a very successful marketing strategy).</P>
<P>One of the well-publicised benefits of minocycline was its convenience - because of its extended half-life, it only needs to be taken orally once-daily, and absorption is not affected by food. This is in contrast to tetracycline and oxytetracycline, which need to be taken on an empty stomach up to four times a day. It is also widely perceived by clinicians to have a faster onset of action than tetracycline or oxytetracycline and to be beneficial in acne that does not respond to other therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Knaggs-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knaggs 1993</LINK>). In addition, although the exact relationship between bacterial levels and acne severity has not been clearly defined, in vivo studies have shown that minocycline produces a greater reduction of skin <I>P. acnes</I> levels compared to tetracycline (<LINK REF="REF-Eady-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eady 1990a</LINK>), and there is a lower level of bacterial resistance to it (<LINK REF="STD-Eady-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Eady 1993</LINK>). The effects of minocycline are also commonly believed to persist post-treatment because of its high lipophilicity (fat solubility) and resultant distribution within the body (<LINK REF="REF-Chopra-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chopra 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leyden-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Leyden 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many of the pharmacological advantages of minocycline over the first-generation tetracyclines (oxytetracycline and tetracycline) have been ascribed to its increased lipid solubility (<LINK REF="REF-Colaizzi-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colaizzi 1969</LINK>). A greater per cent of the drug is absorbed from the intestinal tract, and the serum half-life is extended by several hours (<LINK REF="REF-Agruh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agruh 2006</LINK>). The sustained blood levels are thought to translate biologically into higher skin concentrations and enhanced sebum penetration (<LINK REF="REF-Luderschmidt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luderschmidt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macdonald-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macdonald 1973</LINK>), although this view has been challenged (<LINK REF="REF-Aubin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aubin 1989</LINK>). The absorption profile and steady state concentration also varies significantly between individuals, which cannot be explained by participant size and weight (<LINK REF="REF-Leyden-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leyden 1985</LINK>). There is considerable variation and overlap in serum concentrations that are achieved following doses of 100 mg or 200 mg per day (<LINK REF="STD-Eady-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Eady 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gardner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 1997</LINK>). The observation that the absorption profile of minocycline is minimally affected by the stomach contents (<LINK REF="REF-Leyden-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leyden 1985</LINK>) has been disputed by a later study, which showed that the presence of food in the stomach reduced minocycline absorption between 2% and 51% (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>As a result of the enhanced absorption of minocycline, lower doses are required and less of the active drug remains in the gastro-intestinal tract, minimising the disturbances to the resident microflora that often result in gastro-intestinal upset (<LINK REF="REF-Fanning-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanning 1977</LINK>). However, minocycline and other second-generation tetracyclines exhibit an increased spectrum and incidence of adverse effects, which has been linked to their accumulation in fatty tissue and to their longer half-life (<LINK REF="REF-Ruef-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruef 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The once-daily dosage advantage of minocycline is not unique; lymecycline and doxycycline are typically prescribed as a single-daily dose. In recent years, lymecycline has gained in popularity following the publication of a series of manufacturer-sponsored trials attesting to its efficacy in acne. </P>
<P>Initially, attention focused on the vestibular side-effects of minocycline (<LINK REF="REF-Gump-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gump 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1974</LINK>). The vestibular system is in the inner ear and contributes to balance and the sense of spatial orientation. Diseases of the vestibular system usually induce vertigo and instability, and they are often accompanied by nausea. Prior to 1974, reports of these side-effects were rare, but that year saw a marked increase from less than 10% to over 70% of individuals in the U.S. who were treated. A similar increase was not evident in other countries (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1976</LINK>). With widespread and continued use, other side-effects have become apparent, leading to periodic debate over the safety of minocycline use for acne (<LINK REF="REF-Basler-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basler 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davies-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1988</LINK>). All tetracyclines bind to calcified tissues and are deposited and persist where normal bone forms. Minocycline causes pigmentation in a variety of tissues including skin, thyroid, nails, sclera, teeth, conjunctiva, tongue, and bone. The pigmentation can be irreversible.</P>
<P>Three patterns of serious reactions to minocycline have been described:</P>
<UL>
<LI>early onset dose-related toxicity reactions resulting in single organ dysfunction;</LI>
<LI>hypersensitivity reactions (presenting as pneumonitis, eosinophilia, nephritis, and serum-sickness-like syndrome); and</LI>
<LI>autoimmune disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, and polyarteritis nodosa).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Safety concerns increased markedly following the publication of an article in the BMJ that highlighted the risk of potentially fatal liver failure with two documented deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Gough-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gough 1996</LINK>). Further reports followed (<LINK REF="REF-Beneton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beneton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crosson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knowles-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knowles 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacNeil-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacNeil 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1997</LINK>), and consequently, the level of minocycline prescribing fell by 38% in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2012</LINK>). The ensuing controversy over the safety of minocycline provoked several articles, with differing opinions amongst dermatologists as to the relative risks and benefits of minocycline, tetracycline or oxytetracycline for the treatment of acne (<LINK REF="REF-Beneton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beneton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cunliffe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunliffe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fessler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fessler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seukeran-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seukeran 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 2010 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an extended-release (ER) formulation of minocycline (Solodyn® by Medicis pharmaceutical Corporation) for once-daily treatment of non-nodular moderate to severe acne at a dose of 1 mg/kg. The packaging insert states that a 135 mg dose has a longer T max (time to maximum dose in the blood) (3.5 to 4 hours versus (vs) 2.25 to 3 hours), a lower C max (maximum blood concentration) (2.63 mcg/ml vs 2.92 mcg/ml), and a smaller AUC (area under the curve, which represents how much of the drug is in the body over time) (33.32 vs 46.35 mcg/hr/ml). It is claimed that the extended-release formulation has reduced side-effects, particularly vertigo. Three included studies tested this formulation (<LINK REF="STD-Fleisch-2006a-_x0028_MP010404_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Fleisch 2006a (MP010404)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleisch-2006b-_x0028_MP010405_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Fleisch 2006b (MP010405)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2006-_x0028_MP010401_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2006 (MP010401)</LINK>).</P>
<P>As well as considering the relative risks and benefits of interventions, unfortunately, in today's climate of rising healthcare expenditure, the comparative cost-benefit must be considered. Since the original publication of the review, the relative costs of antibiotics have changed dramatically. Minocycline is no longer the most expensive (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-07-04 10:42:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The fact that acne responds to antibiotics is one of the strongest pieces of evidence that acne is a bacterial disease caused by the bacterium <I>P.acnes</I>. However, all of the antibiotics used to treat acne, including minocycline, also exhibit multiple anti-inflammatory effects. For example, the tetracyclines as a group are matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, and this action may contribute to therapeutic efficacy in acne by limiting proteolytic tissue damage (<LINK REF="REF-Soory-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soory 2008</LINK>). Hence, the relative contributions of antibacterial activity and anti-inflammatory activity to clinical efficacy of the tetracyclines, including minocycline, is not known. </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-07-06 11:49:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Prescribing of minocycline for acne has fallen dramatically in the last decade since the publication of the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2012</LINK>). However, its use is potentially increasing again due to the recent licensing in the United States of a extended-release version (Solodyn®). There appears to have been a non-evidence based switch back to first-generation tetracyclines (such as oxytetracycline or tetracycline) or to the second-generation tetracycline, lymecycline. The main reason for updating this review was to examine new data on the relative efficacy of the tetracyclines in acne and, especially, any head-to-head comparisons of minocycline with lymecycline. Whilst the emphasis was on clinical efficacy, we also sought to examine new safety data, especially any that shed light on the relative risks of the tetracyclines when used chronically, as in acne management.  </P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-06-22 12:09:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The primary aim of updating this review was to determine whether evidence from newer studies was persuasive enough to justify amending our original conclusions about the efficacy or safety of minocycline for acne, or both. Specifically the objectives were as follows:<BR/>1. To identify any new RCTs comparing the efficacy of minocycline against placebo and other drug treatments for acne (both oral and topical) with the aim of undertaking meta-analysis.<BR/>2. To examine any new safety data on the incidence of adverse effects associated with minocycline therapy, and to determine whether the risk increases with dose or duration of therapy.</P>

<P>All prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which minocycline was compared either to placebo or to another active therapy in participants with acne vulgaris were eligible for inclusion, if at least one generally-accepted outcome measure was used. We did not exclude trials on the basis of language, and we included open trials.</P>
<P>It is recognised that rare adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are unlikely to occur in clinical trials involving relatively-small numbers of participants with short follow-up periods; therefore, estimates of the frequency of such events cannot be obtained by pooling data from several small trials. In addition, spontaneous report systems and case reports are not reliable sources of evidence, as the actual number of events that individuals experience is uncertain because of selective reporting and the fact that the number of participants who received the therapy overall is not known. Therefore, information on the incidence of the less common and more severe ADRs associated with minocycline was sought from systematic reviews, cohort studies, or case-control studies that provided a clear indication on the numerator (i.e. the number of adverse effects) and the denominator (the number of participants treated).</P>

<P>In accordance with the methods used in the original version of the review, this update did not select primary and secondary outcome measures. This is because there is no evidence on which to differentiate the reliability and validity of measures. The outcome measures of interest were those that estimated clinical efficacy, participant acceptability, or both, in a defined way. There are many different methods used to assess clinical efficacy, and there is no evidence at present on their relative validity, reliability, or responsiveness. Therefore, we included lesion counts (total, inflamed, and non-inflamed, separately), acne severity scores, physicians' global evaluation, and participants' self-assessment. The abbreviations used throughout this review are non-inflamed lesion (NIL), inflamed lesion (IL), and total lesion (TL).</P>
<P>Data on the overall incidence of ADRs, the incidence of gastro-intestinal (GI) disturbances, and the incidence of ADRs necessitating withdrawal of therapy were analysed for each study to assess the relative safety of each intervention. We judged the acceptability of each therapy either directly or through evidence of compliance and overall dropout rates. We excluded studies that used only surrogate markers of efficacy (such as numbers of cutaneous propionibacteria).</P>

<P>In this review, our analyses attempted to include all people who had been randomised to minocycline or control treatments (an intention-to-treat analysis).</P>
<P>Where continuous data, such as lesion counts or grades from baseline, were used, we extracted the mean and standard error/deviation of the change from baseline to each assessment and calculated the mean difference. In most cases, it was not possible to extract these data directly from the trial report or obtain them from the authors/trial sponsors. If the calculated P value or T statistic was given, we used it to estimate the effect size; otherwise, we used the authors' report of significance.</P>
<P>If the authors of the study had designated a cut-off point for determination of clinical effectiveness (e.g. a 40% reduction in inflamed lesion counts, or attainment of grade 2 on a grading scale), we used this to calculate the risk ratio (RR). Similarly, we dichotomised the results of the participant and doctor evaluations where necessary (e.g. into either 'improved' or 'not improved') and calculated RRs. The RR compares the risk of the event in people receiving minocycline versus people who are receiving an alternative treatment.</P>
<UL>
<LI>A RR of 1 means there is no difference in risk between the 2 groups.</LI>
<LI>A RR of &lt; 1 means the event is less likely to occur in the experimental group than in the control group.</LI>

<P>The duration of the trials ranged from 4 to 24 weeks, with a median of 12 weeks. There is no agreed minimum duration of acne trials, but 12 weeks is commonly used. Nineteen of the trials were conducted under double-blind conditions where neither the assessor nor the participant knew the treatment allocation. In another six, the investigator was unaware of the treatment allocation, but the participant was. Both the participant and the investigator knew the treatment allocation in 14 RCTs.

Non-inferiority trials are designed to demonstrate that the efficacy of a new treatment is not worse than the chosen control by more than a specified margin (in this case a 15% difference in inflamed lesion count).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The 39 RCTs enrolled a total of 6013 participants. The ages ranged from 9 to 47, although most trials (29) insisted on a minimum age of between 12 to 17 years. Where it was stated in 29 of the RCTs, the maximum age was above 24 and generally over 30. Post-adolescent acne is generally regarded as harder to treat, so the degree to which the results can be generalised to adolescents is questionable.

One further RCT of an oral contraceptive inevitably only included women (<LINK REF="STD-Monk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 1987</LINK>). Otherwise, there was a fairly even distribution of men and women or boys and girls across the studies, with a few notable exceptions (<LINK REF="STD-Blecschmidt-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Blecschmidt 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cullen-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Cullen 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Darrah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darrah 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dreno-1998-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 1998 [pers comm]</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dreno-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fallica-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fallica 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hersle-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Hersle 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleisch-2006a-_x0028_MP010404_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Fleisch 2006a (MP010404)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleisch-2006b-_x0028_MP010405_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Fleisch 2006b (MP010405)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peacock-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peacock 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelfini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pelfini 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>All trials reported the entry and exclusion criteria, but there was a lot of variation. The severity of acne varied from mild to severe, but most RCTs included mainly participants with 'moderate to moderately severe inflammatory disease'. Only four trials included participants with mild as well as moderate acne (<LINK REF="STD-Darrah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darrah 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hersle-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Hersle 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Revuz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Revuz 1985</LINK>), and none only included non-inflammatory acne. Almost all included moderate acne (33), and 24 included severe acne. Three trials only included severe acne, two compared minocycline to oral isotretinoin (<LINK REF="STD-Gollnick-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gollnick 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pigatto-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Pigatto 1986</LINK>), and one assessed combination treatment with adapalene (<LINK REF="STD-Smit-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Smit 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria almost always included hypersensitivity to tetracyclines or the comparator as well as pregnancy and lactation. In addition, some authors specifically excluded participants with renal or hepatic dysfunction, vertigo (a common side-effect of minocycline therapy), or any intercurrent illness. Participants with secondary acne and acne conglobata or fulminans were specifically mentioned as excluded by a minority of authors. Such participants should not have been included in any of the trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Among the trials identified, there was considerable variation in the choice of comparator and in the dose of minocycline. Treatment regimens varied from 100 mg per day in 1 or 2 divided doses, to 100 mg or 200 mg initially followed by 50 mg or 100 mg after the first 4 weeks. In 1 instance, 100 mg was given on alternate days after the first 2 weeks, as is recommended in France by the manufacturer (<LINK REF="STD-Cunliffe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunliffe 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six RCTs included a placebo comparison, and three RCTs examined different doses of minocycline. The following oral antibiotics were compared with minocycline: oxytetracycline (2 RCTs), tetracycline (7), doxycycline (5), lymecycline (4), roxithromycin (1), faropenem (1), and josamycin (1). Minocycline was compared against zinc gluconate in one RCT and two different hormonal treatments; cyproterone acetate/ethinyloestradiol (1 RCT) and a type 1 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (1 RCT). The comparisons against topical treatments were topical clindamycin (3 RCTs), topical erythromycin/zinc(1), topical fusidic acid (1) and benzoyl peroxide and benzoyl peroxide/erythromycin (1). Combination treatments were evaluated in four RCTs, and two RCTs compared minocycline with isotretinoin. Finally, one RCT evaluated minocycline as a maintenance therapy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Almost all the trials used more than one outcome measure, and over 50 different methods were used. Thirty-five RCTs counted various combinations of lesions, but there was once again considerable variation in how this was carried out, what was included, and how it was reported (e.g. separate and total lesion counts, absolute changes from baseline, and percentage lesion counts). Although most authors reported mean reductions in grade or lesion count, a minority reported medians instead or in addition (<LINK REF="STD-Gollnick-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gollnick 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 1987</LINK>). Four used grades only (<LINK REF="STD-Blecschmidt-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Blecschmidt 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fallica-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fallica 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hubbell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hubbell 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samuelson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Samuelson 1985</LINK>), and only 17 included any assessment made by the participants.</P>
<P>A variety of significance tests were used with both acne grades and lesion counts: the commonest being the student's t-test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and analysis of covariance. In two instances, non-parametric tests, such as Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon, had been carried out on means instead of medians (<LINK REF="STD-Smit-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Smit 1978;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Stainforth-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Stainforth 1993</LINK>). As far as it could be ascertained, most studies were analysed on a per-protocol basis. A minority of trials used intention-to-treat analysis. It was not always clear how withdrawals and participants who failed to attend at one or more visits had been dealt with, and few studies specified how many of the participants enrolled had been included in the final analysis.</P>
<P>Two studies used a simple quality of life (QOL) questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Dreno-1998-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 1998 [pers comm]</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peacock-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peacock 1990</LINK>), and one included recognised QOL instruments suitable for cost-utility analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>All evaluable trials collected data on unwanted effects, and all but one reported these data in some form. However, some collected data on adverse events, some on side-effects, and some on tolerance. Details of how unwanted effects were identified were given only occasionally and were rarely adequate. Twelve studies gave no detail whatsoever, and five merely stated that they asked the participant. <LINK REF="STD-Revuz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Revuz 1985</LINK> recorded those adverse effects that were spontaneously reported by participants or observed by the doctor. <LINK REF="STD-Khanna-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 1993</LINK> questioned participants about four specific categories of side-effect (photosensitivity, signs of benign intracranial hypertension, hyperpigmentation, and vaginal candidiasis). <LINK REF="STD-Ruping-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ruping 1985</LINK> reported tolerance on a five-point scale as separately assessed by participants and physicians. <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1988</LINK> asked the specific question, 'Has the treatment upset you in any way?'. <LINK REF="STD-Waskiewicz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waskiewicz 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lorette-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lorette 1994</LINK> assessed tolerance on the basis of subjective criteria (e.g. dizziness) and objective signs (e.g. urticaria). <LINK REF="STD-Darrah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darrah 1996</LINK> recorded adverse effects as observed by the physician and as reported spontaneously by the participant in response to a non-leading question. There was clearly confusion about definitions, and some authors had apparently made quite arbitrary decisions about which adverse effects were possibly drug-related. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Cullen-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Cullen 1976</LINK> ruled that joint pain and swelling of the fingers in a minocycline-treated participant was unlikely to be drug-related. In the vast majority of studies, it was impossible to ascertain what proportion of participants had been included in the safety analysis. In 6/26 studies, side-effects were only reported if they led to withdrawal of the participant. Only one of these six studies actually made it clear that participants who hadn't been withdrawn did not report any side-effects.</P>
<P>For the additional review of adverse effects, we identified 16 studies (please see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), of which 3 used a number of different designs simultaneously. Three studies used nationally-reported pharmacovigilence data, and four examined cohorts of consecutive participants attending clinics. Large prescribing databases were the subject of two cohort studies and three case-control studies. Finally, we identified seven systematic reviews.</P>

<P>We excluded 64 studies that are commonly cited as evidence of the effectiveness of minocycline: Most were uncontrolled cohort studies.

<P>Only six of the RCT reports (published and unpublished) mentioned any specifics about how the randomisation was carried out and were rated as low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Blecschmidt-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Blecschmidt 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunliffe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunliffe 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Darrah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darrah 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leyden-2006-_x0028_Part-2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Leyden 2006 (Part 2)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peacock-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peacock 1990</LINK>). The remainder of the included studies did not provide additional information beyond the fact that the study was randomised. One study matched pairs of participants in the treatment groups prior to randomisation on the basis of age, sex, and baseline acne severity (<LINK REF="STD-Sheehan_x002d_Dare-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sheehan-Dare 1989</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Pelfini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pelfini 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Waskiewicz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waskiewicz 1992</LINK> were rated as high risk of bias. In <LINK REF="STD-Pelfini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pelfini 1989</LINK>, the trial design was compromised by a number of participants who were also given 5% benzoyl peroxide, which is very active. Also, two different treatments schedules and the method of randomisation was unclear and possibly based on severity. In <LINK REF="STD-Waskiewicz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waskiewicz 1992</LINK>, the investigators stated that three participants dropped out and were re-included in the trial three to six months after their dropout. In the meantime, their acne did not improve spontaneously or with other treatments. The re-inclusion of dropouts was judged to have compromised the randomisation.</P>

The 34 participants treated with minocycline were reported to have a 49.2% reduction in inflamed lesion counts compared to 26.8% in the 37 participants treated with placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) (means difference (MD) 22.40, 95% CI 4.34 to 40.46) (<LINK REF="STD-Leyden-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leyden 2004</LINK>). Non-inflamed lesion counts did not appear to be undertaken, and no usable data on adverse effects were reported.</P>
<P>Three RCTs evaluated a extended-release formulation of minocycline and were all sponsored by Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation. The two 3-month phase 3 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fleisch-2006a-_x0028_MP010404_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Fleisch 2006a (MP010404)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleisch-2006b-_x0028_MP010405_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Fleisch 2006b (MP010405)</LINK>) included a total of 615 participants receiving minocycline 1 mg/kg and 309 participants receiving placebo. The results of the phase 2 dose-finding trial are further discussed under '2. Dose response' (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2006-_x0028_MP010401_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2006 (MP010401)</LINK>). The similarities between the trial designs in the three RCTs meant that meta-analysis could be undertaken. Minocycline ER resulted in a statistically significant greater percentage reduction in inflamed lesion counts (45.5% reduction versus 32.4%) in <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> (MD 13.43, 95% CI 7.10 to 19.76) and total lesion counts in <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK> (MD 9.84, 95% CI 4.84 to 14.84), but not non-inflamed lesion counts (14.9 vs 6.3 mean per cent reduction from baseline - data not presented in poolable format); the authors stated it as being 'not inferior' and not causing an exacerbation. Pooled treatment success as evaluated by the investigator was <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK> (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.82). For all three analyses I² statistic = 0%. There was no statistically significant difference between the numbers of participants at different doses of minocycline and the placebo group whose skin was clear or almost clear after 12 weeks in <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK> (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.24). Adverse effect data were not presented for the individual trials.</P>
<P>One small Spanish-language study conducted in Chile (80 participants) compared minocycline to tetracycline and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Cabezas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cabezas 1993</LINK>). Very sparse data on the trial methodology and results were available in this publication. The authors did not report any statistical comparison between the minocycline and placebo group. No further data could be obtained from either the trial authors or sponsors.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Dose response</HEADING>
<P>In most countries, the manufacturer's recommended dose of minocycline for acne is 100 mg per day, which is half the normal therapeutic dose used for other indications. Therefore, it is surprising that no study was located that compared 100 mg to 200 mg per day in the treatment of acne.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pierard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pierard 2002</LINK> compared 50 mg a day for 12 weeks with 50 mg twice-daily for 4 weeks, followed by 50 mg a day for 8 weeks. There were only 28 and 31 participants randomised to each group, respectively; very few methodological details were provided; and there were no baseline assessments of equivalence. The authors concluded that the inflammatory papule counts in the 100/50 mg group showed a statistically significant greater reduction compared to the 50 mg daily group (P &lt; 0.05, non-parametric pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test). No details were provided on open comedones, closed comedones, and pustules. There was also a significant difference in the investigator and participant global assessments (P &lt; 0.05, Chi² test). The trial was primarily an evaluation of in vivo antibacterial efficacy, and therefore few protocol details were presented and few clinical data were available from the publication. The authors did not respond to requests for additional information. The authors concluded that the "microbial response to minocycline 100/50 mg was also superior", although no data were provided for further assessment, only a graph. There was insufficient information mentioned in the trial report to allow for proper assessment.</P>
<P>A publication of a double-blind, phase two, dose-ranging trial that explored the appropriate dose of a extended-release form of minocycline was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2006-_x0028_MP010401_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2006 (MP010401)</LINK>). The randomisation was stratified by body weight with 233 participants with moderate to severe acne given either placebo or 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, or 3 mg/kg minocycline ER for 12 weeks. There was a high dropout of 57 participants (24%). By day 84, the number of inflammatory lesions had decreased by 39% in the placebo group and 57%, 49%, and 47%, respectively, in the minocycline groups. The authors concluded that no dose-dependent effect was observed in either global assessment scores, inflamed lesion counts, non-inflamed lesions, or total lesion counts. Although it is probable that insufficient numbers of participants were recruited to ensure the trial was adequately powered, no power calculation was included in the publication. Compared to placebo, the only difference in per cent change from baseline in inflammatory lesions that reached statistical significance was the 1 mg/kg group at 84 days. There were no statistically significant differences between any of the groups for the changes in the number of non-inflamed lesions, total lesion counts, or number of participants who were clear/almost clear as rated by the assessor (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). Subgroup analyses were conducted (it was not stated whether they were planned or post hoc). The analyses indicated that minocycline ER "seemed to be somewhat less effective in the heaviest subjects".</P>
<P>One RCT compared minocycline at a continuous dose of 100 mg per day for 8 weeks with the same initial regimen, but at a reduced dose of only 50 mg per day after 2 weeks. The lead investigator supplied the full report of outcomes from the trial report, but it is as yet unpublished (<LINK REF="STD-Dreno-1998-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 1998 [pers comm]</LINK>). A total of 325 participants were included in the tolerance analysis: 307 in the intention-to-treat and 214 in the per-protocol. After eight weeks, no significant differences between the dosage regimens were noted in any of the outcome measures using either per-protocol or intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). However, because of the short duration of the study, inferences cannot be made concerning their relative efficacies in long-term treatment.</P>

<P>Tetracycline and oxytetracycline are in the first-generation class of tetracyclines.</P>
<P>The original version of the review included 7 RCTs, and 2 further RCTs were identified in the 2012 update. Of these nine studies, the authors of five reported no statistically significant differences between minocycline and (oxy)tetracycline: The methodology of these five studies reflected standards at the time, but by today's standards, it would not be considered robust. They were also likely to be underpowered due to the small total numbers of participants included: <LINK REF="STD-Cullen-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Cullen 1976</LINK> included 100 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-005.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.8</LINK>), <LINK REF="STD-Fallica-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fallica 1985</LINK> included 100 participants, <LINK REF="STD-Hubbell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hubbell 1982</LINK> included 104 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-005.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.7</LINK>), <LINK REF="STD-Samuelson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Samuelson 1985</LINK> included 62 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>), and <LINK REF="STD-Khanna-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 1993</LINK> included 44 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-005.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.9</LINK>).</P>
<P>The sixth study was more recent, well-designed, and a larger observer-blind study conducted in those with mild to moderate acne in primary care in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>). The trial was funded independently. The initial plan was to compare 11 treatments, but slow-recruitment meant that 6 arms were discontinued. Power calculations were undertaken at the start of the study, and approximately 130 participants were randomised to each arm (649 participants in total). Minocycline and oxytetracycline obtained comparable results at 18 weeks with a decrease in inflamed lesion count from baseline (MD 3.60, 95% CI -1.56 to 8.76) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>) and in those participants with at least moderate improvement, as assessed by the participants themselves (<LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>) and by the assessors (<LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>). However, at 12 weeks the minocycline-treated group had a statistically significantly greater reduction in the mean number of inflamed lesions (RR 7.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 13.48) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall numbers of participants experiencing adverse effects were not reported, and there were no differences in the numbers of participants withdrawing because of adverse effects. The oral antibiotic-treated groups experienced more gastro-intestinal and musculoskeletal events at week six. Using 2005 acquisition costs, oxytetracycline was reported as being more cost-effective and of similar effectiveness at approximately 1/7th of the cost at that time. The acquisition costs have now changed as generic minocycline has become available. The clinical efficacy of both tetracyclines was reported as being compromised in individuals who were colonised by tetracycline-resistant propionibacteria. Most of the treatment effect was seen after the first six weeks of treatment.</P>
<P>Three studies found minocycline to be superior to (oxy)tetracycline (<LINK REF="STD-Blecschmidt-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Blecschmidt 1987</LINK> (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>); <LINK REF="STD-Cabezas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cabezas 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruping-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ruping 1985</LINK>). The first two RCTs were however conducted under open conditions and had a number of serious methodological flaws. Therefore, the results must be interpreted with extreme caution. <LINK REF="STD-Ruping-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ruping 1985</LINK> reported that minocycline was significantly superior to tetracycline in terms of the reduction in inflamed lesion count at week 12, but presented the results only in graphical form and did not include any measures of dispersion or state the method used to calculate its P values. Visual inspection of the graphical data does not support the conclusion that minocycline is superior. The study included participants with acne conglobata, and assessments were performed only on one side of the face, back, or chest, with the assessment intervals grouped into 14-day periods without standardisation. The trial also reported that 36 participants could not be evaluated because of faulty or inadequate statements, with no details as to which treatment they were randomised to, and no information was provided on dropouts or the number of participants included in the analysis. The total number of adverse effects in each group was not reported, and the text is contradictory about the numbers withdrawing due to adverse effects. The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Blecschmidt-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Blecschmidt 1987</LINK>) enrolled 237 participants and had similar design faults, with 43 participants being excluded from the analysis and duration of treatment varying between 12 and 20 weeks. The outcome measure used was the number of participants improving by at least two grades at each assessment point, with no indication of what grade they improved from or to.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cabezas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cabezas 1993</LINK> was a small (80 participants) placebo-controlled, double-blind study. It was conducted in Chile, and a very brief report was published in Spanish with few methodological details. Neither the company nor the authors responded to requests for more information. There were no statistical comparisons with the placebo group, but the authors reported that there was a statistically significant difference in favour of minocycline in the average numbers of 'lesions', papules, and pustules after 45 days of treatment.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that minocycline has a faster onset of action than first-generation tetracyclines because it is more fat-soluble, and therefore higher levels are obtained in sebum. <LINK REF="STD-Khanna-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Khanna 1993</LINK> recorded a statistically significant difference in favour of minocycline compared to tetracycline in the 'acne lesion score' at six weeks but not 12 weeks (<LINK REF="CMP-005.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.9</LINK>). This effect was also reported by <LINK REF="STD-Hubbell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hubbell 1982</LINK> in the number of participants converting to grade 1 acne (indicating mild acne), although data for only 55 of 104 enrolled participants were included in the data analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-005.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.7</LINK>). Compared to tetracycline <LINK REF="STD-Samuelson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Samuelson 1985</LINK> reported statistically significant differences in the change in acne grade from baseline in favour of minocycline at weeks two and eight, but only as assessed by the investigator and not when self-assessed by participants. However, the only data provided were the mean grade at each time point, which showed no difference between the groups (<LINK REF="CMP-005.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Blecschmidt-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Blecschmidt 1987</LINK> found that, statistically significantly, more participants treated with minocycline had improved by 2 or more grades by the end of weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 than those treated with oxytetracycline (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). Visual inspection of the survival curves presented in <LINK REF="STD-Ruping-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ruping 1985</LINK> also suggested minocycline had a faster onset of action against papules and pustules (with the caveat about the methodology as described in the paragraph). In all cases where the initial response to minocycline was faster, the magnitude of the reduction in acne severity produced by both drugs at the end of the treatment period was similar (<LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The concerns about the robustness of the RCTs not withstanding, some limited meta-analysis of the 'overall improvement' results could be undertaken (<LINK REF="CMP-005.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.8</LINK>). This indicated that, as assessed by the investigator, more participants receiving minocycline had improved compared to those receiving tetracycline at week 6 (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.96, I² statistic = 72%), but not week 12 (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.31, I² statistic = 0%). However, this difference was not evident when a random-effects meta-analysis was undertaken, reflecting the heterogeneity identified.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">b. Minocycline versus lymecycline (Tetralysal)</HEADING>
<P>Lymecycline is a second-generation tetracycline, which, like minocycline, is typically given as a single-daily dose. It has become the most commonly prescribed first-line antibiotic for acne in Europe.</P>
<P>The original version of the review included two RCTs that compared lymecycline with minocycline, both of which used reducing doses of each drug (as is common practice in France). The first was a 144-participant double-blind, double-dummy trial in 5 centres (<LINK REF="STD-Cunliffe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunliffe 1998</LINK>), which was sponsored by Galderma, who manufacture lymecycline. A variety of outcome measures were used, but the primary end point was declared in advance as the per cent reduction in inflamed lesion count at week 12. Using both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses, no significant difference was found between minocycline and lymecycline for this or any other outcome measure (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.5</LINK>). The sample size had been calculated to enable the study to detect a 15% difference in the percentage reduction in the inflamed lesion count with an 80% probability using a two-sided test performed at the 0.05 significance level. The second study was a small (71 participants) 12-week open study and additionally included participants treated with doxycycline (<LINK REF="STD-Schollhammer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Schollhammer 1994</LINK>). The authors reported a 68.4%, 72.7%, and 62.4% reduction in inflamed lesion counts in the minocycline, lymecycline, and doxycycline groups, respectively. These differences were not found to be statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05, test not reported); however, the trial was likely to be very underpowered.</P>
<P>The 2012 update identified a further two 12-week RCTs trials that both compared 300 mg lymecycline daily with 2 different minocycline regimens.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pierard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pierard 2002</LINK> compared 300 mg lymecycline per day for 12 weeks with 2 different minocycline regimens (50 mg a day for 12 weeks or, alternatively, 50 mg twice-daily for 4 weeks, followed by 50 mg a day for 8 weeks). Double-dummy treatments were used. One of the authors was affiliated with Wyeth-Lederle. There were only 28 and 31 participants randomised to each group, respectively; very few methodological details were provided; and there were no baseline assessments of equivalence. The trial was primarily an evaluation of in vivo antibacterial efficacy; therefore, few protocol details were presented, and few clinical data were available from the publication. The authors concluded that the 100/50 mg group compared to the lymecycline group showed statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05, non-parametric pair-wise Wilcoxon rank sum test) "less severe" acne lesions, a greater reduction in inflammatory papule counts, and "significantly less lesions" at week 12. "Approximately one third" of participants in the lymecycline and minocycline 50 mg groups reported "the clearance of acne lesions" compared to "over half" in the minocycline 100 mg/50 mg group. Total lesions counts are not a good measure of outcome because inflamed and non-inflamed lesions respond differently to treatments. There was also a significant difference in the investigator and participant global assessments (P &lt; 0.05, Chi² test). The authors concluded that the "microbial response to minocycline 100/50 mg was also superior" as assessed by percentage of live bacteria and percentage of dead bacteria and debris, which were assessed by dual-flow cytometry analysis. The authors did not respond to requests for additional information.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Bossuyt-2003-_x0028_TETRABUK_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Bossuyt 2003 (TETRABUK)</LINK> was sponsored and organised by Galderma, who manufacture lymecycline. The study compared extended-release minocycline 100 mg with 300 mg lymecycline daily for 12 weeks in 68 and 66 participants, respectively. At the end of 12 weeks, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the lesion count data (IL, NIL, TLC). There were similarly no difference in global severity grade or participant or physician global assessment of improvement. There were some discrepancies in the publication with regard to the numbers of participants included in the per-protocol analysis, which potentially indicated that approximately one third of participants randomised to each group did not complete the study. The "economic evaluation" included in the paper was a cost-minimisation analysis that compared the most expensive minocycline preparation (extended-release) with lymecycline. The prices of both minocycline and tetracycline have changed since 2003.</P>

Therefore, not surprisingly, because of inadequate statistical power, they did not detect any overall difference between the drugs. Four were 12 weeks, with <LINK REF="STD-Lorette-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lorette 1994</LINK> being 17 weeks.

<P>Roxithromycin is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic derived from erythromycin and with a similar mode of action. Roxithromycin is licensed for acne in Japan, but it is not licensed in the United States or the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>A Japanese RCT compared 4-week treatment with 100 mg daily minocycline (given as single dose once a day or 50 mg twice a day) with 150 mg roxithromycin daily (<LINK REF="STD-Hayashi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hayashi 2011</LINK>) in 49 and 50 participants with moderate acne. A third trial group of 51 participants received faropenem 200 mg three times a day. A second four-week follow-up period occurred in which no treatment was given. The only acne-treatment-related exclusion was if participants had received oral antibiotics within the past month. Concomitant use of acne treatments was prohibited in the treatment period, but permitted during the observational follow-up period. Unsurprisingly, given the small numbers of participants treated and the short (four-week) treatment duration, the authors reported no significant differences between the reductions in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts from baseline, or quality of life. A significant reduction in all groups was seen for all outcomes from baseline at all time points. Data were reported in graphical format only.

The first group received 500 mg josamycin or 100 mg minocycline once daily for 8 weeks. The second received 1000 mg josamycin and 200 mg minocycline. Some participants also received topical 5% benzoyl peroxide. It is unclear how the groups were allocated. The authors reported a statistically significant reduction in the number of papulopustules, comedones, and nodulo-cysts, and the intensity of seborrhoea and erythema. They reported that josamycin was more effective than minocycline (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.5</LINK>). The standard of the publication was however very poor, and the results cannot therefore be substantiated given the potential biases introduced by the likelihood of the trial being open, the dosing schedule, and use of benzoyl peroxide. One participant receiving josamycin had mild gastric discomfort, one minocycline-treated participant had a rash, and a third had to discontinue minocycline due to severe gastric intolerance.</P>

The authors found no overall difference between the treatments after 24 weeks, but as the trial only included 98 participants, it was likely to be inadequately statistically powered to conclude that the treatments are equivalent. 17% (6 out of 36 participants) of the Diane&#8482;-treated group and 20% (7 out of 35 participants) of the minocycline group thought their acne had completely cleared (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.22) (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>).

<P>It is unusual for companies and journals to publish trials with negative findings as in the case of an experimental drug code-named Compound A, which was compared to minocycline. Compound A inhibits the enzyme (called 5-alpha reductase type 1) in the hair follicles that converts testosterone into the active hormone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This is one of the chemicals that causes sebum to be produced by the hair follicles. The experimental drug reduces the amount of DHT in the blood and sebum, but was shown to be ineffective in treating acne; therefore, the authors concluded that more research is required into sebaceous gland control at the cellular level (<LINK REF="STD-Leyden-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leyden 2004</LINK>). The trial was intended to last six months, but only three-month data were reported. It is probable that the trial was stopped early due to lack of efficacy in the group receiving compound A.</P>
<P>After 3 months, the 34 men treated with 100 mg minocycline twice a day were reported to have a 49.2% reduction in inflamed lesion counts compared to 25.7% in the 37 men treated with 25 mg of compound A daily (MD 23.50, 95% CI 3.8 to 43.2) (<LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>). Two other arms in the study included a total 74 participants who received a combination of Compound A and minocycline, and they achieved similar results to those treated with minocycline alone. No usable data on overall adverse effects were reported, but one man receiving minocycline was reported as having a transient elevation in liver enzymes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Minocycline versus zinc gluconate</HEADING>
<P>Oral zinc salts (sulphate, citrate, and gluconate) have been used to treat acne since 1970. Their mechanism of action is poorly understood.</P>
<P>The 2012 update identified 1 double-blind 'equivalence' RCT that compared 100 mg minocycline a day with 30 mg of zinc gluconate in 332 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Dreno-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 2001</LINK>). The sponsoring company (Labcatal Pharmaceuticals) also kindly supplied additional information. Minocycline produced a greater reduction in both inflamed and non-inflamed lesion counts, at all time points, and was evaluated as more effective by both clinicians and participants. Interestingly, for both treatment groups, significantly more women were reported as responding. After 90 days of treatment, the mean difference between the percentage change in inflamed lesions from baseline was as follows: MD -16.42, 95% CI -25.10 to -7.74 (<LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>). The clinician assessed 102/161 minocycline-treated participants as having a successful treatment (defined as a two thirds reduction in IL) compared to 49/157 of those treated with zinc (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.63) (<LINK REF="CMP-011.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.2</LINK>). The results for the doctor and participant overall assessment of effectiveness were similar (<LINK REF="CMP-011.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two minocycline-treated participants had to withdraw for GI disturbances compared to 4 zinc-treated participants (RR 0.04, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.09). 36/169 participants treated with minocycline experienced an adverse effect compared to 55/163 treated with zinc (RR -0.12, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.03). These led to the withdrawal of 4 participants in the minocycline group and 5 in the zinc group (RR -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.03).</P>

<P>Three trials compared minocycline 50 mg twice-daily with 1% clindamycin applied topically twice-daily (<LINK REF="STD-Drake-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Drake 1990;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Peacock-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peacock 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sheehan_x002d_Dare-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sheehan-Dare 1989</LINK>). The trials were of similar design and duration, and all included lesion counts. However, data could not be pooled as the results were presented graphically, and no further information could be obtained from the authors or sponsors.</P>
<P>In all three trials, there was a statistically significant decrease in lesion counts in all groups. Although there was conflicting data in the two Sheehan reports with one saying there was no statistically significant reduction in non-inflamed lesions, there was a definite trend in <LINK REF="STD-Sheehan_x002d_Dare-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sheehan-Dare 1989</LINK> for superiority of topical clindamycin. However, this did not reach statistical significance, probably due to the large range of lesion counts included, and the small number of participants (66). The other two trials obtained virtually identical results for both minocycline and clindamycin. This is to be expected given both trials were very small (52 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Drake-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Drake 1990</LINK> and 80 in the <LINK REF="STD-Peacock-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peacock 1990</LINK> trial completed the trial). <LINK REF="STD-Peacock-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peacock 1990</LINK> also reported on aspects of quality of life obtained via participant questionnaires, with no significant difference between the groups (<LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both treatments were reported as well-tolerated.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">b. Fusidic acid</HEADING>
<P>Fusidic acid is an antibiotic that is especially useful in the treatment of staphylococcal infections. Fusidic acid is widely-available internationally, but not in the United States. Topical use for a chronic condition like acne is contra-indicated because fusidic acid promotes resistance when used alone. Awareness of this issue was low when the trial was conducted.</P>
<P>Twice-daily 2% fusidic acid (<LINK REF="STD-Darrah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darrah 1996</LINK>) was compared with 50 mg oral minocycline twice a day in participants with mild to moderate facial acne in UK general practice. Although spots were always counted on the right side of the face, participants were instructed to apply the topical medication to the affected area only. This trial included both a power calculation and declared the primary end point in advance. However, the end point defined was rather loose, namely a 40% reduction in either total lesion count or total non-inflamed lesion count or total inflamed lesion count by the end of the treatment period. Using this criterion, no significant difference was found between the treatments; 188 participants were included in the non-inferiority design (<LINK REF="CMP-013.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.1</LINK>). At the end of treatment, the overall reduction in the inflamed lesion count due to minocycline was significantly superior (P = 0.04, Chi² test with Yate's continuity correction) than that due to fusidic acid (MD 3.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 5.94) (<LINK REF="CMP-013.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.2</LINK>). The authors' concluded this was unlikely to be of clinical significance. There was a trend for fusidic acid to be superior against non-inflamed lesions. The fusidic acid-treated participants may have done better by applying treatment to the whole face to prevent new lesions forming. As to be expected, topical fusidic acid was associated with more skin adverse effects: 13/90 compared to 3/84. Minocycline was associated with more gastro-intestinal disturbances: 4/84 compared to 1/90.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stainforth-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Stainforth 1993</LINK> evaluated a twice-daily topical application of 4% erythromycin and 1.2% zinc acetate against minocycline 50 mg twice a day in 109 participants. There was a significant reduction in lesion counts in both groups at 12 weeks compared to baseline, with good results seen after 2 weeks. The combination topical was significantly better than minocycline against both inflamed and non-inflamed lesions at the end of the 12-week treatment period (<LINK REF="CMP-014.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-014.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-014.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.2</LINK>). However, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of acne grade at any time point nor in the participants' self-assessment using a visual analogue scale (<LINK REF="CMP-014.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.4</LINK>). The minocycline-treated participants recorded the lowest percentage reductions in inflamed and non-inflamed lesions of all the trials that presented data in this form. After 12 weeks, there was only a 23% reduction in non-inflamed lesions and 36% reduction in inflamed lesions. It is possible that the results may be biased as the authors admit that, in at least seven cases, therapy became known to the assessor during the trial. The topical treatment was associated with dryness and irritation in five participants. Four participants receiving minocycline reported transient headache, with one having symptoms suggestive of benign intracranial hypertension.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">d. Benzoyl peroxide or benzoyl peroxide/erythromycin</HEADING>
<P>Extended-release minocycline was compared to 5% benzoyl peroxide and 2 different combination regimens of benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin in a large, 18-week, community-based, independently-funded study in the UK (see the oxytetracycline comparison for more details). The combination treatments were (a) separate formulations of 2% erythromycin in the morning, 5% benzoyl peroxide at night; and (b) a single formulation containing 3% erythromycin and 5% benzoyl peroxide to be applied morning and night. The participants had mild to moderate acne (<LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>). The outcomes were change in inflammatory lesion count from baseline and the number of participants assessed by participants having at least 'moderate improvement' as determined by investigators and the participants themselves.</P>
<P>Minocycline and 5% benzoyl peroxide produced similar results, with an average of 22.3 less inflamed lesions (<LINK REF="CMP-015.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.3</LINK>) and similar improvements (<LINK REF="CMP-015.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-015.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.2</LINK>). The results for the two different combination regimens were similar: a trend towards the combination treatments being more effective, which was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-016.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 16.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-016.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 16.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-016.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 16.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-017.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 17.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-017.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 17.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-017.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 17.3</LINK>). The numbers of adverse effects at each time point were reported. As to be expected, there were more systemic adverse effects in the minocycline group and more local irritation in the topical groups. The two erythromycin-containing regimens produced the largest reductions in the frequency and population density of viable organisms. The three topical regimens significantly lowered the frequency and population density of erythromycin-resistant propionibacteria.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1988</LINK> compared 50 mg minocycline twice-daily versus 50 mg doxycycline once-daily in a group of 43 participants with acne of unspecified severity, who also received separate formulations of 4% chlorhexidine and 5% benzoyl peroxide. After 12 weeks, only 34 participants remained. Unsurprisingly, because of the very small number of participants enrolled and the additional active treatments used in both groups, no significant differences were detected in any of the reductions in lesion counts: A 59% reduction in total lesion counts was seen for each group, with a 67% to 84% decrease in the number of papules and pustules (<LINK REF="CMP-018.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 18.1</LINK>). There was some apparent discrepancy between the adverse effect data, with tolerance being reported as less than good or excellent in 7% of participants receiving doxycycline and 21% receiving minocycline. The study authors reported that four participants in the doxycycline group and three in the minocycline group experienced side-effects, but it was unclear what they were as only those designated as treatment-related were reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Revuz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Revuz 1985</LINK> compared minocycline against placebo over 60 days in 90 participants who were also applying topical erythromycin/tretinoin gel (of unknown strength). Reductions in the number of lesions in both groups were reported, with minocycline reported as having a statistically significant greater effect against the total number of 'retentional' lesions (thought to be cysts, plus inflamed lesions), but not non-inflamed lesions. Significant reductions in the number of papules and pustules were noted with no significant differences between the two groups. 69% of participants reported good or very good response in the minocycline group compared to 57% in the placebo group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.72) (<LINK REF="CMP-019.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 19.1</LINK>). The data for the physician-reported good/very good response was 77% versus 54% (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.01) (<LINK REF="CMP-019.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 19.1</LINK>). The latter was reported as statistically significant. Unsurprisingly, the rate of skin adverse effects was similar, although more burning was reported in the placebo group (26/34 compared to 21/39).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Smit-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Smit 1978</LINK> randomised 18 participants with severe acne to either 100 mg minocycline or 100 mg doxycycline. Both groups received a topical 5% salicylic acid and 5% resorcinol preparation to be applied twice daily for the 12-week duration of the RCT. The trial did not find any difference between the two groups in the change in overall score from baseline. However, too few participants were included to infer anything about the relative effectiveness.</P>
<P>The 2012 update identified the abstract of a 24-week investigator-blinded RCT that compared 100 mg minocycline daily to 300 mg lymecycline for 2 weeks, followed by 150 mg for another 8 weeks in 152 participants who were also being treated with 0.1% adapalene gel once daily (<LINK REF="STD-Campo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Campo 2003</LINK>). Most, but not all, of the RCTs included in this review found a minimal effect of minocycline (and other antibiotics) on non-inflamed lesions; however, this study used adapalene in both groups, which is active, against non-inflamed lesions. Lymecycline was reported as having a statistically significant greater reduction than minocycline in total lesion counts (67% and 77%, respectively) and non-inflamed lesions (64% versus 77%), but there was no difference in inflamed lesions or global assessments. There were however some contradictions in the abstract, so clarification is required. Data appeared to only be reported from the 122/152 evaluable participants; therefore, the study was likely not to have included sufficient numbers of participants to be able to conclude there was no difference between the groups. Further information was requested from the company, but no response was received. The treatments were reported as 'well tolerated'.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">8. Minocycline versus oral isotretinoin in nodular acne</HEADING>
<P>Isotretinoin is the only treatment that often cures acne after a single course. It works primarily by stopping the production of sebum. However, it is associated with severe side-effects; therefore, it is reserved for severe or refractory acne. It can also harm the foetus, so it is not used in women of childbearing age without adequate contraception.</P>
<P>Two open trials compared oral isotretinoin with minocycline in nodular acne; participants and investigators will always be able to tell who receives isotretinoin due to its distinctive side-effect profile.</P>
<P>In one study, the minocycline-treated group of 50 men also received topical azelaic acid (<LINK REF="STD-Gollnick-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gollnick 1997</LINK>); the second group of 35 men were treated with isotretinoin dosed according to their weight. The authors stated that the study was randomised, but there were unequal numbers of participants in each group. Furthermore, whilst at the start of the trial the two groups were demographically comparable for age, there appeared to be other differences. Only the abstract was available for the original review, but the trial had been published in full by the update, and there were some minor differences in the reported results. The study had two phases; an initial six-month study phase followed by a second three-month maintenance phase (topical azelaic acid only in the minocycline group). The full publication notes that, "Participants in whom a very good clinical improvement was achieved prematurely, i.e. before completing the 6 months of study phase 1, were transferred early to study phase 2". This makes the findings difficult to interpret.</P>
<P>Very high percentage reductions in all types of lesion count were reported for both isotretinoin and the minocycline/azelaic acid combination. The authors reported a statistically significant difference in favour of oral isotretinoin against non-inflamed lesions (66% reduction from baseline vs 80%) (<LINK REF="CMP-020.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 20.2</LINK>) and papules and pustules (88% vs 97%) after 24 weeks of treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-020.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 20.3</LINK>). The clinical significance of these differences is unclear. Changes in the nodule count were 100% in both groups. The investigator reported that 100% of participants in both groups improved. The speed of onset of improvement in this study with the minocycline/azelaic acid combination was rapid and equivalent to oral isotretinoin after just one month of treatment. The adverse effect rates reflected the better tolerance of minocycline/azelaic acid, which is to be expected. In the maintenance phase, 37% of participants who continued on azelaic acid (AA) but had their minocycline stopped showed marked deterioration compared to 4% in the isotretinoin group who stopped treatment. These findings warrant further investigation and a robust trial being undertaken. Because of the side-effects associated with isotretinoin, the combination would be a good option particularly in female participants with nodular acne.</P>
<P>The second study focused on the biochemical impact of isotretinoin, included only 24 men (<LINK REF="STD-Pigatto-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Pigatto 1986</LINK>), and reported few clinical outcomes. The results showed that oral isotretinoin was significantly superior to minocycline with respect to reductions in the number and diameter of nodular lesions. This study is of note because it recorded a total of 16 adverse effects in 7 of 12 minocycline-treated participants, which is a much higher rate than in any other trial. Laboratory testing was undertaken as part of the study-examined changes in the metabolism of lipids: Three participants treated with minocycline had slight but persistent abnormal elevations of alkaline phosphatase during therapy, and five had initial transient minor abnormal elevations of the liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">9. Minocycline as a maintenance therapy</HEADING>
<P>The 2012 update found 1 randomised double-blind 12-week trial that evaluated minocycline as a maintenance therapy after participants with moderately-severe acne had shown 75% or greater global improvement after 12 weeks of treatment with 0.1% tazarotene gel each evening, plus 100 mg minocycline twice daily (<LINK REF="STD-Leyden-2006-_x0028_Part-2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Leyden 2006 (Part 2)</LINK>). Tazarotene gel is not available in the UK. The three regimens that were compared (minocycline 100 mg twice daily, 0.1% tazarotene each evening, or a combination of the 2 regimens) were all effective at maintaining improvement over a 12-week period, and there were no statistically significant differences between the groups for the following outcomes: severity score, maintenance of a 50% or greater global improvement, maintenance of a 75% or greater global improvement, mean percentage change in inflamed lesion count or non-inflamed lesion count, or percentage of participants showing good or excellent maintenance. There was however a gradual increase in the number of inflamed lesions whilst the non-inflamed lesions continued to reduce in number. However, the trial was not powered to detect differences, and no power calculation was reported. The data suggest that the minocycline-containing regimens may be more effective at maintaining a reduction in inflamed lesions compared to tazarotene alone, and that tazarotene-containing regimens had more impact on non-inflamed lesions. Both findings are consistent with their mechanisms of action. However, further evaluation is required in a larger sample of participants before any conclusions can be drawn. All regimens were reported as being well-tolerated (<LINK REF="CMP-021.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-021.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-021.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-021.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-021.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-021.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.6</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Results from the included RCTs</HEADING>
<P>There were numerous differences between the RCTs in the way adverse effect data were collected, interpreted, reported, and analysed, which means that pooled estimates must be interpreted with caution. Accurate denominators could not be ascertained for many of the studies. Most trials only reported the most significant adverse effects; others did not report numbers or percentages of adverse effects. Furthermore, many trials were conducted under 'open' conditions.</P>
<P>Twenty-nine of the RCTs reported adverse events that they attributed to minocycline therapy; of the 1906 participants treated, 332 (17.4%) experienced 1 or more events.</P>
<P>Thirty-four RCTs reported the number of participants who withdrew due to adverse events; this was, in total, 79 (3.6%) out of 2143 treated.</P>
<P>There was a trend for minocycline to be associated with more adverse effects than placebo (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.65, I² statistic = 24%) (Analysis 22.1.1) and higher-dose minocycline more than lower-dose (<LINK REF="CMP-022.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.1</LINK>). Meta-analysis indicated that the rates of adverse effects in minocycline-treated participants were less than in those who were treated with (oxy)tetracycline (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01, I² statistic = 28%) (Analysis 22.1.5). However, a sensitivity analysis that removed the 4 'open'-label studies (in which the reporting could have been influenced by the participants' and investigators' knowledge of treatment assignment) removed this difference (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.95, I² statistic = 34%) (Analysis 22.1.6). The largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>) did not report data on overall adverse effects in a comparable format. The only other statistically significant differences identified were that minocycline-treated participants experienced fewer adverse effects than those receiving zinc, as shown in <LINK REF="STD-Dreno-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 2001</LINK> (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91) (Analysis 22.1.15). Minocycline alone or in combination with azelaic acid also produced fewer side-effects than isotretinoin, as shown in <LINK REF="STD-Pigatto-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Pigatto 1986</LINK> (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.97) (Analysis 22.1.21) and <LINK REF="STD-Gollnick-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gollnick 1997</LINK> (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.85) (Analysis 22.1.20). The results for those adverse effects necessitating treatment withdrawal when being treated with minocycline were similar to those for all adverse effects. Minocycline was associated with more withdrawals, due to adverse effects, than placebo (risk difference (RD) 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.13, I² statistic = 0%) (Analysis 22.2.1) and less than (oxy)tetracycline (RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.00, I² statistic = 44% ) (Analysis 22.2.8). There were no other notable differences (<LINK REF="CMP-022.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The focus of the 233-participant phase 2 study, <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2006-_x0028_MP010401_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2006 (MP010401)</LINK>, was on acute vestibular adverse effects, which are hypothesised as being dose-related. The researchers defined vestibular events as one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, vertigo, and ringing in the ears; the symptoms being attributed to the rapid rise in serum minocycline levels with standard minocycline. The authors reported that the results of the trial indicated this was dose-dependent (10%, 24%, and 28% in the 1, 2, and 3 mg/kg minocycline groups, respectively, compared to 16% in the placebo group). These differences were non-significant statistically, although the study may not have been powered adequately. However, it is not clear whether the symptoms included in the composite measure were actually due to vestibular effects; nausea and vomiting were common symptoms. These adverse effects were more common in the first five days of treatment and in the heaviest participants. In summary, the data reported do not support the study authors conclusions that "the key benefit of this new minocycline preparation is safety", because no standard-release formulation was included as a comparison.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Results from other studies of adverse events</HEADING>
<P>It is recognised that rare adverse effects are unlikely to occur in clinical trials involving relatively small numbers of participants with short follow-up periods. Estimates of the frequency of such events cannot be obtained by pooling data from several small trials. In addition, spontaneous report systems and case reports are not reliable sources; the number of adverse effects is uncertain because of selective reporting, and the number of participants who received the therapy overall is not known. Therefore, information on the incidence of the less common and more severe adverse effects associated with minocycline in any condition was sought from controlled studies that provided a clear indication on the numerator (i.e. the number of adverse effects) and the denominator (the number of participants treated). These studies are subject to different biases than RCTs.</P>
<P>The results of the 16 studies that met the inclusion criteria for the review of adverse effects are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>The notable findings of the studies were as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>FDA data on prescription rates and spontaneous reports of adverse effects estimated that rates of any adverse effect is 13 per million with doxycycline and 72 per million with minocycline. Gastro-intestinal reactions were the most common with doxycycline, whereas changes affecting the central nervous system and gastro-intestinal disturbances were more common with minocycline (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2005</LINK>).</LI>

<LI>There were two different types of liver damage associated with minocycline: hypersensitivity with rapid onset (usually within one month) and autoimmune hepatitis generally after a year or more of therapy (more common in women). The authors noted that they could not make any recommendations about whether or not participants should have routine liver function monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrenson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrenson 2000</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>There were 51 cases of lupus (0.05% of acne cohort of 97,694 participants); of these, 24 had been exposed to minocycline (<LINK REF="REF-Margolis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 2007</LINK>). The hazard ratio (HR) for association of minocycline and lupus erythematosus (LE) was 2.64 (95% CI 1.51 to 4.66) and when adjusted for age and gender, the hazard ratio was 3.11 (95% CI 1.77 to 5.48). A strong relationship between the duration of exposure and LE was noted, but cases have still occurred with exposures of less than six months. The frequency of LE in people treated with minocycline was estimated at 8.8 cases per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Margolis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 2007</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Antineutrophil antibody (ANA) positivity was seen in participants with acne, irrespective of exposure to minocycline. However, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positivity appeared to be a serological marker for developing autoimmune disease in participants receiving minocycline (<LINK REF="REF-Marzo_x002d_Ortega-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marzo-Ortega 2007</LINK>).</LI>

<LI>There was an 8.5 fold greater risk of lupus-like syndrome in young women currently using minocycline for acne compared with non-users or past users, and this effect is strongest for longer-term use. The absolute risk of lupus-like syndrome is 52.8 cases per 100,000 prescriptions, and minocycline increases the risk 8.5 times (95% CI 2.1 to 35) compared to other tetracyclines, which carry a risk of 1.7 (95% CI 0.4 to 8.1) (<LINK REF="REF-Sturkenboom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturkenboom 1999</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The adjusted odds ratio of liver dysfunction associated with exposure to minocycline compared with non-use was 2.10 (95% CI 1.30 to 3.40), and for oxytetracycline/tetracycline it was 1.46 (95% CI 0.81 to 2.64). Overall, the incidence of liver dysfunction was rare: 1.04 cases/10,000 exposed person months (EPM) for minocycline and 0.69 cases/10,000 EPM in those exposed to oxytetracycline/tetracycline (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.65) (<LINK REF="REF-Seaman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seaman 2001</LINK>).</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical efficacy</HEADING>
<P>The 39 RCTs that were included in this updated systematic review demonstrated that minocycline is active against both inflamed and non-inflamed lesions, although there were large variations between trials in both the absolute and percentage decreases attained. Per cent reductions in lesion counts were the most frequently-used outcome measure.</P>
<P>The most robust data from the 6 placebo-controlled trials indicated that minocycline is more active than placebo against inflamed lesions, producing a 45.5% reduction compared to 32% after 12 weeks but with large in-group variations in response (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). There is no evidence to suggest this is a clinically meaningful difference or whether participants were more satisfied with their treatment. The effect against non-inflamed lesions was smaller (14.9% versus 6.3%; no standard deviations were reported). There was no difference in the number of participants ascertained to be 'clear' or 'almost clear' at the end of 12 weeks of treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no robust evidence to indicate whether or not the effects of minocycline are dose-dependent; it is likely that all three of the RCTs that looked at this issue contained insufficient numbers of participants. However, one indicated that after 8 weeks of therapy, there was no difference between a 100 mg a day dose compared to 100 mg a day for 2 weeks, followed by 50 mg a day.</P>
<P>The most robust data from an independently-funded RCT in UK general practice (<LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>) suggested that, when used to treat facial acne, minocycline produces similar results to oxytetracycline, benzoyl peroxide, and combination treatment with erythromycin/benzoyl peroxide. Out of the nine RCTs that compared minocycline to a first-generation tetracycline, five did not find any difference in efficacy, but did not contain sufficient numbers of participants to conclude that there is no difference. The most robust study (<LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>) found minocycline had a greater effect than oxytetracycline against inflamed lesions at 12 weeks, but not 18 weeks (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>). Three other studies found minocycline to be superior, but all had serious flaws (<LINK REF="STD-Blecschmidt-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Blecschmidt 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cabezas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cabezas 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruping-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ruping 1985</LINK>). Seven of the nine RCTs that compared minocycline to other second-generation tetracyclines had serious methodological flaws. None of these trials found any difference between the treatments, but all but two (<LINK REF="STD-Bossuyt-2003-_x0028_TETRABUK_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Bossuyt 2003 (TETRABUK)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunliffe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunliffe 1998</LINK>) were unlikely to contain sufficient numbers of participants. The former was a non-inferiority design. Minocycline was compared to three other non-tetracycline antibiotics (roxithromycin, faropenem, and josamycin) that are not licensed in the UK or U.S. As with the tetracycline RCTS, all had methodological flaws. There is some evidence to suggest that minocycline may have a more rapid onset of action than low-dose (500 mg/day) tetracycline; further evaluation is required, including the clinical significance of this.</P>
<P>Only three other studies were able to detect any difference between treatments; minocycline was found to have greater activity against inflammatory lesions than 2% topical fusidic acid (<LINK REF="STD-Darrah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darrah 1996</LINK>) and oral zinc gluconate (<LINK REF="STD-Dreno-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 2001</LINK>). It was also superior to zinc against non-inflamed lesions (<LINK REF="STD-Dreno-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 2001</LINK>). Minocycline was found to be inferior to a topically applied combination of 4% erythromycin and 1.2% zinc against both inflamed and non-inflamed lesions (<LINK REF="STD-Stainforth-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Stainforth 1993</LINK>), although the mean lesion counts did not change in the minocycline group after the second week. Another finding of note that warrants further evaluation is that a minocycline/azelaic acid combination may produce good results in nodular acne.</P>
<P>It is now widely-accepted that tetracycline and erythromycin should be given for acne in full therapeutic doses, and yet minocycline and doxycycline are still given at lower doses (usually one half the full therapeutic dose). It is surprising that no adequate dose-response study has been done to confirm that doses of 200 mg and 100 mg are equivalent in terms of clinical efficacy. Therefore, no recommendations can be made concerning the appropriate dose of minocycline that should be used.</P>
<P>The efficacy of minocycline in tetracycline-recalcitrant acne cannot be confirmed or refuted as no RCT was located, and similarly, no evaluation of the rate of relapse of participants treated with minocycline was retrieved. Only three studies attempted any measure of the impact of treatment of participant quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Dreno-1998-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 1998 [pers comm]</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peacock-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peacock 1990</LINK>). There was no indication from the trials as to whether minocycline was more acceptable to participants than other forms of acne therapy, and the five trials that monitored compliance did not report the results. It is important that some measure of compliance is included in clinical trials as differences between treatment and control groups can seriously distort the outcome, and where compliance is poor, the sample size will have to be increased to detect the true treatment effect. In the case of acne therapy, compliance and acceptability are important issues and will impact on the clinical results seen.</P>
<P>There is one very important issue that this review has not addressed and that is the emerging problem of antibiotic resistance in<I> P. acnes</I>. Available data suggests that up to one in four antibiotic-treated acne participants are colonised by tetracycline-resistant strains of propionibacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Coates-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coates 1999</LINK>). The resistant strains may or may not show decreased sensitivity to minocycline (<LINK REF="STD-Eady-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Eady 1993</LINK>). However, the minimum inhibitory concentration of minocycline for all of them is within the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines for sensitive strains (less than or equal to 4 mg/ml), and all could potentially be inhibited by serum levels of the drug achieved on a higher dose of 200 mg. The question therefore arises as to whether minocycline is the drug of choice when tetracycline-resistant strains are present on the skin.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Prescribers should inform people that there are extremely rare cases of hypersensitivity to minocycline and tell them what signs and symptoms to look out for. If hypersensitivity occurs, it may be fatal, so medical help should be obtained immediately.</P>
<P>Despite the large volume of data collected, it is still not possible to produce a reliable estimate of the likelihood of experiencing an adverse effect during a course of minocycline for acne. Moreover, it is not possible to predict who might be at increased risk of a serious adverse event on the basis of age, gender, pre-existing health conditions, or dose or duration of minocycline therapy (except in the case of lupus and skin pigmentation - see below).</P>
<P>The most robust study that used spontaneous adverse effect reports coupled with sales data suggested that the overall rate of adverse effects is extremely low at 72 per million people treated with minocycline (0.0072%), but is higher than for doxycycline (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2005</LINK>). This is likely to be a gross underestimate as there is no mandate for clinicians, pharmacists, or people to report adverse effects when receiving therapy; reporting is done on a voluntary basis. The inadequacy of this system is highlighted by the fact that 332 of the 1906 (17.4%) participants receiving minocycline in the 39 included RCTs reported an adverse effect, a rate that is over 2400 times higher.</P>
<P>The studies do support a conclusion of an increased risk of lupus associated with minocycline that is not seen with other tetracyclines, and which increases with duration of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Margolis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marzo_x002d_Ortega-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marzo-Ortega 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schoonen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoonen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sturkenboom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturkenboom 1999</LINK>). It should however be noted that the absolute risk is small: One study estimated it to be 52.8 cases per 100,000 prescriptions (<LINK REF="REF-Sturkenboom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturkenboom 1999</LINK>). Similarly, there is an increase in the risk of liver dysfunction associated with minocycline use, but the incidence is rare: 1.04 cases/10,000 exposed person months (<LINK REF="REF-Seaman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seaman 2001</LINK>). This would support monitoring and periodic liver function tests and ANA tests in those receiving long-term treatment.</P>
<P>Relating to the extended-release version of minocycline, the RCT data reported do not support the conclusions that "the key benefit of this new minocycline preparation is safety", because no standard-release formulation was included as a comparison, and the placebo-controlled trial was likely to be underpowered (<LINK REF="STD-Fleisch-2006a-_x0028_MP010404_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Fleisch 2006a (MP010404)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleisch-2006b-_x0028_MP010405_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Fleisch 2006b (MP010405)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-2006-_x0028_MP010401_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 2006 (MP010401)</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-07-06 12:14:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Systematic reviewing is a retrospective study, and the conclusions are therefore dependent on the primary studies that have actually been conducted, are successfully identified, and then included. In order to prevent any bias arising from the inherent observational nature of the review, a strict systematic review protocol was developed prior to the onset of the review. This was not published as a Cochrane Protocol as this was not a requirement when the review was initially undertaken.</P>
<P>Two authors independently assessed each study. An exhaustive search was conducted and successfully located three unpublished RCTs, <LINK REF="STD-Cunliffe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunliffe 1998 </LINK> (which has since been published) and <LINK REF="STD-Drake-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Drake 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dreno-1998-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 1998 [pers comm]</LINK>, all of which met the inclusion criteria for the review. It is unlikely that any publication bias existed, as the majority of the studies failed to find any differences between the comparators. And any positive study, in either direction, would probably have been widely-publicised and cited in the retrieved studies. Language bias was avoided by inclusion of any RCT regardless of language of publication.</P>
<P>In many cases, the individual study results were not analysed by intention-to-treat, and therefore sensitivity analysis was used to compare the results obtained from efficacy analysis, intention-to-treat, or when dropouts were treated as non-responders. In some cases where categorical outcomes were used, the results had to be dichotomised; therefore, sensitivity analyses were used to validate these assumptions by examining the effect that different cut-off points had on the overall results. In no case were these different analyses found to affect the outcome of any study. Similarly, no study that used both intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol/efficacy analysis found any difference in outcome.</P>

<P>Please see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of minocycline in acne vulgaris by systematically reviewing the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The intention was to pool the results of individual trials to produce overall summary measures of effect. In practice, this was hard to do because the internal validity of most of the studies was severely compromised on account of inadequate design. As well as the use of many disparate outcome measures, there were numerous methodological differences between the retrieved studies that could not be reconciled. This meant that pooling was not appropriate. In addition, the methodological reporting in many of the trial reports was poor, and as a result, the legitimacy of their conclusions could not be properly evaluated.</P>
<P>Only 1 trial conclusively stated funding sources independent from any sponsor (<LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>): 28 cited industry-sponsorship, and 10 made no declaration.</P>
<P>Most of the trialists made some attempt to show that the different treatment groups were comparable at baseline. However, a variety of criteria were used, and some of them were of questionable validity in this context (e.g. height, age of onset of acne). The following criteria were used by a majority of trialists: age, gender, lesion count, or lesion score. In addition, a minority of trialists used weight, duration of acne, and acne grade/severity.</P>
<P>Most trialists specified how long previous acne treatments or other therapies that might have affected acne severity, should have been stopped prior to entry in the trial. However, there was absolutely no consensus on how long this should be. The specified wash-out period for antibiotics was as short as 48 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Revuz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Revuz 1985</LINK>) and up to 4 months (<LINK REF="STD-Hubbell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hubbell 1982</LINK>). For retinoids and hormonal therapy, wash-out periods varied from 14 days (<LINK REF="STD-Peacock-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peacock 1990</LINK>) to 1 year (<LINK REF="STD-Darrah-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Darrah 1996</LINK>). Some studies used similar wash-out periods for oral and topical acne therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Samuelson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Samuelson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sheehan_x002d_Dare-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Sheehan-Dare 1989</LINK>); others used shorter periods for topical therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Drake-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Drake 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorette-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lorette 1994</LINK>). Approximately a third of reports mentioned that the trial was not conducted during the summer to avoid the beneficial/camouflaging effects of ultraviolet light.</P>
<P>Concomitant therapy that might affect acne severity was specifically mentioned as being disallowed in nine trials; three others mentioned that no prescribed topical therapy was permitted. It was unclear in the majority of cases whether participants taking potentially interfering medications were excluded from the per-protocol analysis or continued to be included in the study. It was not usually possible to tell whether concomitant medications had been recorded. Skin hygiene regimens were standardised, usually by the provision of a simple non-mediated soap, in seven trials. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dreno-1998-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 1998 [pers comm]</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>) additionally provided a moisturiser. Compliance is a significant problem in acne, and only a minority of the authors indicated what instructions were given to participants. Only five trials apparently included some form of compliance monitoring. Of the studies for which details were available, in one instance, medication was taken under supervision (<LINK REF="STD-Samuelson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Samuelson 1985</LINK>); two studies counted unused medication (<LINK REF="STD-Cunliffe-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunliffe 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peacock-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peacock 1990</LINK>); and two studies used a participant-completed diary card (<LINK REF="STD-Ozolins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozolins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stainforth-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Stainforth 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In some cases, minocycline was taken on an empty stomach, in others before, with, or after a meal. Six reports mentioned that antacids were among the non-permitted medications, and only four specified exclusion of participants taking divalent metal ions (three iron and one zinc).</P>

<P>The limitations of this review stemmed from the methodological insufficiencies and the subsequent heterogeneity in the primary studies, and the inadequacies of the reported data. The studies generally included insufficient numbers of participants, and the majority were only of 12 weeks duration, so assumptions could not be made about the impact of longer-term therapy. Although additional data were obtained from several authors, the manufacturers of minocycline, who sponsored many of the studies, failed to provide any of the requested information, despite an initial agreement (<LINK REF="REF-Brock-1998-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brock 1998 [pers comm]</LINK>). Subgroup analysis was also impossible due to the poor characterisation of participant groups and lack of adequate outcome data. It was also not possible to examine the impact of study design on the results, particularly with reference to the degree of blinding, as many studies were inconclusive.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-04 14:37:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-07-04 14:37:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The additional 12 RCTs that were located for the update have not changed the original conclusions about the clinical efficacy of minocycline. The 39 RCTs now included in this review do not provide any evidence to support the first-line use of minocycline in the treatment of acne. Although it has been shown to be an effective treatment for moderate to moderately-severe acne vulgaris at a dose of 100 mg per day, no study has conclusively shown any important clinical difference between minocycline and other commonly-used therapies. Meta-analysis indicated that minocycline may have a more rapid onset of action than tetracycline or oxytetracycline, but overall efficacy in the longer-term is similar. There is no evidence that minocycline is more effective in acne resistant to other therapies, or that it has a more prolonged effect. Insufficient information was found to make any recommendations concerning the appropriate dose that should be used.</P>
<P>The relative safeties of the tetracyclines have still not been adequately determined, and little further information could be derived from the included RCTs because of their inherent inability to detect rare events. Recent reviews of case reports and case series (<LINK REF="REF-Gough-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gough 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1997</LINK>) suggest that minocycline therapy for acne may be associated with a broader spectrum and a higher incidence of severe adverse effects than other tetracyclines. The lack of a denominator in nearly all of the studies means that the risks for minocycline compared to other tetracyclines cannot be compared. Only in the case of lupus-like syndrome has it been conclusively shown that acne participants treated with minocycline are at a significantly greater risk than those given tetracycline or no treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Sturkenboom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturkenboom 1999</LINK>). The risk of developing pigmentation (which can be irreversible) and lupus-like syndrome increases with cumulative dose.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-01 11:06:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The poor methodological quality of the acne trials was highlighted in the original version of this review. This was also the case for many of the trials identified in this update, with a few notable exceptions. In order to enable comparison of acne treatment, either directly or indirectly through modelling, an agreed set of core outcome measures should be developed. Until this has been done, trialists are encouraged to include lesion counts and quality of life as outcome measures. </P>
<P>It is surprising that very basic information about acne therapy with the tetracycline group of antibiotics is still unavailable. </P>

<P>This review was first published in 2000 when there was no requirement to publish a Cochrane Protocol. It was however conducted according to a prespecified systematic review protocol according to best methodological practice. There have been no subsequent amendments to this protocol.</P>
<P>For the 2012 update, an additional 12 RCTs were included, and 16 studies were reviewed to evaluate adverse effects. Changes were made to most sections of the review to reflect the impact of the included studies. Two additional tables were added: <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> documented the relative costs of oral antibiotics for acne (BNF April 2012), and <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> summarised the included adverse effect studies.</P>

<LI>This was a double-blind RCT in a multicentre (56 centres: 43 private dermatologists, 3 care units, and 10 hospital dermatologists) setting.</LI>
<LI>The duration of the trial was 12 weeks.</LI>
<LI>The method of randomisation was not stated.</LI>
<LI>Industrial support came from Labcatal Pharmaceuticals (manufacturers of zinc gluconate).</LI>
<LI>UV control was undertaken in the autumn and winter months; participants were asked to avoid exposure to sunlight/UV during this time.</LI>
<LI>For details on the time frame for when oral and topical acne treatments were stopped prior to the start of the trial, see the section on exclusion criteria.</LI>
<LI>Evaluation was at days 30, 60, and 90.</LI>
<LI>The area evaluated was the entire face.</LI>
<LI>The assessor was trained in the ECLA, but there were no details of standardisation.</LI>
<LI>The following statistical analyses were undertaken: Logistic regression analysis was used to identify clinical response criteria in terms of successes/failures within each group. Criteria were age, gender, age at onset of acne, history of acne, existence of an adverse event during the first 30 days, baseline papule/pustule, and comedone counts. An intention-to-treat analysis was used.</LI>
<LI>To calculate the number of participants that had to be included in the study to ensure that any findings had not occurred by chance, it was assumed that (1) the clinical success rate in the reference group would be 60%; the method of statistical analysis would be 15% equivalence hypothesis with 1-tailed testing. It was assumed that the chance of a type I error was 5% and a type II error was 20%. This led to a total of 264 and therefore 150 per group adopted as a precautionary measure.</LI>

<P>Review version: 2002 abstract, 2012 full<BR/>This was open necessarily due to the adverse effect profile of isotretinoin.<BR/>In the initial version of this review, the only information that could be obtained was a brief summary of the study that was published in a review article. The 2006 update included the information included in the full publication published in 2001. Primary outcomes were presented graphically and a median was given.<BR/>"Participants who during study phase 1 had achieved a very good therapeutic improvement were eligible for admission to the second, 3 month study phase (maintenance treatment). Participants in whom a very good clinical improvement was achieved prematurely, i.e. before completing the 6 months of study phase 1, were transferred early to phase 2. The participants of the initial AAMino group admitted to the second study phase used AA cream twice daily as maintenance therapy over a period of 3 months. Participants in the Iso group did not receive any further maintenance therapy."</P>
<P>This trial was a 2-phase trial: 6 months of treatment and then 3 months of maintenance. Participants in whom a very good clinical improvement was achieved prematurely, i.e. before completing the 6 months of study phase 1, were transferred early to study phase 2. The paper stated that all 85 participants were included in the analysis of efficacy. The therapy was regarded as completed before the end of the 6 months in 10% of the participants in the minocycline/azelaic group, while 78% of the participants of this group finished the first study phase as per the schedule after 6 months. The corresponding figures in the isotretinoin group were 14.3% and 77.1%.<BR/>

<LI>This was an observer-blinded RCT of pragmatic design using 97 general practices.</LI>
<LI>The duration of the trial was 18 weeks.</LI>
<LI>Randomisation was generated using a statistical computer program called "SAS PROC PLAN" with block size of 11.</LI>
<LI>In order to conceal which treatments participants had been allocated to, the treatments were supplied by pharmacy in identical opaque cardboard boxes, labelled with participant numbers.</LI>
<LI>The topical vehicle was donated by Stiefel.</LI>
<LI>The use of UV control was unclear.</LI>
<LI>All oral and topical acne treatment was stopped 4 weeks prior to the start of the trial.</LI>
<LI>Evaluation was at 0, 6, 12, and 18 weeks.</LI>
<LI>The area evaluated was the face.</LI>
<LI>The assessor was trained, and each participant was seen by the same assessor throughout. Photographic standards were provided.</LI>
<LI>The method of statistical analysis used was an intention-to-treat analysis in which covariates were investigated. The technique of least squared means was used and logistic regression for the assessor global assessments. The acne grades, severity scores, and quality of life were analysed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) technique.</LI>
<LI>In order to calculate whether sufficient numbers of participants had been included to exclude the possibility that the results had occurred by chance, a "power calculation" was undertaken. This estimated that 132 participants per group would be needed to have an 80% possibility that the results had not occurred by chance. The following assumptions were made in the calculations: There would be a 20% difference in the participant's own assessment of their acne severity between the groups who received the experimental treatment and those receiving 5% benzoyl peroxide; there would be a 75% response rate, alpha = 0.05 (2-sided); and 23% of participants would not finish the trial. The calculation was revised after the number of treatments included in the trial was reduced from 1 to 5.</LI>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>The association of drug-induced lupus and autoimmune hepatitis likely represented only 1 component of a broad clinical spectrum of minocycline-induced autoimmune disorders. The actual incidence of that association was probably underestimated. Baseline and periodic liver function and ANA tests should be preformed on those receiving long-term minocycline therapy</P>

<P>The incidence was found to be greater in women than men (13.5% compared to 7.5%) and in those over the age of 35 (27% compared to 11.8%).

<TD>
<P>Data from 1985 to 2008 identified 2099 events; 1083(51%) with doxycycline and 921 (44%) with minocycline. The proportion of severe events was higher than with minocycline than doxycycline: 268 (29.5%) versus 211 (19.5%) (P &lt; 0.01, Chi² test). Compared to doxycycline, the minocycline group were noted as experiencing 'significantly more frequent', cutaneous reactions including pigmentation, neurological disorders relating intracranial hypertension, respiratory disorders, hypersensitivity reactions; eosinophilia, autoimmune disorders, and DRESS. In the minocycline group, the most common were cutaneous disorders (including pigmentation) (42%), and neurological (12.5%), including intracranial hypertension in one third of cases. There were 41 cases of hypersensitivity DRESS reactions(compared to 5 with doxycycline), and 95% were serious (5% fatal). Other hypersensitivity reactions were also more common in minocycline (4% vs 1.6%), including lupus. Data reported to marketing authorisation holders suggest that serious adverse drug reactions were 4 times more frequent for minocycline than doxycycline (141 vs 33).</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>In practice, minocycline has a less favourable risk-benefit balance than doxycycline, particularly in the treatment of acne</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>These data arise from spontaneous reports to the safety monitoring system in France and to the manufacturers. They are therefore likely to be under-estimates. The increased frequency of minocycline reports may be influenced by the publicity around the risks of minocycline.</P>
<P/>
<P>Sales data used as a proxy denominator indicated that minocycline was used 1.5 times less than doxycycline</P>

<P>Cohort: The incidence of liver dysfunction was rare:1.04 cases/10,000 exposed person months (EPM) for minocycline and 0.69 cases/10,000 EPM in those exposed to oxytetracycline/tetracycline (relative risk 1.51 (CI95: 0.63, 3.65). The risk in both groups was greatest in the first month of use. Case-control: The adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) of liver dysfunction associated with exposure to minocycline compared with non use was 2.10 (CI95: 1.30, 3.40); for oxytetracycline/tetracycline, the ORadj was 1.46 (CI95: 0.81, 2.64); and for exposure to erythromycin, the ORadj was 1.64 (CI95: 0.71, 3.80).</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The authors concluded that individuals with newly prescribed minocycline the incidence of liver dysfunction was rare. The authors thus support a weak association between the use of oral antibiotics and liver dysfunction in patients with acne. The risk associated with exposure to minocycline appears to be very small. The cohort analysis demonstrated that any risk associated with minocycline was not significantly greater than that associated with oxytetracycline/tetracycline exposure.</P>

<P>From matched controls selected from the same cohort it was estimated that the risk of developing SLE-like syndrome following tetracycline exposure is increased 3.5 times (95% CI 1.3 to 7.0).</P>
<P/>
<P>The same study also demonstrated that 85 % of the cases were women and they have a 14 fold relative risk (95% CI: 1.8 to 111) of developing the disorder in comparison to men.</P>
<P/>
<P/>
<P>The absolute risk is 52.8 cases per 100 000 prescriptions and minocycline increases the risk 8.5 times (95% CI: 2.1 to 35) compared to other tetracyclines which carry a risk of 1.7 (95% CI: 0.4 to 8.1)</P>
<P/>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The authors conclude a 8.5 fold greater risk of lupus-like syndrome in young women currently using minocycline for acne compared with non-users or past users and that this effect is strongest for longer-term use.</P>
<P/>
<P>Since lupus-like syndrome is uncommon and reversible after stopping minocycline treatment, the increased risk associated with minocycline use only moderately affects the risk/benefit balance</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P/>
<P/>
<P>There also appears to be a strong effect of cumulative minocycline dose and prolonged (&gt; 100 days) exposure</P>
