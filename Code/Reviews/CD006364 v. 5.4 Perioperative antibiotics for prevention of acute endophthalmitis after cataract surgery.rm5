<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-26 09:06:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
<BR/>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if using antibiotics at the time of cataract surgery can prevent bacterial infection of the eye (endophthalmitis) after cataract surgery. Cochrane researchers collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and found five studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key messages</B>
<BR/>There is a very small chance of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. Antibiotics injected into the eye during surgery lower this small chance of infection (high-certainty evidence). Antibiotic injection and antibiotic eye drops given together probably lower the chance of infection compared with using either injection alone or eye drops alone. Information on adverse effects was not provided in most studies.</P>
<P>
<B>What was studied in this review?</B>
<BR/>Endophthalmitis is a rare, but potentially serious, complication of cataract surgery that may lead to blindness. It is caused by bacteria that enter the eye during surgery or in the first few days after surgery. There are many ways to stop infection during and after surgery, such as using antibiotics at the time of surgery. There are several different types of antibiotic that can be used, and these may be used in different ways (either by injection into the eye, or infusion into the blood, or eye drops) or at different times (before, during, or after surgery).</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review?</B>
<BR/>Cochrane researchers found five relevant studies. Two studies were conducted in Pakistan, one study in several European countries, one study in Brazil, and one study in Turkey. These studies all looked at different treatments: one study compared four different treatments - antibiotic injection combined with antibiotic eye drops versus antibiotic injection alone versus antibiotic eye drops alone versus placebo eye drops; one study compared combined antibiotic injection and antibiotic eye drops versus antibiotic eye drops alone; one study compared combined antibiotics and steroids versus antibiotics and steroid given individually; one study compared two different locations for the antibiotic eye injection; one study compared adding antibiotics to the sterile fluid used during surgery versus not adding antibiotics to this fluid.</P>
<P>The review shows that:</P>
<P>&#8226; Antibiotic injection in the eye (cefuroxime) at the end of surgery lowers the chance of endophthalmitis after surgery (high-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8226; Using antibiotic eye drops (either levofloxacin or chloramphenicol) in addition to antibiotic injection (either cefuroxime or penicillin) probably lowers the chance of endophthalmitis compared with using injections or eye drops alone (moderate certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8226; It is very uncertain whether adding antibiotic to the sterile irrigating fluid used during cataract surgery lowers the chance of endophthalmitis (very low-certainty evidence).<BR/>&#8226; It is very uncertain if using antibiotics and steroids individually or in combination makes a difference to the chance of developing endophthalmitis (very low-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>How up to date is this review?</B>
<BR/>Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to December 2016.</P>

<P>Endophthalmitis is a severe inflammation of the anterior or posterior (or both) chambers of the eye that may be sterile or associated with infection.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-01-19 16:14:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE, Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily (January 1946 to December 2016), Embase (January 1980 to December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to December 2016),the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 6 December 2016. We also searched for additional studies that cited any included trials using the Science Citation Index.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-01-19 16:14:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials that enrolled adults undergoing cataract surgery (any method and incision type) for lens opacities due to any origin. We included trials that evaluated preoperative antibiotics, intraoperative (intracameral, subconjunctival or systemic), or postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis for acute endophthalmitis. We excluded studies that evaluated antiseptic preoperative preparations using agents such as povidone iodine or antibiotics for treating acute endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-01-03 07:21:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Two review authors independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles for eligibility, assessed the risk of bias for each included study, and abstracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-26 09:12:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Five studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, including 101,005 adults and 132 endophthalmitis cases. While the sample size was very large, the heterogeneity of the study designs and modes of antibiotic delivery made it impossible to conduct a formal meta-analysis. Interventions investigated included the utility of adding vancomycin and gentamycin to the irrigating solution compared with standard balanced saline solution irrigation alone, use of intracameral cefuroxime with or without topical levofloxacin perioperatively, periocular penicillin injections and topical chloramphenicol-sulfadimidine drops compared with topical antibiotics alone, and mode of antibiotic delivery (subconjunctival versus retrobulbar injections; fixed versus separate instillation of gatifloxacin and prednisolone). The risk of bias among studies was low to unclear due to information not being reported. We identified one ongoing study.</P>
<P>Two studies compared any antibiotic with no antibiotic. One study, which compared irrigation with antibiotics in balanced salt solution (BSS) versus BSS alone, was not sufficiently powered to detect differences in endophthalmitis between groups (very low-certainty evidence). One study found reduced risk of endophthalmitis when combining intracameral cefuroxime and topical levofloxacin (risk ratio (RR) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.63; 8106 participants; high-certainty evidence) or using intracameral cefuroxime alone (RR 0.21, CI 0.06 to 0.74; 8110 participants; high-certainty evidence) compared with placebo, and an uncertain effect when using topical levofloxacin alone compared with placebo (RR 0.72, CI 0.32 to 1.61; 8103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>Two studies found reduced risk of endophthalmitis when combining antibiotic injections during surgery and topical antibiotics compared with topical antibiotics alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.92 (periocular penicillin and topical chloramphenicol-sulfadimidine; 6618 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.91 (intracameral cefuroxime and topical levofloxacin; 8101 participants; high-certainty evidence)).</P>
<P>One study, which compared fixed versus separate instillation of gatifloxacin and prednisolone, was not sufficiently powered to detect differences in endophthalmitis between groups (very low-certainty evidence). Another study found no evidence of a difference in endophthalmitis when comparing subconjunctival versus retrobulbar antibiotic injections (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.32; 77,015 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>Two studies reported any visual acuity outcome; one study, which compared fixed versus separate instillation of gatifloxacin and prednisolone, reported only that mean visual acuity was the same for both groups at 20 days postoperation. In the other study, the difference in the proportion of eyes with final visual acuity greater than 20/40 following endophthalmitis between groups receiving intracameral cefuroxime with or without topical levofloxacin compared with no intracameral cefuroxime was uncertain (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.11; 29 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>Only one study reported adverse events (1 of 129 eyes had pupillary membrane in front of the intraocular lens and 8 eyes showed posterior capsule opacity). No study reported outcomes related to quality of life or economic outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-26 09:07:02 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Multiple measures for preventing endophthalmitis following cataract surgery have been studied. High-certainty evidence shows that injection with cefuroxime with or without topical levofloxacin lowers the chance of endophthalmitis after surgery, and there is moderate-certainty evidence to suggest that using antibiotic eye drops in addition to antibiotic injection probably lowers the chance of endophthalmitis compared with using injections or eye drops alone. Clinical trials with rare outcomes require very large sample sizes and are quite costly to conduct; thus, it is unlikely that many additional clinical trials will be conducted to evaluate currently available prophylaxis. Practitioners should rely on current evidence to make informed decisions regarding prophylaxis choices.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-26 16:55:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Age-related cataract is a leading cause of reduced vision in both high-income and low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Resnikoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnikoff 2004</LINK>). Surgery for cataract involves removal of the opaque lens and replacement with an intraocular lens (IOL). In the few cases where IOL implantation is not possible, contact lenses and glasses are valid options for the correction of the refractive error that results from being aphakic (without a lens). Endophthalmitis is a potentially vision-threatening complication of cataract surgery. Endophthalmitis is a severe inflammation of the anterior or posterior (or both) chambers of the eye and may be sterile or associated with infection. It most commonly occurs as a complication of cataract surgery, but also may occur following other ocular procedures, trauma to the eye, metastatic systemic infections, and systemic inflammatory disorders.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Reported endophthalmitis rates vary substantially, with some individual centers reporting no endophthalmitis in a several-year period (<LINK REF="REF-Galvis-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galvis 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monica-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monica 2005</LINK>), while others report rates as high as 1 in 200 or 300 surgeries (<LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Arumi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Arumi 2007</LINK>). One systematic review that included studies from high-income and low-income countries indicated a decreasing incidence of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery until the early 1990s, followed by an increase in incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Taban-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taban 2005a</LINK>). The pooled estimate for incidence of endophthalmitis was 1.09 per 1000 surgeries from 1963 to 1999 and 2.65 per 1000 surgeries from 2000 to 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Taban-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taban 2005a</LINK>). In addition, an analysis of US Medicare data reported a 40% increase in the adjusted risk of endophthalmitis comparing data from 1998 to 2001 against 1994 to 1997, with annual rates ranging from 1.79 to 2.47 cases per 1000 surgeries (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>). An analysis of Medicare fee-for-service cataract surgeries reported that rates declined to 1.32 per 1000 surgeries in 2003 and 1.11 per 1000 surgeries in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Keay-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keay 2012</LINK>). Rates appear to have remained relatively consistent, with two more recent Medicare analyses showing rates of 1.2 per 1000 surgeries (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Du-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du 2014</LINK>). Other national-level data have shown a decline, with Sweden's reported rate dropping from 0.48 per 1000 surgeries in 2002 through 2004 to 0.29 per 1000 surgeries for 2005 through 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Friling-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friling 2013</LINK>), and Iran reports an overall rate of 0.02% (<LINK REF="REF-Jabbarvand-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jabbarvand 2016</LINK>). Furthermore, India has recently reported a rate of 0.08% among patients not receiving intracameral antibiotics and 0.02% among those receiving intracameral antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Haripriya-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haripriya 2016</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Endophthalmitis usually presents within a few days following cataract surgery, and 80% of cases present within six weeks. Presenting features include decreased visual acuity (VA), pain, swelling and redness of the eyelids, redness of the conjunctiva, haziness of the cornea due to edema, and increased cellularity of fluid in the anterior chamber of the eye with or without hypopyon (pus). Signs of infection and inflammation of the retina and vitreous usually are observed during exam. Although endophthalmitis is a rare infection, it often results in significant long-term morbidity, even when treated appropriately. Approximately 50% of people do not regain vision of 20/40 or better despite treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Gower-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gower 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lalwani-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lalwani 2008</LINK>), and often nearly one-third have acuity worse than 20/200 following treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Gower-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gower 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheng-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheng 2011</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-19 17:07:23 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several factors are thought to contribute to the incidence of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. One primary factor is the type of incision used for surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Lundstrom-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundstrom 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taban-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taban 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taban-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taban 2005b</LINK>). In addition, many research studies have focused on the role of antibiotics used prophylactically to target ocular surface flora. Examples of prophylactic measures include preoperative lash-trimming and irrigation of the lacrimal drainage system with antibiotics, antiseptic preparation of the operative site using agents such as povidone iodine, and preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative administration of antibiotics. Perioperative antibiotics may be administered through parenteral, topical, or intravitreal routes, using a variety of antibiotics. This review focuses only on perioperative antibiotic use as a prophylactic measure.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-20 12:17:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The vast majority of culture-proven postoperative endophthalmitis cases are caused by gram-positive bacteria, with most cases caused by <I>Staphylococcus epidermidis</I> and other coagulase-negative staphylococci, flora commonly found on the ocular surface (<LINK REF="REF-EVSG-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">EVSG 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mollan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mollan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schimel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimel 2013</LINK>). Other gram-positive organisms and gram-negative agents are less frequently associated with acute endophthalmitis; however, some of the less common gram-negative organisms are associated with the worst visual outcomes. Streptococci are considered the most virulent and have the worst outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Barry-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barry 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gower-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gower 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simunovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simunovic 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soriano-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soriano 2006</LINK>). The conjunctiva and eyelids are the most common sources of infection. The bacteria from these sites are presumably introduced into the anterior chamber through the surgical incision. Endophthalmitis occurs when the intrinsic immune defenses fail to eliminate the virulent bacterial inoculum. To assist the inborn bactericidal processes of the eye, perioperative antibiotics are used to decrease intraocular microbial contamination. Decreasing contamination can be accomplished in several ways, depending on the route of drug administration. Topical antibiotics directly penetrate the ocular surface to enter the aqueous humor of the eye (i.e. the fluid in the anterior chamber). Some antibiotics administered orally achieve intraocular concentrations via systemic delivery, while other antibiotics do not effectively penetrate the eye. Intracameral antibiotic administration is the most direct route of delivery to the site of potential infection.</P>
<P>Perioperative antibiotics eliminate etiologic organisms by either bacteriostatic or bactericidal mechanisms. Bacteriostatic agents arrest the growth and replication of bacteria found on the ocular surface, eyelids, or those already iatrogenically introduced into the aqueous humor. Thus, these drugs limit the spread of infection while the body's immune system eliminates the nonproliferating pathogens. Bactericidal antibiotics kill the bacteria directly, decreasing the total concentration of viable microorganisms. Bactericidal agents are more commonly used in ocular surgery as they can achieve more rapid destruction of invading bacteria. Frequently used perioperative antibiotics with bactericidal properties include fluoroquinolones, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, and cephalosporins.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-01-19 17:08:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cataract surgery is the most common operative procedure in the aged population. While endophthalmitis is relatively rare, the frequency of the procedure makes the absolute number of cases significant enough to be a public health problem. In 2003 to 2004, nearly 1.6 million cases of cataract surgery were performed annually in the US Medicare fee-for-service population alone (<LINK REF="REF-Schein-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schein 2012</LINK>), and an estimated 10 million procedures were performed worldwide annually in the 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2001</LINK>). Experts estimate that the annual target for cataract surgery should be above 30 million surgeries (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2001</LINK>). At that rate, and assuming an incidence of one case per 1000 surgeries, 30,000 cases of postcataract surgery endophthalmitis would occur annually, with about 10,000 leading to blindness in the operated eye. Visual recovery following acute postoperative endophthalmitis remains poor across different clinical settings, despite advances in treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Lalitha-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lalitha 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheng-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheng 2011</LINK>). The extensive use of surgery to provide better vision for people with cataracts across the world calls for adoption of evidence-based methods to prevent acute endophthalmitis. This systematic review update aims to identify the current evidence to facilitate the adoption of evidence-based practices for prophylaxis of acute endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.</P>

<P>We include five RCTs in this review (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table). The studies enrolled 101,005 adults undergoing cataract surgery. The five studies varied widely in the approaches and prophylactic measures examined.</P>
<P>The first two studies were conducted at cataract surgery camps in northern Pakistan where intracapsular cataract extraction was performed, and participants were followed postoperatively for one week (<LINK REF="STD-Christy-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Christy 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Christy 1986</LINK>). Endophthalmitis diagnosis was made based on clinical signs. Although intracapsular cataract extraction is rarely performed in the 21st century, and hence the relevance of these studies for contemporary consideration is reduced, the role of prophylactic antibiotics remains relevant to contemporary practice, and surgical camps remain a mainstay in many low-income countries. Thus, these studies are described briefly. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Christy-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Christy 1979</LINK> compared combined chloramphenicol-sulfadimidine drops and periocular injection of 500,000 units of benzyl penicillin with chloramphenicol-sulfadimidine drops alone in 6618 people/eyes.

<LINK REF="STD-Sobaci-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sobaci 2003</LINK> was conducted in Turkey and compared antibiotics (vancomycin and gentamycin) in balanced salt solution (BSS) irrigating infusion fluid with BSS-only irrigating infusion fluid in 644 eyes of 640 participants. All were treated with ofloxacin and diclofenac sodium four times on the day prior to surgery. Povidone iodine was utilized for antisepsis at the time of surgery and a solution of ofloxacin, dexamethasone, and indomethacin was given postoperatively. Follow-up was for six weeks postoperation. Since the incidence of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery is low (the study authors of <LINK REF="STD-Sobaci-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sobaci 2003</LINK> reported the rate of postoperative endophthalmitis at their institution was 0.109%) and because only 644 eyes were included in the study (with less than one eye expected to be affected), the study lacked sufficient power to detect valid differences between treatments.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK> conducted at multiple sites throughout Europe and Turkey, implemented a two-by-two factorial design to evaluate intracameral cefuroxime injected at the end of surgery and topical levofloxacin given immediately preoperatively (within one hour of surgery) and up to 15 minutes following surgery in 16,603 participants. In a factorial design studying two drugs or procedures that are expected to act independently, treatment arms were allocated such that both drugs could be evaluated alone and in combination. In <LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK>, the two interventions studied were intracameral cefuroxime and topical levofloxacin.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Cunha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cunha 2013</LINK>, all participants underwent phacoemulsification with IOL implantation.

Participants instilled the drops beginning one day before the cataract surgery until 15 days postoperation. Although the study authors reported endophthalmitis as an adverse outcome, the study was not designed to assess differences in endophthalmitis rates between intervention groups.

<P>The results of the five studies are described individually below.

<P>The primary outcome for four studies was postoperative endophthalmitis following cataract surgery; the fifth study investigated prophylaxis and control of inflammation following cataract surgery with endophthalmitis reported as an adverse outcome. The two earliest studies relied on clinical diagnosis of endophthalmitis (<LINK REF="STD-Christy-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Christy 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Christy 1986</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Sobaci-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sobaci 2003</LINK> reported results for bacteriologically confirmed cases only, <LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK> reported results for all suspected cases as well as the subset of bacteriologically confirmed cases, and <LINK REF="STD-Cunha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cunha 2013</LINK> did not report how endophthalmitis was defined.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-19 17:23:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this review were too heterogeneous for us to perform a meta-analysis. The five included studies tested three modes of delivery for antibiotic prophylaxis measures: intraocular injection, topical drops, and antibiotics in the irrigating solution. The two studies that reported statistically significant differences among treatment arms both included antibiotic injection during surgery (one intraocular and the other periocular), and the treatment arms that included ocular injection had the lowest rates of endophthalmitis, ranging from 0.14 to 1.5 endophthalmitis cases per 1000 surgeries (<LINK REF="STD-Christy-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Christy 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK>). Within the <LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK> study, the primary results paper combined the two intracameral injection groups for comparison against placebo and reported a 4.9-fold increased risk of endophthalmitis when not using intracameral injection, which can be translated to an 80% decrease in endophthalmitis risk when using intracameral injection.</P>
<P>In this review, we calculated RRs and CIs for multiple comparisons within <LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK> using the data provided in the study reports; we compared both intracameral injection of cefuroxime and topical drops individually to placebo and to the combined regimen. Both the combined prophylaxis and the intracameral injection alone showed a reduced risk of both presumed and culture-proven endophthalmitis compared with no prophylaxis. Comparison of the combined regimen against topical drops alone showed a reduction in risk for presumed cases, but not for culture-proven cases only.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sobaci-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sobaci 2003</LINK> compared antibiotics in the irrigating solution against BSS alone, and reported a lower endophthalmitis rate (0/322 eyes versus 2/322 eyes up to six weeks after surgery) in the treatment arm that included antibiotics (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.15). If the study were adequately powered, this difference would translate to an 80% reduction in endophthalmitis. However, the overall sample size for this study was quite small (644 eyes) for a rare outcome like endophthalmitis, limiting the ability to evaluate statistical significance, as noted by the wide CIs (95% CI 0.01 to 4.15). Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Cunha-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cunha 2013</LINK> enrolled 129 participants, with only 108 participants analyzed at 20 days postoperation, resulting in a high degree of imprecision among outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Christy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Christy 1986</LINK> investigated the mode of delivery of antibiotics injected during surgery, and found no significant difference between subconjunctival and retrobulbar injection. The rates of endophthalmitis (1.0 to 1.1 per 1000 surgeries) in that study were comparable to endophthalmitis rates reported in the 21st century, even though surgery was performed in surgical camp settings in a developing country and that intracapsular surgery was performed. However, it is notable that this study only followed participants for one week, so some cases likely were missed.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-20 12:50:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The five studies included 101,005 adults and 132 total endophthalmitis cases. While the overall sample size was quite large, the heterogeneity of the study settings, designs, and modes of antibiotic delivery made it impossible to combine the studies and make direct comparisons. Two studies were conducted in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Cataract surgery practice has changed substantially since that time, making the results of these studies less applicable today. Povidone iodine is now used routinely in most countries and is a proven measure for reducing intraocular infection (<LINK REF="REF-Speaker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speaker 1991</LINK>). In addition, wound construction is quite different. In the 1970s and early 1980s large (180°) incisions were used routinely. Today, even in the most remote centers, much smaller incisions are employed. Small-incision manual surgery is now the procedure of choice in the majority of surgical camp settings in low-income countries. Despite these changes in surgical technique, <LINK REF="STD-Christy-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Christy 1979</LINK> suggested that adding periocular penicillin injection substantially reduced the risk of endophthalmitis.</P>
<P>Among the five studies, the <LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK> results are most applicable to 21st century surgical practice, as it used contemporary surgical techniques and study drugs that are readily available in Europe. Its design allowed for examination of both topical and intracameral antibiotics, and included a sample size sufficient to yield statistically significant results. Thus, among the studies reviewed, it provided the firmest evidence upon which to recommend a prophylactic regimen in these settings, and suggested that intracameral antibiotic injection is useful in reducing the risk of postcataract surgery endophthalmitis. However, the choice of antibiotic remains a question for many physicians. Since the publication of <LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK>, uptake of intracameral cefuroxime has varied widely. In the UK, approximately 50% of providers reported intracameral antibiotic use (<LINK REF="REF-Gore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gore 2009</LINK>). A retrospective analysis of billing codes in France suggested that the use of intracameral antibiotics increased from 0.60% to 80% between 2005 and 2014, likely due to the ESCRS recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Creuzot_x002d_Garcher-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creuzot-Garcher 2016</LINK>). Uptake has been more limited in the US. Results of the 2011 American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) member survey showed less than 20% of physicians utilizing intracameral antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Leaming-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leaming 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vazirani-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vazirani 2013</LINK>). By the ASCRS 2014 survey, 50% of US physicians reported use of intracameral antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2015</LINK>); however, this percentage remains well below the rates in Europe, Australia and New Zealand (<LINK REF="REF-Behndig-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behndig 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2016;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2016</LINK>), and US physicians continue to express concerns about the lack of a commercially available preparation. In the US, incorporating intracameral antibiotics into standard prophylaxis practice appears to be related to surgeon volume (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2008</LINK>), and increased surgeon volume has been reported to be associated with reduced risk of postoperative endophthalmitis (<LINK REF="REF-Keay-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keay 2012</LINK>). In both the US and UK, physicians not using intracameral antibiotics cite concerns regarding dilution errors and risk of contamination when compounding the drugs for doses needed for ocular injection (<LINK REF="REF-Gore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leaming-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leaming 2012</LINK>). These factors are important to consider when evaluating the applicability of the current evidence. Further discussion on this issue is provided below in the <LINK TAG="AGREEMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</LINK> section.</P>

<P>The five studies included in this review varied substantially in the prophylaxis measures that they compared and the way data were reported. Two of these studies, <LINK REF="STD-Christy-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Christy 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Christy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Christy 1986</LINK>, were conducted over 30 years ago, when standards for randomization and reporting in clinical trials were less stringent and less well-defined. To the credit of the Christy team, they provided detailed information on both the operative procedure and the follow-up procedures. All five studies randomized participants, but random sequence generation and allocation concealment were described fully only in <LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK>. Hence, we cannot judge whether some selection bias may have occurred in the other studies.</P>
<P>Masking of the intervention was not complete in most of these studies.

<P>The rare nature of endophthalmitis makes RCTs difficult to conduct, because of the very large sample sizes needed to make statistically valid comparisons. Thus, few trials have been conducted, and all that we are aware of are included here. Worldwide, numerous single-center retrospective analyses have been conducted to examine whether changes in practice patterns resulted in reduced endophthalmitis rates. Several studies have reported reduced rates of endophthalmitis following adoption of intracameral or subconjunctival antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Beselga-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beselga 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garat-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garat 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Saenz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Saenz 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myneni-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myneni 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Packer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Packer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shorstein-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorstein 2013</LINK>). The antibiotic of choice has varied across studies of intracameral injections, with moxifloxacin, vancomycin, and cefuroxime all showing a reduction compared with no antibiotic injection (<LINK REF="REF-Packer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Packer 2011</LINK>). Most notably, numerous studies have investigated the benefit of intracameral cefuroxime in light of the ESCRS study and increased availability of the antibiotic in Europe. Data from Sweden have shown extremely low rates of postoperative endophthalmitis (0.029%) in the presence of intracameral cefuroxime (<LINK REF="REF-Friling-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friling 2013</LINK>). In Portugal, a center found that endophthalmitis decreased from 0.26% to 0.0% after introduction of the ESCRS protocol and use of intracameral cefuroxime (<LINK REF="REF-Beselga-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beselga 2014</LINK>). Several other studies also have reported declines in endophthalmitis. Across these studies, the general consensus has been that intracameral antibiotic use reduces the risk of endophthalmitis, which provides further support to the <LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK> study findings.</P>

<P>This systematic review underscores the broad scope of prophylaxis regimens considered to be of potential use in preventing endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. Among the included studies, the mode of antibiotic administration ranged widely from topical administration preoperatively to intraocular injections during surgery. Given our decision not to conduct a meta-analysis of the accumulated data, we are unable to report a direct comparison of the effectiveness of these prophylactic measures. However, among the individual studies evaluated, <LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK> provides the best evidence for antibiotic prophylaxis against postcataract surgery endophthalmitis. Clinical trials of this magnitude are costly and take many years to conduct. Hence, decisions currently need to be made based on the available evidence, with the possibility of conducting future trials as new and improved prophylactic treatments become available (antibiotics or otherwise).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK> demonstrated the efficacy of using intracameral antibiotics for reducing endophthalmitis. However, the antibiotic of choice may differ based on the clinical setting. Concerns of toxicity, contamination, and other problems associated with compounding and diluting remain with the use of cefuroxime (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delyfer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delyfer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olavi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olavi 2012</LINK>). US physicians indicate they may increase their use of intracameral antibiotics if a single-dose vial were commercially available (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2015</LINK>). Hence, the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ASCRS) has called for the pharmaceutical industry and US Food and Drug Administration to prioritize development and approval of single-dose intracameral antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Braga_x002d_Mele-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braga-Mele 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2015</LINK>). One report of ocular toxicity in a cluster of people following a dilution error highlights the need for clinicians to remain vigilant in monitoring preparation of intracameral antibiotics for use during surgery. Resistance of endophthalmitis-causing organisms to moxifloxacin appears to be increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Schimel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimel 2013</LINK>). In determining whether to use intracameral injections and if so which antibiotic to use, individual surgical centers should evaluate the risks and benefits associated with the various available intracameral antibiotics and the resources available for ensuring appropriate dilution and sterility based on their setting (<LINK REF="REF-Olavi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olavi 2012</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-26 17:05:17 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review highlights the limited amount of randomized controlled trial data available for evaluating measures used to prevent endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. Intraocular antibiotics have been used for decades, with multiple studies conducted in surgical camp settings in low-income countries. However, speculation remains over which antibiotics to use and what mode of intraocular delivery is best.</P>
<P>Since the mid-2000s, a great deal of attention has been placed on the value of adding an intracameral injection to the perioperative regimen, and the findings of <LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK> support the effectiveness of this practice. Several case reports and other retrospective analyses have examined a variety of antibiotics for use in intracameral injection at the close of cataract surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Packer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Packer 2011</LINK>). To date, however, the <LINK REF="STD-ESCRS-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ESCRS 2007</LINK> study provides the only prospective clinical trial evidence for the use of intracameral antibiotics. The reluctance of many physicians to utilize intracameral injections with currently available antibiotic preparations highlights the need for the development of commercially available single-use vials of antibiotics for intracameral injection. A single-use vial of cefuroxime, which requires only reconstitution and not dilution, was approved in Europe in 2012 (Thea Laboratories; <LINK REF="REF-Keating-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keating 2013</LINK>). Numerous studies in Europe have reported increases in the use of intracameral antibiotics and corresponding decreases in rates of endophthalmitis following the increased use of cefuroxime (<LINK REF="REF-Barreau-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barreau 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beselga-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beselga 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daien-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daien 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haripriya-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haripriya 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jabbarvand-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jabbarvand 2016</LINK>). Surveys should be conducted in one to two years to determine whether increased utilization of intracameral antibiotics leads to increased antibiotic resistance or other ocular complications, or both. Additionally, single-use vials of antibiotics for intracameral use are needed in the US and other countries. Some ophthalmologists currently utilize moxifloxacin (Alcon) topical drops for intracameral injection without dilution. Given that the coverage spectrum of moxifloxacin is somewhat broader than that of cefuroxime and available for use without dilution, it would be of interest to research the comparative effectiveness of these two drugs. However, such a study would require a sample size of over 100,000 participants, making it unlikely that it will ever be conducted. On a longer view, new approaches to instilling antibiotics into the anterior chamber are needed. Sustained drug-delivery devices provide one example of an area ripe for additional research.</P>

<P>
<B>General:</B> all surgeries were performed by 1 surgeon; surgical technique, postoperative treatment, and follow-up were identical for both groups.</P>
<P>
<B>Preoperative treatment:</B> on the day prior to surgery, all participants' faces were washed with soap and water, eyelashes were clipped, and antibiotic ointment was applied to the conjunctival sac. At the time of surgery, procaine 2% and retrobulbar blocks (lidocaine 2 mL of 2% with hyaluronidase 6 units/mL) were administered, participants' eyelids and surrounding face washed with sterile water, a lid speculum was inserted, and the conjunctival sac irrigated with sterile water.</P>
<P>
<B>Surgical technique:</B> the surgeon used intracapsular cataract extraction procedure and did not rescrub hands between cases or use gloves. All instruments were sterilized with a speed autoclave. Operative technique included a 180° von Graefe knife incision; 1 peripheral iridectomy; 1 to 3 virgin silk corneoscleral sutures placed after the iridectomy but before the lens extraction and forceps delivery of the lens. After the operation, 1 drop of medication (pilocarpine 4%, polymyxin B sulfate 5000 IU/mL, neomycin sulfate 2.5 mg/mL, and hydrocortisone acetate 5 mg/mL) was placed in the conjunctival sac and a sterile pad placed over the eye.</P>
<P>
<B>Postoperative treatment:</B> eyes were examined and dressed daily. Antibiotic ointment was instilled on the first day and on subsequent days a drop of sulfadimidine 5% and 1 drop of atropine 1% were instilled. Participants without complications were hospitalized for 1 week.</P>
