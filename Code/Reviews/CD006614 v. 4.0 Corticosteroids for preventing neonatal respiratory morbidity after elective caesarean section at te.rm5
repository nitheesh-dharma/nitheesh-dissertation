<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-06 10:13:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Babies born at term (at or after 37 weeks) by planned (elective) caesarean section and before onset of labour are more likely to develop respiratory complications than babies born vaginally. The giving of injections called "corticosteroids" to the mother has been shown to reduce the risk of newborn babies having breathing problems in babies born before 34 weeks, but it is not clear if they are useful after this stage. The risk of respiratory complications, mostly respiratory distress syndrome and transient tachypnoea, decreases from 37 weeks to 39 weeks of gestation, at which stage it is low. The aim of this review was to investigate if corticosteroids can reduce the rates of respiratory problems and the need for admission into special care units when given before planned (not emergency) caesarean section at term.</P>
<P>The review identified only one randomised controlled study involving 942 women. Compared with usual care, giving the mother intramuscular betamethasone can halve the chances of a baby needing special care for respiratory problems, and reduce the chances of the baby being admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit. Much larger numbers of women would be needed to confirm differences in the rates of the respiratory problems themselves and any possible harms of giving the corticosteroids, for the mother and the baby.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-16 11:38:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One study comparing prophylactic administration of betamethasone (N = 467) versus usual treatment without steroids (N = 475) in term elective caesarean section was included in the review. Women randomised to treatment group received two intramuscular doses of betamethasone in the 48 hours before delivery, whereas the control group received treatment as usual.</P>
<P>Prophylactic betamethasone appeared to significantly decrease the risk of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory morbidity (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.64). However, no statistically significant reduction was found in the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.07 to 1.58), transient tachypnoea of the newborn (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.11), need for mechanical ventilation (RR 4.07; 95% CI 0.46 to 36.27) and length of stay in neonatal intensive care unit (MD) -2.14 days; 95% CI -5.58 to 1.30).</P>
<P>There were no reported events of neonatal sepsis, perinatal deaths or maternal trauma infection, therefore results on these outcomes are non-estimable. The study did not provide data on other pre-defined outcomes.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-06-18 08:41:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results from the single trial are promising, but more studies with larger samples are needed to investigate the effect of prophylactic steroids in the incidence of neonatal complications per se. Also more data and longer follow up would be needed for potential harms and complications.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-06 10:13:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caesarean section is a risk factor for the development of neonatal respiratory complications, mostly respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and transient tachypnoea of the newborn, both in term and preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Dani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerten-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerten 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nielsen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nielsen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reed-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1985</LINK>). Infants born at term by caesarean delivery are more likely to develop respiratory morbidity than infants born vaginally, and this risk increases furthermore for the subgroup of children born after elective caesarean section, i.e. before onset of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Bowers-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowers 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerten-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerten 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1995</LINK>), with potentially severe implications (<LINK REF="REF-Roth_x002d_Kleiner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth-Kleiner 2003</LINK>). The risk is decreasing with advancing gestational age, and infants born between 37 + 0 and 37 + 6 weeks are at 1.7 times more risk for respiratory complications than those born between 38 + 0 and 38 + 6 weeks, which in turn are at 2.4 times more risk than the infants born between 39 + 0 and 39 + 6 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1995</LINK>). This trend is particularly pronounced for RDS, where the risk decreases from about 39/1000 for the period between 37 + 0 to 37 + 6 weeks to about 8/1000 for the period between 39 + 0 to 39 + 6 weeks, with the odds ratio in comparison to vaginal delivery similarly decreasing from 12.9 before 39 weeks to 1.1 from 39 + 0 weeks onwards (<LINK REF="REF-Zanardo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanardo 2004</LINK>). There is little or no conflicting evidence on how mode of anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Nielsen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nielsen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2001</LINK>) and fetal gender (<LINK REF="REF-Dani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2001</LINK>) further affects this risk.</P>
<P>In view of this evidence, it is currently recommended that elective caesarean section should be deferred to 39 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). However, approximately 10% to 15% of women planned for caesarean may deliver before 39 weeks, and there may be concerns on waiting in the presence of specific clinical indications or previous history. Prophylactic corticosteroids in singleton preterm pregnancies accelerate lung maturation and reduce the incidence of RDS, and administration of steroids is currently recommended between 24 and 34 weeks in cases of threatened preterm labour, antepartum haemorrhage, preterm rupture of membranes or in any condition requiring elective preterm delivery (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence for administration of corticosteroids at or after 36 weeks is more controversial. The most recent version of the Cochrane Review on prophylactic corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation showed that, in cases with gestational age at entry equal or more than 35 to 36 weeks, there is no difference in the incidence of RDS, neonatal death or chorioamnionitis (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Of note, the confidence intervals for these subgroups are wide given the relatively low rates of these serious events, and several outcomes are missing. This is particularly applicable to the maternal and neonatal complications, reflecting either their sparsity at term or the small number of recruits at these stages.</P>
<P>Respiratory morbidity in cases of term elective caesarean births appears to have a different pathophysiology than in preterm birth, with lack of the physiological catecholamine surge (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irestedt-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irestedt 1984</LINK>) and fluid retention in the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1966</LINK>) being the most likely causes. Interestingly, recent evidence indicates that, apart from the traditional mechanical concept of 'vaginal squeeze', molecular mechanisms (predominantly lung epithelial sodium channels) promote alveolar fluid drainage, and these channels may be underactive in fetuses not exposed to the process of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Jain-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 2006</LINK>). Glucocorticoids appear to increase the number and function of sodium channels, as well as the responsiveness to catecholamines and thyroid hormones (<LINK REF="REF-Jain-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 2006</LINK>), providing a rationale for their exogenous administration in cases of elective caesarean.</P>
<P>The practical impact of routine steroid administration in scheduled term caesarean delivery is important to assess. This is even more apparent when taking into consideration that caesarean births represent 30% to 40% of all births in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-McClure-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClure 2007</LINK>) and approximately half of them are elective at term; therefore the use or not of steroids in this setting is a common question for obstetricians.</P>

<P>No placebo was used in the ASTECS study (<LINK REF="STD-Stutchfield-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stutchfield 2005</LINK>), and therefore neither the participants nor the clinicians were blinded. Lack of blinding in randomised studies can potentially predispose to some exaggeration of the intervention effects for some outcomes through multiple pathways (different expectations from the two groups, biased assessment of the effect and/or differential administration of co-interventions) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). This may be particularly true for outcomes involving subjective choices, e.g. whether admission to a special/intensive care unit will be preferred.</P>
<P>The trial was properly randomised and allocation was properly concealed. However, of the 998 randomised women, only 942 were entered into what the trialists called intention-to-treat analysis. Of the 56 cases excluded, 20 were twin pregnancies (excluded by design, as there is evidence that steroids are not effective in twins) and seven were excluded because they were delivered before 37 weeks, leaving 29 cases for which no information was available despite reminders.</P>
<P>Treatment according to protocol was adopted by only 819 women; of the 123 women not treated according to protocol, 51 had an emergency caesarean section, 24 had a normal delivery, 26 were not given steroids and the rest either deviated from the dosing scheme, were not properly documented or withdrew. This loss of information and change of treatment plans may be largely unavoidable in a pragmatic trial, but introduces some noise and potential for bias in the estimation of the treatment effects.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Prophylactic betamethasone appeared to significantly decrease the risk of admission for respiratory distress to neonatal special care units (all levels) (risk ratio (RR) 0.45 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.90) <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, and particularly to neonatal intensive care units (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.64) <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>. The corresponding risk differences were -0.03 (i.e. 3% reduction, 95% CI -5% to -1%) and -0.03 (i.e. 3% reduction, 95% CI -5% to -0%), underscoring the low rates of the two outcomes and better illustrating the actual gain from steroid administration.</P>
<P>In contrast, no statistically significant reduction was found in the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.07 to 1.58) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), transient tachypnoea of the newborn (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.11) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), need for mechanical ventilation (RR 4.07; 95% CI 0.46 to 36.27) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) and length of stay in NICU (mean difference -2.14 days; 95% CI -5.58 to 1.30) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no reported events of neonatal sepsis, perinatal deaths or maternal trauma infection; therefore results on these outcomes are non-estimable.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-06 10:32:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the ASTECS study, the observed rate of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) in the control group was 1.1% and 4.0% respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Stutchfield-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stutchfield 2005</LINK>). Approximately five per cent of neonates in the control group were admitted to special care because of respiratory symptoms, of which more than half were admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).</P>
<P>Prophylactic administration of betamethasone appeared to halve the chances for admission to neonatal special care and reduce the chances of being admitted to NICU by about six times. However, it did not significantly reduce the overall admission rate to neonatal special care for any indication (i.e. respiratory and non-respiratory). Moreover, this single study was underpowered for the differences in hard respiratory outcomes, i.e. RDS and TTN rates, to reach statistical significance. An unexpected finding is that four infants in treatment group needed mechanical ventilation versus only one in control group. As this finding might be alarming, we contacted the authors of ASTECS study; in two out of four cases intubation took place in the delivery room and following a suitable response the endotracheal tube was removed without the babies needing admission to intensive care. In one more case, the mother was randomised to the treatment group, but she went into spontaneous labour and was delivered by emergency section with fetal distress before betamethasone could be given.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis failed to demonstrate significant differences according to gestational age, due to the small number of events in the subgroups.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-07-06 10:13:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic betamethasone reduces admission to special care or neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress after elective caesarean section, and, based on the ASTECS data (<LINK REF="STD-Stutchfield-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stutchfield 2005</LINK>), for approximately 37 to 39 women receiving prophylactic steroids, one more additional admission to special care or NICU would be prevented. The importance of this finding needs to be corroborated by the demonstration of steroids' effect on hard respiratory morbidity, which could currently not be seen.</P>
<P>As ASTECS was a multicentre pragmatic study, this result may also reflect the true effect in regular clinical practice. However, it should be noted that the trial was not blinded and admission to a special care or intensive care unit is largely a subjective choice and may be affected by knowledge of treatment assignment. Therefore, this outcome alone cannot be taken as proof that corticosteroids were effective. </P>
<P>Much larger numbers of participants are needed to evaluate true impact on other important outcomes (e.g. RDS and TTN rates) or uncommon maternal and neonatal complications. Although post-hoc power calculations are problematic, in order for the rate differences in RDS and TTN, as observed in ASTECS, to become significant (P = 0.05, power 80%), approximately 1400 women per arm would be needed.</P>
<P>Finally, there is currently a lack of evidence from medium- and long-term follow up of these infants.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-07-06 10:13:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current evidence comes from a single study without major methodological concerns apart from its non-blinded design.</P>
<P>Although all outcomes may be affected, it is likely that more subjective management decisions or assessments of outcome are more susceptible to bias arising from lack of blinding, as compared to more objective ones (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Admission of neonates to special care is one such example - clinicians potentially biased in favour of the intervention may have been more likely to organise an admission to NICU for babies not exposed to corticosteroids. Such bias was possible, but less likely for radiological diagnosis of RDS or TTN by independent specialists. Similarly, admission to lower levels of special care may be more prone to bias than referral to NICU, as the latter would require more clinical and laboratory findings. Lack of blinding may also contribute to the finding that, although steroids reduce admission rates for respiratory problems, they do not significantly reduce the overall admission rate. Infants in the corticosteroid group may have been less likely to have had their reason for admission classified as "respiratory" because they were known to have received corticosteroids.</P>
<P>The ASTECS study listed specific criteria used for the diagnosis of respiratory distress, which in turn was the criterion for admission to special care; however, this does not guarantee that the appraisal was totally objective and fail-proof for all cases.</P>
<P>Another potential concern would be the considerable loss of data on randomised women, as 123 of 942 women were not treated per protocol. However, in 75 of these cases the reason for this deviation was unpredictable emergency caesarean section or vaginal delivery between randomisation and elective caesarean, which is a likely scenario in a study involving planned caesarean section.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-07-06 10:34:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence from a single randomised controlled trial suggests that prophylactic betamethasone before elective caesarean section at term may significantly reduce admission to neonatal special care units for respiratory complications, but such reduction is not yet seen for objective measures of respiratory morbidity. Reduction in NICU admissions may be important in the light of increasing rates of caesarean section and overcrowding of neonatal units; however, caution is needed in interpreting this potential benefit, given the subjective nature of these outcomes and the lack of blinding in this trial. Moreover, much larger samples and longer follow up would be needed to bring out potential differences in hard clinical outcomes and potential harms.</P>

<P>More studies with larger samples would be needed to investigate the effect of prophylactic steroids in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and transient tachypnoea of the newborn per se, stratify their effectiveness according to gestational age at caesarean and provide more data on potential uncommon side effects and complications.</P>

<P>The original outcome "Admission to the neonatal special care unit or above" was split into a primary outcome (Admission to neonatal special care for respiratory morbidity (all levels of care or intensive care unit (NICU))) and a secondary outcome (Admission to neonatal special care for any indication (all levels of care or intensive care unit (NICU))). This was done because, in the case of non-blinded trials, there is a possibility of bias, as infants in the treatment group may have been less likely to have had their reason for admission classified as &#8220;respiratory&#8221; because they were known to have received corticosteroids. Furthermore, special care was split into two categories "special care - all levels" and "special care - NICU", as different levels of care may reflect different severity of respiratory distress.</P>
