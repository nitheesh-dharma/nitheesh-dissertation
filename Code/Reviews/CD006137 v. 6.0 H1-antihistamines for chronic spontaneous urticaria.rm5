<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-12 14:37:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M  Delamere">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a condition characterised by a rash of red itchy raised weals or hives, which appear for no identifiable reason. Other names include chronic idiopathic or chronic ordinary urticaria. 'Spontaneous' differentiates this type of urticaria from 'inducible' or 'physical' urticaria, for which there are specific triggers such as cold or pressure. 'Chronic' indicates that the condition has continued for at least six weeks. Hives may be intensely itchy, and the appearance may be unsightly and distressing to sufferers. In some cases, hives can be accompanied by deeper swelling, known as angio-oedema, which is most common around the eyes and mouth.</P>
<P>Antihistamine drugs, specifically H1 antihistamines, are the mainstay of treatment for urticaria, although they control the condition rather than cure it. Many antihistamines are available to buy without a prescription, including brand names such as Clarityn, Piriton, Zirtek, Benadryl and Phenergan (brand names may differ by country).</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Which H1-antihistamines are effective and safe for CSU?</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 73 randomised controlled trials, with 9759 participants of all ages and looked for complete suppression of urticaria. The duration of the intervention was up to two weeks (short-term) or longer than two weeks and up to three months (intermediate-term).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We investigated clinical trials in which one therapy was compared against another or against placebo (direct comparisons). We found that for general use, 10 mg once daily of cetirizine for short-term and intermediate-term duration was effective in completely suppressing urticaria, although not in all individuals. Some benefit may be associated with use of desloratadine at 5 mg for at least an intermediate term and at 20 mg in the short term. Levocetirizine at 5 mg was effective for complete suppression in the intermediate term but not in the short term. A higher dose of 20 mg was effective in the short term, but 10 mg was not.</P>
<P>Adverse events, such as headache or dry mouth, are tolerable with most antihistamines. Evidence is less clear for improvement in quality of life (e.g. reduction in sleep disturbance from itching, less distress from the appearance of hives) as many studies did not address this.</P>
<P>We cannot say whether one antihistamine works better than all the rest, as we did not have head-to-head evidence for every possible treatment comparison.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence found for most outcomes was low. Further well-designed and carefully reported comparative studies are required, if we are to find out how well these medicines work, and if any adverse effects are reported, especially over periods of up to several months.</P>

<P>We searched the following databases up to June 2014: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and PsycINFO (from 1806). We searched five trials registers and checked articles for references to relevant randomised controlled trials.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-11-12 12:46:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials of H1-antihistamines for CSU. Interventions included single therapy or a combination of H1-antihistamines compared with no treatment (placebo) or another active pharmacological compound at any dose.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-11-12 14:28:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M  Delamere">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
<P>Our primary outcome measures were proportion of participants with complete suppression of urticaria: 'good or excellent' response, 50% or greater improvement in quality of life measures, and adverse events. We present risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-12 14:45:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M  Delamere">
<P>We identified 73 studies (9759 participants); 34 studies provided data for 23 comparisons. The duration of the intervention was up to two weeks (short-term) or longer than two weeks and up to three months (intermediate-term).</P>
<P>Cetirizine 10 mg once daily in the short term and in the intermediate term led to complete suppression of urticaria by more participants than was seen with placebo (RR 2.72, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.91). For this same outcome, comparison of desloratadine versus placebo in the intermediate term (5 mg) (RR 37.00, 95% CI 2.31 to 593.70) and in the short term (20 mg) (RR 15.97, 95% CI 1.04 to 245.04) favoured desloratadine, but no differences were seen between 5 mg and 10 mg for short-term treatment.</P>
<P>Levocetirizine 20 mg per day (short-term) was more effective for complete suppression of urticaria compared with placebo (RR 20.87, 95% CI 1.37 to 317.60), and at 5 mg was effective in the intermediate term (RR 52.88, 95% CI 3.31 to 843.81) but not in the short term, nor was 10 mg effective in the short term.</P>
<P>Rupatadine at 10 mg and 20 mg in the intermediate term achieved a 'good or excellent response' compared with placebo (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77).</P>
<P>Loratadine (10 mg) versus placebo (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.79) and loratadine (10 mg) versus cetirizine (10 mg) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.43) over short-term and intermediate-term treatment showed no significant difference for 'good or excellent response' or for complete suppression of urticaria, respectively.</P>
<P>Loratadine (10 mg) versus desloratadine (5 mg) (intermediate-term) showed no statistically significant difference for complete suppression of urticaria (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71). For loratadine (10 mg) versus mizolastine (10 mg) (intermediate-term), no statistically significant difference was seen for complete suppression of urticaria (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.16) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.42).</P>
<P>Loratadine (10 mg) versus emedastine (2 mg) (intermediate-term) showed no statistically significant difference for complete suppression (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.39) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.24); the quality of the evidence was moderate for this comparison.</P>
<P>No difference in short-term treatment was noted between loratadine (10 mg) and hydroxyzine (25 mg) in terms of complete suppression (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10).</P>
<P>When desloratadine (5 to 20 mg) was compared with levocetirizine (5 to 20 mg), levocetirizine appeared to be the more effective (P value &lt; 0.02).</P>
<P>In a comparison of fexofenadine versus cetirizine, more participants in the cetirizine group showed complete suppression of urticaria (P value &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>Adverse events leading to withdrawals were not significantly different in the following comparisons: cetirizine versus placebo at 10 mg and 20 mg (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 13.22); desloratadine 5 mg versus placebo (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.10); loratadine 10 mg versus mizolastine 10 mg (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.60); loratadine 10 mg versus emedastine 2 mg (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.14); cetirizine 10 mg versus hydroxyzine 25 mg (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.45); and hydroxyzine 25 mg versus placebo (RR 3.64, 95% CI 0.77 to 17.23), all intermediate term.</P>
<P>No difference was seen between loratadine 10 mg versus mizolastine 10 mg in the proportion of participants with at least 50% improvement in quality of life (RR 3.21, 95% CI 0.32 to 32.33).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-12 12:49:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the results of our review indicate that at standard doses of treatment, several antihistamines are effective when compared with placebo, all results were gathered from a few studies or, in some cases, from single-study estimates. The quality of the evidence was affected by the small number of studies in each comparison and the small sample size for many of the outcomes, prompting us to downgrade the quality of evidence for imprecision (unless stated for each comparison, the quality of the evidence was low).</P>
<P>No single H1-antihistamine stands out as most effective. Cetirizine at 10 mg once daily in the short term and in the intermediate term was found to be effective in completely suppressing urticaria. Evidence is limited for desloratadine given at 5 mg once daily in the intermediate term and at 20 mg in the short term. Levocetirizine at 5 mg in the intermediate but not short term was effective for complete suppression. Levocetirizine 20 mg was effective in the short term, but 10 mg was not. No difference in rates of withdrawal due to adverse events was noted between active and placebo groups. Evidence for improvement in quality of life was insufficient.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-12 11:59:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urticaria is a condition characterised by the development of a rash of red itchy raised weals or hives that blanch with pressure. The main associated symptom is itching, which may be intense. Although individual weals typically come and go within 24 hours, the overall condition may persist, with fresh crops of weals occurring on other areas of the body, even as the original lesions resolve. In some cases, the weals are accompanied by deeper swelling, known as angio-oedema. If recurrent crops of urticaria continue to occur for longer than six weeks, the condition is known as chronic urticaria (to distinguish this from the more common acute urticaria, for which a cause is more often identified) (<LINK REF="REF-James-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarbijt-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarbijt 2014</LINK>). Chronic spontaneous urticaria may occur at any age (<LINK REF="REF-Hellgren-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellgren 1972</LINK>). Recent publications show a female-to-male predominance of 2:1 (<LINK REF="REF-Gaig-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaig 2004</LINK>) with a prevalence of between 0.5% and 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Maurer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maurer 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>A careful history and physical examination are important, but an underlying cause is never identified in most individuals with chronic urticaria (<LINK REF="REF-Grattan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grattan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Charlesworth-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charlesworth 2002</LINK>). In such cases, the condition has also been called 'chronic idiopathic urticaria.' This term was replaced by 'chronic ordinary urticaria' to include the subset of people who appear to have autoimmune disease, with a circulating antibody that is able to bind to mast cells, thereby causing histamine release and weal formation. This group makes up about 30% of those with chronic urticaria, but such individuals tend to respond in the same way to treatment as those with non-autoimmune urticaria (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 2003</LINK>). Current consensus is to use the term 'chronic spontaneous urticaria' (<LINK REF="REF-Maurer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maurer 2013</LINK>), which describes the behaviour of the disease rather than assuming a particular level of knowledge of its pathogenesis. By contrast, when a trigger for urticaria can be identified, the term 'inducible' is now preferred. In practice, chronic spontaneous urticaria covers the population of individuals who were previously labelled as having chronic idiopathic or ordinary urticaria. Most of the extant literature employs these outmoded terms. We therefore deemed it appropriate to include such studies, whilst adhering to the term 'chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)' throughout our review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>The severity of urticaria varies between individuals. Some of those with the condition have several attacks each day for many months; others may have an attack every week or every month. This can be a very debilitating condition, particularly if the attacks are frequent. The inability to predict an attack and the lack of an identifiable cause are often sources of great frustration. Historically it has been reported that after 10 years, at least 20% of those with urticaria still suffer from it (<LINK REF="REF-Champion-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Champion 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Humphreys-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humphreys 1998</LINK>) and that half of those with chronic urticaria and angio-oedema still had chronic urticaria at five years (<LINK REF="REF-Champion-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Champion 1969</LINK>). However, the condition is rarely permanent, and recent surveys suggest a higher chance of disease remission (<LINK REF="REF-Kozel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kozel 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-06 11:01:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of treatment is to suppress urticarial activity completely. In some individuals, only symptomatic improvement can be achieved by reducing the severity and frequency of attacks. H1-antihistamines (commonly called 'antihistamines,' which are available over the counter for various complaints, including hay fever and allergies) form the basis of treatment, providing symptomatic relief for many affected individuals. Older (or 'first-generation') H1-antihistamines (e.g. hydroxyzine) are no longer recommended for use in chronic urticaria, as they are more sedating than the newer 'second generation' of antihistamines (e.g. cetirizine) and carry a higher risk of side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, headache, glaucoma and urinary retention.</P>
<P>Antihistamines may have to be taken over extended periods of time to control the disease. High doses of H1-antihistamines may be required to obtain sufficient symptom control in urticaria. Adverse effects of H1-antihistamines vary between individuals, and some of those with the condition may tolerate one antihistamine better than another (<LINK REF="REF-Nolen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolen 1997</LINK>). Terfenadine and astemizole have been associated with cardiac arrhythmias (<LINK REF="REF-DuBuske-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">DuBuske 1999</LINK>) in a small proportion of people and have been withdrawn from the market. Oral corticosteroids have an occasional role as rescue therapy in severe exacerbations of chronic urticaria.</P>
<P>Other treatments for difficult to control CSU include H2-antihistamines (also known as H2-receptor antagonists, or H2RAs) such as ranitidine (these are not commonly referred to as antihistamines and are usually used for acid-related stomach conditions). (This class of medications was systematically reviewed in <LINK REF="REF-Fedorowicz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedorowicz 2012</LINK>.) Other interventions include the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast, immunosuppressive agents (e.g. ciclosporin), diets and food avoidance, doxepin and the anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody omalizumab.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-11-06 12:08:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria can be difficult to treat. Many of those with the condition do not respond to initial treatment, and clear guidance is needed on which antihistamines to use, appropriate dosing regimens and likely responses. As treatment is usually aimed at reducing symptoms and improving the lives of people with CSU, evidence regarding quality of life was sought so an important outcome for this review could be assessed.</P>
<P>Many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) related to the use of antihistamines in CSU have been conducted. We sought to investigate:</P>
<UL>
<LI>whether one antihistamine is superior to another;</LI>
<LI>if combination therapy is superior to monotherapy;</LI>
<LI>whether high-dose therapy is superior to standard doses;</LI>
<LI>the duration of benefit from H1-antihistamines;</LI>
<LI>risks and side effects of H1-antihistamines when used in the treatment of individuals with chronic urticaria; and</LI>
<LI>the effects of treatment on quality of life.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We have provided an assessment of the level and quality of currently available evidence, and we have identified areas that require further research on this important condition.<BR/>

<P>H1-antihistamines usually are classified as first or second generation, according to their chemical structure and properties. First-generation antihistamines may cause sedation and can be useful for treating sleep disturbance due to itching. Second-generation antihistamines are less sedating, as the molecule is less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier; however, they are not without the possibility of sedative effects, and some (particularly terfenadine and astemizole) may also cause irregularities in heart rhythm (cardiac arrhythmia). A category of third-generation antihistamines has been used to describe some of the later antihistamines. This term is not generally accepted, as such agents do not differ sufficiently from earlier drugs in terms of desirable and undesirable effects (<LINK REF="REF-Holgate-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holgate 2003</LINK>). In our analyses (of those trials that yielded outcome data), we included the following.</P>

<P>In this review, we included 'Risk of bias' assessments.

<P>For studies with items judged as 'unclear,' we requested clarification from trial investigators, but no further information was forthcoming at the time that this review was prepared. No study provided complete clarity on every item in our 'Risk of bias' assessment, indicating widespread suboptimal reporting of methodology or results.

<P>The randomisation process and concealment of allocation are the most important and sensitive indicators that bias has been minimised in clinical trials. In one of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Garavaglia-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Garavaglia 1995</LINK>), we assessed risk of bias as high, as the report of the study stated that the participant group was "randomly divided (by triplets) into three groups," using a preestablished randomisation list. As participants who dropped out were replaced with new participants, it is unclear whether the trial design is truly randomised, and whether new participants were randomly assigned de novo or were assigned to the group of the most recent dropout. We were unable to obtain further information from trial investigators to clarify this. Among all 73 included studies, only 12 (<LINK REF="STD-Brostoff-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brostoff 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dakhale-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dakhale 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Lorenzo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Lorenzo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gimenez_x002d_Arnau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gimenez-Arnau 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Handa-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Handa 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kint-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kint 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monroe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Monroe 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ortonne-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ortonne 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pons_x002d_Guiraud-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pons-Guiraud 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ring-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ring 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weller-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuberbier-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zuberbier 2010</LINK>) clearly described adequate randomisation methods.

A short-term duration of intervention was used in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hoxha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hoxha 2011</LINK>), which investigated three doses compared with placebo and reported that 4/34, 11/34, 21/34 and 0/36 (desloratadine 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg and placebo) achieved resolution of symptoms. Following an intermediate-term duration of intervention, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Lorenzo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Lorenzo 2004</LINK>) reported complete suppression of urticaria in 18/40 (desloratadine 5 mg) and 0/40 (placebo) (additional data supplied by investigator); the report of the study states that the difference between the total symptom scores for the desloratadine and placebo groups was statistically significant (P value &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>These data from <LINK REF="STD-Hoxha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hoxha 2011</LINK> suggest an association between dosage and an increased chance of complete suppression of urticaria.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-15 12:23:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>This review included 73 randomised studies with 9759 participants. For inclusion in our review, we would have preferred all studies to define their inclusion criteria explicitly as individuals with urticaria for a duration of at least six weeks, with the exclusion of those with inducible urticaria. To avoid excluding multiple studies that were likely to be relevant, we included studies that clearly stated the diagnosis under investigation as chronic spontaneous (or idiopathic or ordinary) urticaria, with nothing included in the paper to contradict this.</P>
<P>All studies were carried out in a secondary care setting, which included hospitals, research centres and dermatology centres. Participants were adults or were 12 years of age or older, and most were female.</P>
<P>Seventeen studies looked at short-term response to treatment of up to 2 weeks' duration, whilst 55 assessed intermediate response (longer than two weeks to three months). One study did not mention the duration of treatment or follow-up. No study looked at a long-term response of three months and beyond. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) can persist for years, and it would be useful for future studies to address whether treatments are effective over a longer period.</P>
<P>Considerable variation was noted in the interventions and comparators used in included studies; this limited the number of analyses that we could carry out. Additionally, pooling of data was not feasible for most of the treatment options, as the outcomes reported were not comparable. Of the 23 comparisons we were able to make, 10 provided outcome data that could be combined in meta-analyses. Thus most of our findings are based on results from individual trials.</P>
<P>Evidence suggests that some antihistamines appear to be more effective than placebo in achieving complete suppression of urticaria. This is the case for cetirizine 10 mg in the short term and in the intermediate term. Levocetirizine 20 mg over the short term also appears to be effective for complete suppression of urticaria (<LINK REF="STD-Hoxha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hoxha 2011</LINK>); however <LINK REF="STD-Hoxha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hoxha 2011</LINK> has been published only as a conference abstract, and a fuller report or further information was unavailable at the time of writing of this review. The <LINK REF="STD-Nettis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nettis 2006</LINK> study found levocetirizine 5 mg to be considerably more likely to lead to complete suppression of urticaria over an intermediate-term duration than <LINK REF="STD-Hoxha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hoxha 2011</LINK> over a short duration. Given that this information was derived from only two studies, each with some factors carrying an unclear risk of bias, it may be the case that levocetirizine is more beneficial when used for a longer duration.</P>
<P>Rupatadine in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Gimenez_x002d_Arnau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gimenez-Arnau 2007</LINK> was effective (good or excellent response) at 10 mg or 20 mg when compared against placebo. However, no difference was demonstrated between doses.</P>
<P>Meta-analyses assessing response to treatment with loratadine 10 mg indicate that its efficacy was not significantly different from that of placebo in the short and intermediate time frame (intervention for up to three months) for the outcome of 'good or excellent response' (<LINK REF="STD-Belaich-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Belaich 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monroe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Monroe 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Comparisons of desloratadine versus placebo suggested a possible relationship between dose, duration and response: Lower doses (5 mg) with a shorter intervention period led to similar results, but a longer duration of a low dose (5 mg) or a shorter duration of a higher dose (20 mg) led to a higher rate of complete suppression of urticaria. In <LINK REF="STD-Hoxha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hoxha 2011</LINK>, different doses of desloratadine 5 mg to 20 mg were compared with doses of levocetirizine 5 mg to 20 mg; study investigators concluded: "increasing dose up to four-fold in both active groups was beneficial without compromising safety. Levocetirizine appeared to be more effective than desloratadine" (P value &lt; 0.02).</P>
<P>In comparisons of more than one active intervention, no significant difference was found between loratadine 10 mg and cetirizine 10 mg at short- or intermediate-term durations in bringing about complete suppression of urticaria (<LINK REF="STD-Patel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yin-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similarly, for loratadine 10 mg versus desloratadine 5 mg for complete suppression of urticaria and for good or excellent response, no statistically significant difference was noted between groups over an intermediate term of intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Gu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zou 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>For loratadine 10 mg versus mizolastine 10 mg, again with an intermediate term of intervention, no statistically significant difference was noted between groups for complete suppression of urticaria and for 'good or excellent response' (<LINK REF="STD-Guo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-H_x002d_N-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Liu H-N 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yin-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2003b</LINK>). Loratadine 10 mg versus emedastine 2 mg (one study; n = 161) showed no statistically significant difference for complete suppression or good or excellent response, or for withdrawals due to adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Pons_x002d_Guiraud-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pons-Guiraud 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>We investigated the frequency with which adverse events led to withdrawal of treatment. No significant differences were observed in efficacy or adverse events compared with placebo in the intermediate term for cetirizine (doses from 5 mg to 20 mg) (<LINK REF="STD-Breneman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Breneman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breneman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Breneman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalivas-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kalivas 1990</LINK>), desloratadine (5 mg) (<LINK REF="STD-Monroe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Monroe 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nettis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nettis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ring-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ring 2001</LINK>) or hydroxyzine (25 mg) (<LINK REF="STD-Breneman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Breneman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalivas-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kalivas 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>For withdrawals in comparisons of two active interventions, no significant differences were noted between loratadine 10 mg and mizolastine 10 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Leynadier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Leynadier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2003</LINK>), loratadine 10 mg and emedastine 2 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Pons_x002d_Guiraud-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pons-Guiraud 2006</LINK>), cetirizine 10 mg and hydroxyzine 25 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Breneman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Breneman 1996</LINK>) and cetirizine 5 mg to 25 mg and hydroxyzine 25 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Kalivas-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kalivas 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Quality of life was assessed in one comparison of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Guo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2003</LINK>), but no difference was noted between loratadine 10 mg and mizolastine 10 mg in the proportion of participants with at least 50% improvement in quality of life.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-11-09 03:33:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies that met our criteria for inclusion in this review were conducted all over the world. We searched exhaustively and identified studies conducted in many disparate populations, including those in the USA, Australia, various European countries, South America, China, Taiwan and India. We also searched for reports on clinical trials in progress and for data from completed but unpublished clinical trials. Translation of all relevant non-English studies was conducted, and data were extracted and included. Most Japanese studies defined CSU as lasting four weeks or longer, and as this differed from our more generally recognised definition of CSU as lasting six weeks or longer, they could not be included. Evidence within this review should be applicable to all populations in which antihistamines are used for the treatment of CSU.</P>
<P>After discussion and consensus, we excluded studies that compared terfenadine and astemizole unless other comparison trial arms included interventions. These drugs are no longer in use for the treatment of urticaria because of safety concerns.</P>
<P>It is interesting to note that eight studies excluded participants previously unresponsive to antihistamines. The effect of this is that a subset of those with CSU who were more likely to be refractory to the intervention were screened out. These may be individuals with more severe disease. This could have a large effect on observed efficacy of an antihistamine in this trial, although it does not render in-trial comparisons of different antihistamines completely invalid.</P>
<P>The duration of CSU varies among individuals, although the mean duration may be prolonged (three to five years), and a small proportion of people can have CSU for longer than 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Demera-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demera 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 2005</LINK>). It was disappointing to note that the duration of interventions used in the studies included in this review was relatively short (up to six weeks), and longer-term data are not available.</P>
<P>It would also have been of interest to analyse each study by itch, weal numbers and angio-oedema separately, as itch is a different symptom from swellings, even though both are mediated by histamine. Some of the original product licences for classical antihistamines were based on itch suppression rather than reduction in wealing. Itch is often the most troublesome symptom for people in terms of impairment of quality of life because of its effect on sleep and its general propensity to cause distress. In clinical practice, patients may refer to improvement in itch but not weals (or the opposite) rather than both, so treatment effects should ideally be reported separately rather than as an overall assessment of improvement. Furthermore, physician-rated scales of itch are a contradiction, as it is only the individual with the symptom who can rate this. In our review, we were unable to look at itch or weal numbers separately because not all of the included studies reported these consistently. and our focus was on urticaria rather than angio-oedema. We were reluctant to undertake further subgroup analyses because the likelihood of false-positive significance tests increases as more subgroup analyses are performed.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-11-12 08:37:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included studies had notable methodological limitations; only 12 were clearly adequately randomised, and the randomisation method used in the rest was unclear or at high risk. Only four described adequate allocation concealment; in the remaining studies, this was unclear or was judged to confer high risk of selection bias. Blinding of participants and personnel was adequate in only 20 studies, and blinding of outcome assessors was adequate in 14. Twenty studies were at risk of bias from incomplete reporting of outcome data (attrition bias), and 20 studies were at high risk of selective reporting bias. We detected other sources of bias including baseline imbalance within groups and potential bias from industry sponsorship or funding in 55 of the included studies, but the extent to which these factors may have introduced bias was unclear. It is therefore important to emphasise that any conclusions that we have drawn are reliant on primary studies with varying degrees of bias. Risk of bias should be considered when these results are interpreted (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), and findings derived from studies with high or unclear risk of bias should be viewed with caution.</P>
<P>Although we included a large number of studies, only a few for each comparison reported outcome data that could be incorporated in meta-analyses. Several studies included small numbers of participants. We have drawn limited conclusions from single study analyses, or we have reported the results of the trial narratively or we have presented results from small meta-analyses of up to three studies (e.g. loratadine vs desloratadine, n = 410 from three studies; loratadine vs mizolastine, n = 204 from three studies).</P>
<P>Some studies showed some statistical heterogeneity, for example, for the comparison of loratadine versus desloratadine, and loratadine versus mizolastine. We give reasons for downgrading the quality of the body of evidence for each comparison in the 'Summary of findings' tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-08" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 8</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-09" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 9</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-10" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 10</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-11" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 11</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-12" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 12</LINK>) (as described in the footnotes of each table). Overall, the quality of evidence in each comparison was rated as low in most studies or of moderate quality, meaning that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. The current body of evidence does not, therefore, allow robust conclusions.<BR/>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-11-09 04:02:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Risk of bias was assessed for all studies. Although we requested additional details of trial conditions from study investigators, in many cases we were unable to determine whether randomisation and allocation concealment methods were adequate. Overall, a high proportion of the included studies were assessed as having unclear or high risk of bias. Most although not all trials published within the past 10 years provided enough information to enable full assessment of risk of bias. Many studies were at high risk of attrition bias as the result of dropouts and losses to follow-up. This could often be attributed to participants who did not experience symptomatic relief in the placebo arm of trials.</P>
<P>Of the 73 included studies with 9759 randomly assigned participants, 31 were stated to be sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, and six through research grants or non-profit organisations. It is unclear whether sponsorship was a source of bias in these trials.</P>
<P>We attempted to minimise publication bias by seeking out results of unpublished trials. This review included 73 studies, of which 35 provided outcome data for 23 comparisons. Therefore, even though we have included a large number of studies, clinical diversity and variation in the ways in which results were reported led to only a few meta-analyses. Whilst every effort was made to minimise the introduction of bias in this review, clinically divergent interventions led to wide confidence intervals and potentially imprecise results. Sensitivity analysis was not possible for primary outcomes measures for studies at low risk of bias, as studies were too few to permit assessment of the results of the review in this way.</P>
<P>Although the evidence for cetirizine is somewhat more robust than for other antihistamines, it should be borne in mind that cetirizine was effective in suppressing urticaria completely in only some participants. Bias may be present here because cetirizine has been on the market for a long time and more data are available for this agent in comparison with other drugs.</P>
<P>We were unable to include data from studies of participants with varying types of urticaria if no disaggregated data specific to the participants with CSU were available. Although some such studies may provide valuable information, we excluded them, as any conclusions that we derived from studies with mixed populations may not be applicable to populations with CSU.</P>
<P>The clinical heterogeneity that was present in the included studies in terms of populations, interventions and outcomes contributed to difficulties in pooling data for analysis. In some cases, smaller unpublished studies that reported outcomes that fit our inclusion criteria contributed data to several meta-analyses (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Hoxha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hoxha 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Kavosh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavosh 2011</LINK> reviewed second-generation H1-antihistamines and found that limited data on comparisons of antihistamines led to the recommendation to use cetirizine in preference to fexofenadine. In our review, the main finding from the key study (<LINK REF="STD-Handa-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Handa 2004</LINK>) was that at four weeks, 27/59 participants in the cetirizine group had complete suppression of urticaria as compared with 2/57 in the fexofenadine group (P value &lt; 0.001). However, this result was derived from only 116 participants and no meta-analysis was possible, so the finding may not be wholly conclusive.</P>
<P>The findings of this review are broadly in agreement with those of the <LINK REF="REF-Kavosh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavosh 2011</LINK> review, which recommended use of levocetirizine in preference to desloratadine. In our review, two studies were identified that compared these interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Hoxha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hoxha 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potter-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 2009</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Hoxha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hoxha 2011</LINK>, study investigators concluded: "Increasing dose up to four-fold in both active groups was beneficial without compromising safety. Levocetirizine appeared to be more effective than desloratadine" (P value &lt; 0.02). However, this study was published only as a conference abstract, and we were unable to obtain study data from study investigators. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Potter-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 2009</LINK> demonstrated at least good response following treatment with levocetirizine 5 mg and desloratadine 5 mg. Levocetirizine "...decreased pruritus duration and the mean CSU composite scores to a significantly greater extent than desloratadine during the first week (P=0.002 and 0.005, respectively) and over the entire study (P=0.009 and P&lt;0.05, respectively)." No meta-analysis was possible for this comparison.</P>
<P>Other studies have investigated treatment with H1-antihistamines at higher than recommended licensed doses (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Finn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weller-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 2013</LINK>). In our review, one study compared different doses of fexofenadine, but the outcomes did not fit our criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2000</LINK>). Furthermore, in this trial, participants previously unresponsive to antihistamines were excluded.</P>
<P>A review by <LINK REF="REF-Church-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Church 2012</LINK> concluded that three clinical studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hong-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Potter-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Potter 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staevska-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Staevska 2010</LINK>) suggested that H1-antihistamines, or at least desloratadine and levocetirizine, are efficacious in the treatment of CSU. However, we excluded <LINK REF="STD-Hong-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hong 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Staevska-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Staevska 2010</LINK> from our review, as they included participants outside our inclusion criteria. We agree with the authors of <LINK REF="REF-Church-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Church 2012</LINK> that an independent multi-centre study could provide valuable information about the relative efficacy of these interventions. Currently available evidence for use of higher doses of H1-antihistamines for CSU is limited, and no long-term data are available for any of the trials.</P>
<P>Guidelines of the British Association of Dermatologists for management of urticaria (<LINK REF="REF-Grattan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grattan 2007</LINK>) suggested that patients should be offered the choice of at least two non-sedating H1-antihistamines, and that benefits of increasing the dose to above the licensed limit may outweigh risks, but we found limited evidence in our included studies to support this approach.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-12 09:04:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-11-12 09:03:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has found limited quality evidence to establish the efficacy of H1-antihistamines compared with placebo in the treatment of CSU. Several antihistamines were found to be superior to placebo at standard (licensed) doses of treatment. Although the quality of evidence for adverse events was low, the direction of effects in most of the analyses suggest that users generally found these medicines tolerable.</P>
<P>Symptomatic relief has been demonstrated to a variable extent with different antihistamines. However, only few studies have assessed their effects on quality of life in urticaria.</P>
<P>On the basis of our data collection and analysis, it is evident that a clear message does not emerge regarding whether one antihistamine is better than another. Given the quality of trials and of their reporting, as well as the wide variation in comparisons and few opportunities to combine results in meta-analyses, we must be guarded in putting forward specific treatment algorithms.</P>
<P>For general use, cetirizine at 10 mg once daily for short- and intermediate-term duration was found to be effective in completely suppressing urticaria. However, three of the four trials that compared this treatment against placebo did have factors that we rated as suggesting high risk of bias. The two trials of loratadine 10 mg once daily versus placebo failed to demonstrate efficacy and were also at some risk of bias. Only two trials compared these two drugs: They failed to show a difference in efficacy, although they were not designed to demonstrate equivalence. Cetirizine and loratadine offer the advantages of being cheap and widely available. It would be reasonable to regard cetirizine as a first-line option.</P>
<P>Some benefit (for complete suppression of urticaria) may be derived from using desloratadine at 5 mg once daily for at least an intermediate term of intervention and 20 mg desloratadine in the short term. Once again, risks of bias in trials of this drug were significant.</P>
<P>Levocetirizine at 5 mg once daily in the intermediate term appears to be effective in achieving complete suppression of CSU. This is based on the results of only three trials. We rated two of these as carrying an unclear risk of bias in every domain, although the third, whilst small, was relatively well conducted and reported. Evidence of benefit from increasing the dose to a ceiling of 20 mg per day is limited. It is common practice to use higher than licensed doses of various H1-antihistamines, at least in Europe, where the guidelines recommend this (<LINK REF="REF-Zuberbier-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuberbier 2012</LINK>). We included very few RCTs that assessed the effects of this and found insufficient evidence to support the practice, especially over longer durations. For clarity, the maximum licensed dose for both cetirizine and loratadine is 10 mg once daily, and for both levocetirizine and desloratadine, 5 mg once daily.</P>
<P>Although we included trials on various other drugs, their data are too sparse to allow firm conclusions about their relative efficacy. Furthermore, very few trials assessed combinations of antihistamines at conventional or higher doses; although such prescribing does occur in clinical practice, we have no basis on which to make recommendations.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-11-12 09:04:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found little research on the use of higher doses of H1-antihistamines, and no included studies continued over longer durations. Very few assessed whether responses were sustained after the intervention was stopped; future work should address these gaps.</P>
<P>Study investigators should provide information about the duration of urticaria for each participant before entry into a trial, as it is conceivable that urticaria that has persisted for many years may be more refractory to treatment than urticaria of only six weeks' duration.</P>
<P>We would welcome trials with two (or more) active treatment arms rather than a placebo that performed comparisons of different doses over longer periods. Although trials including a placebo yield useful data, particularly for new compounds, participants receiving placebo may find little benefit from taking part and seem to be more likely to withdraw or to fail to comply with the medication schedule. This can lead to very high levels of dropout and resulting difficulties in interpretation of study results. Trials should preferably be conducted independently of involvement of pharmaceutical companies.</P>
<P>Many dermatologists recommend higher, unlicensed doses of H1-antihistamines in difficult cases of urticaria. Future studies should address whether this is justified in terms of effectiveness and safety.</P>
<P>In this review, primary outcome scores were variable for several of the trials, making it difficult for review authors to draw direct comparisons. This would be enabled by the use of a standardised outcome score such as the Urticaria Activity Score. This instrument is recommended in the European guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Zuberbier-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuberbier 2012</LINK>) and comprises the sum of 4-point scales (0-3) for number of weals and pruritus over a 24-hour period. In several studies, outcome measures were not clearly defined, and for some measures, it was not clear how improvements in composite scores really correlated with symptomatic relief. For example, level of pruritus is likely to be of far greater importance to an individual with urticaria than the size of the largest weal.</P>
<P>In terms of reporting of results, we find that it is more meaningful to the clinician and to the participant if outcomes can be related to numbers of individuals who achieve a particular response. For example, five out of 10 of those with CSU will attain complete symptom relief, and a further three will experience greater than 50% improvement, rather than a particular drug will, on average, lead to a 3-point reduction in total symptoms score. The latter approach is often accompanied by a P value &lt; 0.05, but clinical significance and the spread of responses may be less clear: Was there some improvement for all participants, or were complete responses noted for a few and no response for others? We favour clear outcomes such as number of participants achieving complete suppression of urticaria, or 75% reduction in itch severity (which could be equated with a good response).</P>
<P>Wider use of standardised and validated quality of life (QoL) scores for trial participants diagnosed with this often disabling condition would provide measurable data to aid treatment decisions. For example, QoL scores would help investigators to monitor change in dosage or drug, or cessation of therapy.</P>
<P>Virtually no long-term studies have looked at treatment and outcomes over much longer periods of time. Longer-term studies should be designed, so that the extent of relief from symptoms from participants' perspective (symptoms, quality of life) and safety and efficacy should be included in the design of such studies. We do recognise that long-term studies may be difficult to perform for reasons including expense and attrition, with fewer participants remaining in the study over long periods of time.</P>

<P>We now use the term <I>chronic spontaneous urticaria</I>.</P>
<P>We changed the wording of the 'Types of participants' criteria to clarify that we mean angio-oedema without weals rather than angio-oedema without urticaria, as the latter uses the term &#8216;urticaria&#8217; as a descriptor rather than a disease. We used 'autoinflammatory syndrome' rather than &#8216;associated abnormalities,&#8217; as Muckle-Wells and Schnitzler's syndrome are not urticaria.</P>
<P>We clarified that we have included any first-generation ('sedating') or second-generation ('non-sedating') H1-antihistamines at any dose (including topical interventions and H2RAs given concomitantly) given as single therapy or as combination therapy. Comparators consisted of no treatment, that is, placebo, or another active (pharmacological) compound. We included studies that compared the same drug but at different doses, but we excluded non-pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture.</P>
<P>We collected additional data from the reports of studies, such as country and setting, to obtain further information about clinical heterogeneity between our included studies.</P>
<P>We did not carry out subgroup analyses on the basis of first-generation ('sedating') and second-generation ('non-sedating') antihistamines, as included studies with relevant outcome data were too few to allow meaningful comparisons.</P>
<P>We clarified that duration of intervention is categorised as follows: up to two weeks (short-term) and longer than two weeks up to three months (intermediate-term). Our analyses are now subgrouped by duration of intervention, as we are not looking for a cure but would like to identify which antihistamine will suppress or give good or excellent response for urticaria immediately and over the longest time.</P>
<P>We excluded studies that investigated the effects of astemizole or terfenadine (withdrawn from use).</P>
<P>We described moderate statistical heterogeneity as &gt; 50% in the protocol, but we revised this in the full review to moderate heterogeneity at I² &gt; 60%.</P>
<P>For some comparisons, we used Fisher's exact test because of the small number of participants,</P>
<P>We had stated that we would use funnel plots when at least three studies were included in the meta-analysis, but the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> recommends a minimum of 10 studies for sufficient power.</P>
<P>We included in our methods section updated information about assessment of risk of bias using the 'Risk of bias' tool of The Cochrane Collaboration, and details about how we dealt with cross-over trials are provided in the <LINK TAG="UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Unit of analysis issues</LINK> section.</P>

Daily UAS is the average of morning and evening scores. Final week by definition was the terminal week. It was the last week that participants stayed for the treatment period</LI>

<P>However, if participants dropped out, they were replaced with new participants (14 did not take the medication, 35 did not return for assessment, 37 did not take the correct medication. All of these participants were replaced). As participants who dropped out were replaced with new participants, it is unclear whether the trial design is truly randomised; it is not clear whether new participants were randomly assigned de novo or were assigned to the group of the most recent dropout. The trial report states: "since the randomisation was performed on groups of 3, it was actually necessary for each loss of a patient [to result in resumed] treatment of three patients" (page 182) </P>
