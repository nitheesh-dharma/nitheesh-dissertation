Having read the reviewers' comments, I think there are a couple areas where a small tweak may bring even greater clarity could be added to the review. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. There is a slight discrepancy between the methods in the abstract and in the main text in terms of the duration of the education intervention (up to 1 hour in the abstract and just 'short' in the methods). I would be helpful if this could be addressed so they match up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. It would be useful to clarify in the methods the purpose of allowing a short education session/minimal ongoing support alongside the AP; I assume (from my own practice) it is because it is almost impossible to give a patient an action plan without spending at least a small amount of time explaining it/providing the necessary education, but you want to exclude studies that had a substantial or ongoing educational/case management component? This makes good sense to me, as you are largely trying to explore the effects of the AP rather than more comprehensive COPD case management/self-management education, but could you perhaps expand on this slightly in the methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. I've added the words &amp;quot;written or oral&amp;quot; when you are describing the action plans in the types of intervention section, just to clarify that both were allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. The peer reviewers consistently mentioned that they were concerned about the MAs and subgroups being based on a small number of trials; while I disagree with one of the peers that this means the outcomes can't be given a high GRADE rating, perhaps it is worth briefly addressing this limitation, particularly with regard to subgroup analyses, in the overall applicability section?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. In the comparisons with other studies section, was the low baseline risk NNTB for hospital admissions from Zwerink 2014 chosen for a reason? (they also present a NNTB for high baseline risk). Did you feel this was more comparable to the baseline risk in your included studies? Might be worth mentioning it was for low baseline risk when reporting it in the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Still to be addressed, perhaps alongside peer review?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;- CJC second stats check July 14th. Looks very good but graph labels still need to say &amp;quot;Favours ......&amp;quot; consistently in the x axis for the Forest plots. This needs to be corrected before copy editing. Corrected.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;- JRT: Contribution of authors section should be expanded to say what R Wood-Baker for this update. Corrected.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;- RN comments 20/07/16: (sign-off editor) - This is a great update, really clear and well written. Just picked up a few really small issues that can be addressed alongside peer review comments: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract: &lt;/b&gt;Main results: &amp;quot;There was no significant difference in all cause mortality during 12 months [OR 0.88, CI 0.59 to 1.31]&amp;quot; - think this needs re-wording to reflect uncertainty (i.e. potentially nearly halving odds of death to almost one-third increase). Corrected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract: &lt;/b&gt;Conclusions: Similarly for conclusions of abstract: &amp;quot;Use of COPD action plans in this context does not increase or decrease mortality.&amp;quot; - I would suggest needs slightly re-wording as above. Corrected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLS:&lt;/b&gt; Key results: &amp;quot;Giving people an action plan made no difference to their chance of dying from any cause over a year.&amp;quot; - as above Corrected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background:&lt;/b&gt; description of the condition: I don't think the meaning of this sentence is entirely clear: &amp;quot;The prevalence of COPD is predicted to increase due to the &lt;i&gt;continued incidence&lt;/i&gt; of smoking..&amp;quot; I wonder if it would benefit from slight re-wording? Corrected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; measures of treatment effect: There's a reference to Deeks 2004 but it's not hyper-linked and I couldn't find the reference in order to link it - perhaps it got removed in this update? Corrected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; assessment of reporting bias: &amp;quot;We visually inspected funnel plots when 10 or more studies contributed to analysis for an outcome.&amp;quot; - as there were only 7 included studies, I assume this was not possible? I've tweaked it to &amp;quot;We &lt;i&gt;planned to&lt;/i&gt; visually inspected funnel plots &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; 10 or more studies contributed to analysis for an outcome.&amp;quot; - is that OK? Thankyou for your change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prednisone vs prednisolone&lt;/b&gt;: both appear in the review. We don't mind which you go for, but probably better to stick with one or the other? Corrected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; effects of intervention: health care utilisation: In some places where a difference was detected you have not started the direction of the effect but in others you have. For clarity and consistency I have added this for you - I hope this is OK? (Analysis 1.7, 1.10, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17) Thankyou.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; effects of intervention: mortality: I have a note about imprecision to the description of analyses 1.18, 1.19 and 1.20, just to highlight the fact that a difference has not been ruled out (i.e. this CIs are not sufficiently tight around no effect) - is this OK? Thankyou.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: effects of intervention: Use of medications for acute exacerbations of COPD: as above, I have indicated the direction of the effect for analyses 1.21, 1.22, 1.25, 1.26, 1.27 and 1.29.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; effects intervention: secondary outcomes: I have added the direction on effect for analyses 1.30. Thankyou.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results: &lt;/b&gt;COPD self management exacerbation related self-efficacy: Kolbe 1996 is referenced but not hyper-linked and I could not find a reference in order to link it - again, perhaps it got removed during the updating? Corrected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results: &lt;/b&gt;cost effectiveness: I added the direction of effect to analysis 1.60 Thankyou.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion:&lt;/b&gt; where mortality is described in the summary of main results section I have added the words &amp;quot;but the confidence intervals do not rule out important benefit or harm of the intervention&amp;quot; - is this OK? Thankyou.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion:&lt;/b&gt; quality of evidence: Mortality was still described as high quality, despite being changed to moderate in the SOF due to imprecision; I have changed this and added a note about the result being imprecise. Thankyou.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB: I did not used tracked changes as I thought this would look a bit odd/messy for the peer referees - we can easily create a compared PDF to show you exactly where the changes have been made - please do let us know if you would like this. Also, if you disagree with anything I've done, please do flag it up for me to change back - I certainly don't want to create extra work for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please consider all points below and respond to say how you chose to address the comment, or, if you chose not to do so, please explain your reasons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT comments:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;- &lt;/b&gt;I have revised the 'What's new' section, please check you are happy with the content. The 'update' line should include any things that were revised, and the 'conclusions changed' section should outline any conclusions reported, you may also note where they differ from the last publication of this review-Authors reply Deleted &amp;#8220;education up to one hour&amp;#8221; as this was permitted in the last review. Reworded allowance for action plan directed case manager support. Mentioned subgroup analysis and changes to outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: Changes made, looks OK I think&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I think it would be valuable to add one sentence to the conclusions noting that there have been a change to conclusions, perhaps noting the difference if it's practical in a short way to do this. This is so that previous readers of the review can easily pick up any impact this may have on their practice, and perhaps also assist people creating guidelines on what changes they may need to consider making?-Authors reply Made changes in Rev Man under conclusions (implications for practice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: Yes, I think this is better - uncertain if it should also say something similar in the abstract - Sign-off to check?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Please have another look at the Plain language summary headings, the following are the ones recommended by the Consumer group: Background, Study Characteristics, Key Results, Quality of the Evidence, Conclusions.-Authors reply Added the headings above, and edited PLS. Mainly added short conclusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: Yes, that's fine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Please note I have included the current publication for reference for the author also where you make note of it under 'Why it is important to do this review'-Authors reply No action needed. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: OK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- With regards authors and citation, you may wish to consider moving former authors to acknowledgements and removing them from the byline?-Authors reply We acknowledge the contribution of the original author of the review A Turnock in 2005. OTHER AUTHORS ARE ALL ACTIVE IN THIS UPDATE &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: OK, good to know, but this should also be reflected in 'Contributions of authors' for R Wood-Baker - I have re-added deleted '&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Turnock: Original review author in 2005.'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Check under 'Data synthesis', are you missing a seventh bullet point? -Authors replyDivided &amp;#8220;use of oral corticosteroids and antibiotics&amp;#8221; into two bullet points to make seven points. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: OK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Under 'Results of search', I think the last update was in 2010 according to the Cochrane Library, not 2009? Just check and confirm either way, if it was 2010, this sentence should be changed: 'In 2009, two studies were included (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Martin 2004&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Martin 2004&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Rootmensen 2008&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Rootmensen 2008&lt;/a&gt;)'-Authors reply The previous article state that studies were assessed from a search in 2009 but review published in 2010- changed. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: OK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- In Results/included studies, I have added a sentence clarifying the additional data added to the review.-Authors reply No action required. See Rev Man &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: OK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- In the Discussion section, perhaps under 'Agreements and disagreements with other reviews' it could be valuable to note the differences found in this update by comparison to the review published in 2010?-Authors reply Added changes in rev Man &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: Yes, that's great&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Again within the review conclusion, please include one sentence which identifies the differences between this review and the one published in 2010. -Authors reply Added changes in Rev Man under conclusions, implications for practice &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;: JRT: Great!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Overall the update looks very thorough, great work!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC stats check 24/3/2016&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;please see word document&lt;/b&gt;. Graph labels need to be checked please (not all say Favours Action plan etc.) This is a great update, thank you.-Authors reply See responses in Word document&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CJC contact editor comments: &lt;b&gt;Please revisit GRADE ratings&lt;/b&gt; (see my note in the SoF table) and then revise the abstract and text accordingly. We do not know if mortality is increased or decreased so &lt;b&gt;please reword the abstract to reflect this uncertainty&lt;/b&gt; (see yellow highlights in abstract).-Authors reply GRADE ratings for Hospitalizations for COPD /100 patient years (Action Plan +phone follow up andMortality (all cause) revised to MODERATE in SOF , Discusion and Conclusions, and abstract&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly the subjective outcomes are at high risk of bias (not unclear) in the studies where there was not an active control (this is because the patients themselves assess their quality of life in response to questions)! &lt;b&gt;Please revisit risks of bias table for subjective outcomes. &lt;/b&gt;-Authors reply&lt;b&gt; Martin McGeoch, Watson, Woodbaker&lt;/b&gt; ROB for lack of blinding participants subjective outcomes graded HIGH. This may not alter the downgrading though as it has been taken into account in the SoF tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: Chris notes some further final changes at top of this yellow note which should be made alongside addressing any PR comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liz notes 11/03/2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PRISMA diagram contains numbers for the 2014 searches - but not for the searches you ran in 2015 - please can you update the figure to include the results from your 2015 searches done&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: Details now added!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The date limits in your additional search strategies are for 2014.

H. Hamd, et al. (2011). &amp;quot;Effects of written action plan adherence on COPD exacerbation recovery.&amp;quot; Thorax 66(1): 26-31.&lt;br&gt;Background: The effects of written action plans on recovery from exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have not been well studied. The aims of this study were to assess the effects of adherence to a written action plan on exacerbation recovery time and unscheduled healthcare utilisation and to explore factors associated with action plan adherence. Methods: This was a 1-year prospective cohort study embedded in a randomised controlled trial. Exacerbation data were recorded for 252 patients with COPD who received a written action plan for prompt treatment of exacerbations with the instructions to initiate standing prescriptions for both antibiotics and prednisone within 3 days of exacerbation onset. Following the instructions was defined as adherence to the action plan. Results: From the 288 exacerbations reported by 143 patients, start dates of antibiotics or prednisone were provided in 217 exacerbations reported by 119 patients (53.8% male, mean age 65.4 years, post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 43.9% predicted). In 40.1% of exacerbations, patients adhered to their written action plan. Adherence reduced exacerbation recovery time with statistical (p=0.0001) and clinical (-5.8 days) significance, but did not affect unscheduled healthcare utilisation (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.83). Factors associated with an increased likelihood of adherence were influenza vaccination, cardiac comorbidity, younger age and lower FEV1as percentage predicted. Conclusions: This study shows that adherence to a written action plan is associated with a reduction in exacerbation recovery time by prompt treatment. Knowing the factors that are associated with proper and prompt utilisation of an action plan permits healthcare professionals to better focus their self-management support on appropriate patients&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;30/08/10 Next update include subgroup with phone call support (up to monthly?)

The hospital admission outcome excludes any useful reduction with action plans, even though it does not reach stastical significance. I leave the wording to you!! SoF tables should also reflect primary outcomes first. This can be followed by the secondary outcomes.&lt;br&gt;Synopsis&lt;br&gt;ACTION: reads well!&lt;br&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Fine. One or two very minor changes made.&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;ACTION: The heterogeneity in ED attendance makes me wonder if the Martin data on ambulance calls should be included here? Why are the rates so much higher than in the Wood-Baker study?&lt;br&gt;Table of included studies&lt;br&gt;ACTION: fine&lt;br&gt;Metaview Labels&lt;br&gt;ACTION: I am puzzled by the SGRQ scores as I thought a higher score meant more symptoms, which means that the labels are the wrong way around? This is the usual convention for SGRQ. &lt;b&gt;This will need sorting out please. I am not sure about SF36 &amp;amp; HADS. Days severely worse must be labelled the wrong way around?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Good summary of the issues.&lt;br&gt;Contentious issues&lt;br&gt;ACTION: &lt;b&gt;Should the title be &amp;quot;Action plans for management of exacerbations of COPD?&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; Is it possible to obtain any data on ICC from Richard's study?&lt;br&gt;Summary of Findings Table&lt;br&gt;ACTION:&lt;b&gt; Could you send me the Grade File so that I can edit the SoF tables please?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Authors' Contribution&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Fine&lt;br&gt;Spellchecked&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Not yet.&lt;br&gt;Next action : &lt;b&gt;Back to authors for response, particularly to comments in bold please.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2009 update&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;24/11/09 Figures checked.

Numbers of subjects in outcome 1.7 re-entered (total was 112 not 56)&lt;br&gt;Discussion rewritten to provide more support that increased medication use represents and appropriate response to an acute exacerbation (as per AP).&lt;br&gt;No details available on subjects who suffer frequent exacerbations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;IMPROVEMENTS SUGGESTED BY PEER REVIEWERS (CJC 14 April)&lt;br&gt;1. Please add detail to the results section of the abstract as indicated in red.&lt;br&gt;2. Please add the point estimates and 95% CI for each outcome in the results section (not just a statement about significance). Not all readers will look at the forest plots.&lt;br&gt;3. Both peer reviewers felt that it was unjustified to extrapolate from increase medication usage to the assumption that this was appropriate. Please either support the appropriateness of the increases or tone down the conclusions to reflect the fact that the increases could have been inappropriate.&lt;br&gt;4. If overall management plans have been shown to be effective this could be reflected in the conclusions: &amp;quot;The lack of evidence to support the role of the action plan in COPD management should not be necessarily seen as the evidence of lack of efficacy. In conclusion, a written action plan without a broader self-management plan cannot be recommended for widespread adoption in primary care.&amp;quot;?? Suggested by one peer reviewer.&lt;br&gt;5. Is it possible to outline how often the participants in the trials suffered exacerbations and admissions. Do you think that action plans could be more useful in those who suffer frequent admission. Do the data allow this to be investigated?&lt;br&gt;Thanks for attending to the above comments,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;=================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing 24 Feb 2005&lt;br&gt;I have used word to compare the text of this version with the previous one.&lt;br&gt;Thanks for clarifying the selection of patients.&lt;br&gt;I had not noticed that McGeoch was unpublished!&lt;br&gt;I have also taken out the totals for single study outcomes in analyses.&lt;br&gt;Do you have a reference for the change of OR to SMD?&lt;br&gt;Thanks for taking out the reporting of non-significant trends.&lt;br&gt;I have altered the final sentence of the discussion as you have not shown that it fails to improve healthcare!&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In conclusion, the results from this review show that action plans provide an approach to the management of acute exacerbations of COPD which increases patients self-efficacy and their use of oral antibiotics and corticosteroids. Unfortunately this has not been shown to result in any significant reduction in the use of healthcare resources, change in the participants physiology or improved clinical outcomes.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;This can go out for peer review - thanks for all the hard work.&lt;br&gt;================================&lt;br&gt;CJC edit 6 Jan 05 (PLEASE SEE RED TEXT WHERE I HAVE MADE CHANGES OR INSERTED COMMENTS]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: fine, but I am not clear what you mean by patients with asthma were excluded. Do you mean that for a trial to be in the review it had to state that patients with asthma were not allowed into the trial, and similarly non-smokers. If so this could be made clearer. It seems (from your descriptions of studies) that McGlone did not exclude asthma, so should this trial be in the review?&lt;br&gt;WE WANT PARTICIPANTS TO BE PRIMARY COPD SUFFERERS SO WHERE REVIEWS INCLUDED MANY OR ALL ASTHMA SUFFERERS THEY WERE EXCLUDED. ALTHOUGH MCGLONE DOESN'T STATE ASTHMA SUFFERERS AS AN EXCLUSION SHE DOES STATE PRIMARY COPD AS THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND IS THUS INCLUDED. FOR SUBJECTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE MCGLONE STUDY THEY HAD TO FULFILL THE ATS CRITERIA FOR COPD, WHICH INCLUDES EXCLUSION OF ASTHMA.&lt;br&gt;SIMILARLY WE WANT PARTICIPANTS TO HAVE SMOKED BUT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE CURRENT SMOKERS. STUDIES WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO'D NEVER SMOKED WERE EXCLUDED. ALL INCLUDED STUDIES HAD INCLUSION CRITERIA OF A NO LESS THAN 10 PACK YEAR HISTORY OF SMOKING AS STATED IN DESCRIPTION OF STUDIES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: missing for first study WE'RE CONFUSED, DO YOU MEAN THE MCGLONE STUDY, WE SEEM TO THINK IT IS THERE AS AN UNPUBLISHED STUDY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine but not sensible to try to use Jadad as below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: fine but see comment in discussion about direction of good and bad effects?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: I would not use Jadad scale for this review but by all means document the components in the included study and carry out sensitivity analysis according to Cochrane quality score or other factors that you think are a serious threat to the internal validity of the studies. I am not sure about the way you are using Log Odds Ratios. Could you explain this? In comparison 1#9 and 1#10 for example this is a dichotomous outcome and should be entered as such. The effect should be an Odds Ratio not a mean difference?&lt;br&gt;AGREE AND HAVE CHANGED. ORIGINALLY WERE ATTEMPTINGTO COMBINE DATA FROM ANOTHER STUDY BUT IT PROVED IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTRACT DATA&lt;br&gt;Results: . It is also not acceptable to report the direction of non-significant outcomes as if this was noteworthy. This lends too much weight to the direction of an effect (which may randomly be either way) when the null hypothesis has not been disproved. Please report either as simply no significant difference was found. If you wish to provide the point estimate and CI that is fine but not with a comment about the direction of the non-significant trend. Please refashion the results. I'VE TAKEN OUT REFERENCES TO TRENDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not usually report the results from single trials (eg knowledge etc) as if they were pooled results, please alter the way this is reported to emphasise that there is no pooled data for these outcomes(section C2). AND HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THE SMI SCORES WERE ONLY LOOKED AT IN THE MCGEOCH STUDY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Again too much weight is given to the trends here and there are described as if they are statistically significant but small in size. This is not fair reporting of the data and needs to be removed. REWRITTEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Mx plans as part of a bigger package.? Is the control in Mcglone really usual care? Absolute in Watson and change from baseline in McGlone (could lead to publication bias)? CONTROL IS RECOMMENDED CARE IN AUSTRALIA, CANNOT COMMENT IF THIS LEVEL OF CARE IS ACHIEVED ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledgements: please expand to say what the individuals actually did. DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflict of interest: should include that fact that one reviewer was involved in an included study please. DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: Toby please send to Liz to review the search strategy and date of last search. It would be most helpful to know if the GIV analyses have been checked by a statistician. Do the CIs match with those from the published papers? How were the Odds ratios turned into mean differences (see above). For the unpublished paper I cannot cross check the results. GIV ANALYSES HAVE NOT BEEN CHECKED.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-12-11 08:01:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reviewed evidence on the effect of action plans for exacerbations in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We found seven relevant studies. Evidence gathered in this review is current to November 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease of the airways that is commonly caused by smoking. People with COPD often experience worsening of symptoms, known as an &#8220;exacerbation&#8221;, for which they need extra treatment and sometimes a stay in hospital. An action plan is a written or spoken guide that is given, with brief education, to people with COPD to help them recognise symptoms of an exacerbation and start taking extra treatment earlier. Individuals may keep extra medicines at home or may receive a prescription to take to a pharmacist. Sometimes a health professional will make regular phone calls to help patients use the action plan. We conducted this review to find out if having an action plan for COPD exacerbations improves health and reduces hospital visits.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics </B>
</P>
<P>We found seven relevant studies of 1550 people with COPD. We did not include studies that gave other treatments, such as an exercise programme or longer educational sessions, along with an action plan. People in three studies had ongoing support to help them use the action plan. People in the included studies had moderate to severe symptoms and were followed up for six or 12 months.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>People with COPD who are given an action plan have fewer emergency department visits and hospital stays related to breathing problems over a year. We calculated that for every 19 people given an action plan, one person would avoid a hospital stay for an exacerbation.</P>
<P>People with an action plan took more corticosteroid and antibiotic medicines for exacerbations - on average just under one more course of corticosteroids and two more courses of antibiotics over a year.</P>
<P>Some studies showed that giving people an action plan improved their ability to recognise and self-start treatment for worsening COPD symptoms.</P>
<P>Giving people an action plan made no difference in their chance of dying from any cause over a year, but this finding showed some variability.</P>
<P>We could not say whether follow-up phone calls added benefit over following an action plan alone.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence in this review is generally independent and reliable, and we are very or moderately certain about the results.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>We believe that people with COPD should be given an individualised action plan with a short educational component so they can benefit from fewer and shorter hospital stays, better understanding of the need to self-start treatment and appropriate use of medication for exacerbations.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-12-13 10:04:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-28 14:18:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major driver of decline in health status and impose high costs on healthcare systems. Action plans offer a form of self-management that can be delivered in the outpatient setting to help individuals recognise and initiate early treatment for exacerbations, thereby reducing their impact.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-11-28 14:18:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To compare effects of an action plan for COPD exacerbations provided with a single short patient education component and without a comprehensive self-management programme versus usual care. Primary outcomes were healthcare utilisation, mortality and medication use. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, psychological morbidity, lung function and cost-effectiveness.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-11-28 14:20:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register along with CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trials registers. Searches are current to November 2015. We handsearched bibliographic lists and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-11-28 14:20:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs comparing use of an action plan versus usual care for patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD. We permitted inclusion of a single short education component that would allow individualisation of action plans according to management needs and symptoms of people with COPD, as well as ongoing support directed at use of the action plan.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-11-28 14:20:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. For meta-analyses, we subgrouped studies via phone call follow-up directed at facilitating use of the action plan.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-13 10:04:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This updated review includes two additional studies (and 976 additional participants), for a total of seven parallel-group RCTs and 1550 participants, 66% of whom were male. Participants' mean age was 68 years and was similar among studies. Airflow obstruction was moderately severe in three studies and severe in four studies; mean post bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) was 54% predicted, and 27% of participants were current smokers. Four studies prepared individualised action plans, one study an oral plan and two studies standard written action plans. All studies provided short educational input on COPD, and two studies supplied ongoing support for action plan use. Follow-up was 12 months in four studies and six months in three studies.</P>
<P>When compared with usual care, an action plan with phone call follow-up significantly reduced the combined rate of hospitalisations and emergency department (ED) visits for COPD over 12 months in one study with 743 participants (rate ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.79; high-quality evidence), but the rate of hospitalisations alone in this study failed to achieve statistical significance (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01; moderate-quality evidence). Over 12 months, action plans significantly decreased the likelihood of hospital admission (odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.97; n = 897; two RCTs; moderate-quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19 (11 to 201)) and the likelihood of an ED visit (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78; n = 897; two RCTs; moderate-quality evidence; NNTB over 12 months 12 (9 to 26)) compared with usual care.</P>
<P>Results showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality during 12 months (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.31; n = 1134; four RCTs; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence interval). Over 12 months, use of oral corticosteroids was increased with action plans compared with usual care (mean difference (MD) 0.74 courses, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.35; n = 200; two RCTs; moderate-quality evidence), and the cumulative prednisolone dose was significantly higher (MD 779.0 mg, 95% CI 533.2 to 10248; n = 743; one RCT; high-quality evidence). Use of antibiotics was greater in the intervention group than in the usual care group (subgrouped by phone call follow-up) over 12 months (MD 2.3 courses, 95% CI 1.8 to 2.7; n = 943; three RCTs; moderate-quality evidence).</P>

<P>Use of COPD exacerbation action plans with a single short educational component along with ongoing support directed at use of the action plan, but without a comprehensive self-management programme, reduces in-hospital healthcare utilisation and increases treatment of COPD exacerbations with corticosteroids and antibiotics. Use of COPD action plans in this context is unlikely to increase or decrease mortality. Whether additional benefit is derived from periodic ongoing support directed at use of an action plan cannot be determined from the results of this review.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-11 08:01:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a systemic, progressive, heterogeneous disease with significant worldwide public health importance. COPD is associated with a chronic innate inflammatory response that results from continuous exposure to inhaled noxious particles (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hogg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogg 2004</LINK>). This inflammatory response may induce destruction of lung parenchyma and may disrupt normal repair and defence mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2016</LINK>). These pathological changes lead to characteristic progressive airflow limitation that is not fully reversible (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>COPD develops from a combination of genetic and environmental factors and is most commonly linked to cigarette smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Halbert-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halbert 2006</LINK>). In addition to cigarette smoking, exposures such as burning of wood and other biomass fuels are important risk factors for some populations (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>COPD is a significant cause of preventable worldwide morbidity and mortality. Estimates have placed COPD as the fourth leading cause of death globally (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). The prevalence of COPD is predicted to increase owing to the persisting incidence of smoking and ageing of the global population (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2016</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that COPD will become the third leading cause of death by 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>). Other estimates have predicted that COPD will become the seventh leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-Mathers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathers 2006</LINK>). In 2010, the economic burden of COPD in the United States was projected to be $49.9 billion, including $29.5 billion in direct healthcare expenditures (<LINK REF="REF-American-Lung-Association-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Lung Association 2014</LINK>). In Australia, it was estimated that in 2008, COPD cost the economy $98 billion AUD (<LINK REF="REF-Access-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Access 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) advises that a postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume of one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio &lt; 0.70 is needed for a diagnosis of COPD (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2016</LINK>). Disease severity can be classified by the degree of airflow limitation, although evidence suggests that this is a poor predictor of many negative features of the disease. Patients with similar airflow limitations have been found to belong to different disease phenotypes and to have marked differences in age, symptoms, comorbidities and predicted mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Agusti-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agusti 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burgel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgel 2010</LINK>). Interest in the potential importance of airway and blood eosinophilia as a predictor of exacerbations and their response to corticosteroids has recently increased (<LINK REF="REF-Bafadhel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bafadhel 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pascoe-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascoe 2015</LINK>), but this has not been taken into account in most clinical studies, such as those included in this review.</P>
<P>The presentation, progression and pathological abnormalities associated with COPD are variable (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2013</LINK>). COPD can result in an array of systemic physical functional limitations including poor musculoskeletal strength and function, poor exercise performance and self-reported functional limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Eisner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisner 2008</LINK>). Patients with COPD often have multiple comorbidities spanning both medical and psychiatric illnesses that can have a significant impact on prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanania-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanania 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rennard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rennard 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another important prognostic factor that is a major problem associated with COPD is the occurrence of exacerbations. The GOLD guidelines define a COPD exacerbation as 'an acute event characterised by a worsening of the patient&#8217;s respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and leads to a change in medication' (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2016</LINK>). Exacerbations are a major driver of decline in health status and health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Chhabra-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chhabra 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2004</LINK>). They are usually managed with increased bronchodilator medication, oral corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2014</LINK>) and antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Vollenweider-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vollenweider 2012</LINK>). People with frequent exacerbations of COPD experience poorer health status, accelerated decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, worsened quality of life and increased hospital admissions and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Halpin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halpin 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vestbo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vestbo 2011</LINK>). COPD exacerbations account for the greatest proportion of the total COPD burden on the healthcare system (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2016</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-01 10:48:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Management of COPD is complex and should involve a multi-disciplinary and multi-modality approach. An action plan is used to encourage early intervention for exacerbations. Action plans provide guidelines detailing self-initiated actions, such as changing medication regimens or visiting a general practitioner (GP) or hospital, to be undertaken in response to alterations in symptoms of COPD suggesting the start of an exacerbation. A healthcare provider or case manager can develop an action plan by using a template and can personalise the plan for individual patients according to their symptoms and ongoing regular management. Templates for action plans are provided online by some lung support groups, and they can be given to patients in primary care at low cost. Sometimes an action plan is accompanied by prescriptions for prednisolone and an oral antibiotic.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-01 10:48:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Action plans include interventions designed to allow patients to recognise and initiate early treatment for exacerbations. The early warning signs of an exacerbation have been found to be fairly consistent and recognisable within individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2006</LINK>). Despite this fact, evidence suggests that patients do not seek medical care for all of the exacerbations that they experience (<LINK REF="REF-Langsetmo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langsetmo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walters-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2012</LINK>). Unreported exacerbations are usually less severe but still impact health status (<LINK REF="REF-Langsetmo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langsetmo 2008</LINK>). Furthermore, some patients may present late for treatment of their exacerbation, and this is associated with slower recovery, worse quality of life and increased healthcare utilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 2004</LINK>). The chronic and progressive nature of COPD underlies the importance of self-management.</P>
<P>Action plans are frequently incorporated into self-management interventions for COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Bourbeau-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourbeau 2009</LINK>). A Cochrane systematic review found that comprehensive self-management interventions improved health-related quality of life and decreased healthcare utilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Zwerink-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwerink 2014</LINK>). In this review, 75% of studies incorporated the use of an action plan, and it was hypothesised that the decreased number of respiratory-related hospitalisations observed in the intervention group may particularly have reflected this (<LINK REF="REF-Zwerink-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwerink 2014</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-11 08:01:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lack of consensus on an operational definition of COPD self-management has been a barrier to the formulation of clear recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Effing-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Effing 2012</LINK>). Heterogeneity among interventions, study populations, follow-up time and outcome measures made it difficult for review authors in two Cochrane systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Kruis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruis 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zwerink-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwerink 2014</LINK>) to determine the most effective form and content of self-management for COPD. Effing et al proposed a conceptual definition of COPD self-management, stated as follows: "A COPD self-management intervention is structured but personalised and often multi-component, with goals of motivating, engaging and supporting the patients to positively adapt their health behaviours and develop skills to better manage their disease" (<LINK REF="REF-Effing-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Effing 2016</LINK>). Development and evaluation of specific self-management interventions is important for application of the definition presented by Effing et al. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Turnock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turnock 2005</LINK>). The aim of this review is to determine the role and effectiveness of an action plan as a self-management intervention provided for patients with COPD without comprehensive self-management education/training.</P>

<P>The intervention consisted of an action plan with a single educational component of short duration. The short educational portion allowed time the clinician needed to personalise the action plan according to individual management needs and symptoms. An action plan is defined as a written or oral guideline that details self-initiated interventions (such as changing medication regimens or visiting a GP or hospital) undertaken in response to alterations in symptoms of COPD (e.g. increased breathlessness, increased amount or purulence of sputum, increased use of a relief inhaler, decreased activity level) (i.e. changes that would suggest commencement of an exacerbation). Investigators permitted ongoing support directed at use of the action plan delivered by telephone or direct contact. We deliberately did not include studies with broader self-management support interventions, such as individual or group education delivered in multiple sessions over a longer period or exercise programmes, irrespective of whether they included an action plan. Researchers compared the active intervention versus 'usual care' delivered by healthcare providers.</P>

<P>This review update includes a total of seven parallel-group RCTs that included 1550 participants with COPD (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Since the last update appeared in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2010</LINK>), review authors have added two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK>) with an additional 976 participants. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rootmensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rootmensen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK>) were randomised at patient level, two (<LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK>) were cluster-randomised at practice level and one (<LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK>) was randomised by the minimisation technique to control for centre and gender. Four studies recruited participants through GPs. <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK> recruited from 54 GPs in 31 practices, and <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK> recruited from 22 GPs in 12 practices. <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK> recruited participants attending two groups of general practices but did not specify the number of GPs involved, and <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK> recruited through a consortium of GPs in one region. <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK> recruited participants from a centralised electronic medical record database of a US Veterans Hospital. <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK> recruited participants through scheduled visits to a respiratory nurse at eight regional hospitals and five general practices.</P>
<P>All participants had received a diagnosis of COPD as a major functionally limiting disease before inclusion. In line with the GOLD criteria for diagnosis of COPD, all participants showed a postbronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC ratio &lt; 0.70. However, <LINK REF="STD-Rootmensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rootmensen 2008</LINK> recruited participants with a diagnosis of COPD or asthma. We included in this review only results for the subgroup of participants with COPD (111 of 191). Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK> were also required to have one or more of the following during the previous year: hospitalisation or ED visit for COPD, long-term home oxygen use or course of systemic corticosteroids for COPD. <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK> recruited participants over the age of 40 who were currently using bronchodilator therapy. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK> were at least 50 years of age. Both <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK> also required FEV<SUB>1</SUB> &lt; 65% predicted. <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK> stated inclusion criteria of symptoms at least weekly and history of one or more exacerbations in the previous 12 months requiring an increase in therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK> required at least one hospital admission or two acute exacerbations of COPD requiring GP care during the previous 12 months. Entry criteria for <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK> included current use of bronchodilator therapy.</P>
<P>Assessment of baseline characteristics of participants (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) shows that studies involved people of similar age, with mean age from 60 to 71 years and overall mean age of 68 years. All studies included more male participants, ranging from 51% to 98% with overall mean of 66%. The high incidence of male participants in <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK> (98%) reflected recruiting from Veterans Affairs medical centres. The percentage of current smokers in each study group varied from 28% (<LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK>) to 12% (<LINK REF="STD-Rootmensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rootmensen 2008</LINK>), with overall mean of 27%. Severity of airflow obstruction, as indicated by the overall mean postbronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> as percentage of predicted value (staged according to the GOLD classification), was moderate in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK> (54% predicted); <LINK REF="STD-Rootmensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rootmensen 2008</LINK> (61% predicted); <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK> (57% predicted)) and severe in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK> (54% predicted); <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK> (54% predicted); <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK> (54% predicted); <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK> (54% predicted)). At baseline, mean impairment scores for overall quality of life when available (in four studies) (based on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire maximum impairment = 100) ranged from 37 to 57, with mean overall score of 46. Within studies, impairment in quality of life was similar between intervention and control groups.</P>
<P>Three studies specified exclusion of nursing home residents (<LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK>). Five studies specified exclusion of participants with other primary limiting diseases such as lung cancer and cardiac disease (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK> also excluded participants with a primary diagnosis of asthma. <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK> excluded participants without access to a telephone.</P>
<P>Study follow-up was six months in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rootmensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rootmensen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK>) and 12 months in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK>). Investigators reported a total of 217 withdrawals from the total 1550 participants enrolled and a drop-out rate ranging from 5% to 27%.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Action plan intervention</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> presents a comparison of action plan interventions. Three studies used a standard written action plan and information booklet (<LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK> used an individualised action plan intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Rootmensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rootmensen 2008</LINK> provided an intervention consisting of additional care that included individual instructions for what to do in case of exacerbations.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK> participants also received an individual educational session with a nurse experienced in managing respiratory disease. Their action plan was a written self-management plan that was developed in consultation with their treating GP. It listed the participant's maintenance medications and an individualised action plan based on early recognition of symptoms associated with exacerbations of COPD. Seventy-six per cent received a standard action plan with instructions to self-initiate a short course of oral corticosteroids and an antibiotic; the other 24% received an action plan with instructions to initiate antibiotics only (N = 10), to double their dose of inhaled corticosteroids and commence an antibiotic (N = 2), to initiate a short course of oral corticosteroids only (N = 1) or to contact their GP (N = 3). Participants following action plans that involved self-initiation of medication were given prescriptions by their GP. All intervention participants were encouraged to present to their GP early.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK>) used action plans that were identical and provided advice on management of usual care and exacerbations, together with a booklet on self-management, a prescription from their GP for prednisolone and a broad-spectrum antibiotic for self-administration during an exacerbation. <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK> made no attempt to individualise instructions in the action plan, whereas the remaining trials (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rootmensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rootmensen 2008</LINK>) delivered self-management plan education in an individual session provided by a nurse, a respiratory educator or the participant's GP.</P>
<P>Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK>) supplied booklets with action plans that covered topics such as smoking cessation, control of breathlessness, nutrition, exercise, clearance of mucus from the lungs, medications and contact details of community support services. Two trials educated participants on the correct use of inhalers (<LINK REF="STD-Rootmensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rootmensen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>, participants attended a single 1 to 1.5-hour group educational session. They received individualised written action plans that included a description of the signs and symptoms of an exacerbation that should prompt initiation of self-treatment, refillable prescriptions for prednisolone and an oral antibiotic, contact information for a case manager and the telephone number of the 24-hour VA help line. Participants were instructed to begin action plan medications for symptoms that were substantially worse than usual. A case manager made monthly phone calls to reinforce general principles of COPD management, to review details of the action plan and to answer questions.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK>, participants attended an individual educational session with a respiratory nurse, who systematically checked and discussed aspects of COPD care such as vaccination, optimisation of medication, inhalation techniques, exercise, nutritional aspects, smoking (cessation) and exacerbation management. Participants received an individualised action plan that included recognition of symptom changes, use of medication/lifestyle prescriptions, additional medication/breathing exercises and energy preservation in case of symptom increase and a contact person/telephone number in case of an exacerbation. For individual participants, it was optional for the case manager (in consultation with the attending physician) to provide self-treatment medication (course of corticosteroids and/or antibiotics). Two standardised reinforcement sessions were held by telephone at one and four months to evaluate participants' understanding of and adherence to the action plan; when needed, researchers provided additional information.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Control</HEADING>
<P>Investigators provided all control groups with usual care; although this varied between studies, participants were always specifically denied access to the action plan. <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK> provided usual care that included provision of a booklet and an individual nurse educational session. <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK> provided non-standardised education based on routine practice at the time. The remaining three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rootmensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rootmensen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK>) supplied no additional education for participants in control groups. <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK> distributed to usual care participants a one-page handout containing a summary of principles of COPD care based on published guidelines. In <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK>, a nurse case manager assessed participants and systematically checked and discussed aspects of COPD care such as vaccination, optimisation of medication, inhalation techniques, exercise, nutritional aspects, smoking (cessation) and exacerbation management. Participants had no additional contact with the case manager.</P>

<P>We assessed three studies as having low risk of bias for blinding of participants; two utilised a modified consent procedure by which the major objective of the study was withheld from participants until after the study was completed (<LINK REF="STD-Rootmensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rootmensen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK>), and in <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>, participants were aware of their allocation, but this awareness was not thought likely to affect primary healthcare utilisation outcomes. Regarding patient-reported outcomes, we assessed those from <LINK REF="STD-Rootmensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rootmensen 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK> as low risk because investigators used a modified consent procedure, and those from <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK> as unclear risk. We assessed four studies as having unclear risk of bias with regards to participants, as they were not blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK>); this introduced the potential for bias in self-administered patient assessments, such as quality of life measures and daily diary records. In some practices in <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>, GPs may have implemented both intervention and usual care, leading to possible confounding between treatment methods. <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK> did not blind outcome assessors, suggesting potential for high bias for subjective outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK> adequately blinded assessors.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-11 08:01:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review update summarises the effects of an action plan (defined as a guideline detailing self-initiated actions such as changing medication regimens or visiting a general practitioner (GP) or hospital, to be undertaken in response to alterations in symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suggesting the start of an exacerbation) with an accompanying educational component of short duration only (up to one hour) versus usual clinical care in COPD. Seven relevant randomised studies contributed to the comparison of action plan versus usual care for exacerbations of COPD. We included studies that provided ongoing support directed at use of the action plan, and we excluded studies with broader self-management interventions.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome of healthcare utilisation for exacerbations, evidence shows benefit over 12 months, with fewer hospitalisations and emergency department (ED) visits for COPD in a large study (n = 743) of action plans with phone support (rate ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.79, moderate-quality evidence (GRADE)) and decreased likelihood of hospital admission in two studies (n = 897) (odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.97, moderate-quality evidence (GRADE)). Thus over 12 months in studies in which participants had relatively low baseline risk, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) derived by avoiding hospitalisation for an exacerbation was 19 (95% CI 11 to 201).</P>
<P>Over the same follow-up period, we found benefit for ED visits alone for COPD, with fewer ED visits for COPD in a large study (n = 743) of action plans with phone support (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.73, high-quality evidence (GRADE)) and less likelihood of an ED visit for COPD in two studies (n = 897) (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78, moderate-quality evidence (GRADE)). Over 12 months, the NNTB required to avoid an ED visit for an exacerbation was 12 (95% CI 9 to 26). However, two studies (n = 201) that used action plans alone reported no significant reduction in the rate of ED visits for COPD (MD 0.37, 95% CI -0.50 to 1.24, very low-quality evidence (GRADE)). For hospital admissions alone, one study (n = 743) of action plans with phone support reported no significant benefit (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01, moderate-quality evidence (GRADE)). Fewer hospital admissions and ED visits for COPD translated into lower costs for the action plan intervention.</P>
<P>Four studies (n = 1134) found no significant change in all-cause mortality over 12 months for action plan use, with or without phone support (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.31, moderate-quality evidence (GRADE)), but confidence intervals do not rule out important benefit or harm associated with the intervention.</P>
<P>Clear evidence indicates that action plans increased treatment for exacerbations of COPD over 12-month follow-up. Two studies (n = 200) reported an increase in courses of oral corticosteroids (MD 0.74, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.35, moderate-quality evidence (GRADE)), and one study (n = 743) reported an increase in the cumulative dose of oral corticosteroids with phone support for action plan use (779.0 mg prednisolone, 95% CI 533.2 to 1024.8, high-quality evidence (GRADE)). Three studies (n = 943) reported a significant increase in courses of antibiotics (MD 2.26, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.70, moderate-quality evidence (GRADE)).</P>
<P>Studies have shown statistically significant benefit for respiratory-related quality of life with action plan use over 12 months. Using St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) overall score, three studies (n = 1009) reported that the score was 2.8 units lower - from 0.8 lower to 4.8 lower (moderate-quality evidence (GRADE)). The confidence interval includes the minimum clinically important difference of 4 units. The review found no clear evidence of benefit for psychological morbidity in depression or anxiety as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in a single study over 12 months (low-quality evidence (GRADE)).</P>
<P>Evidence also shows a positive effect on knowledge of appropriate self-management for exacerbations in three studies that used different measurement instruments. We found clear evidence that action plans with limited education improved recognition and actions for appropriate self-management during early stages and in severe exacerbations and led to increased self-efficacy for exacerbation prevention and actions.</P>

For the likelihood of at least one hospital admission in 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), in one study without ongoing support (OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.31 to 3.03) and in one study with ongoing phone support (OR 0.66, 95%CI 0.46 to 0.95), results showed no heterogeneity between subgroup results (Chi = 0.39, df = 1, P = 0.53, I = 0%). In the same studies, for the likelihood of at least one ED visit in 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>), the study without ongoing support (OR 0.64, 95%CI 0.25 to 1.66) and the study with phone support (OR 0.53, 95%CI 0.36 to 0.78) showed no heterogeneity between subgroups (Chi = 0.13, df = 1, P = 0.72, I = 0%).</P>
<P>For all-cause mortality over 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>), three studies without ongoing support (OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.79) and one study with ongoing phone support (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.14) showed moderate heterogeneity between subgroup results (Chi = 5.17, df = 3, P = 0.16, I = 42%); however, results of the test for subgroup differences were not statistically significant (Chi = 3.03, df = 1, P = 0.08, I = 67.0%).</P>
<P>For use of medication for exacerbations, only one outcome permitted subgroup analysis. For courses of antibiotics over 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.27" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.27</LINK>), in two studies with no ongoing support (MD 0.78, 95% CI -0.24 to 1.79) and in one study with phone support (MD 2.60, 95% CI 2.12 to 3.08), pooled analysis showed substantial heterogeneity (Chi = 10.55, df = 2, P = 0.005, I = 81%), and results of the test for subgroup differences were significant (Chi = 10.09, df = 1, P = 0.001, I = 90.1%)<BR/>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-11 08:01:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our searches for this review are current to November 2015, and review results are based on seven studies that included 1550 symptomatic participants with COPD, with fairly typical characteristics of the COPD population at higher risk of exacerbation. In four studies, participants' mean forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) was &lt; 50% predicted, and in three studies &lt; 60% predicted. Three studies required a history of exacerbations in the past year (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>). Two studies excluded participants receiving home oxygen therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>), and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK>) excluded those receiving long-term oral steroid therapy. Study recruitment was community based, and participants had varying numbers of comorbidities. The results of meta-analyses, including those for healthcare utilisation, hospital admissions and ED presentations, are based on small numbers of studies with similar follow-up periods, and the included studies have a relatively low baseline risk for hospital admissions. The applicability of findings to populations with high baseline risk is not known.</P>
<P>As shown in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, the format of the intervention had common elements in the self-management action plan: early recognition of exacerbations based on symptoms, appropriate self-initiated interventions and directions to seek medical care. Self-management education was limited to a single short session, and so the intervention excluded multi-faceted self-management support programmes. Available information from three studies showed that the length of educational input was 45 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Rootmensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rootmensen 2008</LINK>), 60 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>) and 60 to 90 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>). This update included support for implementing the action plan provided up to monthly by direct contact or by phone call. We made this change to reflect clinical practice in which action plans may be delivered in the outpatient setting with some form of ongoing support. <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK> included support for action plan use. For combined hospital admissions or ED visits, <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK> reported a rate ratio of 0.78 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.74; P = 0.53) for participants receiving four to eight calls versus zero to three calls. The rate for participants with nine or more calls versus zero to three calls showed a significant reduction with increased phone contacts (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; P = 0.04).</P>
<P>With the addition of new studies, this update has shown greater benefit for patient outcomes in addition to improvement in knowledge and understanding of appropriate actions in the event of an exacerbation. Analysis of mortality data was possible only for all-cause mortality, as no data were available for respiratory-related mortality. Studies reported few adverse effects data despite increased use of oral corticosteroids in the action plan group. In <LINK REF="REF-Walters-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2014</LINK>, an adverse drug reaction was significantly more likely with corticosteroid treatment of acute exacerbations than with placebo (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.60 to 3.40), and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) was 6 (95% CI 4 to 10). Hyperglycaemia was the most common adverse event (OR 4.95, 95% CI 2.47 to 9.91). Data on patient-reported outcomes are few; this review shows benefit for overall respiratory-related quality of life, but use of different instruments or follow-up periods precluded meta-analyses for generic quality of life and psychological morbidity.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-12-01 11:09:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Among primary outcomes, this review update, which incorporates two new studies conducted since 2009, shows evidence of benefit for measures of healthcare utilisation of varying strength, generally high or moderate quality of effects on hospital admissions and ED visits when based on greater numbers of studies or on studies with large sample sizes and lower quality when based on smaller studies conducted earlier (before 2004). Review authors downgraded the result for mortality to moderate quality owing to imprecision. We graded the clear benefit derived from greater use of treatment for acute exacerbations as moderate (courses of oral corticosteroids) or high (cumulative doses of oral corticosteroids), and as moderate for courses of antibiotics. For patient-reported outcomes, we graded respiratory-related quality of life improvement as showing moderate quality; although health-related quality of life was improved, the mean effect size was small, so this may not be clinically important for most patients. We graded the quality of evidence for the psychological domain of depression as low and noted no significant differences.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-12-01 11:10:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Confounding may be present in studies based in primary care through self-selection of general practitioners (GPs) with an interest in COPD (<LINK REF="STD-Watson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1997</LINK>), who might be more likely to treat COPD exacerbations with antibiotics or prednisolone in the absence of an action plan. However, in studies that used cluster-randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK>) this was less likely. <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK> did not account for the effect of clustering. In the meta-analysis, review authors included available group mean results for individual participants, potentially leading to overestimation of effect. Review authors other than the study author extracted and entered all data from <LINK REF="STD-Wood_x002d_Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wood-Baker 2006</LINK>. Review authors who were not trialists in a study made decisions on downgrades for Summary of findings tables. <LINK REF="STD-McGeoch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGeoch 2004</LINK> reported methods of analysis that accounted for clustering.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-01 11:10:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As the primary objective of this review is to examine the specific effects of a self-management action plan for exacerbations of COPD, we restricted included studies to those that excluded broad self-management training and education, often delivered in a group format, and sometimes as part of a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. In clinical practice in some settings, an action plan may include some form of ongoing support for action plan use, often provided during case management for outpatients or those receiving primary care. For this reason, we decided that this update should include studies with up to monthly ongoing support limited to use of the action plan. We prespecified this change to the inclusion criteria of the old review (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2010</LINK>) in the updated protocol. Subgroup analysis indicates possibly greater effect for such regular phone support.</P>
<P>In comparison with the previous version of this review, moderate-quality evidence now suggests benefit in healthcare utilisation for COPD action plans. This development is largely due to inclusion of two new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK>) that featured ongoing support for action plan use and contributed an additional 976 participants to the pooled analysis.</P>
<P>Other systematic reviews looked at effects of self-management interventions provided with or without action plans (protocol published (<LINK REF="REF-Zwerink-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwerink 2014</LINK>)), and examined action plans that form part of a broad self-management educational programme (<LINK REF="REF-Lenferink-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenferink 2015</LINK>) or comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation programme (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2015</LINK>). In <LINK REF="REF-Zwerink-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwerink 2014</LINK>, 74% of studies (n = 23) included an action plan as part of the self-management intervention. Similar to our review, <LINK REF="REF-Zwerink-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwerink 2014</LINK> found a reduction in the likelihood of respiratory-related hospitalisation (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75) in nine studies reported similar benefit in number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) in a population at low baseline risk of avoiding hospital admission (20, 95% CI 15 to 35). It was not possible to create subgroups of at least three studies that did not use an action plan in the intervention; thus review authors for <LINK REF="REF-Zwerink-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwerink 2014</LINK> performed no subgroup analyses. The benefit achieved by an action plan with a short patient education component is thus comparable with that achieved by more comprehensive educational programmes and self-management programmes. A review of pulmonary rehabilitation programmes, in which subgroups compared 'exercise only&#8217; trials (n = 31 trials) and &#8217;exercise plus more comprehensive components&#8217; trials (n = 34), noted no significant differences in effects on respiratory-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2015</LINK>). The lack of effect on mortality reported in this review is similar to the finding of no effect on mortality in the review of self-management education (<LINK REF="REF-Zwerink-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwerink 2014</LINK>), which did not include data from <LINK REF="STD-Fan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fan 2012</LINK> on a comprehensive care management programme that included action plans. Investigators in <LINK REF="STD-Fan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fan 2012</LINK> stopped the study prematurely because a higher number of deaths in the intervention group versus the control group could not be explained satisfactorily by study authors.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-12-01 11:10:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review features new evidence that use of action plans for management of COPD exacerbations, with a single brief COPD educational component and without comprehensive self-management support, can reduce hospital-based healthcare utilisation. New evidence also supports use of action plans for increasing self-efficacy in exacerbation management and for increasing appropriate treatment of COPD exacerbations with corticosteroids and antibiotics. Use of COPD action plans in this context does not increase mortality.</P>
<P>This review update features changes to inclusion criteria that allowed ongoing support limited to delivery of the action plan up to monthly. The review includes two new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Trappenburg 2011</LINK>), both featuring support for action plan use and contributing significant weight to beneficial effects.</P>
<P>The incidence of exacerbations of COPD is high (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Reilly-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Reilly 2006</LINK>), so this review suggests that considerable benefit may result from routine use of action plans with a brief patient education component and with ongoing support for action plan use among individuals with COPD in primary care. Whether additional benefit may be derived from periodic ongoing support for use of an action plan cannot be determined from the results of this review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-01 11:10:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research should be conducted to assess whether added benefit in decreasing the impact of COPD exacerbations can result when support for action plans that provide only brief education is optimally delivered. Investigators could also evaluate the utility of action plans that provide brief COPD education at the time of hospital admission for COPD exacerbations.</P>

<P>In planning this 2016 update, before searches were run, the review author team made changes to the protocol. We prespecified inclusion criteria to permit limited support directed only at use of the action plan (up to monthly). We also prespecified that subgroup analysis would be performed by comparing studies with and without this limited ongoing support.</P>
<P>We made changes to the outcomes; we prespecified these changes before commencing the update on the basis of consensus reached by two review authors (MH, JW) on which outcomes were clinically important.

<B>Intervention</B>: A generic care plan was developed by a group comprising a general practitioner, a community-based respiratory nurse, a respiratory physician, an emergency department consultant, the local St John's Ambulance paramedical staff director and the after hours GP service director. This results in 5 separate sections within the plan with specific instructions for patient and/or career, GP and/or community nurse, ambulance service, and emergency department and medical staff of Dunedin Hospital. Although sections showed significant overlap, it was recognised that the language and content of each section had to be appropriate for different users of the plan. Thereafter, the care plan was individualised and was 'signed off' for each participant allocated to the intervention group. This was done on the basis of an interview between participant and respiratory nurse (FRS), a review of hospital notes in relation to previous admissions by the respiratory specialist (DRT) and a review by the participant's own GP.</P>

<P>Sample size calculation was based on the assumption that about 10 patients would be recruited for each surgery, and that no additional between-participant variation would be due to clustered-randomisation of surgeries. Analysisof the 12-month change in outcome variables was based on a mixed-model repeated measures ANOVA. This analysis enabled estimation of any additional variation in outcome measures as a consequence of clustered-randomisation of surgeries rather than individuals. Analyses of outcome variables showed no additional variation from this source beyond that anticipated by between-participant variation. Analysis of the 12-month change in outcome variables was based on a mixed-model repeated measures ANOVA. This analysis enabled estimation of any additional variation in outcome measures as a consequence of clustered-randomisation of surgeries rather than individuals. Analyses of outcome variables showed no additional variation from this source beyond that anticipated by between-participant variation. For this reason, all analyses were based on use of participants as replicates. When baseline differences in outcome measures were evident, ANCOVA for repeated measures was used to test the relative effects of treatments.</P>
