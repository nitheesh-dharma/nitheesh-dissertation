<P>When a pregnant woman uses opiate medications (for example, pethidine, morphine and similar drugs) for pain relief in labour her newborn baby's breathing or heart rate may be depressed. Naloxone, a drug that counters the effects of opiates, is often used to help such newborns. This review did not find any evidence that naloxone reduces the need for assisted breathing or admission to neonatal care units for babies born after women used opiate-based pain relief in labour.</P>

<P>We included nine trials that compared the effects of naloxone versus placebo or no drug in newborn infants exposed to maternal opiate analgesia prior to delivery. None of these trials specifically recruited infants with cardiorespiratory or neurological depression. The main outcomes reported were measures of respiratory function in the first six hours of life. There is some evidence that naloxone increases alveolar ventilation.

<P>The existing evidence from randomised controlled trials is insufficient to determine whether naloxone confers any important benefits to newborn infants with cardiorespiratory or neurological depression that may be due to intrauterine exposure to opiate.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-17 12:32:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-17 12:32:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Opioid analgesics are available, recommended and commonly used for relief of maternal pain during labour in most delivery units in middle- and high-income settings (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2012</LINK>). Estimates suggest that about one-third to one-half of women receives opiate analgesia in labour. The extent of use in low-income settings is less certain (<LINK REF="REF-Redshaw-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redshaw 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ullman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ullman 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The commonly used opiates (pethidine, diamorphine, morphine, fentanyl) are highly lipid soluble and transplacental transfer to the fetus occurs rapidly. Intrauterine exposure to maternal opiates within about four hours of birth may be associated with neurological and cardiorespiratory depression and feeding-behaviour problems in newborn infants (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 2010</LINK>). Concern exists that these adverse effects may delay neonatal physiological transition and postnatal adaptation and result in neonatal intensive or special care unit admission. Delay in establishment of effective breastfeeding is an important potential consequence of this maternal-infant separation (<LINK REF="REF-Nissen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nissen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ransjo_x002d_Arvidson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ransjo-Arvidson 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-12-21 16:17:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Naloxone, a specific opiate antagonist, is available for the treatment of neurological and cardiorespiratory depression in opiate-exposed newborn infants. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) has provided guidance on the use of naloxone for newborn infants (<LINK REF="REF-Niermeyer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niermeyer 2001</LINK>). The advice follows the long-standing recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Drugs that naloxone should not be used routinely in opiate-exposed newborn infants but should be "reserved for adjunctive therapy in selected infants who have not initiated or established independent respiration following ventilation, are significantly depressed, and have a high probability of being narcotized" (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1980</LINK>). These recommendations refer to infants of mothers who have received opiate for analgesia up to four hours prior to delivery. The dose of naloxone recommended in 1980, 0.01 mg/kg, was later revised to 0.1 mg/kg (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1990</LINK>). In 2010, an ILCOR Consensus on Science and Treatment Recommendations statement updated this advice and suggested that naloxone should only be given to infants with severe respiratory depression after positive-pressure ventilation has restored a normal heart rate and colour (<LINK REF="REF-Kattwinkel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kattwinkel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perlman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 2010</LINK>). However, despite these guidelines, surveys of policy and practice indicate that clinicians continue to administer naloxone to opiate-exposed newborn infants in the first few minutes after birth even in the absence of neurological or cardiorespiratory depression or before effective supported ventilation is established (<LINK REF="REF-Herschel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herschel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gill-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 2007</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Opiate-dependent mothers</HEADING>
<P>The AAP Committee on Drugs has advised that naloxone should not be administered to infants of opiate-dependent mothers as naloxone may precipitate acute withdrawal and seizures in opiate-habituated infants (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>). However, there are few data on significant adverse events due to naloxone in infants of opiate-dependent mothers and some authors have recommended a small dose of naloxone (0.01 mg/kg) as a part of the resuscitation of such infants (<LINK REF="REF-Maas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maas 1990</LINK>).</P>

</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-12-21 16:23:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Naloxone should not be regarded as harmless. Concern exists that naloxone may interfere with the role of endogenous opioids in neuroendocrine programming and behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Smotherman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smotherman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Castro-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Castro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szeto-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szeto 1995</LINK>). Given these questions of appropriateness of use and potential long-term effects, it is important to evaluate the available data on the use of naloxone in opiate-exposed newborn infants.</P>

<P>We included nine trials in the review and these are described in the table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'.

<P>A total of 316 infants participated in the included trials. All were undertaken in the 1970s or early 1980s. The participants were term newborn infants whose mothers had received pethidine (meperidine) for pain relief up to six hours prior to delivery. None of the trials specifically restricted participation to infants with cardiorespiratory or neurological depression following opiate exposure. In most trials, the intervention appears to have been given in the first five minutes after birth. In two trials, naloxone was given later; at 30 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Gerhardt-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Gerhardt 1977</LINK>) or at one hour (<LINK REF="STD-Welles-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Welles 1984</LINK>) after birth. Naloxone was administered via the intramuscular route in four trials, and in the other five via the umbilical venous route. The dose of naloxone used ranged from 0.01 to 0.07 mg/kg with the exception of one study in which a total dose of 0.2 mg was given (<LINK REF="STD-Wiener-1977b" TYPE="STUDY">Wiener 1977b</LINK>). The outcomes most commonly assessed were measures of respiratory effort such as Apgar scores, blood gases values, or other measures of alveolar ventilation.</P>
<P>None of the trials examined the effects of naloxone in infants of mothers who had used a prescribed or non-prescribed narcotic during pregnancy.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-21 16:21:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified nine small trials that compared naloxone versus placebo or no drug for treating newborn infants who had been exposed to maternal opiate analgesia prior to delivery. The trials evaluated the effect of naloxone on infants exposed to opiate analgesia in labour. None examined the use of naloxone in infants who had been exposed to opiate <I>in utero</I> during pregnancy, for example due to maternal opiate-dependence.</P>
<P>None of the included trials provided any data on any of the primary outcomes of this review, that is maternal separation (need for neonatal unit admission) and effect on breastfeeding. With regard to secondary outcome measures, most trials only reported measures of respiratory function and neurological behaviour in the first 48 hours after birth. We did not find any data on the incidence of seizures in the neonatal period, or long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-17 12:36:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials provided some evidence that infants who received naloxone had higher indices of alveolar ventilation, higher expired carbon dioxide levels and lower alveolar carbon dioxide tensions than control infants. However, the clinical significance of these findings is unclear since the infants recruited to the trials did not appear to have been selected because of cardiorespiratory depression. Infants with low Apgar scores up to five minutes were not eligible for inclusion in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bonta-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bonta 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Welles-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Welles 1984</LINK>). There are no trial data that assess whether treatment with naloxone affects the need for, or the duration of, mechanical respiratory support including positive-pressure ventilation. All of the included trials were conducted over 25 years ago. The evidence is likely to be of limited relevance in the clinical context for which naloxone is recommended by the ILCOR, that is, for opiate-exposed newborn infants with respiratory depression despite appropriate ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Niermeyer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niermeyer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kattwinkel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kattwinkel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perlman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 2010</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-01-17 15:00:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All of the trials were small and had various methodological weaknesses including uncertain allocation concealment that may have biased their findings and the findings of this review (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Ascertainment or surveillance biases may also be present since caregivers and clinicians in some of the trials were aware of the allocated intervention. Although follow-up assessment was complete in the trials, none assessed outcomes beyond the first few days after birth.</P>

<P>Clinicians and service-users may consider it appropriate to undertake a randomised controlled trial to determine if naloxone confers any important benefits to newborn infants with cardiorespiratory or neurological depression that may be due to intrauterine exposure to opiate. This trial should assess outcomes that are relevant to the infant, family, and caregivers, such as the need for admission to a neonatal unit for ongoing respiratory support. In view of the concerns that naloxone may interfere with the role of endogenous opioids in neuroendocrine programming and on behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Smotherman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smotherman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Castro-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Castro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szeto-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szeto 1995</LINK>), follow-up assessment beyond infancy should determine neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>
