<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-10 17:30:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) but their effect on length and quality of life of patients has not been studied systematically. In this systematic review, we tried to compare the effect of treatment regimens used for GvHD in the absence and presence of corticosteroids, or with different doses of corticosteroids. After searching relevant sources, we located only two studies that met our criteria to be included in the study. Their results are described in detail in the text of the review. In brief, these studies are in favor earlier remission and slightly better outcome in patients but more evidence is needed in this field.</P>

<P>Corticosteroids are commonly used in treatment of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Nevertheless, there has been no systematic analysis of effects of their use on the patients' survival and quality of life.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-05-22 08:46:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To compare the effect of corticosteroids in treatment of patients with GvHD and to compare the effect of different regimens of corticosteroids.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-11-12 06:41:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>We searched MEDLINE (up to July 2008), EMBASE (up to July 2008) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (up to July 2008) to identify relevant studies. All of the references were assessed in order to identify additional trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-05-22 08:47:44 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized controlled trials of any language were included in the study as long as they met any of the predefined comparisons of interest. The primary outcome in question was the overall survival of the patients. Due to lack of evidence, inclusion criteria was revised during the process of the review to include studies comparing different dosage of corticosteroids.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-11-10 17:30:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>All derived citations and abstracts were screened by two independent review authors for relevance. For the potentially relevant trials, the full text was obtained and reviewed by two review authors independently. Two review authors completed data extraction independently. After revising the inclusion criteria, this process was retried to ensure all relevant evidence is included in the review.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-22 08:49:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No studies met the original inclusion criteria but two studies (four articles) met the revised inclusion criteria. As they addressed different clinical questions, meta-analysis was not performed. The outcomes of one study were in favor of efficacy of corticosteroids in inducing an earlier remission of acute GvHD, while the other study reported that early corticosteroid therapy of acute GvHD could not prevent progression of the disease to higher grades, although it was accompanied by a slightly better prognosis in the patients who responded by the fifth day of treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no certain study regarding appropriate use, dose and length of therapy for acute GvHD. Further studies are needed to define the appropriate use of steroids and whether other agents are appropriate as frontline therapy.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-11-12 06:42:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Several studies have documented that many patients with hematologic diseases such as hematopoietic malignancies, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia and thalassemia can be cured by allogenic bone marrow transplantation from a HLA-identical sibling (<LINK REF="REF-Locatelli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locatelli 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2004</LINK>). A common complication of such transplantations is graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) which is caused by the recognition of host antigens as foreign by donor T lymphocytes. Unfortunately, GvHD remains a major source of mortality and morbidity including abnormalities of growth and development in children, sexual satisfaction and employment in adults, and functional performance status (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2002</LINK>). Risk factors for developing GvHD include donor-recipient gender mismatch, donor parity, age, and source of allogenic stem cells.<BR/>GvHD is categorized to acute and chronic forms, regarding the time of occurrence of disease after transplantation. It is important to delineate between acute and chronic GvHD. The cut-off is arbitrarily set at 100 days post stem-cell transplantation. The induction of acute GvHD may be deduced into three phases: (i) recipient conditioning, (ii) donor T cell activation and (iii) effector cells mediating. GvHD cytokines have been shown to be extremely important in the initiation and propagation of GvHD. The usual target organs are skin, gut and liver. The incidence of acute GvHD varies widely (between 10 to 90%) (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1999</LINK>). Clinical grading ranges from grade I with milder symptoms to grade III with severe multi-organ involvement, and grade IV which is life-threatening (Alexander 2000, <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2004</LINK>).<BR/>Chronic GvHD occurs usually within three years following transplant in up to 60% of patients (Wingard 2002). Organ fibrosis with collagen deposition and atrophy are the hallmarks of chronic GvHD, which is generally divided into three categories: progressive onset, quiescent, and de novo, the latter having better prognosis. On the other hand patients with prior acute GvHD, liver dysfunction and thrombocytopenia have poor prognosis. Patients not responding to first and second line chronic GvHD therapy also have a poor prognosis. Regarding the prolonged or continuing use of steroids in treatment of acute and chronic GvHD, there remains the question of the effect of the duration of steroid administration, including tapering or cessation of this agent due to adverse effects.</P>
</CONDITION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-11-10 17:30:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Once GvHD has developed, the strategy of treatment is not well established. Most centers administer prednisone at 1 to 2 mg/kg of patient body weight or the dose equivalent of another glucocorticoid and cyclosporine A (CSA) or tacrolimus as medication of first choice (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 2000</LINK>). Long term treatment with high dose glucocorticoids is associated with a high risk for morbidity. A regimen of cyclosporine and prednisolone administered on alternating days might have better efficacy and less toxicity than prednisolone alone for treatment of chronic GvHD (<LINK REF="REF-Koc-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koc 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1987</LINK>).</P>

<P>To determine the effect of corticosteroids used for the treatment of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after myeloablative allogenic stem cell transplantation in improving outcome, as well as the potential increases of undesired adverse effects such as infections (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2009-11-11 11:03:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>The review was aimed to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with or without blinding, in any language. Quasi-randomized trials (such as those assigning participants to study groups by case record number) were not included, because they are subject to selection bias and may result in unreliable outcomes. Studies with unclear information about the method of randomization were included in the review when they appeared to be likely to be randomized.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with acute or chronic GvHD who have undergone allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) either by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSC) after myeloablative conditioning therapy were included. Acute GvHD is defined as GvHD occurring within the first 100 days from transplantation time. All different stages of the disease were considered as well as the different types of HLA-matching, including HLA-matched or -mismatched relatives and unrelated HLA-matched or -mismatched donors.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-05-01 09:56:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two arms of the included studies targeting treatment of GvHD which only differed in the usage of one corticosteroid for the two arms or the dosage of one corticosteroid in the two arms. Consequently, any type of drugs or non-chemical interventions for treatment of GvHD had been accepted until the two arms of the study had not differed in respect to such interventions. Consequently, the intervention design of included studies had to follow one of the following patterns:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Single drug versus same single drug plus corticosteroids</LI>
<LI>Multiple drug regimen versus same multiple drug regimen plus corticosteroids</LI>
</OL>
<P>We also included studies which compared the effect of different timing or dosing of corticosteroid regimen in the two arms. This addition was made during the process of the review, since we noticed the lack of studies meeting the first two criteria and the existence of studies targeting different dosage of corticosteroids in treatment of GvHD. After this addition, we rechecked all search results to ensure we include all studies meeting the new criteria.</P>
<P>In any of the above-stated situations, the prevention methods for GvHD had to be balanced across the arms, or vary only due to the play of chance.</P>

<P>After removing duplicated results, 3986 records were resulted from the electronic searching in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; searching conference proceedings didn't yield any relevant studies. Two of us (HS, MR) screened through these records and selected relevant studies based on their titles and abstracts. We kept both RCTs and reviews, since further studies could be found by tracking the references of reviews. Full texts of 21 studies were retrieved for full text scrutiny, and two more references were identified by reference tracking. Finally, four articles reporting two studies were identified to meet the inclusion criteria (for QUOROM diagram see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Characteristics of these studies are provided in the table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'. In the meantime, several studies were excluded from the study for reasons such as lack of appropriate randomization, uncontrolled design or because they addressed a different question (e.g. a comparison that was not in the interest of our study).

<P>Although the application of randomization was described in both of the studies, the method was not mentioned in the reports. Although the comparison of the treatments in both studies could be accomplished with the interventions 'masked', none of them reported any level of blinding to be applied. Also, allocation of the patients to the study groups was not declared to be concealed in any of the studies. Intention To Treat method was used to analyze the data in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Lint-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Van Lint 1998</LINK>) but not in the other one. The authors did not provide further information when they were contacted.

<B>A)</B> <LINK REF="STD-Hings-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hings 1993</LINK> study:</P>
<P>This study was carried out by recruiting 68 patients who had developed moderate to severe acute GvHD after receiving allogenic transplantations, and were eligible for treatment with Prednisolone (PRED) at 60 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>/day. After 14 days, if they had responded or had stable disease, they were defined as eligible to be randomized to either short taper or long taper of PRED. 38 patients were not eligible for randomization for reasons like death or progression to chronic GvHD. 14 patients were allocated to short taper group, and 16 were allocated to long taper group. The differences between baseline characteristics of the patients in the two groups were not statistically significant. Patients were assessed on a weekly basis, and a scoring system, which was a modification of Seattle clinical staging score for GvHD, was used to evaluate the patients' response to therapy. All patients were followed for a minimum of one year post-transplantation.</P>
<P>The two treatment arms differed in the amount of steroids administered (6300 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> for long taper and 2275 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> for the short taper group) and the prescribed duration of the treatment (21 versus 1 weeks, respectively). At the end of eight weeks, three of the 13 evaluable patients in the short taper group, and two of the 13 evaluable patients in the long taper group still had active GvHD. Although the overall response rate was similar in the two study arms, patients receiving the long taper achieved more rapid resolution, compared to the short taper group (with the median of 30 days versus 42 days, respectively; P value = 0.01). When analyzed with respect to total cumulative PRED dose, patients in both groups responded after receiving approximately the same dose (median dose was 1300 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> for long taper and 188 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> for short taper group, P value = 0.5). No statistically significant differences were seen in the rate of flares of acute GvHD, incidence of chronic GvHD, date of onset of chronic GvHD post-transplantation or post-randomization and, in the number of days hospitalization in the first six months post-transplantation (P values being greater than 0.5 in all of the above). Survival of 6 months post-transplantation was 12 of 14 and 13 of 16 for short and long taper patients, respectively (P value = 0.87). 19 episodes of infectious complications were observed in the long taper group, compared to 17 episodes in the short taper group; the difference was not significant. The incidence and timing of the infection were reported to be similar in both groups, as well as the distribution of infectious organisms. Also, no difference was observed in the incidence of non-infectious complications related to steroid therapy.</P>
<P>Overall, the authors concluded that a long taper regimen of steroids could result in a slightly earlier remission of acute GvHD symptoms, but no overall improvement in the rate of control of GvHD. Also, more rapid cessation of steroids did not improve either morbidity or mortality in the first six months post-transplantation, and did not reduce the incidence of steroid related complications.</P>
<P>B) <LINK REF="STD-Van-Lint-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Van Lint 1998</LINK> study:</P>
<P>We identified three reports of the same study conducted by Van Lint et al. The first two (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Lint-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van Lint 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Lint-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Van Lint 1997</LINK>) were preliminary reports, confined to a summary of the methods and results of the study. Here we describe the study based on the most complete report (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Lint-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Van Lint 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The study was a multi-center clinical trial, aimed to compare the effect of high versus low dose 6-Methylprednisolone (6MP). 95 patients with hematological neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases who had received HLA-identical bone marrow transplants from sibling donors and had developed acute GvHD were randomized to receive either 2 mg/kg/d (low dose) or 6 mg/kg/d (high dose) of 6MP. Patients who showed progression or poor response after 5 days on the low dose regimen, were shifted to the high dose regimen. The results were analyzed as Intention To Treat.<BR/>
<BR/>47 patients were allocated to the low dose regimen, and 48 to the high dose arm. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups; the study arms were also matched for some factors which could confound the results, including age, GvHD prophylaxis and diagnosis.</P>
<P>Comparison of the given doses of 6MP within different intervals showed that the dose of 6MP did not differ significantly except for the first 10 days of therapy. Patients were classified to responders and non-responders, based on the regression or progression of GvHD. Death due to transplant-related complications occurred in 10 of 66 responders and 17 of 27 non-responders (P value &lt; 0.00001) while the response rate was similar in the two groups (68% in low dose and 71% in high dose group, P value = 0.9). Also no difference was observed in the proportion of responders to non-responders, when patients were stratified based on their age (P value = 0.9), GvHD prophylaxis regimen (P value = 0.9), conditioning regimen (P value = 0.5), and the phase of the disease (P value = 0.7). The average cumulative dose of 6MP was indifferent between the two groups (25mg/kg in non-responders versus 28mg/kg in responders on days 1 through 5, P value = 0.6; 17mg/kg in non-responders versus 15mg/kg in non-responders on days six through ten, P value = 0.5).</P>
<P>In 17% of patients in low dose group and 20% from the high dose arm, acute GvHD progressed to grade III-IV (P value=0.6). The progression risk was similar in patients treated early (within the first 12 days) and those treated later (after the 12th day.) Among the 68 patients evaluable for chronic GvHD, the number of patients who had developed limited or extensive chronic GvHD was similar in the two study arms (P value=0.8). The probability of relapse was not statistically different in the two groups of patients (P value = 0.1).</P>
<P>The overall actuarial transplant-related mortality rate was 28% in the low dose group and 32% in the high dose group (P value = 0.7) and the mortality rate was not different in patients stratified for age, GvHD prevention regimen, conditioning regimen, or disease status at transplant (early versus advanced). However, it was significantly lower in patients with acute GvHD of grade I-II versus patients who experienced acute GvHD of grade III-IV (23% versus 58%, P value &lt; 0.0001). In the low dose arm, the patients who did not respond by day five of therapy, had a transplant-related mortality rate of 46%, which was significantly larger than the 16% transplant-related mortality rate for patients who responded by day five (P value = 0.007).</P>
<P>The actuarial 3-year survival of patients allocated to the low dose and high dose arms were 63% and 62% respectively (P value = 0.9). Causes of death included leukemia recurrence, acute GvHD, infections, interstitial pneumonia, multiorgan failure, hepatitis, heart failure, and hemorrhage, and their rates were similar in the two groups (P value = 0.6). Infectious side effects of therapy were not statistically different in the two study arms.</P>
<P>All together, the authors conclusion was that early treatment of acute GvHD with high dose 6MP could not prevent progression of the disease to grade III-IV, and treatment with a low dose regimen would have a good prognosis in patients who responded by the fifth day of treatment.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-12 06:44:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Corticosteroids have been used for prevention and treatment of GvHD for many years. Although advancements in the treatment of GvHD using immuno-modulators and other immuno-suppressor drugs have proven many other therapeutic modalities to be effective, corticosteroids are still being widely used in the treatment protocol of this disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bacigalupo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacigalupo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Lint-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Lint 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies met the inclusion criteria of this systematic review. The outcomes for this review were not uniformly reported in the included studies, and the two trials did not address questions similar enough for results to be pooled. Blinding was not undertaken in any of the two studies and the quality of reporting of these trials was also generally quite poor, according to CONSORT. The included studies emphasized on overall survival, remission and relapse rates, and did not describe the quality of life of the survivors. Both trials had a small sample size, hence a questionable statistical power.</P>
<P>Hings et al reported that a long taper regimen of corticosteroids could result in a slightly earlier remission of acute GvHD symptoms, but the overall rate of control of GvHD was not affected (<LINK REF="STD-Hings-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hings 1993</LINK>). Van Lint et al concluded that early treatment of acute GvHD with high dose 6MP could not prevent progression of the disease to grade III-IV, but treatment with a low dose regimen would result in a better prognosis in patients who responded by the fifth day of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Lint-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Van Lint 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review highlights the paucity of information on the role of corticosteroids in treatment of Graft versus Host Disease. Also, there was a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of corticosteroids for treatment of chronic GvHD, which should be addressed by future randomized controlled trials.</P>
<P>One could argue that the use of corticosteroids in treatment of GvHD is obviously mandatory, so there is no interest in assessing it through trials. It should be noted that corticosteroids are also used in prevention of GvHD, and several studies have assessed this approach. In a recently published systematic review, Quellmann et al. reported that by pooling the results of five RCTs it could be concluded that the addition of corticosteroids to GvHD prophylaxis regimens reduces the risk of acute GvHD, although, based on the randomized trials currently available there is no evidence that this benefit improves long-term outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Quellmann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quellmann 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In brief, there is a lack of RCT data on which to base definitive conclusions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is not enough evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids to achieve a faster or better response in treatment of GvHD, and the currently available evidence does not explain its impact on the survival of the patients. The use of corticosteroids is accompanied by a higher risk of fungal infections and other corticosteroid related adverse reactions. However, there is little evidence from randomized controlled trials to evaluate its effect on the patients' quality of life, which is particularly important for patients suffering chronic GvHD.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for well structured research into treatment options of GvHD with a larger sample size, reporting outcomes such as disease free survival, measures of quality of life, and cost-effectiveness measures, to provide more strong recommendations supporting or disproving use of corticosteroids for treatment of GvHD. Current evidence does not address the effect of corticosteroids in treatment of chronic GvHD. This review suffers from the great heterogeneity concerning definition of study arms and study conduct.</P>

<P>During the searching phase, we noted that there are a few studies comparing different dosage of corticosteroids in treatment of GvHD. As we found no studies to meet our original inclusion criteria, we updated our inclusion criteria and other relevant sections accordingly. The words "regimens" was added to the title of the review to indicate that different dosages is also reviewed. A new item was added to the inclusion criteria, to include studies that compare different timing and/or dosage of corticosteroids. Search results were screened with scrutiny to identify all studies meeting this new criterion. Results section reflects the outcome of this process. References of newly included studies were also rechecked to ensure all relevant studies are found and included.</P>
