<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-04 08:48:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Croup is an acute illness commonly seen in children up to six years of age but mostly by the age of two. It is triggered by viral infections causing upper airway obstruction with varying degrees of respiratory distress. Mostly, it is mild and transient and resolves with supportive care. Croup is characterised by a barking cough, hoarseness, varying degrees of inspiratory stridor (abnormal breathing sound) and chest wall retractions and is usually preceded by one to three days of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. The peak croup seasons are autumn and winter but can occur at any time.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids are an accepted treatment for moderate to severe croup, supplemented in more severe cases by nebulised epinephrine and oxygen. Epinephrine is often effective and safe but can have undesired effects (such as increased heart rate and anxiety). Corticosteroids improve croup symptoms but it takes time for their full effect to be achieved. In the meantime the child remains at risk of deterioration. This may rarely result in the development of respiratory failure, which may require emergency intubation and ventilation. Therefore, finding a safe and effective treatment to bridge the gap between the administration and effectiveness of the corticosteroids is important for clinical practice.</P>
<P>Some studies have shown a benefit of using heliox in children with croup. Heliox, a gas with lower density than air or oxygen, is believed to reduce the resistance to gas flow in narrowed upper airways, potentially improving symptoms and signs of respiratory distress. This review found three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of heliox in 91 children with croup. Heliox did not appear to be more effective than administration of 30% oxygen in children with mild croup. In children with moderate to severe croup who had been administered oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, heliox appeared to be at least as effective as continuous 100% oxygen with one to two doses of nebulised racaemic epinephrine (adrenaline as a fine spray) in one study. It was slightly more effective than no treatment in another study. There were no adverse effects or outcomes reported. The included trials were small and had a number of methodological limitations. Further methodologically well-designed RCTs with more participants are needed to further assess the role of heliox in managing children with moderate to severe croup. The evidence is current to November 2013.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-03 13:35:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Croup is thought to be triggered by a viral infection and is characterised by respiratory distress due to upper airway inflammation and swelling of the subglottic mucosa in children. Mostly it is mild and transient and resolves with supportive care. In moderate to severe cases, treatment with corticosteroids and nebulised epinephrine (adrenaline) is required. Corticosteroids improve symptoms but it takes time for a full effect to be achieved. In the interim, the child is at risk of further deterioration. This may rarely result in respiratory failure necessitating emergency intubation and ventilation. Nebulised epinephrine may result in dose-related adverse effects including tachycardia, arrhythmias and hypertension and its benefit may be short-lived. Helium-oxygen (heliox) inhalation has shown therapeutic benefit in initial treatment of acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and may prevent morbidity and mortality in ventilated neonates. Heliox has been used during emergency transport of children with severe croup and anecdotal evidence suggests that heliox relieves respiratory distress.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-11-28 02:20:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 10, MEDLINE (1950 to October week 5, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to November 2013), CINAHL (1982 to November 2013), Web of Science (1955 to November 2013) and LILACS (1982 to November 2013). In addition, we searched two clinical trials registries: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and clinicaltrials.gov (searched 12 November 2013).</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-03 13:26:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>We included three RCTs with a total of 91 participants. One study compared heliox 70%/30% with 30% humidified oxygen administered for 20 minutes in children with mild croup and found no statistically significant differences in the overall change in croup scores between heliox and the comparator. In another study, children with moderate to severe croup were administered intramuscular dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg and either heliox 70%/30% with one to two doses of nebulised saline, or 100% oxygen with one to two doses of nebulised racaemic epinephrine for three hours. In this study, the heliox group's croup scores improved significantly more at all time points from 90 minutes onwards. However, overall there were no significant differences in croup scores between the groups after four hours using repeated measures analysis. In a third study, children with moderate croup all received one dose of oral dexamethasone 0.3 mg/kg with heliox 70%/30% for 60 minutes in the intervention group and no treatment in the comparator. There was a statistically significant difference in croup scores at 60 minutes in favour of heliox but no significant difference after 120 minutes. It was not possible to pool outcomes because the included studies compared different interventions and reported different outcomes. No adverse events were reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-28 02:20:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>There is some evidence to suggest a short-term benefit of heliox inhalation in children with moderate to severe croup who have been administered oral or intramuscular dexamethasone. In one study, the benefit appeared to be similar to a combination of 100% oxygen with nebulised epinephrine. In another study there was a slight change in croup scores between heliox and controls, with unclear clinical significance. In another study in mild croup, the benefit of humidified heliox was equivalent to that of 30% humidified oxygen, suggesting that heliox is not indicated in this group of patients provided that 30% oxygen is available. Adequately powered RCTs comparing heliox with standard treatments are needed to further assess the role of heliox in children with moderate to severe croup.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-11-28 02:20:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Croup (also know as viral laryngotracheobronchitis), is a common respiratory syndrome in children, which may progress to an acute respiratory obstruction. It is characterised by a barking cough, hoarseness, varying degrees of inspiratory stridor and chest wall retractions. It is usually preceded by a one to three-day period of viral upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Croup commonly affects children up to the age of six years, with the highest incidence in the second year of life (<LINK REF="REF-Denny-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denny 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rittichier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rittichier 2000</LINK>). A seasonal variation in the occurrence of croup, with a peak in the autumn and winter, has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Denny-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denny 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Segal-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 2005</LINK>). Two commonly used methods for assessing the severity of croup are the Westley and Taussig Croup Scales (<LINK REF="REF-Taussig-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taussig 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Westley-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westley 1978</LINK>). The croup score is assigned based on the following observed parameters: level of consciousness, stridor, colour, air entry and retractions. The Westley croup score has numerical values ranging from zero to 17. Values less than four correspond to mild croup, four to six to moderate croup and more than six to severe croup. The Taussig scale also has numerical values ranging from zero to 15. A score of less than four corresponds to mild croup, four to seven corresponds to moderate croup and more than seven corresponds to severe croup (<LINK REF="REF-Taussig-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taussig 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Westley-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westley 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>Croup is thought to be triggered by a viral infection, most commonly by human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), particularly HPIV type 1 and less commonly by influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, adenovirus, enteroviruses and <I>Mycoplasma pneumoniae </I>(<I>M. pneumoniae</I>)<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Denny-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denny 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marx-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marx 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Segal-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 2005</LINK>). Viral invasion of the subglottic mucosa causes inflammation and oedema, leading to narrowing of the upper airway. As this narrowing progresses, the pressure gradient necessary to move air through the upper airway becomes greater, leading to an increased effort in breathing. This may result in fatigue of the respiratory muscles and subsequently lead to respiratory failure, requiring emergency intubation. Systemic, oral or nebulised corticosteroids are the currently accepted treatment for moderate to severe croup, supplemented in more severe cases by nebulised epinephrine (<LINK REF="REF-Bjornson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjornson 2011</LINK>) and oxygen. Antibiotics do not play a role in the treatment of acute croup. Corticosteroids have been shown to improve symptoms of croup but it takes time for their full effect to be achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2012</LINK>). Nebulised budesonide has been shown to have a beneficial effect as early as two hours after administration (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klassen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klassen 1998</LINK>) but in the meantime the child remains at risk of deterioration and of developing respiratory failure, requiring emergency intubation and ventilation.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-28 02:20:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Helium is a biologically inert, colourless, odourless and non-combustible gas and was first discovered in 1868 by Jannsen and Lockyer. In the early 1930s Barach pioneered the successful use of a helium-oxygen mixture (heliox) in the treatment of adults and children with asthma and upper airway obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Barach-1935" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barach 1935</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barach-1936" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barach 1936</LINK>). However, it was not until the 1980s that helium-oxygen mixtures regained popularity, possibly due to the rising mortality from asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Robin-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robin 1988</LINK>). This led to an increase in clinical trials assessing the effect of heliox in the management of acute upper and lower airway obstructive disorders in children (<LINK REF="REF-Cambonie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cambonie 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grozs-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grozs 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinon_x002d_Torres-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinon-Torres 2002</LINK>). Heliox is used in concentrations of helium/oxygen of 80%/20%, 60%/40% or 70%/30%.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-11-28 02:20:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Heliox has a similar viscosity and a substantial sevenfold lower density than air and when combined with oxygen results in heliox, a gas mixture with an up to threefold (heliox 80/20) lower density than air (<LINK REF="REF-Papamoschou-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papamoschou 1995</LINK>). The density of a gas mixture is proportional to the Reynolds number (Re), a dimensionless ratio of the inertial to the viscous force and will thus have an effect on the type of gas flow present in the airway. It is known that turbulent flow occurs when Re &gt; 3000 and laminar flow occurs when Re &lt; 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Glauser-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glauser 1969</LINK>). Pathological narrowing of the airway, as seen in croup, will lead to increased turbulence and higher gas flow resistance, resulting in an increased breathing effort. In theory, a gas of low density, such as heliox, should create a less turbulent or even laminar flow, by reducing the Reynolds number, leading to a decrease in resistance to gas flow and the work of breathing (<LINK REF="REF-Houck-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houck 1990</LINK>). Heliox is also believed to improve gas exchange, due to a delivery of increased tidal volume as a result of lowering the resistive forces within the airway (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2003</LINK>). A Cochrane Review investigating the role of heliox inhalation therapy in infants with RSV bronchiolitis concludes that the addition of heliox therapy to standard medical care may significantly reduce a clinical score evaluating respiratory distress in the first hour after starting treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Liet-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liet 2010</LINK>). Similarly, a Cochrane Review in children with asthma suggests that heliox might have beneficial effects in patients (children or adults) with severe obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-11-28 02:20:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Croup can cause anxiety and distress to affected children and their parents. In mild cases, supportive treatment may suffice but in moderate to severe cases, more aggressive therapy may be required to prevent exhaustion and respiratory failure. The available treatment options for croup are limited. Corticosteroids take time for their clinical effects to be achieved. Nebulised epinephrine (adrenaline) is widely used. It has a rapid onset and short-lived benefit but can be associated with dose-related side effects such as tachycardia, hypertension and arrhythmias. Treatment of croup with heliox has demonstrated a beneficial effect, albeit in a small numbers of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Beckmann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Beckmann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiCecco-2004" TYPE="STUDY">DiCecco 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK>) and in one study the benefit appeared to be no different to nebulised epinephrine (<LINK REF="STD-Weber-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2001</LINK>). No significant evidence of benefit was reported in the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Vorwerk-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vorwerk 2010</LINK>), but there are new data from a Spanish randomised controlled trial (RCT) to suggest that heliox, when added to corticosteroids, clinically improves moderate croup (<LINK REF="STD-Pardillo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pardillo 2009</LINK>). Also a recently published retrospective cohort study indicates that heliox, when added to standard treatment for transporting critically ill children with croup, provides rapid and sustained improvement in croup scores with no extension of length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) (<LINK REF="STD-Kline_x002d_Krammes-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kline-Krammes 2012</LINK>). There is a need for an updated review of the evidence regarding the role of heliox in children with croup to guide clinical practice.</P>

<P>We identified three studies (with a total of 91 participants) suitable for inclusion in this review. Two studies were published in English and one in Spanish. All trials included in the review are randomised controlled trials and the study participants have similar characteristics in terms of age and sex distribution. The characteristics of included studies are described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table and summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Terregino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Terregino 1998</LINK> enrolled children with <I>mild croup</I> aged between six months and four years, presenting to the Emergency Department. It was a small study with 15 participants; eight received heliox and seven received 30% oxygen, both delivered via humidification. Children were excluded from entering the study if they had a presumed diagnosis of epiglottitis, a history of chronic upper airway obstruction, if they were in severe respiratory distress or their oxygen requirements exceeded 2 L/min to maintain an oxygen saturation of at least 95%. The treatments were delivered via a tight-fitting mask for a 20-minute period. No additional treatments were given to the study participants. The main outcome of the study was a change in Westley croup score (<LINK REF="REF-Westley-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westley 1978</LINK>) at 20 minutes. Other outcomes were measured at five-minute intervals for 20 minutes and they included heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. The difference in the mean baseline croup scores between the intervention and comparator groups was not significant. No adverse events were reported during the study period and all patients were discharged from the Emergency Department.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2001</LINK>, 29 children aged between six months and three years with a diagnosis of <I>moderate to severe croup</I>, defined as a modified <LINK REF="REF-Taussig-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taussig 1975</LINK> croup score &#8805; five or a score of three in any of the five categories, were enrolled from the Emergency Department. All children received continuous cool mist and 0.6 mg/kg of intramuscular dexamethasone. Fourteen children were then randomised to receive heliox and 15 children were randomised to receive 100% oxygen plus one to two doses of nebulised racaemic epinephrine. Gas therapy was administered via a facemask or tent house continuously for three hours followed by a further 60-minute observation period. The primary outcome measure was the change in croup score over time (at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 and 240 minutes) and the secondary outcomes were changes in oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and heart rate. There was no significant difference in the mean baseline croup score between the intervention and comparator group. No adverse events were reported during the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pardillo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pardillo 2009</LINK> enrolled 47 children aged between 6 and 36 months with <I>moderate croup</I> (defined as a Taussig score between five and eight). A single dose of 0.3 mg/kg of dexamethasone was administered orally to all study participants. Heliox was administered to 24 children via a mask with a reservoir to prevent re-inhalation for a period of one hour and 23 children received no treatment unless their oxygen saturations fell to below 92% during the study, in which case oxygen was administered by nasal prongs. Children were excluded if they had congenital or acquired cardiac conditions, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, stenosis or malformations of the trachea, bronchospasm at diagnosis, intolerance of oral dexamethasone or if they had been treated with corticosteroids in the previous two weeks. The main outcome measures were changes in the Taussig croup score and respiratory rate, which were analyzed at 60 and 120 minutes. The other outcome measures included were: need for nebulised rescue epinephrine, admission rate and re-consultation within the following 72 hours. There was no significant difference in the mean baseline croup score or respiratory rate between the intervention and control group. No adverse events were reported during the study.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-02 18:53:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Only three RCTs with a total of 91 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Terregino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Terregino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pardillo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pardillo 2009</LINK>) assessed the effect of heliox inhalation as treatment in children with a diagnosis of croup. <LINK REF="STD-Terregino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Terregino 1998</LINK> compared helium-oxygen (70/30) inhalation with humidified oxygen (30%). <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2001</LINK> compared helium-oxygen (70/30) inhalation with oxygen (100%) and nebulised racaemic epinephrine and <LINK REF="STD-Pardillo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pardillo 2009</LINK> compared heliox 70/30 with no treatment. Overall, in all studies there was more improvement in the croup scores from pre- to post-intervention with heliox than with the comparator intervention, although it did not reach statistical significance in two of the studies. There were no significant changes in heart rate, respiratory rates or oxygen saturation between the intervention and comparison groups. There were no adverse events and there was no need for intubation reported in any of the study participants. Some patients were admitted to hospital and some re-presented at the Emergency Department in the <LINK REF="STD-Pardillo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pardillo 2009</LINK> study. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2001</LINK> lacked data on the main outcomes and we were unable to obtain data after contacting the authors. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the findings of this study.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-11-28 02:48:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the case series described by <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1979</LINK>, seven children (aged from newborn to three years) with severe airway obstruction due to post-intubation or infectious croup were given heliox as a carrier for oxygen. Even though most of the children had underlying medical problems, helium-oxygen inhalation was found to significantly reduce respiratory distress as measured by croup score and it prevented the need for tracheal intubation. <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1982</LINK> described a further case series of 14 children (aged from three to 21 months) with viral croup who were referred for possible tracheal intubation or tracheostomy. These children were commenced on helium-oxygen inhalation and subsequently an improvement in respiratory distress was observed, while none of the participants required intubation. Both case series included a heterogenous study population and lacked a control group, which makes it very difficult to comment on the contribution of heliox mixtures to the observed clinical outcomes. Anecdotal evidence of benefit from heliox is further supported by <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK> who reported dramatic relief of respiratory distress in three children with croup who were commenced on heliox therapy. A recently published retrospective chart review by <LINK REF="STD-Kline_x002d_Krammes-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kline-Krammes 2012</LINK> included 35 children, 17 treated with heliox and 18 controls transported by air and admitted to paediatric intensive care. Those treated with heliox had a higher baseline croup score compared to the controls. The improvement in croup scores in the heliox group was more rapid and there was no difference in the number of children requiring nebulised racaemic epinephrine during transport. The length of stay in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and hospital was similar between the two groups.</P>
<P>Data from the included studies do not allow for a robust conclusion as to whether heliox is an effective treatment for relieving symptoms and signs of croup in children or on rates of admission or intubation in these children. All the studies reported changes in croup scores while other review outcomes were not consistently reported. We found only three trials with a total of 91 participants that met the inclusion criteria for our review.</P>
<P>The first RCT to assess the effect of heliox in children with croup was <LINK REF="STD-Terregino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Terregino 1998</LINK>. This study showed that there was no statistical significance in the mean change of croup scores pre- and post-intervention between the control and heliox group, suggesting that heliox was as effective but not more effective than humidified oxygen in reducing croup score. A limitation, however, is the exclusion of all children with severe croup who could have benefited from the intervention and the period of gas application was short compared to the other studies. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn about the benefit of heliox in children with severe croup. None of the participants received corticosteroids or epinephrine, contrary to current standard practice in moderate to severe croup, making it difficult to apply the results to current clinical care.</P>
<P>The RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2001</LINK> found that overall heliox is as effective as, but not more effective than, nebulised racaemic epinephrine and 100% oxygen in improving croup scores. The study reported a statistically significant improvement in the intervention group after 90 minutes of treatment but in the absence of raw study data this is difficult to confirm. There are a number of limitations to this study. Participants requiring rescue nebulised epinephrine were excluded from the analysis, as were participants who did not tolerate the gas delivery system or had incomplete data. This may have led to a biased estimate of the treatment effect. Another limitation is the type of gas delivery system used to administer helium-oxygen, as entrainment of room air would have reduced the helium concentration of the inhaled gas mixtures and may have diminished any beneficial effects. Tent houses, as used in the study by Weber et al, are considered sub-optimal for heliox delivery as helium will accumulate at the top of the tent so the helium concentration reaching the upper airway of the patient will be markedly reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Martinon_x002d_Torres-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinon-Torres 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stillwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stillwell 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Pardillo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pardillo 2009</LINK>, heliox was compared with no treatment in children with moderate croup who had been administered corticosteroids. The study results show that treatment with heliox provided a greater improvement in croup scores at 60 minutes and 120 minutes compared to baseline than no treatment. This study also reported other outcomes that are relevant for clinical practice. The number of participants requiring rescue adrenaline was higher in the control group (five patients) compared to the heliox group (one patient), as was the number of patients who were admitted (two in the control and one in the heliox group) but the number of patients who re-presented for treatment at 72 hours was similar (two patients in each group). This is the first RCT to report these findings and it also had more participants compared to the other two RCTs published. A limitation of the study was that it was open-label hence the investigators knew which arms the participants belonged to.</P>
<P>The duration of heliox administration varied in the three studies. The chosen duration of 20 minutes by <LINK REF="STD-Terregino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Terregino 1998</LINK> might have been too short to demonstrate a significant benefit particularly because the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Pardillo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pardillo 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2001</LINK> reported a statistically significant difference in the improvement in the heliox group compared to the control group after 60 and 90 minutes of treatment respectively. Only the study by <LINK REF="STD-Pardillo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pardillo 2009</LINK> reported data for some other outcomes that are relevant in clinical practice but unfortunately none of the studies fully addressed all the outcomes of the review.</P>
<P>The results of the studies indicate that heliox has a positive effect in reducing the severity of the signs and symptoms of croup as observed from the changes in croup scores and may be beneficial as part of initial treatment while waiting for the action of corticosteroids to take effect. Also there is evidence that heliox maybe useful during transport of children with severe croup.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-11-28 02:20:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The quality of the evidence from the three included trials is variable. The trials by <LINK REF="STD-Terregino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Terregino 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pardillo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pardillo 2009</LINK> had a small sample size and it is likely that these studies were underpowered which may have resulted in a type II error and failure to find a true effect. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2001</LINK> presented incomplete outcome data which limits the quality of evidence available for interpretation. Another limitation of <LINK REF="STD-Pardillo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pardillo 2009</LINK> was that it was an open-label study, resulting in a high risk of performance and detection bias.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-05-29 15:13:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To minimise any potential bias in the review process we have used a systematic and comprehensive search strategy. Two review authors independently identified and reviewed records and we feel confident that reasons for exclusion were consistent and appropriate. We have also contacted a leading medical gas supplier to enquire about any unpublished studies to minimise the risk of publication bias. Data analysis and extraction was carried out independently by two review authors and interpretation of the data and outcomes was thoroughly discussed by the whole author team. None of the authors has any potential conflict of interest in the outcome of this review.</P>

<P>This review is an update of a Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Vorwerk-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vorwerk 2010</LINK>) which had also been published elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Vorwerk-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vorwerk 2008</LINK>). One additional study was identified in our updated review which slightly changed the conclusion towards a potential benefit of heliox in the management of croup in young children. Given the paucity of evidence from randomised clinical trials, as more evidence becomes available this conclusion may be revised.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-11-28 02:20:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At present there is some evidence to suggest a short-term benefit of heliox inhalation in the treatment of moderate to severe croup in children who have been administered oral or intramuscular dexamethasone. In one study, the benefit appeared to be no different to that of the combination of 100% oxygen with one to two doses of nebulised racaemic epinephrine and in another study it appeared slightly more beneficial than no treatment. The difference in the croup score (Taussig score) between those administered heliox and those without additional treatment was around one point on the croup scale which was in the moderate range after 60 minutes. The clinical significance of this difference is not clear. In children with mild croup, the benefit of humidified heliox appeared to be equivalent to that of 30% humidified oxygen, suggesting that heliox is not indicated in this group of patients provided that 30% oxygen is available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-11-28 02:20:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Adequately powered RCTs that compare heliox with standard treatments are needed to further assess the role of heliox therapy in the management of children with severe croup. These trials also need to incorporate clinical outcomes with health and economic relevance such as rate and duration of admission to paediatric intensive care units, rate and duration of intubation, rate of return to medical care for ongoing croup symptoms, rate and duration of hospital admission, parental anxiety and side effects.</P>
