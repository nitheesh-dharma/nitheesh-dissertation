In lower-income settings, ready-made spectacles may provide a useful alternative to expensive custom-made spectacles.</P><P><B>What was studied in the review?</B><BR/>Worldwide, an unmet need for corrective spectacles is the leading cause of reduced vision in children; short-sightedness (unable to see objects in the distance clearly) has become the commonest eye condition. Reduced vision may affect academic performance and therefore choice of occupation and socio-economic status in adult life. It can also be associated with other symptoms such as headaches. Vision screening programmes designed to identify children who need spectacles have therefore been introduced into schools. Such programmes improve access to health care for some children who would not otherwise have it, but the value of these screening programmes is debatable. This review was therefore designed to collect and evaluate any evidence regarding how well such programmes are working.</P><P><B>What are the main results of the review?</B><BR/>Cochrane Review authors found seven relevant studies. These studies tested ways of improving the take-up of spectacle prescriptions given as part of a screening programme. Five studies were from China, one from India and one from Tanzania. These studies compared: vision screening with free spectacles with vision screening alone; vision screening with education with vision screening alone; and vision screening and ready-made spectacles with vision screening and custom-made spectacles.</P><P>The review shows that:</P><P>&#8226; There are no studies comparing vision screening with no vision screening (evidence gap).<BR/>&#8226; Vision screening with provision of free spectacles results in more children wearing spectacles after screening compared with giving the children a prescription on its own (high-certainty evidence).

Our pre-specified primary outcome was uncorrected, or suboptimally corrected, visual acuity deficit due to refractive error six months after screening. Pre-specified secondary outcomes included visual acuity deficit due to refractive error more than six months after screening, visual acuity deficit due to causes other than refractive error, spectacle wearing, quality of life, costs, and adverse effects. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-02-13 09:38:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We identified seven relevant studies. Five of these studies were conducted in China with one study in India and one in Tanzania. A total of 9858 children aged between 10 and 18 years were randomised in these studies, 8240 of whom (84%) were followed up between one and eight months after screening. Overall we judged the studies to be at low risk of bias. None of these studies compared vision screening for correctable visual acuity deficits with not screening.</P><P>Two studies compared vision screening with the provision of free spectacles versus vision screening with no provision of free spectacles (prescription only). These studies provide high-certainty evidence that vision screening with provision of free spectacles results in a higher proportion of children wearing spectacles than if vision screening is accompanied by provision of a prescription only (risk ratio (RR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 1.90; 1092 participants). The studies suggest that if approximately 250 per 1000 children given vision screening plus prescription only are wearing spectacles at follow-up (three to six months) then 400 per 1000 (335 to 475) children would be wearing spectacles after vision screening and provision of free spectacles. Low-certainty evidence suggested better educational attainment in children in the free spectacles group (adjusted difference 0.11 in standardised mathematics score, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21, 1 study, 2289 participants). Costs were reported in one study in Tanzania in 2008 and indicated a relatively low cost of screening and spectacle provision (low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of any important effect of provision of free spectacles on uncorrected visual acuity (mean difference -0.02 logMAR (95% CI adjusted for clustering -0.04 to 0.01) between the groups at follow-up (moderate-certainty evidence). Other pre-specified outcomes of this review were not reported.</P><P>Two studies explored the effect of an educational intervention in addition to vision screening on spectacle wear. There was moderate-certainty evidence of little apparent effect of the education interventions investigated in these studies in addition to vision screening, compared to vision screening alone for spectacle wearing (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.31, 1 study, 3177 participants) or related outcome spectacle purchase (odds ratio (OR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.31, 1 study, 4448 participants). Other pre-specified outcomes of this review were not reported.</P><P>Three studies compared vision screening with ready-made spectacles versus vision screening with custom-made spectacles. These studies provide moderate-certainty evidence of no clinically meaningful differences between the two types of spectacles. In one study, mean logMAR acuity in better and worse eye was similar between groups: mean difference (MD) better eye 0.03 logMAR, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05; 414 participants; MD worse eye 0.06 logMAR, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.08; 414 participants). There was high-certainty evidence of no important difference in spectacle wearing (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.05; 1203 participants) between the two groups and moderate-certainty evidence of no important difference in quality of life between the two groups (the mean quality-of-life score measured using the National Eye Institute Refractive Error Quality of Life scale 42 was 1.42 better (1.04 worse to 3.90 better) in children with ready-made spectacles (1 study of 188 participants). Although none of the studies reported on costs directly, ready-made spectacles are cheaper and may represent considerable cost-savings for vision screening programmes in lower income settings. There was low-certainty evidence of no important difference in adverse effects between the two groups. Adverse effects were reported in one study and were similar between groups. These included blurred vision, distorted vision, headache, disorientation, dizziness, eyestrain and nausea.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-13 09:20:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Vision screening plus provision of free spectacles improves the number of children who have and wear the spectacles they need compared with providing a prescription only.

There are three types of refractive error. Myopia (short-sightedness) compromises distance vision. Hypermetropia (long-sightedness) compromises near vision and, if severe enough, distance vision as well. Astigmatism, caused by a non-spherical cornea, impairs both distance and near vision.</P><P>In normal visual development, changes in refractive error occur over the first few years of life. The majority of full-term babies are hypermetropic at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Banks-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banks 1980</LINK>) but this decreases with growth so that in adult life the preponderance of refractions are around zero or emmetropia (<LINK REF="REF-Sorsby-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorsby 1964</LINK>). Most of this change occurs in early childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrlich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrlich 1997</LINK>) in a process known as emmetropisation (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1995</LINK>). The main risk factors for development of myopia appear to be intensive education and limited time outdoors (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2017</LINK>). Myopia can be inherited (<LINK REF="REF-Yap-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yap 1994</LINK>), possibly through the genetic determination of the axial length of the eye (<LINK REF="REF-Canoll-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canoll 1982</LINK>).</P><P>Myopia is a common condition. Some authors estimate that 34% of the world population will be affected by myopia in 2020 (uncertainty interval 26% to 43%) (<LINK REF="REF-Holden-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holden 2016</LINK>). This corresponds to 2620 million people (1976 to 3366 million people). There is considerable global variation in the prevalence of myopia in children. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies suggested that 70% (95% credible interval (CrI) 61% to 77%) of East Asian children have myopia by the time they are 15 years old (<LINK REF="REF-Rudnicka-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudnicka 2016</LINK>). East Asian was defined as Chinese, Japanese, Mongolian and Taiwanese. This high prevalence contrasts with relatively low prevalence in black children living in Africa (6%, 95% CrI 3% to 9%) and slightly higher prevalence in white children (17%, 95% CrI 11% to 25%). This review also provides evidence that there has been a 23% increase in myopia prevalence per decade in East Asian children (adjusted odds ratio per decade 1.23, 95% CrI 1 to 1.55). In contrast over the same period, the prevalence of myopia in white children has appeared to be stable (adjusted odds ratio per decade 0.85, 95% CrI 0.69 to 1.05). However, a study in the UK published since the review was done, has suggested that there has been an increase in myopia prevalence in white children, albeit to a smaller degree (from 7% in the 1960s to 16% between 2006 to 2008) (<LINK REF="REF-McCullough-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 2016</LINK>).</P><P>Uncorrected refractive error is an important cause of visual impairment in children. Approximately 1% of children (13 million) worldwide are estimated to be visually impaired due to uncorrected refractive error (<LINK REF="REF-Resnikoff-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnikoff 2008</LINK>). There is important global variation in the prevalence of visual impairment due to uncorrected refractive error ranging from 0.034% in the Western Pacific Region (A) to 5.94% in China (<LINK REF="REF-Resnikoff-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnikoff 2008</LINK>). Studies show that children with refractive error often do not have spectacles or are not wearing optimal correction (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2012</LINK>).</P><P>Uncorrected visual acuity deficit has been shown to have a negative impact on academic performance in some (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstand-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstand 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maples-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maples 2003</LINK>; ) but not all (<LINK REF="REF-Dirani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dirani 2010</LINK>) studies. Qualitative studies have described how uncorrected visual deficits may lead to reduced focus, perseverance and class participation, affecting academic performance and leading to psychosocial stress (<LINK REF="REF-Dudovitz-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dudovitz 2016</LINK>),</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-02-08 15:54:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><P>Vision screening involves testing the visual acuity of children in schools or communities with the aim of identifying children with reduced vision.</P><P>Reduced vision is detected at screening using age-appropriate visual acuity tests; commonly letter, picture, illiterate E or Landolt C optotypes. Although visual impairment and refractive error are correlated, the level at which refractive error becomes significant enough to impact on visual performance varies considerably depending on the individual and measurement-specific variables (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Data from the Sydney Myopia Study suggests that uncorrected visual acuity of 6/9.5 or less has a high sensitivity (97.8%) and specificity (97.1%) for detecting refractive errors in adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Leone-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leone 2010</LINK>). Similar results were seen in the NICER study in Northern Ireland (UK) (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donoghue-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donoghue 2012</LINK>).</P><P>Treatment for reduced visual acuity due to refractive error in school age children usually consists of optical correction of the error. Spectacles are a simple and effective means of correcting refractive error and are the most widely used treatment. Contact lenses are used as an alternative to spectacles in specific clinical circumstances (keratoconus, severe anisometropia, high refractive power) mainly in high-income countries but increasingly also in urban centres of low- and middle-income countries.</P><P>Provision of optical correction requires measurement of the type and degree of refractive error in each eye. This can be done clinically (by retinoscopy) or by an automated refractometer. The optical centres of the corrective lenses in spectacles must align with the visual axis of each eye. Spectacles without astigmatic correction and where the refractive error is the same in both eyes can be mass produced at low cost. These are known as 'ready-made' spectacles.</P><P>Optical correction of the refractive error will result in a more or less immediate improvement in visual acuity to a normal level, if spectacles are worn. Whether or not children wear spectacles is an important determinant of a screening programme's success. The availability, affordability and acceptability of spectacles may affect whether any that are prescribed are actually worn. Barriers to spectacle use are likely to be complex and include cultural and economic factors. Over-prescribing, whereby spectacles are prescribed for insignificant refractive error is probably one important factor leading to a low proportion of children wearing prescribed spectacles (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2012</LINK>). Other factors may include concerns over appearance, teasing from peers, discomfort, negative parental attitudes, cost, and beliefs that spectacles will lead to weaker eyes.</P><P>There is debate as to whether optical correction can result in persistence of a refractive error that might otherwise have naturally resolved or reduced. Animal experiments suggest that emmetropisation may be affected by optical correction (<LINK REF="REF-Hung-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hung 1995</LINK>). Currently available evidence from human populations does not provide support for this hypothesis (<LINK REF="REF-Walline-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walline 2011</LINK>).</P><P>Visual acuity screening programmes vary with regard to who carries out the testing, for example teachers, nurses, optometrists, parents, other volunteers or computer programs (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2012</LINK>). Vision screening programmes can be provided as part of the government healthcare system or can be run by non-governmental organisations, such as charities or the private sector.</P><P>Regular screening activities for correctable visual acuity deficits are concentrated in high-income countries. In Ohio USA, for example, children are screened at kindergarten and then bi-annually throughout their school careers (<LINK REF="REF-Ohio-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohio 2004</LINK>); in Sweden visual acuity is measured in pre-school age children and again at seven and 10 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Kvarnstrom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kvarnstrom 2001</LINK>). In the UK routine vision screening is recommended for four- to five-year-old children only (<LINK REF="REF-PHE-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHE 2017</LINK>). Although screening programmes have been introduced in lower-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Limburg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Limburg 1999</LINK>) the great majority of children never receive an eye examination and access to health services is often limited, especially in rural areas (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ma-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wedner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wedner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wedner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wedner 2003</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-01-24 16:39:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Vision screening for correctable visual acuity deficit is expected to work by identifying children who require spectacles, but who currently do not have them, and enabling access to spectacles for those children. One of the roles of mass vision screening in this context is to improve equity of access to care.</P><P>It should be noted that visual acuity screening programmes for undetected, correctable visual acuity deficits will inevitably identify some children with reduced vision due to causes other than refractive error, for example cataract or amblyopia, although these will occur much less commonly than refractive error. Whilst these conditions are not the focus of this review, we will describe any data found regarding the proportions of such conditions detected by screening.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-01-24 16:39:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Given the high prevalence of visual impairment due to uncorrected refractive errors in children, and the simplicity of treatment, the detection and correction of refractive errors has been made one of the priorities of the World Health Organization (WHO) Vision 2020 initiative (<LINK REF="REF-Resnikoff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnikoff 2001</LINK>).

While other causes of reduced vision may also be detected these occur relatively infrequently (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2017</LINK>). Vision screening for refractive error in school-age children is not expected to impact on the prevalence of refractive error itself but aims to reduce the prevalence of uncorrected refractive error. To achieve this, vision screening programmes must not only reliably detect the target condition but also ensure that treatment, in whatever form, is available, affordable and can be realistically implemented. The remit of this review was to identify RCTs (including cluster-randomised controlled trials) that evaluated the effectiveness of screening as an intervention.</P><P>We identified seven relevant studies. Five of these studies were conducted in China with one study in India and one in Tanzania. Children enrolled in these studies were aged between 10 and 18 years. None of these studies compared vision screening for correctable visual acuity deficits versus not screening.</P><P>Two studies compared vision screening with provision of free spectacles versus vision screening with no provision of free spectacles (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). These studies provide high-certainty evidence that vision screening with provision of free spectacles results in a higher proportion of children wearing spectacles than if vision screening is accompanied by provision of a prescription only. The studies suggest that if approximately 250 per 1000 children who are given vision screening plus prescription only are wearing spectacles at follow-up (three to six months) then 400 per 1000 (335 to 470) would be expected to be wearing spectacles after vision screening and provision of free spectacles. Costs were reported in one study in Tanzania in 2008 and indicated a relatively low cost of screening and spectacle provision but the extent to which these can be extrapolated to other locations is unclear. One study investigated the effect of combining a teacher incentive with free spectacles and found that this may also improve spectacle wearing. Other pre-specified outcomes of this review were not reported.</P><P>Two studies explored the effect of an educational intervention in addition to vision screening on spectacle wear (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). There was little apparent effect of the education interventions investigated in these studies in addition to vision screening, compared to vision screening alone in terms of spectacle wearing. Other outcomes were not reported.</P><P>Three studies compared vision screening with ready-made spectacles versus vision screening with custom-made spectacles (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). These studies provide moderate-certainty evidence that the two types of spectacles provide similar visual results and quality of life, and high-certainty evidence of no important difference in spectacle wearing. There was low-certainty evidence that the adverse effects or symptoms were similar in the two groups. Although none of the studies reported on costs directly, ready-made spectacles are cheaper and may represent considerable cost savings for vision screening programmes in lower-income settings.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-01-26 10:57:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>VIsion screening programmes directed to school-age children and adolescents take place in many different contexts throughout the world. They may be affected by the background prevalence of refractive error as well as the organisation and delivery of eye healthcare services in the locality, including access to affordable spectacles. The purpose and impact of vision screening may be different at different ages, for example, screening at school entry (age four to five years) differs from screening at older ages. Evidence provided in this review may not, therefore, be universally applicable and must be interpreted in context.</P><P>There are a wide variety of approaches to school-age vision screening throughout the world. Some commentators have observed that the existence of these variations, both between and within countries, is a reflection of the low-certainty evidence base (<LINK REF="REF-Rahi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahi 2002</LINK>). It is not the aim of the current review to provide a summary of current vision screening programmes but for relevant reviews see <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Hopkins-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopkins 2013</LINK>. The studies in the current review were from Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Africa. As such, the results of these studies may be more applicable to low- and middle-income settings. The children included in these trials were aged 10 to 18 years. The results of these studies will not apply to vision screening at school entry (four to five years in many countries).</P><P>This review does not provide a direct answer to the question as to what are the benefits and harms of vision screening programmes in school-age children and adolescents. We did not identify any randomised controlled trials addressing that question. However, the included studies that compare provision of free spectacles (<LINK REF="STD-SIL-2014" TYPE="STUDY">SIL 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wedner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wedner 2008</LINK>) demonstrated reasonably large differences in spectacle wearing and these were not associated with any important adverse effects. in particular <LINK REF="STD-SIL-2014" TYPE="STUDY">SIL 2014</LINK> provides evidence that spectacle wearing did not lead to an increased progression of myopia and this is supported by other evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Walline-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walline 2011</LINK>).</P><P>The evidence on the provision of free spectacles is reasonably robust and will be applicable to settings where such provision is not currently available. The review also provides reasonably conclusive evidence that cheaper, ready-made spectacles may be an acceptable alternative to expensive, custom-made spectacles in children without astigmatism or anisometropia. The finding that educational interventions, as tested so far, do not appear to be effective in improving spectacle wear may also be applicable to other higher-income settings. It is notable that the prevalence of spectacle wearing in the comparator group in the included studies varied from 25% to 75% and possibly higher. The reasons for variation in spectacle wear are not clearly understood but may include over-prescribing, concerns over appearance, teasing, discomfort and beliefs around spectacle wearing (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2012</LINK>).</P><P>There may be unanticipated economic effects of provision of free spectacles. A recently published trial has tested out a model for sustainable provision of free spectacles (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2017</LINK>). Offering an upgrade option (stylish designs and scratch-free coatings) to free spectacles resulted in greater percentage of children purchasing spectacles and increased programme income.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Certainty of the evidence</HEADING><P>The certainty of the evidence ranged from high to low, depending on the outcome.</P><P>We judged the studies largely to be at low risk of bias and judged the estimates of effect from each individual study as reasonably secure, downgrading only for imprecision as needed for each individual effect estimate. We were concerned with the applicability of the evidence with respect to location and downgraded for indirectness, depending on the comparison and the outcome. The extent to which the findings may be extrapolated to other settings was sometimes unclear.</P></SUBSECTION></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-02-08 16:17:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah"><P>Two of the review authors (JE/PM) were involved in one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Morjaria-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Morjaria 2016</LINK>).

This finding may be applicable to other parts of the world but currently it is unclear if it is. Such studies could usefully be done in other countries and should be accompanied by formal cost-effectiveness analyses. Where there is the intention to introduce a new screening programme, the opportunity to carry out a randomised controlled trial should not be missed, so that the potential benefits or harms of this intervention can be measured. Outcomes should include both the prevalence of uncorrected visual acuity deficit as well as quality of life and educational outcomes. Further evidence on the progression of myopia is also needed.</P><P>There was considerable variation in spectacle wearing in the studies included in this review.

Children then were given self-refracting spectacles (Adspecs; Adlens, Ltd., Oxford, UK) and were directed to adjust the spectacle power to optimise vision in each eye and then to read the assignments again.

The trained personnel, who had various backgrounds, took part in the study screening examinations in their own townships. Spectacles were available at the vision centers at a cost of USD 10 and up.
