<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-22 09:49:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Magnesium does not reduce preterm birth or improve the outcome for the infant when given to women after contractions of preterm labour have been stopped.</P>
<P>Babies born preterm, before 37 weeks of pregnancy, may not survive or they may have later physical health and developmental problems if they do survive. Women whose preterm labour is stopped with tocolytic therapy (medication to reduce uterine contractions) remain at high risk of preterm birth. A variety of agents (tocolytics) are used to halt the uterine contractions. These include betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, magnesium sulphate, and oxytocin receptor antagonists. Subsequent tocolytic maintenance medication has been advocated. Oral and intravenous magnesium has been used to prevent further early contractions.</P>
<P>We included four randomised controlled trials involving a total of 422 women in this review. The trials did not demonstrate any differences between magnesium maintenance therapy and placebo or other treatments (ritodrine or terbutaline) in the prevention of preterm birth or perinatal deaths. The trials were too small to exclude either important benefits or harms from magnesium maintenance therapy. Magnesium was less likely than the alternative tocolytics (betamimetics) to result in side effects, particularly palpitations or tachycardia, although diarrhoea was more likely. This finding is based on very few studies of low quality, and none of them looked at the infants' later development.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-26 15:03:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>We included four trials involving 422 women. Three trials had high risk of bias and none included any long-term follow-up of infants. No differences in the incidence of preterm birth or perinatal mortality were seen when magnesium maintenance therapy was compared with placebo or no treatment; or alternative therapies (ritodrine or terbutaline). The risk ratio (RR) for preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) for magnesium compared with placebo or no treatment was 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.40 (two trials, 99 women); and 0.99, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.72 (two trials, 100 women) for magnesium compared with alternative therapies. The RR for perinatal mortality for magnesium compared with placebo or no treatment was 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 99.16 (one trial, 50 infants); and 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 99.16 (one trial, 50 infants) for magnesium compared with alternative treatments.</P>
<P>Women taking magnesium preparations were less likely to report side effects (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96, three trials, 237 women), including palpitations or tachycardia (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.52, three trials, 237 women) than women receiving alternative therapies. Women receiving magnesium were however, more likely to experience diarrhoea (RR 6.79, 95% CI 1.26 to 36.72, three trials, 237 women).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-22 09:49:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-02-22 09:13:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) is the principal cause of early neonatal mortality and morbidity and causes both significant immediate health problems and substantial long-term problems in a proportion of surviving babies (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saigal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saigal 2008</LINK>). Additionally, women who give birth to preterm babies are at increased risk of psychological distress (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 2002</LINK>). Prevention of preterm birth remains an important priority.</P>
<P>Preterm labour, defined as birth occurring before 37 completed weeks' gestation, is a major cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Saigal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saigal 2008</LINK>). A substantial proportion of women who have an episode of threatened preterm labour are actively treated with agents to stop the uterine contractions (acute tocolytic therapy). Women whose preterm labour is successfully arrested with acute tocolytic therapy still remain at risk of preterm birth until they reach 37 weeks of gestation, and they may therefore be treated with agents aimed at further prolonging gestation (maintenance tocolytic therapy).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-02-22 09:49:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>A variety of therapeutic tocolytic agents that inhibit uterine contractions have been used to halt uterine activity in women in preterm labour and so prevent preterm birth. Separate Cochrane systematic reviews assessing betamimetics (<LINK REF="REF-Anotayanonth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anotayanonth 2004</LINK>), calcium channel blockers (<LINK REF="REF-King-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2003</LINK>), magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>), and oxytocin receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2005</LINK>) cover these topics.</P>
<P>Women whose preterm labour is initially arrested with tocolytic therapy remain at high risk of preterm birth until they reach full term. For these women, the use of subsequent tocolytic maintenance medication has been advocated to reduce the risk of recurrence of preterm labour and to prevent preterm birth. Clinical practice guidelines vary as to when maintenance tocolysis is recommended to commence, but this usually begins once initial tocolytic medications have ceased. The maintenance tocolysis is usually given as oral medications and the duration of use is variable.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-06-08 08:32:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Magnesium was described as having an effect on uterine contractility, by increasing the duration of labour, in the late 1950s (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1959</LINK>). The exact mechanism of magnesium as a tocolytic agent (for initial use or for maintenance) is only partially understood. Magnesium decreases the frequency of depolarisation of smooth muscle, by modulating calcium uptake, binding and distribution in smooth muscle cells. The net result is inhibition of uterine contractions. However, the use of magnesium for tocolysis is not without risk of side effects, including diarrhoea, tachycardia and palpitations. In particular, uncoated magnesium salts are not used orally for maintenance therapy because of their potential to cause adverse gastrointestinal effects (<LINK REF="STD-Ricci-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ricci 1991</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-02-22 09:49:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of maintenance tocolytic therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent preterm labour is unproven for women who have an episode of preterm labour that stops after acute tocolytics (<LINK REF="REF-Sanchez_x002d_Ramos-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez-Ramos 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review assesses the efficacy of magnesium tocolytic maintenance therapy after preterm labour has been successfully arrested with initial tocolytic therapy. Another four Cochrane reviews have addressed other therapies for tocolytic maintenance therapy namely the use of terbutaline pumps (<LINK REF="REF-Nanda-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nanda 2002</LINK>); oral betamimetics (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2006</LINK>); calcium channel blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Gaunekar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaunekar 2004</LINK>) and oxytocin antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2009</LINK>).</P>

We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. Where there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or where substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we have used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary where an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we have discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect had not been clinically meaningful, we would not have combined trials.</P>

<P>Women taking magnesium preparations were less likely to report palpitations or tachycardia than women receiving alternative treatments (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.52, three trials, 237 women; I² = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>) but were much more likely to experience diarrhoea (RR 6.79, 95% CI 1.26 to 36.72, three trials, 237 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>). Considering the outcome diarrhoea, we identified moderate statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis (T² = 0.95; I² = 43%) and thus a random-effects model was used (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>). As above, it is possible that the differing comparison treatments across the three trials contributed to this heterogeneity.</P>
<P>No differences between groups were shown for the side effects nausea (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.70, three trials, 237 women; I² = 0%) or vomiting (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.06, three trials, 237 women; T² = 0.73; I² = 60%).</P>
<P>No data were available from the included trials for other indicators of neonatal morbidity (a low Apgar score at five minutes, use of mechanical ventilation, or pulmonary air leak, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, patent ductus arteriosus and neonatal infection). There were no data on the mother's assessment of therapy, or on costs.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Magnesium versus alternative treatment, placebo or no treatment (high-quality trials only)</HEADING>
<P>When the pre-specified sensitivity analyses were undertaken to examine the influence of study quality, <LINK REF="STD-Holcomb-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Holcomb 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ricci-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ricci 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ridgway-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ridgway 1990</LINK> were excluded because the randomisation and allocation concealment processes were unclear in these trials.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Rust-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rust 1996</LINK> study was at low risk of bias on randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcomes assessment and selective reporting, but 18% of women were lost to follow-up in this trial and it was unclear whether the incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed. The <LINK REF="STD-Rust-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rust 1996</LINK> trial found no significant difference between magnesium and terbutaline or magnesium and placebo on gestational age at birth, although it found magnesium to be more favourable than terbutaline for reducing length of stay for the infant (MD -4.4 days, 95% CI -8.69 to -0.11). The authors note that this benefit may be due to the confounding effect of the larger number of twins in the terbutaline group, and report that when twins were controlled for, neither magnesium or terbutaline showed beneficial or detrimental effects on maternal or neonatal outcomes. In this trial, women taking magnesium were more likely than those in the placebo group to experience side effects (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.20), although there was no difference seen between magnesium and terbutaline (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.24), the latter being consistent with the two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ricci-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ricci 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridgway-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ridgway 1990</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-08 08:33:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Given that magnesium has been used widely for many years as tocolytic maintenance medication in women who have had an episode of threatened preterm labour, it was surprising that evidence to support its use was so sparse. Of the four trials identified, only one was rated of reasonable quality for randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcomes assessment and free of selective reporting. The trials available for inclusion in this review do not demonstrate any differences between magnesium maintenance therapy and placebo or other treatments in the prevention of preterm birth or perinatal mortality. However, the trials were too small to exclude either important benefits or harms from magnesium maintenance therapy. Magnesium was less likely than the alternative tocolytics (betamimetics) to result in side effects, particularly palpitations or tachycardia, although diarrhoea was more likely.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-26 15:02:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following methods were used to assess <LINK REF="STD-Holcomb-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Holcomb 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ricci-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ricci 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridgway-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ridgway 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rust-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rust 1996</LINK>.</P>
<P>Trials under consideration were evaluated for inclusion and methodological quality, without consideration of their results. These assessments were performed separately by each reviewer with discrepancies resolved by discussion. There was no blinding of authorship.</P>
<P>Quality scores for concealment of allocation were assigned to each trial using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2002</LINK>). A = adequate, B = unclear, C = inadequate, D = not used.</P>
<P>In addition, quality scores were assigned to each trial for completeness of follow-up and blinding as described below.</P>
<P>Completeness of follow-up:<BR/>(A) less than 3% of participants lost to follow-up;<BR/>(B) 3% to less than 10% of participants lost to follow-up;<BR/>(C) 10% to less than 20% of participants lost to follow-up;<BR/>(D) 20% or more lost to follow-up;<BR/>(E) unclear.</P>
<P>For blinding:<BR/>(A) neither investigator, outcome assessor, nor participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated treatment;<BR/>(B) either the investigator, outcome assessor, or the participant knew the allocation, or it is likely that for a significant proportion (at least 20%) of participants the allocation could be correctly identified;<BR/>(C) no blinding, investigator, outcome assessor and participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated treatment;<BR/>(D) unclear.</P>
<P>Data were extracted independently by the two reviewers and double entered. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. There was no blinding of authorship. Whenever possible, unpublished data were sought from investigators.</P>
<P>A priori it was decided that all eligible trials would be included in the initial analyses and sensitivity analyses would be carried out to evaluate the effects of trial quality. It was planned to do this through excluding trials given less than an A rating for quality for concealment of allocation, then D or E for completeness of follow-up, then C or D for blinding.</P>
<P>Dichotomous outcomes are presented in the form of relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (fixed-effect model). Continuous outcomes are presented as weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (fixed-effect model).</P>
