<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Each year more than 28,000 kidney transplants are performed globally. Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for eligible people who have lost kidney function. Most kidney transplant recipients receive corticosteroids as part of their immunosuppression treatment. Steroids are effective in preventing acute rejection, which is a major problem in the early period after kidney transplantation. However, steroids can also lead to serious side effects when taken long-term. This review looked at two strategies to reduce steroid administration after kidney transplantation: either discontinuing steroids soon after transplantation (within 14 days) or stopping steroid treatment later.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we do?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the literature up to February 2016 and identified 48 studies (7803 patients) that were evaluated in this review. Only three studies included children. This is an update of a review that was last published in 2009.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>Our review looked at data relating to 7803 kidney transplant recipients. We assessed the risk of bias in all studies and found that most were unblinded, about half did not report funding sources or how they randomised and allocated study participants.</P>
<P>We found that the risk of acute rejection significantly increased with both steroid-reducing treatments among adults who received kidney transplants. There was no little or no difference in the numbers of deaths or loss of transplanted kidneys for both steroid-reducing strategies within five years after kidney transplantation. Side effects, such as infection, cancer or diabetes after transplantation did not differ between groups of patients whose steroids were discontinued compared with those who continued to take steroids. The effect of steroid withdrawal in children is unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>There was no evidence to suggest a difference in patient mortality or graft loss up to five year after transplantation, but longer-term consequences of steroid avoidance and withdrawal still remain unclear.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-07-20 15:03:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Steroid-sparing strategies have been attempted in recent decades to avoid morbidity from long-term steroid intake among kidney transplant recipients. Previous systematic reviews of steroid withdrawal after kidney transplantation have shown a significant increase in acute rejection. There are various protocols to withdraw steroids after kidney transplantation and their possible benefits or harms are subject to systematic review. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.</P>

<P>Assessment of risk of bias and data extraction was performed by two authors independently and disagreement resolved by discussion. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-01 17:16:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>We included 48 studies (224 reports) that involved 7803 randomised participants. Of these, three studies were conducted in children (346 participants). The 2009 review included 30 studies (94 reports, 5949 participants). Risk of bias was assessed as low for sequence generation in 19 studies and allocation concealment in 14 studies. Incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed in 22 studies and 37 were free of selective reporting.</P>
<P>The 48 included studies evaluated three different comparisons: steroid avoidance or withdrawal compared with steroid maintenance, and steroid avoidance compared with steroid withdrawal. For the adult studies there was no significant difference in patient mortality either in studies comparing steroid withdrawal versus steroid maintenance (10 studies, 1913 participants, death at one year post transplantation: RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.30) or in studies comparing steroid avoidance versus steroid maintenance (10 studies, 1462 participants, death at one year after transplantation: RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.80). Similarly no significant difference in graft loss was found comparing steroid withdrawal versus steroid maintenance (8 studies, 1817 participants, graft loss excluding death with functioning graft at one year after transplantation: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.92) and comparing steroid avoidance versus steroid maintenance (7 studies, 1211 participants, graft loss excluding death with functioning graft at one year after transplantation: RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.86). The risk of acute rejection significantly increased in patients treated with steroids for less than 14 days after transplantation (7 studies, 835 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.30) and in patients who were withdrawn from steroids at a later time point after transplantation (10 studies, 1913 participants, RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.61). There was no evidence to suggest a difference in harmful events, such as infection and malignancy, in adult kidney transplant recipients. The effect of steroid withdrawal in children is unclear.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-18 18:00:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>This updated review increases the evidence that steroid avoidance and withdrawal after kidney transplantation significantly increase the risk of acute rejection. There was no evidence to suggest a difference in patient mortality or graft loss up to five year after transplantation, but long-term consequences of steroid avoidance and withdrawal remain unclear until today, because prospective long-term studies have not been conducted.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-07-20 16:55:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-07-20 16:55:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have to undergo renal replacement therapy which is available either as dialysis or kidney transplantation. Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for eligible patients with ESKD, because it offers a nearly normal life and is associated with better survival and quality of life compared to dialysis treatment. More than 16,000 kidney transplants are currently performed annually in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-OPTN_x002f_SRTR-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">OPTN/SRTR 2014</LINK>) and more than 12,000 in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-ERA_x002d_EDTA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERA-EDTA 2013</LINK>). Despite kidney transplants from live donors, organ demand exceeds organ availability worldwide and the number of patients wait listed for kidney transplantation continues to rise (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ERA_x002d_EDTA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERA-EDTA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OPTN_x002f_SRTR-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">OPTN/SRTR 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although short-term outcomes of kidney transplantation have continuously improved since the 1980s, long-term results have only marginally improved until today. Death with a functioning graft and chronic allograft nephropathy are the most important causes of graft loss (<LINK REF="REF-Pascual-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual 2002</LINK>). Thus, strategies that prolong patient survival and graft patency have become a priority in kidney transplantation.</P>
<P>One of the key factors that influence transplant outcomes is immunosuppression which prohibits progressive immune mediated injury of the allograft. Standard immunosuppressive protocols nowadays consist of an initial induction treatment followed by a maintenance regimen. Immunosuppression is induced by an intensive treatment for the initial days after transplantation either with higher dosages of the immunosuppressive drugs or by adding an additional immunosuppressive agent, such as anti-T-cell antibodies or interleukin 2 receptor antibodies. Maintenance immunosuppression usually comprises a combination of three drug groups: calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporin (CsA) or tacrolimus (TAC), anti-proliferative agents, such as azathioprine (AZA) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, such as prednisolone.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids are long known for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties and have been used to prevent rejection since the early days of kidney transplantation. Although steroids are effective in preventing acute rejection, chronic steroid use may be an important cause of morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Opelz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opelz 2005</LINK>). Steroids exhibit a wide range of adverse effects, such as skin fragility, bodyweight gain, osteoporosis and cataracts, can adversely affect important cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors including hypertension, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia and may contribute to an increased risk of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Coutinho-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coutinho 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Czock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2001</LINK>). A literature review on the safety of low dose glucocorticoid treatment in rheumatoid arthritis suggested that the toxicity of steroids is overestimated, because adverse effects of chronic low dose steroid treatment (&#8804; 10 mg/d prednisolone equivalent) were found to be modest and rarely statistically significantly different from placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Da-Silva-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Da Silva 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-15 17:25:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>With the aim to reduce the adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy, there has been much effort to limit the exposure of kidney transplant recipients to steroids. Lessening exposure to steroids can be achieved by either steroid avoidance or steroid withdrawal. In steroid avoidance, steroids are either avoided completely or withdrawn within the first days after kidney transplantation and steroid withdrawal refers to discontinuation of steroids at a certain time point in the later post-transplant phase. This review evaluated all steroid avoidance or withdrawal strategies in kidney transplant recipients.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-07-20 14:55:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Steroids show adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects and therefore discontinuing steroid treatment may take effect by a decrease in this accelerated cardiovascular risk. However, while steroid avoidance and withdrawal potentially reduces post-transplant atherosclerosis, ischaemic heart disease, post-transplant diabetes and death, it may significantly increase the risk of acute rejection. Acute rejection is associated with late graft loss, especially if rejection episodes are severe, followed by impaired kidney function, occur late and affect arteries (<LINK REF="REF-Basadonna-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basadonna 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Massy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massy 1996</LINK>). The new immunosuppressants TAC and MMF have led to important declines in the incidence of acute rejection and may provide a more potent substrate to attempt safe steroid-free immunosuppression or steroid withdrawal.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-07-20 16:52:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>It is important to reduce the cardiovascular risk in kidney transplant recipients, who area population at increased cardiovascular risk, but at the same time it is important to avoid rejection and graft loss. Steroids have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk in kidney transplant recipients, but long-term benefits and harms of steroid discontinuation have not yet been established with controlled long-term data (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2010</LINK>). Prednisone was perceived as the least effective and least favoured immunosuppressive drug compared to calcineurin inhibitors, MMF and AZA in a survey among Canadian kidney transplant recipients and the majority of US transplant physicians and surgeons stated that steroid-free immunosuppression was a goal for future organ transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Hricik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hricik 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prasad-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 2003</LINK>). Steroid use varies largely in clinical practice around the globe. While steroids are discontinued in many centres worldwide, they are at the same time frequently used for long-term treatment in kidney transplant recipients to protect the allograft. There is no consensus whether discontinuation of steroids is safe, what type of patients benefit from steroid discontinuation and at what time point after transplantation steroids are best stopped. A number of RCTs evaluating steroid avoidance or withdrawal at various time-points after kidney transplantation with different immunosuppressive regimes have been performed during the last decades and were first systematically reviewed in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Pascual-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual 2009</LINK>). Steroid avoidance and steroid withdrawal strategies in kidney transplantation were not associated with increased patient mortality or graft loss, despite an overall higher incidence of acute rejection for steroid withdrawal strategies compared with steroid maintenance. The aim of this review was to update the benefits and harms of steroid withdrawal and avoidance in kidney transplant recipients with new evidence from RCTs.<BR/>

<P>Two authors independently carried out data extraction using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non-English language journals will be translated before assessment. Where more than one report of a study existed, reports were grouped together and the publication with the most complete data was used in the analyses. We examined any prior or subsequent report for supplementary outcomes or data to ensure the inclusion of all relevant information. If data were unclear, ambiguous or missing, authors were contacted for further information and any provided additional data was included in the review. Whenever necessary, disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>

<P>The reporting of outcome measures varied across studies. Of the 45 included studies, 34 reported patient mortality and 23 reported acute rejection (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Reporting of harms was more limited and inconsistent among studies (six studies reported cardiovascular events with varying definitions of cardiovascular events or definitions not reported).

There was no study investigating steroid avoidance compared versus steroid maintenance that was published as abstract only, consequently the influence of publication status on the effect estimates could not be tested. There was no evidence to suggest a difference in effect estimates of mortality and graft loss for studies depending on whether they have performed intention-to-treat analysis.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-01 17:16:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The aim of this review was to provide updated evidence addressing the benefits and harms of steroid avoidance and withdrawal in kidney transplant recipients. All identified studies concerned one of the three comparisons defined for this review. The majority of studies compared steroid withdrawal versus steroid maintenance (24 adult studies, 2 studies in children). Steroid avoidance was compared versus steroid maintenance in 19 studies, one of which was conducted in child kidney transplantation. Of the three studies that compared steroid avoidance versus steroid withdrawal, none involved children. In adult kidney transplantation meta-analysis could be carried out for all three comparisons, but data was particularly scarce for the comparison of steroid avoidance with steroid withdrawal. The low number of studies with child kidney transplant recipients did not enable data synthesis through meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We were unable to demonstrate clear beneficial effects, such as a reduction in mortality or NODAT within five years after transplantation for steroids withdrawal or avoidance in adult kidney transplant recipients. Both steroid withdrawal and steroid avoidance showed little or no effect on mortality, graft loss, and CMV infection. The risk of acute rejection did significantly increase by 77% after steroid withdrawal and by 58% after steroid avoidance compared to steroid maintenance (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effect of steroid withdrawal in children is uncertain. The available data allowed only one meta-analysis for acute rejection in children, which found no significant difference. Death and graft loss had not been observed in one of the two studies in children and outcomes such as biopsy-proven acute rejection and malignancy were only reported in one of the two studies which further reduced the quantity of the available data. Only one study investigated the effect of steroid avoidance compared versus steroid maintenance in children, thus a meta-analysis was not possible.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-07-20 17:00:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>An extensive literature review was performed to identify studies that assessed the benefits and harms of steroid withdrawal or avoidance in kidney transplant recipients. In general, two parameters are particularly relevant for assessing benefits and harms of steroid withdrawal in kidney transplant recipients: firstly, the time-point of steroid withdrawal after kidney transplantation and secondly, the duration of follow-up to observe outcome events in kidney transplant patients.</P>
<P>Steroids are withdrawn at various time points after kidney transplantation in clinical practice and this fact was reflected by the variety of time points used to investigate the effects of steroid withdrawal in clinical studies. We used a cut-off of 14 days after transplantation to discriminate between steroid withdrawal and steroid avoidance. With this approach we were able to combine different time points for steroid withdrawal within these clinically relevant time frames. The majority of steroid avoidance studies used steroids for seven days or less, and the majority of the steroid withdrawal studies withdrew steroids between three to six months after transplantation. Thus, our findings may not be applicable for patients who are withdrawn from steroids at other time-points after transplantation.</P>
<P>Most studies had between one and three years of follow-up after either steroid avoidance or withdrawal which constitutes a major limitation for conclusions regarding long-term consequences for patient and graft survival. Acute rejection is a major risk factor for reduced long-term graft survival and typically occurs within the first year after transplantation. The impact of acute rejection on long-term graft outcomes depends on the severity, recurrence and treatment of the acute rejection. While particularly severe and recurrent rejections increase the risk of graft loss, a single early acute rejection with complete functional recovery after treatment appears to be less harmful for long-term graft outcomes. Most of the acute rejections reported in the included studies occurred early after transplantation and were mild and easily controlled with steroids which could be an argument to conclude that an increased risk of long-term graft loss after steroid withdrawal is unlikely. However, recognizing that potential harms arising from steroid withdrawal may remain hidden for up to five years after steroid withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Gulanikar-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gulanikar 1991</LINK>); follow-up periods of the included studies were too short to determine long-term graft survival. Furthermore, it is important to stress that only half of the studies reported acute rejection. Consequently, potential harmful effects of steroid withdrawal on long-term graft survival cannot be ruled out with this review with sufficient confidence.</P>
<P>Reporting of harmful events was especially limited and inconsistent. More than half of the studies did not report adverse events such as infection and CMV infection and less than a third of the studies reported malignancy and cardiovascular events. Even though we did not find evidence to suggest a difference in harmful events, it is important to point out that the absence of evidence does not mean there is evidence for absence of effect. It is unclear which outcomes occurred in the studies that provided no data. Although we believe this is the most comprehensive evidence summary on this topic, interpretation of our findings must consider the limitations of available data from this cohort. The value of increasing available evidence of potential harms associated with interventions has been widely recognised and is also not a problem peculiar to this review, but is common to many randomised studies and systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Cuervo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuervo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tunis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunis 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one study investigating steroid avoidance included an mTOR-inhibitor as baseline immunosuppression. Consequently, we cannot extrapolate the safety of steroid avoidance or withdrawal to protocols including mTOR-inhibitors.</P>
<P>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation in the included studies may mean that our findings are not generalizable to all kidney transplant recipients. Eight studies did not specify any exclusion criteria, of which four did not specify any inclusion criteria. In three studies only recipients of a living kidney transplant were included and 11 studies included solely recipients of a cadaveric kidney transplant. Seventeen studies limited participation for patients who received their first kidney transplant and 16 studies excluded kidney transplant recipients who had experienced previous acute rejection. Kidney transplant recipients with a PRA &gt; 50% were excluded in 13 studies. It is unclear whether the findings of this review apply to kidney transplant recipients with a higher immunologic transplant risk.</P>
<P>Although almost all studies included participants of a wide range of adult ages, none of the studies reported results for different age groups. Therefore we were unable to determine whether there is any difference in results depending on age. Due to the low number of studies in child kidney transplantation, our findings need to be interpreted with great caution in the light of a clear lack of evidence in children.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-07-20 14:46:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The quality of the included studies was rather variable. The main limitations in the quality of the studies were allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, blinding of participants and personnel and disclosure of funding. Of the 48 included studies only five studies blinded participants and personnel. This was considered a high risk of bias because clinical decision making could be influenced by knowledge of the treatment, such as for example that patients withdrawn from steroids were more closely monitored for signs of acute rejection. Adequate allocation concealment was reported in 14 studies and 19 studies demonstrated adequate sequence generation. The lack of adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects in the original study and thus in a systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juni-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). All hard clinical outcomes (mortality, graft loss, acute rejection) were reported in 37 studies, but incomplete reporting of relevant data for a meta-analysis in many studies hampered use of the provided data in our analysis. Comparison of kidney function was only possible in a limited number of studies because frequently either the number of participants in whom kidney function was measured or a measure of variability of the effect estimate were not provided. It might be more informative to compare the number of patients at risk of graft loss with a low creatinine clearance rather than assessing mean data. However, these data were not provided in any of the studies. Similarly dichotomous outcomes, especially infection and acute rejection were frequently reported as rates or episodes which complicated the use of such data for meta-analysis. For disclosure of funding sources, 16 studies reported receiving of funding from pharmaceutical companies and 28 studies did not disclose their sponsor. We found that blinding of outcome assessors was adequate in 43 studies where the primary outcome were hard-clinical endpoints (mortality, graft loss, acute rejection) and considered unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-07-20 17:01:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>We searched multiple databases without language restriction in attempt to reduce publication bias. The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register contains handsearched reports of studies presented at conferences and meetings, but there is a possibility that we missed unpublished data presented at smaller conferences or studies published in foreign language journals and low impact journals. Studies may have been added since our last search of the register. Not all included studies reported all outcomes which may have affected the results of the meta-analysis.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-07-20 17:03:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Several previous systematic reviews have addressed steroid avoidance and withdrawal after kidney transplantation. The first review included three steroid withdrawal and four steroid avoidance studies in patients on CsA with or without AZA and showed a significant increase in acute rejection with an incidence of acute rejection of 48% in those withdrawn from steroids versus 30% in those maintained on steroids (P = 0.012) (<LINK REF="REF-Hricik-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hricik 1993</LINK>). The review published seven years later (<LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 2000</LINK>) included 10 studies and showed an increased proportion of patients with acute rejection by 0.14 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.17; P &lt; 0.001) and an increase in graft failure after steroid withdrawal by 40% (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.70; P = 0.012). Most studies included in this meta-analysis used CsA-based immunosuppression with either no anti-metabolite added or in combination with AZA. Only two studies with MMF were included and subgroup analysis showed similar results for these studies compared versus those that did not include MMF. A review of six studies of steroid withdrawal in kidney transplant recipients on triple therapy with calcineurin inhibitors and MMF showed an increase in acute rejection and no difference in graft failure (<LINK REF="REF-Pascual-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual 2004</LINK>). Due to the relative short follow-up in these six studies long-term consequences for graft survival given the observed increase in acute rejection after steroid withdrawal is unclear. A meta-analysis published in 2012 by <LINK REF="REF-Knight-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2010</LINK> found an increased risk of acute rejection and a reduced cardiovascular risk after steroid withdrawal or avoidance, but these findings resulted from a combined analysis of all steroid withdrawal or avoidance time points and were based on surrogate outcomes such as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and NODAT. Another review (<LINK REF="REF-Pascual-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual 2012</LINK>) with nine studies comparing steroid avoidance to steroid maintenance in kidney transplant recipients who received an immunosuppressive regimen consisting of antibody induction, either CsA or TAC and MMF reported that the increased risk of acute rejection in steroid avoidance was lost when patients received TAC-based immunosuppression.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-07-20 14:48:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Steroid avoidance and steroid withdrawal after kidney transplantation significantly increased the risk of acute rejection. We found no evidence to suggest a difference in patient and graft survival up to five years after transplantation, but the data to support the absence of harm is limited due to the low number of events observed in rather small studies. Follow-up periods were too short to draw any conclusions on long-term outcomes in kidney transplant recipients after steroid withdrawal or avoidance. In child kidney transplant recipients data is very limited and does not allow any conclusions about steroid withdrawal, but caution is warranted with induction treatment that may increase the risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease in children.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-07-20 12:29:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Proving that steroid avoidance or withdrawal after kidney transplantation is safe and beneficial requires demonstration of beneficial effects, such as a reduction in patient mortality or cardiovascular events while at the same time graft survival is not reduced in the long-term. Until now, only short-term data exist that demonstrate an increased risk of acute rejection and the absence of evidence of harm, but there is no long-term data to draw any conclusions about the harms and benefits of steroid avoidance or withdrawal beyond five years after transplantation. Long-term RCTs are needed to determine whether steroid withdrawal and avoidance after kidney transplantation are safe and beneficial. Child kidney transplant recipients constitute a target population in a clear need of well-conducted steroid withdrawal studies.</P>
