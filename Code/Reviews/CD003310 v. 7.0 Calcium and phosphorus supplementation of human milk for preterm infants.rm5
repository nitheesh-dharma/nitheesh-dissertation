<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-02-23 08:47:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>When babies are born too early (preterm), they have very low stores of the minerals calcium and phosphorus needed for healthy bones and growth. Human milk may not contain sufficient minerals for these babies.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Calcium and phosphorus are essential for healthy bones and normal growth and development. When a baby is born preterm and does not receive enough calcium and phosphorus, bone fractures and poor growth can occur.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for evidence in April 2016 and identified one randomised controlled trial including 40 babies. Investigators reported a small decrease in the concentration of alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme involved in bone growth) among infants who had received calcium/phosphorus supplementation. We found no difference in growth between infants who had been given human milk supplemented with extra calcium and phosphorus and infants who had received no supplementation. One small trial provided the evidence, and we judged the evidence to be of low quality. Researchers reported no follow-up of these babies into childhood.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean? </B>
</P>
<P>Evidence is insufficient to allow a judgement as to whether extra calcium and/or phosphorus provided to preterm babies confers benefit for their bones and growth. It is no longer very common to give calcium and phosphorus supplements alone, as human milk fortifiers now available include many other components as well as minerals to support the growth and development of preterm babies. We therefore suggest that future trials conducted to examine effects of mineral supplements in preterm babies include them in multi-component human milk fortifiers and assess clinically important outcomes into childhood.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-02-22 04:10:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 14 April 2016), Embase (1980 to 14 April 2016) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 14 April 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases (11 May 2016) and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials<B>.</B>

<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing supplementation of human milk with calcium and/or phosphorus versus no supplementation in hospitalised preterm infants were eligible for inclusion in this review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-02-22 04:16:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (JB, JW) independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We reported dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the quality of evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-23 08:47:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a 2001 review that identified no eligible trials. One trial including 40 infants met the inclusion criteria for this review. Using GRADE criteria, we judged the quality of the evidence as low owing to risk of bias (inadequate reporting of methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and/or blinding) and imprecision (wide confidence intervals and data from a single small trial). We found no evidence of a difference between calcium and phosphorus supplementation versus no supplementation for neonatal growth outcomes (weight, length, head circumference) at any time point reported (two, four or six weeks postnatal age). At six weeks postnatal age, supplementation with calcium/phosphorus was associated with a decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase concentration (MD -56.85 IU/L, 95% CI -101.27 to -12.43; one randomised controlled trial (RCT); n = 40 infants). Investigators provided no data on growth at 12 to 18 months, neonatal fractures, feed intolerance, breastfeeding or any of the prespecified childhood outcomes for this review (fractures, growth, neurodevelopmental outcomes).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-23 07:50:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified one small trial including only 40 infants that compared supplementation of human milk with calcium and phosphorus versus no supplementation in hospitalised preterm infants. We judged the evidence to be of low quality and found no evidence of differences between groups for clinically important outcomes including growth and fractures. Although serum alkaline phosphatase concentration was reduced in the group receiving supplementation at six weeks postnatal age, this difference is unlikely to be of clinical significance. We conclude that evidence is insufficient to determine whether benefit or harm ensues when human milk is supplemented with calcium and/or phosphorus for the hospitalised preterm infant. We see no advantage of conducting further trials of this intervention because with the advent of multi-component human milk fortifier, supplementation of human milk with calcium and/or phosphorus alone is no longer common practice. Future trials should consider assessing effects of multi-component fortifiers with different mineral compositions on clinically important outcomes during the neonatal period and in later childhood.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-24 17:49:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-02-23 07:51:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Human milk is the recommended nutritional source for full-term infants during at least the first six months of postnatal life (http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/). For this group, breast milk supplies adequate substrate to meet the infant's nutritional demands and provides the infant with other substances that may afford some physiological advantage (e.g. immunoglobulins, gastrointestinal hormones). Breastfeeding may also contribute to maternal-infant bonding.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-24 17:49:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Human milk is recommended for enteral feeding of all preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Academy of Pediatrics 2014</LINK>). However, human milk provides insufficient quantities of various nutrients, including calcium and phosphorus, to meet the estimated needs of these infants.</P>
<P>Two-thirds of fetal body mineral content is acquired during the third trimester of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Itani-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Itani 1991</LINK>). Therefore, preterm infants are born with low skeletal stores of calcium and phosphorus and require very high quantities of these minerals if they are to attain adequate postnatal skeletal growth. These requirements may not be met by feeding human milk alone (<LINK REF="REF-Bhatia-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatia 2007</LINK>). Observational studies have shown that preterm infants fed human milk alone may have hypophosphataemia (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 1983</LINK>), radiological evidence of poor bone mineralisation (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1979</LINK>) and elevated alkaline phosphatase activity (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1984</LINK>), and all of this may be associated with fractures and lower than expected growth rates (<LINK REF="REF-Bhatia-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatia 2007</LINK>). Furthermore, early bone mineral content may predict peak bone mineral density and therefore lifelong fracture risk (<LINK REF="REF-Winsloe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winsloe 2009</LINK>). On the other hand, calcium and phosphorus supplements can be associated with adverse effects such as hypercalcaemia, feed intolerance (<LINK REF="REF-Bozzetti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bozzetti 2009</LINK>) and elevated calcium, all of which are associated with nephrocalcinosis and renal damage in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Schell_x002d_Feith-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schell-Feith 2010</LINK>). Concern about development of metabolic bone disease might lead parents and clinicians to give formula rather than persisting with expressing and giving breast milk when such a decision is considered. For this reason, provision of supplements might influence the likelihood of continued breastfeeding and hence developmental outcomes.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-23 08:47:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this updated review conducted in 2016, we included one trial of 40 infants that compared supplementation with calcium and phosphorus versus no supplementation in hospitalised preterm infants. We found no evidence of a difference between infants supplemented with calcium and phosphorus and those given no supplementation for the primary outcomes of this review of growth and bone metabolism, except for a small decrease in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentrations at six weeks among infants who received calcium and phosphorus supplementation. Review authors considered this decrease unlikely to be of clinical significance. Evidence was based on the findings of a single small trial, which did not report long-term outcomes for childhood and adulthood (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-02-23 04:56:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High-quality evidence is insufficient to reveal whether supplementation with calcium and phosphorus improved growth and bone health of hospitalised preterm infants. In the single trial included in this review, infants were born relatively large (mean gestation 33 weeks) and therefore were at low risk of metabolic bone disease. These findings may not be applicable to smaller and more preterm infants at greater risk of bone disease who may be more likely to benefit from supplements, if such a benefit can occur. Supplementation with calcium and phosphorus alone is no longer common practice. The Cochrane systematic review on multi-component human milk fortification has provided evidence superseding the evidence provided in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2016</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-02-23 04:58:08 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review includes one trial of 40 infants. The evidence is limited by lack of methodological detail and imprecision. We were not able to make judgements about risk of bias. Evidence was based on data from a single small trial including wide confidence intervals associated with the summary treatment effect. Using GRADE criteria (<LINK REF="REF-GradePro-GDT" TYPE="REFERENCE">GradePro GDT</LINK>), we judged the evidence to be of <I>low quality</I>.</P>

<P>We identified no other studies or reviews reporting on comparison of calcium and phosphorus supplementation of human milk for preterm infants versus no fortification. Supplementation with calcium and phosphorus alone is no longer common practice, but calcium and phosphorus are commonly included in multi-component human milk fortifiers that are widely used.

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-02-23 05:05:06 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Supplementation of human milk with minerals, usually as one component of a multi-component fortifier, has become common practice largely on the basis of metabolic studies conducted to evaluate the composition of human milk and the nutritional requirements of preterm infants. Small controlled studies have evaluated urinary excretion of minerals as a proxy for mineral accretion and therefore bone deposition and have provided no evidence of any short-term or long-term clinical benefit derived from mineral supplementation. Despite this, it is unlikely that new studies will evaluate supplementation of human milk with minerals alone versus no mineral supplementation. Assessment of the effect of supplementation of human milk with minerals may best be done in the context of manipulation of multi-component fortifier composition for very and extremely preterm infants at high risk of metabolic bone disease.</P>
